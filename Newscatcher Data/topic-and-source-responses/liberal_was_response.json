            "summary": "NEW YORK — National Public Radio has suspended a veteran editor who wrote an outside essay criticizing his employer for, in his view, journalism that reflects a liberal viewpoint with little tolerance for contrary opinions.\nUri Berliner, a senior editor on NPR's business desk, was suspended five days without pay, according to an article posted Tuesday by NPR's media correspondent, David Folkenflik. He wrote that Berliner was told he violated the company's policy that it must approve work done for outside news organizations.\nBerliner told NPR that he was not appealing the suspension. An NPR spokeswoman said the company would not comment on individual personnel matters.\nHe wrote his essay last week for The Free Press. Berliner wrote that NPR has always had a liberal bent, but for most of his 25-year tenure had an open-minded, curious culture.\nAdvertisement\n'In recent years, however, that has changed,' he wrote. 'Today, those who listen to NPR or read its coverage online find something different: the distilled worldview of a very small segment of the U.S. population.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nHis commentary became an instant hit with outside conservative activists who have made similar criticisms of NPR. He specifically criticized his employer for its coverage of former President Donald Trump, of accusations against the president's son, Hunter Biden, and of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFollowing publication, NPR's top editor, Edith Chapin, said she strongly disagrees with Berliner's conclusions and is proud to stand behind NPR's work.\nOne of his NPR colleagues,'Morning Edition' co-host Steve Inskeep, wrote on Substack Tuesday that Berliner's essay in The Free Press was filled with errors and assumptions.",

            "summary": "JOHANNESBURG — On a recent trip to South Africa, I traveled to Sharpeville, site of the infamous 1960 massacre of 69 Black protesters that became an early catalyst for the anti-apartheid movement. President Cyril Ramaphosa was reminding an audience that the country's fight for full equality remains incomplete.\nI was surprised when Ramaphosa intoned, 'If we are to build a society of equals, a South Africa that belongs to all who live in it, we must end the discrimination and intolerance directed at people because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n'We must resist the efforts of those who want to take us backwards,' he said, 'who express reactionary and hateful views directed at members of the LGBTQI+ community.' His words were met with cheers from the staunchly pro-African National Congress crowd decked out in green and gold T-shirts and hats. He was preaching to the faithful.\nAdvertisement\nBut I couldn't help thinking how his words might have landed 4,000 miles away in Ghana, where just weeks earlier the parliament had passed a harsh bill to impose strict prison terms for anyone identifying as gay or 'promoting' gay rights. Ghana's president has yet to sign the legislation.\nOr in Uganda, which last year passed one of the continent's strictest anti-gay laws — signed by the president and upheld by the courts — imposing life imprisonment for engaging in gay sex and the death penalty for 'aggravated homosexuality.'\nOr in Kenya, where the parliament is considering the 'Family Protection Bill,' which would criminalize homosexuality and same-sex marriage.\nSouth Africa legalized same-sex marriage in 2006 and is regularly listed as one of the most gay-friendly tourist destinations on an otherwise unfriendly continent. The country also carries a certain moral weight in the world, owing to the long liberation struggle against the abhorrent apartheid regime.\nAdvertisement\nBut why does South Africa stay publicly silent as more and more of its African neighbors pass horrific anti-gay laws?\nThis is not the only thing mysterious about South Africa's foreign policy.\nThe United States, Britain and the European Union are major investors in the country and key trading partners. But South Africa seems to have much warmer relations with Russia — an economic lightweight.\nSouth Africa used its moral authority to take Israel before the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice over its war in Gaza, which South African diplomats have said amounts to genocide. But it has issued scarcely any condemnation of Russia's unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine, which has resulted in tens of thousands of casualties on both sides and the bombing of Ukrainian cities.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough it is one of the continent's most stable democracies, South Africa seems most at home in the BRICS group, which includes Russia and China (a growing trade partner) along with democracies India and Brazil. China has made no secret of its ambition to use the BRICS group to challenge what it considers U.S. and Western hegemony in the world.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nWho's side is South Africa on?\nThe answer, as with most things here, is rooted in the country's long anti-apartheid struggle.\nIt was after the Sharpeville massacre that the ANC embraced armed struggle and established its military wing, uMkhonto we Sizwe. That was at the height of the Cold War, and the United States and Britain branded the ANC a pro-communist terrorist organization. (The ANC inexplicably remained on the U.S. terrorism list until April 2008.) The official U.S. policy was 'constructive engagement' with the apartheid regime.\nAdvertisement\nShunned in the West, the ANC found support from the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, Libya under Moammar Gaddafi and the Palestine Liberation Organization.\nThe ANC's leaders include many stalwarts of that liberation fight. The old soldiers recall fighting in the bush in Angola alongside Cuban mercenaries with Russian weapons, against U.S.-backed anti-communist UNITA fighters.\nANC members still keep close ties to Vladimir Putin's United Russia party and the Chinese Communist Party, including by sending ANC members for 'party-to-party diplomacy' and fully funded training sessions to Russia and China.\nThe ANC also received support from other African countries as South Africa became the continent's last stand against White colonial rule. And after liberation, with the first all-race democratic election in 1994, its leaders were loath to openly criticize African neighbors — even close ones like Zimbabwe, then ruled by the corrupt dictator Robert Mugabe.\nAdvertisement\nSouth Africa does not want to be seen as the continent's 'Big Brother,' hectoring over human rights. It tried that in 1994, when President Nelson Mandela privately implored Nigeria's military dictator Sani Abacha to spare the life of Niger Delta environmental campaigner Ken Saro-Wiwa. Mandela was humiliated when Saro-Wiwa was executed in 1995 on the opening day of a Commonwealth meeting in New Zealand. When attempts to have Nigeria sanctioned by the African Union left South Africa isolated, it largely retreated as the continent's voice of moral authority.\nSouth Africa needs the West for investment and trade. But the ANC remembers the liberation movement's oldest friends. The resulting tensions are what make South Africa's foreign policy seem at times inexplicable. As the world becomes more polarized between democracies and authoritarian regimes, the tensions may also become harder to sustain. 'I feel that South Africa's foreign policy is incompatible with its internal democracy,' said Branko Brkic, editor of the Daily Maverick newspaper.\nSome foreign policy analysts I spoke with said South Africa also suffers from a communication problem: Its diplomats do not always adequately explain the rationale behind their policies or consider how certain actions will be perceived — as with trying to stay nonaligned on the Ukraine war. 'It opens itself up to criticism,' said Philani Mthembu, executive director at the Institute for Global Dialogue, a think tank. 'South Africa needs to improve how it anticipates its partners will react.'",

            "excerpt": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has acknowledged that a law he enacted two years ago making it easier for people to challenge books in schools and libraries has caused problems for school districts",
            "summary": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Two years ago, Democrats repeatedly and forcefully warned Republicans and Gov. Ron DeSantis that a new law making it easier to challenge school books was so broadly worded that it would create havoc across the state.\nNow they can say, 'I told you so.'\nDeSantis backtracked on the 2022 law on Tuesday when he signed a bill narrowing its focus. He blamed liberal activists for abusing the law, not the citizens whose objections to certain books account for the majority of book removals from school libraries and classrooms.\n'The idea that someone can use the parents rights and the curriculum transparency to start objecting to every single book to try to make a mockery of this is just wrong,' DeSantis said the day before the bill signing. 'That's performative. That's political.'\nCoincidentally, PEN America, a group that fights book bans, issued a report Tuesday saying Florida is responsible for 72% of the books that have been pulled from the nation's schools in the first half of the current school year.\nAdvertisement\nThe organization said liberal activists are not the ones who should be blamed for abusing the law.\n'The majority of books that we see being removed are books that talk about LBTQ+ identities, that include characters of color, that talk about race and racism, that include depictions of sexual experiences in the most broadest interpretation of that understanding,' said Kasey Meehan, Pen America's Freedom to Read program director.\nThose challenges are being made by conservative individuals and groups such as Moms For Liberty, Meehan said.\nThe original law allowed any person — parent or not, district resident or not — to challenge books as often as they wanted. Once challenged, a book has to be pulled from shelves until the school district resolves the complaint. The new law limits people who don't have students in a school district to one challenge per month.\nAdvertisement\nThe PEN America report says Florida is responsible for 3,135 of the 4,349 school book bans in the United States so far this school year. Just this week in conservative Clay County, one person challenged 40 books, Meehan said.\nBefore dropping out of the Republican presidential primary, DeSantis campaigned heavily on his education platform, including the law giving people more power to challenge books.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'It's just a big mess that DeSantis created and now he's trying to disown it, but I don't know if he'll be able to distance himself from this because he campaigned on it so hard,' said House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell.\nIt's not the only example of the tough-talking governor having to make adjustments to ideology he championed while seeking the White House.\nHe also has made concessions in the settlement of several lawsuits involving the state and Walt Disney World. The dispute between them erupted in 2022 after the company spoke out against a DeSantis-backed law that opponents dubbed 'Don't Say Gay.' The law bans classroom lessons on gender identity and sexual orientation.\nAdvertisement\nThe Associated Press asked DeSantis' office for examples of liberal activists abusing the law and it provided one: Chaz Stevens, a South Florida resident who has often lampooned government. Stevens raised challenges in dozens of school districts over the Bible, dictionaries and thesauruses.\nThe change to the law 'ensures that book challenges are limited for individuals, like Chaz, who do not have children with access to the school district's materials,' DeSantis spokeswoman Julia Friedland said in an email. She didn't reply to follow-up emails requesting more examples.\nStevens, who 11 years ago made national news when he installed a Festivus pole made out of beer cans across from a nativity scene displayed in the Capitol, was delighted DeSantis' office singled him out.\n'When they need to make stupid stupider, they send me up. I'm part comedian, I'm part activist, I'm part artist. I just want a better society,' Stevens said. 'I'm an idiot, but a smart guy at the same time.'\nAdvertisement\nWhile DeSantis' predecessor, current Republican Sen. Rick Scott, allowed what was then called the 'free speech zone' in the Capitol rotunda, the rules changed under DeSantis and new barriers were put in place to use Capitol space for political expression. The League of Women Voters and Stevens are among the applicants who have been denied access under the new rules.\n'I didn't realize that I have the power of millions!' Stevens said. 'I'm just one guy. I'm an agitator. I know my role in this.'\nDriskell pointed out that DeSantis was warned there would be problems when the book ban law passed in 2022.",

            "summary": "Nicholas F. Jacobs is an assistant professor of government at Colby College, where Daniel M. Shea is a professor of government. They are the authors of ' The Rural Voter .' This op-ed was adapted from an article in UnHerd .\nNicholas F. Jacobs is an assistant professor of government at Colby College, where Daniel M. Shea is a professor of government. They are the authors of 'The Rural Voter.' This op-ed was adapted from an article in UnHerd.\nA good American progressive is meant to disapprove of disparaging political stereotypes. But that hasn't stopped them gleefully embracing the caricature of the enraged rural American. You know the tropes; they're the last ones you can utter in respectable conversation: 'white trash,' 'redneck,' 'hillbilly,' all them ignorant belligerents in stark raving anger ready to storm the Capitol.\nAcademic Thomas Schaller, co-author of 'White Rural Rage: The Threat to American Democracy,' recently stoked this prejudice on MSNBC: Rural voters 'are the most racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-gay geo-demographic group in the country. … They are the most likely to excuse or justify violence as an acceptable alternative to peaceful public discourse.' The book was soon trending on X.\nAdvertisement\nAs two scholars of rural politics, who have spent the past three years poring over thousands of survey interviews with rural Americans, this caricature of the rural rabble-rouser is deeply puzzling. Instead of threats to democracy, or rebellious politics, or reflexive anger, we keep finding something different: pride in rural living, a sense of communal belonging, a shared fate that intertwines the economic well-being of rich and poor in rural communities. Yes, there are resentments, especially toward government officials and experts. But resentment is not a stereotype. It's a motivation, a story.\nStill, rageful stereotypes sell better than complex backstories. And they're easier for our political and media ecosystems to make sense of. Reference some data point about QAnon conspiracies in the heartlands, and you'll raise more money from nervous liberals in the city (who just so happen to live next to three times as many QAnon conspiracy believers). Lash out against the xenophobia in small towns, and you'll mobilize your city voters to the polls. Rage draws clicks. It makes a splash. Yes, racism and hostility toward these groups exists in the countryside, as it does throughout the United States. And we are deeply troubled by the enduring role it plays in U.S. politics. But it is a national problem, not one to which White rural Americans uniquely contribute.\nWhat we do see in rural America are a unique set of resentments or grievances that arise from real and perceived slights against rural communities. These include economic policies that have devastated local industries, a lack of investment in rural infrastructure and education, and a sense of cultural dismissal from urban-centric media and politics.\nAdvertisement\nSuch failures help to explain the deep-rooted skepticism in many rural areas toward government policy solutions. Just consider the aftermath of the North American Free Trade Agreement, implemented in 1994. NAFTA's champions, including both Democrats and Republicans, promised that the deal would bring prosperity to small farmers, but between 1998 and 2018, 1 out of every 10 small U.S. farms disappeared. Not long after the trade barriers were removed, Canadian cattle ranchers flooded the U.S. market with beef and prices plummeted, forcing small farms out of business. Meanwhile, large-scale agribusinesses capitalized on the open borders. If government neglect drove your grandpa off his farm back then, why would you trust it now?\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIf one is interested in building political coalitions that include rural voters, and which may lead to more inclusive and equitable policymaking, it is these resentments that must be understood. The stereotype of the raging rural American misrepresents the complexities of the rural experience. It is why Hollywood fell for Sen. J.D. Vance's (R-Ohio) story of Appalachian poverty, while failing to recognize that he was running a political campaign that spoke to the resilience, values and pride of rural residents. And it is why most progressives don't have much empathy left for rural voters — despite feeling deeply for nearly every other marginalized group in American society.\nIn some circles, this lack of empathy stems from the fact that these so-called deplorables are blamed for having brought Donald Trump to power. As Paul Waldman, the second co-author of 'White Rural Rage,' said: 'If Donald Trump gets back to the Oval Office, it will be because — once again — rural Whites put him there.'\nAdvertisement\nBut rural America is not responsible for Trump. If simply voting for Trump makes you 'enraged,' then the residents of cities and suburbs, from which Trump derived 80 percent of his total votes in 2020, are downright furious. Pinning Trump's gains on decades of rural America's losses is just another form of confirmation bias — reinforcing existing beliefs without critical examination. Rarely do you hear mentions of figures such as Bill Clinton, who championed NAFTA, or Hillary Clinton, who seemed to openly celebrate the fact that she lost the places that were economically suffering the most.\nWith stereotypes of rage come stereotypes of irrationality. But rural folk have good reason to partly blame Democrats, experts and college professors for their misfortunes. They know full well that federal agriculture and trade policies pushed by both Democrats and Republicans did destroy rural economies. And that liberal elites stood by as rural students became one of the least likely groups to attend college, and one of the most likely to drop out. Surely, the drive for diversity and inclusion should include rural kids, too?\ndid destroy rural economies. And that liberal elites stood by as rural students became one of the least likely groups to attend college, and one of the most likely to drop out. Surely, the drive for diversity and inclusion should include rural kids, too?\nWe've also noticed that city dwellers tend use stereotypes as a crutch to disguise the fact that they know very little about how different people live their lives. Both rural and urban people see the 'other' as having different values. Many of these differences are overblown, but some of them are, undoubtedly, true. We see it in our own lives: As college professors who choose to live in the countryside, we hear colleagues playfully say we've 'gone native,' and our neighbors think we're squirrelly. We love both worlds and the people within them, even when they value different things. But stereotypes, generalizations, tropes and unchecked hyperbole foreclose the possibility of closing this divide.\nAdvertisement",

            "excerpt": "After 30 years of unchecked power, Africa's most storied liberation movement might lose its parliamentary majority.",
            "summary": "The African National Congress bears most of the blame. South Africa's ruling party for the past 30 years, since the country's first all-race elections, the ANC was once unassailable as the party of the country's first Black president, Nelson Mandela, and the vanguard of the liberation movement that ended the abhorrent apartheid regime.\nAdvertisement\nBut after three decades of unchallenged power, the ANC has become ossified, unresponsive, and tainted by corruption and failure to deliver basic services. Kickbacks for state contracts have become rampant, especially during the disastrous administration of Jacob Zuma, who faced multiple indictments and allegations of corrupt dealings and who was briefly imprisoned before being questionably paroled. Last month, the powerful speaker of the national assembly and ANC member, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, was accused by prosecutors of taking $135,000 in bribes when she served as defense minister. She resigned Wednesday.\nNow many young South Africans appear to be turning against the ANC. National elections are due May 29, and most signs and surveys suggest the ANC might for the first time lose its absolute majority in parliament. That would be a good thing.\nWhat happens after the election will be a crucial test for the country's young democracy and will have implications across the continent for other struggling democracies. South Africa has no experience with coalition government. How the various parties navigate the uncertainty — and even if the ANC would accept a loss of its complete control — point to a fraught post-election period.\nAdvertisement\nTo be sure, the ANC is still a massive voter turnout machine that commands loyalty among the older generation. It's leaders, including President Cyril Ramaphosa, like to remind voters that many of the country's problems stem from the inequalities of the repugnant apartheid regime. But among younger voters, that message falls short.\nFollow this author Editorial Board 's opinions\nFollow this author\nEditorial Board\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nIf the ANC lands just a few seats shy of a majority, it could assemble a coalition with independents and tiny parties. But if its losses are bigger — and some projections put its support as low as 40 percent — then the ANC will need to join forces with one of the larger established parties to maintain its hold on government. . Which way the ANC turns will determine its economic direction as well as its future foreign policy, including relations with the United States.\nThe current main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, is expected to come in second. An ANC-DA alliance would likely ensure a centrist liberal economic policy scaling back the heavy state role in the economy. The DA has also been more critical of Russia's invasion of Ukraine than the ANC, which has adopted a neutral position. The DA runs the provincial government in Western Cape, considered in public opinion surveys to be South Africa's best-run province. But the Democratic Alliance suffers from the stigma of being seen as the party favored by the country's White minority.\nAdvertisement\nAnother party poised to do well is an ANC offshoot, the Economic Freedom Fighters, which advocates a blend of Marxist economic policies and land confiscation. It's fiery, charismatic leader, Julius Malema, is also given to harsh, violence-tinged rhetoric. An ANC alliance with the EFF would mean a sharp turn to a far-left, socialist and anti-Western agenda.\nThe wild card is Mr. Zuma, who has formed a new party, uMkhonto weSizwe, which is expected to peel away votes from the ANC in Mr. Zuma's native KwaZulu-Natal province. Mr. Zuma retains a significant base. His supporters have also shown a penchant for violence, as in 2021 when Zuma supporters rioted against his arrest. There are fears of a repeat of violence if his new party fares poorly.",

            "summary": "History may be written by the victors, but Neil J. Young's excellent new book, 'Coming Out Republican,' is a sympathetic look at one of the past century's losers: the gay conservative. Young, a historian by training, has spent his career explaining the heterogeneity of the conservative movement. His first book, 'We Gather Together,' was about the alliances and rivalries among Catholics, Mormons and evangelicals that birthed the Christian right, and Young has written about religion and politics for the New York Times and CNN.\n'Coming Out Republican' moves from the 1950s to the present, telling the stories of the closeted operators and buttoned-up political clubs that often served as the Myrtle Wilson to the Christian right's Daisy Buchanan, their sense of entitlement out of proportion to the way their supposed allies treated them. Sometimes these gay men acted gallantly to expand the individual freedoms of their queer countrymen. But there are also many instances in the book of them selling out the other civil rights movements in whose wake they traveled. 'Coming Out Republican' is less about an interest group than a self-interest group, one that has long been unable to envision a liberation project more ambitious than expanding the sexual prerogatives of White men.\nmoves from the 1950s to the present, telling the stories of the closeted operators and buttoned-up political clubs that often served as the Myrtle Wilson to the Christian right's Daisy Buchanan, their sense of entitlement out of proportion to the way their supposed allies treated them. Sometimes these gay men acted gallantly to expand the individual freedoms of their queer countrymen. But there are also many instances in the book of them selling out the other civil rights movements in whose wake they traveled. 'Coming Out Republican' is less about an interest group than a self-interest group, one that has long been unable to envision a liberation project more ambitious than expanding the sexual prerogatives of White men.\n'Coming Out Republican' is at its best when using profiles of individual men to depict the eras in which they lived. Leonard Matlovich, a Vietnam War hero, came out in 1975 and sued the federal government to reenlist after he was kicked out of the military. Conservative and macho, Matlovich claimed that 'everything I am and everything I hope to be I owe to the United States Air Force.' He relied on Frank Kameny, of the gay advocacy group the Mattachine Society, and a lawyer from the ACLU to sue on his behalf. Appearing on the cover of Time magazine, he had a dark mustache from central casting, but he was an imperfect poster boy, all-American but naive about gay life. He once bashfully asked a reporter from the Advocate — an eminent gay magazine — what the publication was.\nAdvertisement\nIn his study of Matlovich, Young deftly, if a little dryly, parses the cross currents of imperialism, respectability and internecine gay resentment. His prose is at times as vanilla as the men he writes about, relying on ventriloquism of vulgar gay patois for color. In other illuminating sketches, we meet figures such as Jon Hinson, the Bible-thumping congressman from Mississippi who resigned after getting caught performing oral sex on a Black Library of Congress technician in a bathroom in the Capitol, and Terry Dolan, Ronald Reagan's whiz kid pollster who bragged about purging moderates from Congress, bulldozing a path for the Christian right's ascension in the 1980s. They are but two of the legions of closeted Republicans who believed in privacy for a man's sex life but not, among other things, a woman's right to an abortion. Young takes so much care describing the different ways Matlovich, Hinson and Dolan conceived of themselves, and the roles they played in the politics of their era, that their deaths feel like a gut-punch. Each one died of AIDS.\nLess successful are Young's sections on gay Republican groups — the Log Cabin Republicans, the Teddy Roosevelt Republican Club, the Lincoln Republican Club, Concerned Republicans for Individual Rights, GOProud — whose sheer number of names reflects how often they split off from one another. Most of the book's colorful characters were better at acting out and working covertly than they were at building large coalitions, so the stakes of their collective action — like persuading a few thousand San Francisco Republicans to oppose a California ballot initiative — feel low.\nYoung also has the credulous habit of, for example, describing a group whose membership 'doubled that year to over 150' and citing the growth as evidence of its strength, when such crowds would barely match a modest gay bar's Saturday night or a Baptist church's Sunday services. In instances when gay Republican groups have wielded influence in a decisive way — say, by whipping up a handful of votes to pass civil rights protections in the California legislature and marriage equality in the New York legislature — it is not because they had power that could not be ignored. It is because in the eyes of Republican lawmakers in very liberal states, gay Republicans could, like a mistress that doesn't ask or expect too much, be indulged from time to time.\nBut that's state politics. At the national level, gay Republicans have been betrayed and insulted by every Republican presidential candidate since Reagan. In 1980, they had reasons for optimism. Despite Reagan's conservative bona fides, two years earlier he helped defeat a California referendum that would have barred gay people from teaching in public schools. But as president, his embrace of the religious right was so close, and his administration's antipathy for people with AIDS so pronounced, that it further stained the Republican Party's reputation with gay people. George H.W. Bush ran as a moderate and even signed gay-friendly legislation like the Ryan White Care Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act before abandoning tolerance to court the religious right. Less than a decade after he left office, his son campaigned as a compassionate conservative, and then ran for reelection supporting a constitutional amendment to forbid same-sex marriage. Donald Trump also seemed to embrace LGBTQ people as he campaigned for the 2016 election, but as president he nominated judges hostile to LGBTQ rights and supported policies that made it easier for people claiming religious exemptions to discriminate against sexual minorities.\nAdvertisement\nYoung makes a persuasive case that gay Republicans contributed to the civil rights progress of the last few decades. Intellectuals like Andrew Sullivan and operators like Ken Mehlman, who ran George W. Bush's 2004 campaign from the closet, contributed to the push for marriage equality and military participation. But neither man — or really any conservative advocate — did nearly as much as Evan Wolfson, the Lambda Legal lawyer, who articulated the intellectual foundations of same-sex marriage and executed the political strategy to make it a reality. The simple fact is that liberal gays have been more clear-eyed about power than their conservative counterparts, better at building coalitions and more wary of placating the Christian conservatives who do not believe there is a place for sexual minorities in public life.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nYoung could have more forcefully thought through the reluctance of gay Republicans to find common cause with members of other minority groups. The obvious answer is the most uncomfortable one: Gay Republicans see themselves as having more in common with other White people, rich people and men. Unfortunately, the only way that the numerically few can wield power is through solidarity with other minorities, but that requires insight that does not always come easily to White gay men, especially conservative White gay men: None of us is that special, and trying to be 'not that kind of gay' comes at a cost. One of the most heartbreaking themes of 'Coming Out Republican' is how unfamiliar many conservative gays are with the varying joys of gay life — writing it off as too 'PC' or too promiscuous. Being gay can be quite fun, not despite but because of our endless squabbles and struggles over how to keep this life distinct and ours, and open to as many people as want to partake.\nAnyone could benefit from reading this book. Straight people will learn how the puritanical impulse to control other people's ' sex lives has defined politics for nearly a century, an impulse as old as it is futile. Queer people — who often must teach ourselves our own history — will learn how respectability remains an empty promise. But it is gay Republicans themselves who most need to read Young's book. If they are not too vain, the Peter Thiels and George Santoses of the world might find in these pages a warning that having power is not the same thing as being tolerated until you are no longer useful.\nNathan Kohrman is a writer covering medicine, politics and culture.

Mike Wilson said he hopes lawmakers use the coming months to craft another version of DEI legislation for the 30-day session in 2025.\n'It'll be something that we'll work on in the interim and hopefully come to some sort of agreement with the House,' Wilson said Tuesday during a news conference featuring Senate Republican leaders.\nDebates around DEI efforts on college campuses have played out in statehouses across the country this year. Republicans in at least 20 states have sought to limit such initiatives, claiming they are discriminatory and enforce a liberal orthodoxy. Alabama and Utah enacted anti-DEI laws this year, and a ban enacted in Texas last year has led to more than 100 job cuts on University of Texas campuses.\nAdvertisement\nIn Kentucky, the issue generated contentious debates when the Senate and House passed different versions of anti-DEI bills. Opponents warned that proposed restrictions on campuses could roll back gains in minority enrollments and stifle campus discussions about past discrimination.\nState Sen. Gerald Neal, the top-ranking Democrat, said Tuesday that anti-DEI efforts were 'a shameless attempt to reverse the progress that our commonwealth has made.'\nWilson, who is the Senate majority whip, sponsored the bill passed by chamber Republicans in February. It would have prohibited 'discriminatory concepts' in non-classroom settings, such as training sessions and orientations, and would have barred schools from providing preferential treatment based on a person's political ideology. It also would have prohibited requiring people to state specific ideologies or beliefs when seeking admission, employment or promotions.\nAdvertisement\nAbout a month later, the House stripped away the Senate's language and inserted a replacement that took a tougher stance by also defunding DEI offices and officer positions. Wilson's original bill didn't call for dismantling those offices.\nSenate Republicans had concerns about portions of the House version, Wilson said Tuesday without offering specifics. Both versions died when the legislative session ended Monday night.\nDemocratic Gov. Andy Beshear denounced anti-DEI efforts last month while commemorating the 60th anniversary of a landmark civil-rights rally in Frankfort, the state's capital city.\n'DEI is not a four-letter word,' Beshear said. 'DEI is a three-letter acronym for very important values that are found in our Bible. Diversity, equity and inclusion is about loving each other. It's about living out the Golden Rule. ... Diversity will always make us stronger. It is an asset and never a liability.'\nAdvertisement\nWith supermajorities in both chambers, Republicans can easily override the governor's vetoes.\nNeal, who is Black, said Tuesday that supporters of the anti-DEI bills want to 'suppress that part of history that makes them feel uncomfortable' instead of acknowledging and learning from the past.\nDuring the Senate debate in February, Wilson said his bill would counter what he called a broader trend in higher education toward denying campus jobs or promotions to faculty refusing to espouse 'liberal ideologies fashionable in our public universities.' He said such practices extended to students and staff.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'Diversity of thought should be welcomed in our universities and higher education,' Wilson said. 'But we've seen a trend across the United States of forcing faculty, in order to remain employed, to formally endorse a set of beliefs that may be contrary to their own, all in violation of the First Amendment.'\nAdvertisement\nLooking ahead to renewed work on the issue, Wilson said Tuesday that there were portions of the House bill that GOP senators 'thought we could live with,' without offering details.\nRepublican Senate Majority Floor Leader Damon Thayer predicted Tuesday that GOP senators will reach out to House Republicans to try to strike an agreement on DEI legislation that he hopes lawmakers could take up early in next year's session. Thayer is retiring from the Senate at the end of 2024.",

The challenge this year, a wartime Passover, will be how to celebrate it together.\nAt every Passover Seder, we ask, 'Why is this night different from all other nights?' This year, we must also confront the question, 'Why is this Seder different from all other Seders?' and the inescapable reality that among our multitude there are different and clashing answers about Israel and Gaza.\nAt Thanksgiving, my family sidestepped our divisions by declaring the table an Israel-free zone. But that won't work for Passover. The exodus of the Jews from Egypt and their arrival in Israel is the story. The concluding words of the Seder make the point, ' L'shanah haba'ah b'Yerushalayim. Next year in Jerusalem.'\nis the story. The concluding words of the Seder make the point, 'L'shanah haba'ah b'Yerushalayim. Next year in Jerusalem.'\nAdvertisement\nBut that leaves the matter of what to do about this year. Even as we give thanks for the liberation of the Jews from Egypt, we must keep in mind that 1,200 were slaughtered on Oct. 7 and that others, who knows how many are still alive, are being held hostage in Gaza. There are too many Seder tables with empty chairs. Giving thanks for liberation has to make way for mourning those who are gone forever and for keeping top of mind those who may still be brought back.\nThere is a frankly uncomfortable part of the Passover Haggadah. 'For not only one enemy has risen up to destroy us,' this passage reads, 'but in every generation do enemies rise up against us, seeking to destroy us.' In ordinary years, at least for me, this has carried with it an anachronistic air of Jewish paranoia. This year, not so much.\nAmerican Jews have to grapple with two simultaneous truths. In Israel, Hamas is seeking to destroy us. And yes, destroy us as Jews, not simply Israel. Just read their charter. The continued existence of Israel as a Jewish state feels more tenuous than at any time in my life.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, in the United States, there is the parallel fact of rising antisemitism. Jewish Americans of my generation once thought our parents were alarmist and out of touch with modernity when they emphasized this passage. But were they? The Anti-Defamation League reports a 140 percent increase in antisemitic incidents in 2023, the highest level on record and more than the previous three years combined.\nFollow this author Ruth Marcus 's opinions\nFollow this author\nRuth Marcus\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nAgain, this is linked to anti-Israel sentiment but ventures beyond opposition to Zionism to antisemitism pure and simple — 'Kill the Jews' graffiti and Jewish students being spat on. Much as we would prefer to believe otherwise, it is now happening here.\nStill, and here we get to the clashing answers part, this year we must also acknowledge: There are too many dead civilians in Gaza, too many dead or injured children, too many Gazans suffering from homelessness and hunger. To be true to our ethical compass as Jews, we are also called upon to keep in mind their suffering — and to temper our celebration accordingly.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael was brutally invaded on Oct. 7; it had the right and the duty to defend itself. Had Hamas not attacked, none of these terrible consequences would have ensued. Had Hamas not embedded itself within, and underneath, the civilian population, many of these deaths would not have occurred; Hamas is the only combatant in the history of urban warfare whose strategy is to maximize the deaths of its own people.\nBut to say that does not go far enough to recognize Israel's responsibility, in particular for its failure to facilitate the delivery of food and other humanitarian aid to the civilian population. I understand how difficult it is for Israelis to support providing this help while the hostages suffer, especially because of the real risk of supplies being diverted to Hamas. And yet, this resistance feels fundamentally un-Jewish.\nThe Haggadah, as it happens, suggests a better way. It opens with the words, 'Let all who are hungry, come and eat; all who are needy, come and celebrate the Passover with us.' All, not only Jews.\nAdvertisement\nGod, we are told, visited 10 plagues on the Egyptians, from turning waters of the Nile into blood to the slaying of the firstborn. At the Seder, we dip a finger into the second cup of wine to symbolically spill a drop of blood as we recite each one to reflect that our happiness cannot be complete. The Egyptians, also God's children, suffered as well when the pharaoh hardened his heart. Hamas, perhaps, exists in every generation.",

The minutes were first reported by the blog Real Rasslin' on Tuesday.\nAll of this was over a Dec. 20 match in Oklahoma City that lasted 120 seconds bell to bell between Rose and Alejandra Lion.

            "summary": "Former president Donald Trump's struggle to find a position on abortion that appeases religious activists in his party without offending more moderate and secular voters is perhaps the clearest example of one of the most important tensions in American politics today: Religion is declining in America overall but in some ways becoming an even more important force within the Republican Party . We have less religion but still very religiously influenced politics.\nwithin the Republican Party. We have less religion but still very religiously influenced politics.\nYou've no doubt read articles over the past two decades about the declining numbers of Christian Americans and the growing contingent who have no religious affiliation. And that's not just a story of Democrats and liberals leaving faith. The number of Republicans who attend church weekly and consider religion a core part of their lives is also shrinking.\nYet many policies enacted by local, state and federal Republican elected officials and conservative judges are straight from the religious right's agenda: vouchers and other initiatives to make it easier for parents to send their children to religious schools; limits on reproductive rights that ban abortion and could even threaten in vitro fertilization; restrictions on gay and particularly transgender Americans; provisions allowing religious Americans to cite their faith in declining to participate in various activities, such as getting vaccinated.\nAdvertisement\nLouisiana's House of Representatives last week passed a bill requiring the state's public schools and universities to display the Ten Commandments. Trump is promising to create a federal task force to root out what he describes as 'anti-Christian bias' in America. Some Republican operatives likely to play major roles in a second Trump term have openly stated that they believe government policies should be shaped in accordance with Christianity.\nFollow this author Perry Bacon Jr. 's opinions\nFollow this author\nPerry Bacon Jr.\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nHow are these trends — a secularizing America, a party increasingly tied to its religious wing — happening at once? In some ways, they are causal. Many Americans on the political left and center say they stopped identifying themselves as Christians in part because of the faith's vocal conservative bloc, particularly its anti-LGBTQ+ agenda. On the flip side, Robert P. Jones, founder of the Public Religion Research Institute (now known as PRRI), argues White Christians have become more radical in their policy goals and more deeply embedded in the Republican Party because of their alarm at how quickly America is becoming more racially diverse and secular.\nBut with a growing number of Republicans saying they aren't Christian or religious, another explanation is important: internal party politics. Polls suggest there are many Republican voters who would prefer a GOP that wasn't trying to make abortions impossible and ban books written by LGBTQ+ authors from public schools and libraries.\nRepublicans saying they aren't Christian or religious, another explanation is important: internal party politics. Polls suggest there are many Republican voters who would prefer a GOP that wasn't trying to make abortions impossible and ban books written by LGBTQ+ authors from public schools and libraries.\nAdvertisement\nBut those Republicans aren't organized into well-funded activist groups working at the local, state and federal levels. And the portion of the party wary of the religious right overwhelmingly falls in line and backs GOP candidates in general elections, even if those candidates have adopted the religious right's agenda.\nIn contrast, the party's religious bloc defends its priorities fiercely — and in moral terms. Groups such as the Family Research Council and the Alliance Defending Freedom are constantly pushing bills in state legislatures and filing lawsuits. They are creative and relentless in exploring methods to execute their agenda, such as their effort to get a future Republican president to invoke a once-obscure law from 1873 (the Comstock Act) to limit abortion.\nThose on the religious right argue that abortion, same-sex marriage, people changing their gender identities and other actions condoned by liberals are violations of core religious tenets. So they aren't willing to set aside those views just because they poll badly. It's hard for nonreligious Republicans to win intraparty arguments when the religious bloc is speaking with such passion.\nAdvertisement\nSo while America and even the Republican electorate is significantly less religious than in Ronald Reagan's or George W. Bush's heyday, the GOP is still dominated by the same two groups that have controlled it for decades: wealthy individuals and businesses who donate millions to conservative organizations and Republican campaigns because they want to keep taxes low and regulations limited; and religious groups that want to keep American culture conservative.\nOf course, the religious right has changed over time. Though the term 'evangelical' once described religious conservatives of prior eras, it was more precisely a movement led by White, male Southern Baptist leaders and activists. Today's religious right has a bigger role for Catholics, women and people of color, as well as Protestants who aren't Southern Baptists, including Pentecostals and those from America's growing ranks of nondenominational churches. (This is why I use the term 'religious right' rather than, say, 'Christian nationalists' or 'evangelicals.' There are many Christians who argue that the religious right's stances are a perversion of the faith. The exact meanings of 'Christian nationalism' and 'evangelicalism' are contested, but everyone agrees there is a bloc on the right that claims to be acting out of religious beliefs.)\nNevertheless, winning Republican primaries still requires courting both the party's business and religious wings. The former provides money for a campaign; the other voters and local organizers.\nAdvertisement\nThese two groups have an informal détente. Wealthy conservatives who are more interested in keeping taxes low don't trash the party's religious conservatives for being focused on abortion and school vouchers. And the religious conservatives go along with tax cuts for the wealthy.\nTrump is beholden to religious conservatives, too. The business wing of the party tried to break with him after the 2020 election and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, spending much of the past three years trying to elevate other potential Republican presidential nominees, particularly Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. But Trump's strong support among religious voters helped him easily win the Republican primaries this year.\nFor the general election, Trump's attempts to distance himself from recent antiabortion rulings from conservative judges in Arizona and Florida show he understands the problem: The religious right's agenda might be unacceptable to the rest of the country.\nAdvertisement",

            "summary": "JERUSALEM — Every year, Alon Gat's mother led the family's Passover celebration of the liberation of the ancient Israelites from Egypt thousands of years ago. But this year, Gat is struggling with how to reconcile a holiday commemorating freedom after his mother was slain and other family members abducted when Hamas attacked Israel.\nGat's sister, Carmel, and wife, Yarden Roman-Gat, were taken hostage in the Oct. 7 attack. His wife was freed in November but his sister remains captive.\n'We can't celebrate our freedom because we don't have this freedom. Our brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers are still in captivity and we need to release them,' Gat said.\nOn Monday, Jews around the world will begin celebrating the weeklong Passover holiday, recounting the biblical story of their exodus from Egypt after hundreds of years of slavery. But for many Israelis, it's hard to fathom a celebration of freedom when friends and family are not free.\nAdvertisement\nThe Hamas attack killed some 1,200 people, while about 250 others were taken hostage. About half were released in a weeklong cease-fire in November, while the rest remain in Gaza, more than 30 of them believed to be dead.\nFor many Jews, Passover is a time to reunite with family and recount the exodus from Egypt at a meal known as the Seder. Observant Jews avoid grains, known as chametz, a reminder of the unleavened bread the Israelites ate when they fled Egypt quickly with no time for dough to rise.\nBut this year many families are torn about how — or even if — to celebrate.\nWhen Hamas attacked Kibbutz Be'eri, Gat, his wife, 3-year-old daughter, parents and sister hid for hours in their rocket-proof safe room. But fighters entered the house and killed or abducted everyone inside, except for his father who hid in the bathroom. His mother was dragged into the street and shot.\nAdvertisement\nGat, his arms and legs bound, was shoved into a car with his wife and daughter. During a brief stop, they managed to flee. Knowing he could run faster, Roman-Gat handed him their daughter. Gat escaped with her, hiding in a ditch for nearly nine hours. His wife was recaptured and held in Gaza for 54 days.\nPassover this year will be more profound as freedom has taken on a new meaning, Roman-Gat told The Associated Press.\n'To feel wind upon your face with your eyes closed. To shower. To go to the toilet without permission, and with the total privacy and privilege to take as long as I please with no one urging me, waiting for me at the other side to make sure I'm still theirs,' she said in a text message.\nStill, Passover will be overshadowed by deep sorrow and worry for her sister-in-law and the other hostages, she said. The family will mark the holiday with a low-key dinner in a restaurant, without celebration.\nAdvertisement\nAs hard as it is in times of pain, Jews have always sought to observe holidays during persecution, such as in concentration camps during the Holocaust, said Rabbi Martin Lockshin, professor emeritus at Canada's York University, who lives in Jerusalem.\n'They couldn't celebrate freedom but they could celebrate the hope of freedom,' he said.\nThe crisis affects more than the hostage families. The war, in which 260 soldiers have been killed, casts a shadow over a normally joyous holiday. The government has also scaled back festivities for Independence Day in May in light of the mood and fearing public protests.\nLikewise, the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, capped by the three-day Eid al-Fitr feast, was a sad, low-key affair for Palestinians. Over 80% of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced by the fighting, and Hamas health officials say nearly 34,000 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive.\nAdvertisement\nThe scenes of suffering, devastation and hunger in Gaza have received little attention in Israel, where much of the public and national media remain heavily focused on the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack and ongoing war.\nAfter several months of fits and starts, negotiations on a deal to release the remaining hostages appears at a standstill — making it unlikely they will be home for Passover.\nThe hostages' pain has reverberated around the world, with some in the Jewish diaspora asking rabbis for prayers specifically for the hostages and Israel to be said at this year's Seder. Others have created a new Haggadah, the book read during the Seder, to reflect the current reality.\nNoam Zion, the author of the new Haggadah, has donated 6,000 copies to families impacted by the war.\n'The Seder is supposed to help us to relive past slavery and liberation from Egypt and to learn its lessons, but in 2024 it must also ask contemporary questions about the confusing and traumatic present and most important, generate hope for the future,' said Zion, emeritus member of the faculty of Jewish studies at the Hartman Institute in Jerusalem.\nAdvertisement\nThe revised Haggadah includes excerpts from hostage families urging people not to hate despite their pain. It offers a guide for navigating the mixed feelings during the holiday, while posing existential questions about the Jews and the state of Israel.\nSome families say it's too painful to celebrate at all.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe girlfriend of Nirit Lavie Alon's son was abducted from the Nova music festival. Two months later the family was informed by Israel's military that Inbar Haiman, a 27-year-old graffiti artist, was dead, her body still in Gaza.\n'It's impossible to celebrate a freedom holiday,' said Alon. Instead of being with family this year, she's going to spend a few days in the desert. There will be no closure until all of the hostages are back, including the remains of those who were killed, she said.\nAdvertisement\nAhead of Passover, some families are still holding out hope their relatives will be freed in time.\nShlomi Berger's 19-year-old daughter, Agam, was abducted two days after the start of her army service along the border with Gaza.\nVideos of her bloodied face emerged shortly after the Hamas attack, one showing an armed man pushing her into a truck, another showing her inside the vehicle with other hostages. The only proof of life he's had since was a call from a released hostage, wishing him happy birthday from Agam, who she'd been with in the tunnels, he said.\nStill, he refuses to give up hope.",

            "excerpt": "A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 45% of U.S. adults say they have become more concerned about climate change over the past year",
            "summary": "Like many Americans, Ron Theusch is getting more worried about climate change.\nA resident of Alden, Minnesota, Theusch has noticed increasingly dry and mild winters punctuated by short periods of severe cold — symptoms of a warming planet.\nAs he thinks about that, future generations are on his mind. 'We have four children that are in their 20s,' the 56-year-old truck driver and moderate Democrat said. 'It's like, what's our grandkids' world going to be like?'\nA new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 45% of adults in the United States say they have become more concerned about climate change over the past year, including roughly 6 in 10 Democrats and one-quarter of Republicans.\nPresident Joe Biden's signature climate change policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, was intended to address some of those fears, investing billions in incentives for consumers and businesses to move toward clean energy sources. Biden has pointed to this climate agenda as a major presidential success during his run for reelection. But the poll suggests that although the law has already affected some Americans, it's not widely known among the general population — and may not be the electoral boost Biden is looking for.\nAdvertisement\nAbout one-quarter of Americans say tax credits for renewable energy projects such as wind power have benefited people like them so far, with similar numbers for incentives for companies to manufacture clean energy technologies in the U.S. rather than abroad, tax credits for individuals to add solar panels to their homes, or subsidies and tax credits for electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances like heat pumps. Those numbers are fairly substantial for a law that passed less than two years ago, where the benefits largely hinge on big-ticket purchases like cars or home improvements.\nPromoting electric vehicles has also been a major focus for the Biden administration, and 15% of U.S. adults say electric vehicles have had a good impact on them personally.\n'I totally agree with the act because it's done so many things for people,' said Charles Lopez, a 65-year-old liberal Democrat from the Florida Keys. 'They help everybody ... I'm not ready for a full electric, but I'll get there when there's enough charging stations.'\nAdvertisement\nBut the people who have benefited from the law are disproportionately Democrats. And while only about 1 in 10 U.S. adults think the individual tax credits and subsidies have hurt people like them, those provisions of the law aren't yet registering with the majority of Americans — roughly one-quarter say those credits haven't made a difference to people like them. Nearly 4 in 10 in each instance don't know enough to have an opinion about them.\n'I still think that, as much as we'd like for them to be implemented in a way that we can actually see results, it's not really happening in my eyes,' said Sandra Sherman, a 62-year-old resident of Vero Beach, Florida, who identifies as a liberal Democrat. 'With solar panels, although it seems like a really good idea, I see very few people in the area in Florida that I live in that actually have them.'\nGenerally, U.S. adults also aren't confident the IRA will have an impact even in more time. The poll found that only between 23% and 35% of U.S. adults say the law's key components will eventually help address climate change. About 2 in 10 think the main provisions of the law will make no difference in addressing climate change, and about one-third don't know enough to say.\nAdvertisement\n'A lot of the public feeling on it is, ‘well something needs to be done,' but not necessarily knowing what needs to be done or not even necessarily having strong feelings about what needs to be done,' said David Weakliem, a University of Connecticut professor emeritus.\nBiden still has an advantage over his opponent, former President Donald Trump, when it comes to climate change generally. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults and two-thirds of Democrats have 'a lot' or 'some' trust in Biden on climate change. That includes 29-year-old Jaime Said, a moderate Republican.\nBiden has 'talked about it more and he has mentioned a few plans of things he wants to do. So even if he doesn't do them, at the very least he's thinking about them. That's kind of headed in the right direction,' Said, a medical student in Panama City, Florida, said.\nAdvertisement\n'I know already, right off the bat, (Trump is) not going to address it much,' Said added. 'That's why I don't have too much faith in him doing anything about it.'\nOnly about 3 in 10 say they have 'a lot' or 'some' trust in Trump with regard to addressing climate change.\nBut one of Biden's major pitches for the IRA — that it will help the American economy and U.S. workers — doesn't seem to be resonating. According to the poll, only about 2 in 10 Americans say the law has done more to help the U.S. economy, while about one-quarter think it's done more to hurt the economy, and about half think it either made no difference or don't know enough to say.\nAnd broadly, a majority of Americans say the federal government is currently doing 'too little' to address climate change. They generally agree it's important for the government to support climate solutions. About half say it's extremely or very important to limit the use of products and technologies that harm the environment, and nearly half say it's important for the government to pass stricter environmental laws and regulations. About 4 in 10 say it's important for the government to build a national network of public charging stations for electric vehicles, which is another Biden administration priority.\nAdvertisement\nMost say it's extremely or very important for the federal government to invest in new, environmentally friendly technologies, and most, like 38-year-old Julio Carmona, a health program associate who lives in Stratford, Connecticut, and identifies as a moderate Democrat, say the same about enforcing current environmental regulations.\n'We can all do our part when it comes to saving energy, recycling and all those other things,' said Carmona. 'But if the big corporations aren't doing it, I think that, for me, would be where the government should start.'\n___\nThe poll of 1,204 adults was conducted April 4-8, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.\nAdvertisement\n___\nAlexa St. John is an Associated Press climate solutions reporter.

            "excerpt": "Legal experts largely agreed the Muldrow ruling lowered the bar in workplace bias claims, but views diverged on how that standard would play out in DEI cases.",
            "summary": "The Supreme Court's unanimous decision this week in favor of a St. Louis police sergeant was almost universally cast as a win for workers, who now have a lower bar for proving discrimination claims. But it's also being held up by conservative activists intent on dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, who say it will give them added firepower to quash workplace programs reserved for minorities, women and other underrepresented groups.\nAmerica First Legal, which has filed more than a dozen complaints over DEI policies at such companies as McDonald's, Morgan Stanley and the National Football League, is already factoring the ruling into its strategy, according to general counsel Gene Hamilton. The nonprofit, founded by a former White House adviser to Donald Trump, will be 'citing this decision in cases as we continue to dismantle so-called DEI programs, which almost always overtly discriminate against American citizens based on their race and sex,' he said.\nBut civil rights groups such as American Civil Liberties Union dismissed such interpretations as fearmongering with no grounding in law. 'These scare-tactics are trying to chill employers' commitment and investment in expanding workplace opportunity,' Ming-Qi Chu, deputy director of the ACLU's Women's Rights Project, said in a statement following the decision. 'We won't let them.'\nAdvertisement\nThe split screen on Muldrow v. City of St. Louis parallels the partisan divide over DEI and affirmative action programs in business, government and academia. Proponents contend such initiatives are necessary to foster diversity and reach groups that historically have been denied advancement or locked out altogether. Critics contend they discriminate against White people and men, and are designed to advance a liberal worldview.\nMuldrow v. City of St. Louis parallels the partisan divide over DEI and affirmative action programs in business, government and academia. Proponents contend such initiatives are necessary to foster diversity and reach groups that historically have been denied advancement or locked out altogether. Critics contend they discriminate against White people and men, and are designed to advance a liberal worldview.\nTensions have only intensified since the Supreme Court struck down the use of race-conscious college admissions last June, overturning more than four decades of precedent. Soon after, Harvard's first Black president resigned amid plagiarism allegations and her much-criticized comments about antisemitism on campus — an event that conservatives cast as a win against DEI. Moreover, legal challenges have been lobbed against multiple federal and state government diversity programs, forcing some to open their services to people of all racial backgrounds.\nBut the case of Jatonya Clayborn Muldrow, a Black woman and a longtime veteran of the St. Louis Police Department, drew particular attention from employment attorneys and DEI experts, who viewed it as a potential flash point in the legal battle over diversity efforts.\nAdvertisement\nMuldrow sued the department in 2018, alleging that she was transferred to less prestigious role because she was a woman. Though her rank and pay did not change, she alleges the move from an investigative unit to supervising patrol officers resulted in a more haphazard schedule, less prestigious responsibilities and fewer perks. But lower courts dismissed Muldrow's discrimination claims under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, saying they did not amount to 'significant' harm, meaning a lesser title or a loss in salary or benefits.\nThe Supreme Court was asked to consider whether Muldrow and other employees needed to show 'significant harm' to bring a discrimination claim in a job transfer. On Wednesday, the high court ruled 9-0 that it was not necessary to show significant harm, merely 'some harm.'\nLegal experts largely agreed that the ruling lowered the bar for bringing workplace discrimination claims beyond lateral transfers, though views diverged about whether that lower standard would apply to claims against DEI programs. Ahead of the ruling, some DEI proponents feared the justices might well decide that plaintiffs didn't need to show any harm, an outcome they said would leave a slew diversity programs vulnerable to litigants who merely felt the programs discriminated against them.\nAdvertisement\n'This is a narrow decision, and I think for those who are watching this case closely to see how it could affect the legal landscape around DEI programs, this is not the broad decision that DEI opponents were hoping for,' said Lauren Hartz, partner at Jenner & Block and co-chair of the law firm's DEI Protection Task Force. 'I have no doubt they'll look for ways to weaponize the decision in service of their agenda, but they're not going to find a lot of ammunition.'\nBut Andrea Lucas, a commissioner on the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, contends that DEI programs already were vulnerable to challenges and even more susceptible now that the high court has lowered the standard of harm. Lucas, who was appointed to the panel in 2020 by Trump, said that leadership development or training programs that are restricted to certain racial groups are 'high-risk,' especially in light of the high court's ruling this week.\nShe also predicted the ruling could make it easier to challenge a practice known as diverse hiring slates, such as the NFL's Rooney Rule, in which employers require a certain number of job candidates to be from underrepresented backgrounds.\nAdvertisement\n'If a DEI program posed problems before, and continues to, I think [the court's decision] further solidifies the possibility that some will be viably challenged,' Lucas said. 'I don't think the ‘some harm' standard will be the saving grace for a DEI program.'\nMany attorneys toed the line, explaining that while the ruling does not represent a death knell for DEI practices, it could spark a greater number of challenges to programs previously thought safe.\n'Big picture: a lot of employment decisions that may not have been considered actionable could now be considered actionable,' said Lindsay Burke, a partner at Covington and co-chair of the firm's Employment Practice Group. 'And so plaintiffs of all varieties could bring more claims if they think an employment decision is based on their protected characteristic.'\nAdvertisement\nThat includes employees who believe certain DEI programs discriminate against them, Burke said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nChallenges to DEI programs under the 1964 Civil Rights Act represent only a portion of those filed in recent months. Conservative activists have also challenged grant and scholarship programs using the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which prohibits discrimination in private contracts. Government programs, meanwhile, have been successfully challenged under the Constitution's equal protection clause, resulting federal programs for minorities being opened to all races, including White people. The Muldrow decision only concerned Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination in employment.\nKenji Yoshino, a professor at New York University and director of the school's Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, said that the impact of the high court's decision this week will take time to take shape.\n'Because it's going to take a lot of litigation to figure out what ‘some harm' is and how different it is from ‘significant harm,'' Yoshino said.",

            "summary": "The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for Idaho to broadly enforce a ban on gender-affirming medical care for minors, the first time the justices have intervened on the contentious issue of transgender health treatments.\nWhile the underlying case concerns the constitutionality of a ban on gender-affirming medical care for minors, the court's order did not address the merits of the issue — only whether the law could take effect for now. The state's restrictions will not immediately apply to the two transgender teens who sued the state.\nIdaho legislators passed the Idaho Vulnerable Child Protection Act last May. The law bans puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and certain surgeries for transgender adolescents. Idaho doctors who prescribe those treatments to transgender youth can face up to 10 years in prison.\nAdvertisement\nSoon after Idaho Gov. Brad Little (R) signed the bill into law, two anonymous teen plaintiffs and their parents sued the state and asked a judge to block the law while the suit moved through the courts. In December, U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill, a Bill Clinton appointee, granted their motion and temporarily blocked the ban from taking effect.\nplaintiffs and their parents sued the state and asked a judge to block the law while the suit moved through the courts. In December, U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill, a Bill Clinton appointee, granted their motion and temporarily blocked the ban from taking effect.\nThe state appealed, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit refused to stay the lower court's opinion. Idaho then asked the Supreme Court to limit the injunction to just the two plaintiffs, thereby letting the ban take effect against all other trans youth in Idaho.\n'Plaintiffs suffer no harm at all — let alone irreparable harm — if the injunction applies to them but not to others,' lawyers for the state wrote in legal filings.\nThe plaintiffs' lawyers argued that limiting the injunction would out the teenage girls at the center of the suit. Because the law promises criminal repercussions for doctors, the only way the girls could receive care without a total injunction is if they reveal themselves as the lawsuit's plaintiffs to staff at doctors' offices and pharmacies every time they visited a doctor or sought to fill their prescriptions.\nAdvertisement\nThat argument did not sway the court.\n'The plaintiffs face no harm from the partial stay the State requests,' wrote Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, who was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr.. 'Even with it, the district court's preliminary injunction will operate to prevent state authorities from taking any action to interfere with their ability to access the particular drug treatments they seek.'\nJustice Brett M. Kavanaugh, joined by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, wrote separately to say they agreed with the decision to temporarily block the lower court ruling while litigation continues.\nThe court's three liberal justices objected to Monday's ruling, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson writing that the high court should have resisted 'micromanaging' the lower courts.\nJackson, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, added that the issue of gender-affirming medical care for transgender children is a 'a serious and consequential matter, which, indeed, raises the profile of this case and the stakes of our intervention, for the law at issue here will have a significant practical impact on everyone it affects.'\nAdvertisement\nNearly half the country has passed bans on gender transition care for minors, and most of those bans have wound up in court. Though several federal courts have blocked the bans from taking effect, three higher courts — the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit in Cincinnati, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit in Chicago — have allowed the bans to proceed.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nWhile those cases have centered around the constitutionality of the bans, Idaho's request is largely technical. In court filings, the state argued that the Supreme Court has never authorized universal injunctions and some circuit courts even prohibit them.\nIn legal filings, Idaho's lawyers argued that the plaintiffs have no right to seek a universal injunction because they are only affected by parts of the ban. Both teenagers testified in court documents that they once took puberty blockers and currently take estrogen. Neither is currently seeking a surgical intervention, and neither wants access to testosterone. Trans adolescents and their families have not filed for class-action status, the lawyers argued, and should not be protected by the injunction.\nAdvertisement\n'The Plaintiffs both want access to a single procedure,' the state's representatives wrote, 'but the injunction applies to all 20+ procedures that the (Vulnerable Child Protection Act) regulates.'\nLawyers have tried to make similar cases in Texas and Florida over laws that limit LGBTQ rights.\nIn 2022, after families with trans children sued the state of Texas over an order that directed the Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate them, a district court judge initially ruled that an emergency injunction only covered two specific families who sued. Eventually, the judge issued another injunction covering all Texas families who are members of PFLAG National, an organization uniting LGBTQ families.\nAnd last year, after the restaurant Hamburger Mary's won a temporary injunction against a drag ban in Florida, lawyers for that state argued that the injunction should only apply to Hamburger Mary's and not other bars or restaurants.\nAdvertisement\nIn that case, Kavanaugh and Barrett emphasized that the question of whether lower courts can block enforcement of a law against those not involved in litigation is an important question that could warrant review in the future. But, Kavanaugh said, the Florida case was 'an imperfect vehicle' for considering the question.\nThough Idaho's request focuses on the technical issue of universal injunctions, lawyers for the state also noted that the bans themselves merit legal review.\nLast November, the ACLU, Lambda Legal and other nonprofit advocacy groups asked the Supreme Court to review a September 2023 decision by the 6th Circuit that upheld laws that bar transgender children in Tennessee and Kentucky from accessing puberty blockers and hormones.\nThe court has yet to say whether it will consider that case. Though legal experts believe the court will eventually rule on whether these bans violate the Constitution, the court has great flexibility in deciding when and how to take cases. The court receives thousands of petitions each year but takes fewer than 70 or so.\nAdvertisement\nTypically, the high court takes cases when the lower courts have issued contradictory rulings. So far, the two circuit courts that have issued full and final opinions on the bans have agreed that they do not violate the Constitution. An 8th Circuit ruling that struck down Arkansas's ban is on appeal.\nThe 9th Circuit tends to be more liberal, and if that court ultimately rules in favor of the trans teens, it will cause a circuit split.",

'Sleeping is a biological necessity,' Kagan said. 'Sleeping in public is kind of like breathing in public.'\nAdvertisement\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor asked where people are supposed to sleep in a city that lacks sufficient shelter beds.\nBut several conservative justices, who make up a majority of the court, suggested that policymakers, and not judges, should be setting local rules for dealing with homeless people.\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. asked the Biden administration's lawyer why 'these nine people' are the right ones to 'weigh the policy judgment.'\nThe Supreme Court agreed to intervene in the case after hearing pleas from an unlikely coalition that spanned the political spectrum, including liberal leaders like California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and officials in Republican-led states like Montana and Alabama. Their legal briefs described governments overwhelmed by the severity of the problem: More than 600,000 people are homeless nationwide, according to federal data, and nearly half sleep outside.\nAdvertisement\nThe case began in Grants Pass, Ore., after officials started strictly enforcing a set of measures that outlawed sleeping or camping in public spaces like parks and in parked cars, imposing fines ranging from $75 to $295. The penalties increased substantially when unpaid and could eventually result in jail time or a park ban.\nThree homeless people — Debra Blake, Gloria Johnson and John Logan — sued Grants Pass in 2018, saying the city, with a population of 40,000 people, was punishing them unconstitutionally 'based on their status of being involuntarily homeless.' They cited the Eighth Amendment's protections against cruel and unusual punishment.\nThere are officially more than 600 unhoused residents of Grants Pass, with another 1,000 living on the edge, but local service providers say at least twice as many are homeless. Grants Pass does not have a homeless shelter. Its only major transitional housing program, the Gospel Rescue Mission, is a privately-run religious facility with 138 beds and stringent requirements for residents, such as regular chapel attendance and abstinence from substances and romantic relationships.\nmore than 600 unhoused residents of Grants Pass, with another 1,000 living on the edge, but local service providers say at least twice as many are homeless.

Its only major transitional housing program, the Gospel Rescue Mission, is a privately-run religious facility with 138 beds and stringent requirements for residents, such as regular chapel attendance and abstinence from substances and romantic relationships.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2020, a district court judge sided with the unhoused people behind the lawsuit and barred the city from enforcing its anti-camping ban in parks at night if no other shelter was available. Judge Mark D. Clarke told the city that it has other options for preventing encampments without violating the Eight Amendment.\n'Let us not forget that homeless individuals are citizens just as much as those fortunate enough to have a secure living space,' Clarke wrote.\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which covers Western states, including Oregon, California and Washington, upheld the decision in 2022. A closely divided 9th Circuit refused to rehear the case sitting with a full complement of judges, drawing sharp dissents and warnings of 'dire practical consequences' for hundreds of cities and millions of people.\nAdvertisement\nJudge Diarmuid O'Scannlain, joined by 14 colleagues, said a related 2019 decision by the 9th Circuit and expanded in the Grants Pass case was 'paralyzing local communities from addressing the pressing issue of homelessness, and seizing policymaking authority that our federal system of government leaves to the democratic process.'\nAs a result of the 9th Circuit panel's ruling, the attorney for Grants Pass told the Supreme Court, encampments have multiplied unchecked throughout the West because restrictions on public camping no longer play their critical deterrent role, resulting in spikes in violent crime, drug overdoses, disease, fires, and hazardous waste.\n'The homelessness crisis is a significant challenge for communities large and small throughout the nation,' the city's legal team, led by attorney Theane D.

'The solution is not to stretch the Eighth Amendment beyond its limits and place the federal courts in charge of this pressing social problem.'\nAdvertisement\nIn response, lawyers for the homeless individuals said state and local officials are still free to restrict tents in public spaces, to clear encampments, and even to fine homeless people who decline other shelter options. But the city cannot punish people with no alternatives, they argued.\n'Punishing homeless people for resting or sleeping outside anywhere at any time when they have no access to shelter and need a blanket to survive is not the punishment of ‘conduct' in any meaningful sense of the word — it is akin to punishing the ‘conduct' of breathing outside as a homeless person,' their legal team, led by attorneys Kelsi Corkran and Edward Johnson, told the justices in advance court filings.\nThe Biden administration charted something of a middle path. Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar agreed with the unhoused individuals in court filings that anti-camping laws are unconstitutional when they target people who have no access to indoor shelter.\nAdvertisement\nBut Prelogar urged the justices to return the case to the lower courts to ensure that the city's laws are not blocked across the board. Such bans should still be allowable, she argued, if an investigation shows that a given person does in fact have access to shelter.\nBoth sides in the case known as City of Grants Pass v. Gloria Johnson cited a Supreme Court ruling from decades ago to bolster their conflicting arguments. The Biden administration and the homeless individuals said the 9th Circuit ruling is consistent with a 1962 decision from the high court that invalidated a California law criminalizing drug addiction, finding that the government cannot criminally punish a person because of an involuntary status.\nGrants Pass v.

Frederick Haynes III told The Associated Press that he submitted a letter with his resignation as head of the Chicago-based Rainbow PUSH Coalition, effective immediately.\n'After a time of prayer and consultation, I felt it was best to step down as president and CEO of Rainbow PUSH,' he said by phone from Texas. 'I am forever honored that the Rev. Jackson graciously considered me worthy of following him as president of the organization that he founded.'\nHaynes, 63, said he felt it was 'necessary' to move on in light of 'challenges that continue to exist,' but declined to elaborate further. His resignation letter, written on Rainbow PUSH letterhead, also did not go into details about his decision.\nAdvertisement\nIn a statement issued late Tuesday, Jackson said the organization accepted Haynes' resignation and they would remain 'partners in the fight for peace, civil rights and economic justice.'\nJackson said his son, Yusef Jackson, an attorney, would continue to serve as the organization's chief operating officer. He did not mention the prospects of choosing another president and CEO.\n'We will carry on the vital work of protecting, defending, and gaining civil rights by leveling the economic and educational playing fields,' Jesse Jackson said.

He planned to lead Rainbow PUSH, which advocates for social justice and political activism, from Texas. He has been senior pastor since 1983 at Friendship-West, which has about 13,000 members, according to the church.\nAdvertisement\nHaynes said that even though the formal takeover was in February, he hit the ground running over the summer with duties in the office and hoped he could collaborate with Rainbow PUSH and Jackson in the future.\n'He remains one of my heroes. He remains one of the great leaders of all time,' Haynes said.\nIn his resignation letter, he said he plans to continue his work 'in the fight for liberation and freedom.'\nJackson — who was pivotal in the modern Civil Rights Movement — has faced numerous health issues in recent years and has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.\nStill, the 82-year-old two-time presidential candidate hasn't shied away from the public eye.",

But it will be the first major political event this year for the former first lady.\nMelania Trump had for months not appeared at her husband's campaign events, notably being absent at his victory party on Super Tuesday. Her attendance at the fundraiser — for a group she has previously supported — could be a sign that she will ramp up her schedule with several months left before the November election.\nBoth Trumps went together to cast their ballots in the Florida primary last month. When a reporter asked if she would return to the campaign trail, she responded with a smile, 'Stay tuned.'\nAdvertisement\nThe former first lady then attended a high-profile fundraiser at hedge-fund billionaire John Paulson's house in Palm Beach, where she was photographed with her husband in front of the mansion facing the ocean.\nThe Log Cabin Republicans group describes itself on its website as the county's 'largest organization representing LGBT conservatives and straight allies who support fairness, freedom, and equality for all Americans.' Melania Trump was a special guest and award recipient of the organization's Spirit of Lincoln award in 2021 at a dinner hosted at Mar-a-Lago.\nThe Log Cabin Republicans on Friday posted on X thanking Melania Trump for her message in a Fox News Digital interview.\n'We must unite in our effort to establish a society where equality is the everyday experience of every American,' Melania Trump said in the interview.\nAdvertisement\nIn a 2020 endorsement of the former president for his reelection bid, the Log Cabin Republicans described Trump as having a 'commitment to govern from a place of inclusion.' In this endorsement, the group praised Trump for his 'commitment to end the spread of HIV/AIDS' and his initiative to 'end the criminalization of homosexuality internationally.'\nYet critics often criticize Trump's record on LGBTQ+ issues. During his presidency, he nominated judges for the U.S. Supreme Court, including Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, who were criticized by liberal advocates for LGBTQ+ people.\nTrump also faced national criticism in 2017 when he announced transgender people were barred from military service, when about 15,000 transgender people were enlisted at the time. In 2019, he barred U.S. embassies from displaying the rainbow or pride flag during Pride Month.\nAdvertisement\nThroughout his campaign, Trump has repeatedly mocked transgender people using language of gender identity that LGBTQ+ critics call harmful. He has acted out a young athlete struggling to lift heavy barbells compared with other competitors 'who transitioned.'\nIn campaign speeches he has touted his promise to cut federal funding on schools pushing what he calls 'transgender insanity.'",

Harvard University remains in an almighty mess after months of turmoil over hate speech. There is a way to fix this: Appoint former Massachusetts governor and retiring U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) university president.\nThough I am a lifelong Democrat, did not vote for Romney when he ran for U.S. president in 2008 and have no personal connection to him, I make this suggestion in the sincere and robust hope that he is someone who can navigate the university through painful but necessary reform and drive back the antisemitism that is tarnishing the institution's credibility.\nAs the grandson of Holocaust survivors and president of the American Jewish Congress, I find it devastating that Harvard has failed to vigorously address the unchecked antisemitism on campus. Anyone who has studied there can attest that Harvard is not an antisemitic institution. I never for a moment felt oppressed or marginalized as a student on the Harvard campus. But to my dismay, recent years have seen an unconscionable spike in — and even worse, an administrative tolerance of — hate speech directed at Jews, including targeting Jewish students. The university's response has thus far been ramshackle and unproductive, to put it mildly.\nAdvertisement\nHarvard knows there is a problem. Increasing numbers of students, faculty, alumni and donors have expressed discomfort, even horror, at the hostile environment on campus. But in its most talked-about response — the appointment of a task force to combat antisemitism — Harvard included as co-chair a professor who referred to Israel as a 'regime of apartheid.' How was this allowed to happen?\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAs we saw with the disastrous congressional testimony of then-President Claudine Gay, leadership matters. The university president must be the flag-bearer of our values. There is no doubt that there are other Americans of similar standing and stature, but Romney's unique bridge-building character is precisely what Harvard needs in an age of toxic polarization. A Harvard alumnus, he is an eloquent and experienced administrator who has consistently demonstrated his political independence in defense of what is right, rather than what is expedient.\nRomney has been nothing short of a profile in courage in the Senate, supporting gun safety reform and voting to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson as the first Black female Supreme Court justice. Importantly, he has been a staunch supporter of civil rights for all, including leveling heartfelt criticism at Harvard for failing to protect Jewish students. He can guide Harvard as it faces intense scrutiny from Congress and from an increasingly anxious — even angered — Jewish community.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough many at Harvard might not share Romney's politics — a 2022 Harvard Crimson poll shows that more than 80 percent of Harvard's faculty identify as liberal — choosing him would be an ideal way to nurture a culture and atmosphere of open inquiry and respectful dialogue. What matters more than political leanings is that Romney has the moral courage and independence to identify the root sources of antisemitism at the university, address the decline in Jewish student applications and enrollment and teach a new generation of young adults the importance of mutual tolerance and civilized coexistence.",

He faces 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection with reimbursement of a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election. Prosecutors have accused Trump of classifying the reimbursement as a legal expense, rather than a campaign expense, and of authorizing the payment to Daniels to keep her from publicly accusing him just before the 2016 election of a tryst she alleged happened years earlier.\nIt is one of four criminal indictments against Trump; the other three trials are delayed and may not happen before the election.\nIn addition to picking a jury, lawyers have been sparring in the courtroom this week over whether Trump has repeatedly violated a gag order by making public comments and social media posts related to witnesses and others Merchan has said should be protected.\nAdvertisement\nThat discussion led to an extraordinary exchange late Thursday where Trump's lawyer pledged to keep his client from posting about witnesses and the judge said he did not think that was possible.\nOn the first day of the trial, prosecutors asked for Trump to be held in contempt and fined $1,000 for each of what they said were three violations. Before juror candidates came into the courtroom Thursday, prosecutors alleged that Trump had violated his gag order 'seven more times' in recent days by repeatedly highlighting articles and tweets disparaging the credibility of Michael Cohen, a key government witness who was once Trump's lawyer and fixer, and that of the jurors selected on the second day of the trial.

'We're not telling them who the witnesses are.'\nMerchan said he 'can't blame' prosecutors for their decision and refused to order the district attorney to provide the names.

            "summary": "BRUSSELS — Belgian police shut down a gathering of far-right politicians and supporters on Tuesday, citing concerns about public order, while attendees protested curbs on free speech and vowed to find another venue for Day 2.\nThe annual National Conservative conference, held this year in Brussels, comes ahead of Europe-wide elections. As campaigning for the June 6-9 event heats up, mainstream parties fear that disenchanted voters might turn to the people at NatCon 2024.\n'This is what we're up against. We're up against a new form of evil ideology,' Nigel Farage, the man credited with taking Britain out of the European Union, told the gathering of a few hundred stridently nationalist and fundamentalist Christian politicians and think-tankers.\nAnti-migrant sentiment featured in a number of speeches. Some targeted what they saw as the follies of climate policy, 'narco-socialism' or 'woke indoctrination,' often with sharp opposition to multinational organizations like the EU.\nAdvertisement\nLashing out at the bloc's treaties, and the pledge in the preamble of the founding EU texts to an 'ever-closer Union' among the 27 member countries, Polish lawmaker Ryszard Legutko said it all makes 'medieval monks look almost like intellectual anarchists.'\nSurveys suggest that mainstream political parties are likely to retain power after the June elections, but quite possibly with a reduced majority.\nBelgian police quietly shut down the conference by barring attendees from re-entering the venue if they dared to leave. A dozen or so officers blocked the main entrance. It was the third venue for the gathering after the owners of two other locations shied away when anti-fascist protesters vowed to disrupt proceedings.\nThis year's NatCon, organized by the conservative U.S. think tank the Edmund Burke Foundation, was held under the banner of 'National Conservatism, Preserving the Nation-State in Europe.'\nAdvertisement\nFrench far-right figurehead Eric Zemmour was scheduled to criticize the EU's new migrant and asylum rules but was turned away by police. Suella Braverman, who served as U.K. home secretary for just over a month in 2022 before being fired, railed for 27 minutes against the European Court of Human Rights.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nPoliticians and former leaders from Spain, Poland and the Netherlands were also on the agenda. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was due to speak on Wednesday.\n'I guess they couldn't take free speech any longer,' Orban posted on the social media platform X. 'The last time they wanted to silence me with the police was when the Communists set them on me in '88. We didn't give up then and we will not give up this time either!'\nSpeakers summoned the grand ideas of figures like the Pope, Homer, Dostoyevsky, Leo Strauss, Tocqueville and Gramsci. English was the common language, spattered with classical Latin. Modern liberal democracy was likened to a form of 'neo-Marxist authoritarianism.'\nAdvertisement\nMostly though, those who could speak before the gathering was shut down for the day focused on their 'enemies' among the mainstream political parties.\n'We have to know our enemies are in panic and they show it every day,' said EU lawmaker Hermann Tertsch, from Spain's far-right Vox party. 'The enemy knows their time is running out.'\nAs Brussels police warned that the conference's time was limited, too, Edmund Burke Foundation Chairman Yoram Hazony invited participants to stay as long as they dared.",

            "summary": "President Biden condemned antisemitism on college campuses in a statement on Sunday, three days after more than 100 people protesting the Gaza war on Columbia University's campus were arrested.\nBiden's statement, which came as part of a lengthy Passover greeting he issued from the White House, didn't name Columbia directly but said there had been 'harassment and calls for violence against Jews' in recent days.\n'This blatant Antisemitism is reprehensible and dangerous — and it has absolutely no place on college campuses, or anywhere in our country,' the statement said.\nThe president and the White House often issue holiday greetings for various faiths, but the latest statement was notable for its political references. It noted that Passover was coming at a difficult time for Jews still processing the Oct. 7 attacks, when Hamas militants killed 1,200 in Israel and took numerous hostages.\nAdvertisement\nEarlier Sunday, the White House issued a separate statement directly in response to anti-Israel protests at Columbia, which are continuing this week as students occupy the university grounds in tented encampments.\n'While every American has the right to peaceful protest, calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly Antisemitic, unconscionable, and dangerous,' said the statement from Andrew Bates, deputy White House press secretary.\nMonday is the beginning of Passover, a celebration of Jews' liberation from slavery in Egypt.\nThe protest at Columbia University came the same week as many other demonstrations across the country that were meant to highlight Israel's war in Gaza. Protesters have blocked major roads in New York and San Francisco and airport access roads in Chicago and Seattle.\nPro-Palestinian demonstrators shut down roads and bridges across the United States on April 15, calling for a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. (Video: Julie Yoon/The Washington Post)\nBut the situation at Columbia has come under a bigger political spotlight after its president, Minouche Shafik, was called to testify Wednesday before a House Committee investigating campus antisemitism.\nAdvertisement\nThe following day, Shafik summoned New York Police Department officers in riot gear to the campus. The arrested students, who offered little resistance, were charged with trespassing. Shafik told New York police in a letter that students involved in the protest would be suspended.\nStudents have returned to the grounds to occupy on Sunday, prompting new concerns and condemnations.\nOn Sunday morning, Elie Buechler, a rabbi at the Hillel for Columbia University, told Jewish students in a WhatsApp message that they should leave campus until safety measures have improved, he confirmed to The Washington Post.\n'What we are witnessing in and around campus is terrible and tragic,' Buechler's message said. 'The events of the last few days, especially last night, have made it clear that Columbia University's Public Safety and the NYPD cannot guarantee Jewish students' safety in the face of extreme antisemitism and anarchy.'\nAdvertisement\nBrian Cohen, a director of Columbia's Hillel, said in a statement later Sunday that the university's center for Jewish student life would remain open. The directors of Columbia's Chabad also encouraged students on social media to join the organization's Passover activities.\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams (D) said in a statement Sunday night that more New York police officers have been stationed near Columbia's campus. He said that a protester at the university yelled 'We are Hamas.'\n'As mayor of the city with the largest Jewish community in the world outside of Israel, the pain these protests are causing Jews across the globe is not lost on me,' Adams said. 'I also see and hear the pain of those protesting in support of innocent lives being lost in Gaza.'",

            "summary": "JOHANNESBURG — South Africa faces an unusual national election this year, its seventh vote since transitioning from white minority rule to a democracy 30 years ago. Polls and analysts warn that for the first time, the ruling African National Congress party that has comfortably held power since Nelson Mandela became the country's first Black president in 1994 might receive less than 50% of votes.\nOne big reason is Jacob Zuma, the former president and ANC leader who stepped down in disgrace in 2018 amid a swirl of corruption allegations but has emerged in recent months with a new political party. It intends to be a major election player as the former president seeks revenge against former longtime allies.\nHere is what you need to know about the 82-year-old Zuma's return to the political ring and how it might play a significant election role.\nWHO IS JACOB ZUMA?\nZuma has long been one of South Africa's most recognizable politicians. He was a senior leader in the ANC during the liberation struggle against apartheid. A former ANC intelligence chief, he has repeatedly threatened to reveal some of the party's secrets. While Zuma was not one of Mandela's preferred choices to succeed him, Mandela trusted Zuma to play an influential role in ending deadly political violence that engulfed KwaZulu-Natal province before the historic 1994 elections. The province has remained a vocal base of support for Zuma ever since, and members of Zuma's Zulu ethnic group make up its majority. Zuma became deputy leader of the ANC in 1997 and was appointed South Africa's deputy president in 1999.\nHOW DID HE BECOME PRESIDENT?\nZuma's path to power included legal challenges. In 2006, he was found not guilty of raping the daughter of a comrade at Zuma's home in Johannesburg. A year earlier, he was fired as South Africa's deputy president after his financial advisor was convicted for corruption for soliciting bribes for Zuma during an infamous arms deal. Alleging a political witch hunt, Zuma launched an aggressive political campaign that saw him elected ANC president in 2007. His campaign appealed to widespread discontent with then-President Thabo Mbeki, who was often described as autocratic and aloof. The corruption charges against Zuma were later dropped, amid controversy, and he was elected South Africa's president in 2009.\nHOW DID HE LOSE POWER?\nZuma's presidency was often under fire. His close friends and allies, the Gupta family, were accused of influencing appointments to key cabinet positions in exchange for lucrative business deals. The allegations of corruption in government and state-owned companies eventually led the ANC force Zuma to resign in 2018. A judicial commission of inquiry uncovered wide-ranging evidence, and Zuma in 2021 was convicted and sentenced to 15 months in jail for refusing to testify. Zuma remains aggrieved with the ANC and his successor, President Cyril Ramaphosa. But few South Africans expected the break to go so far.\nHOW HAS HE REEMERGED?\nZuma shocked the country in December by denouncing the ANC and campaigning against a party that had been at the heart of his political career. His new political party, UMkhonto WeSizwe, was named after the ANC's military wing, which was disbanded at the end of the struggle against white minority rule. The ANC has launched a legal case seeking to stop the new party from using a name and logo that are similar to those of the military wing. The charismatic Zuma continues to crisscross the country, delivering lively speeches, and an image of his face will represent the party on ballots.\nWHAT ARE ZUMA'S ELECTION CHANCES?",

            "summary": "KYIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian and Western leaders welcomed a desperately needed aid package passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, as the Kremlin claimed the passage of the bill would 'further ruin' Ukraine and cause more deaths.\nThe House swiftly approved $95 billion in foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies in a rare Saturday session as Democrats and Republicans banded together after months of hard-right resistance over renewed American support for repelling Russia's invasion.\nWith an overwhelming vote, the $61 billion in aid for Ukraine passed in a matter of minutes. Many Democrats cheered on the House floor and waved Ukrainian flags.\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who had warned that his country would lose the war without U.S. funding, said that he was grateful for the decision of U.S. lawmakers.\nAdvertisement\n'We appreciate every sign of support for our country and its independence, people and way of life, which Russia is attempting to bury under the rubble,' he wrote on social media site X.\n'America has demonstrated its leadership since the first days of this war. Exactly this type of leadership is required to maintain a rules-based international order and predictability for all nations,' he said.\nThe Ukrainian president noted that his country's 'warriors on the front lines' would feel the benefit of the aid package.\nOne such 'warrior' is infantry soldier Oleksandr, fighting around Avdiivka, the city in the Donetsk region that Ukraine lost to Russia in February after months of intense combat.\n'For us it's so important to have this support from the U.S. and our partners,' Oleksandr told The Associated Press. He did not give his full name for security reasons.\nAdvertisement\n'With this we can stop them and reduce our losses. It's the first step to have the possibility to liberate our territory.'\nAmmunition shortages linked to the aid holdup over the past six months have led Ukrainian military commanders to ration shells, a disadvantage that Russia seized on this year — taking the city of Avdiivka and currently inching towards the town of Chasiv Yar, also in the Donetsk region.\n'The Russians come at us in waves — we become exhausted, we have to leave our positions. This is repeated many times,' Oleksandr said. 'Not having enough ammunition means we can't cover the area that is our responsibility to hold when they are assaulting us.'\nOther Western leaders lauded the passing of the aid package.\n'Ukraine is using the weapons provided by NATO Allies to destroy Russian combat capabilities. This makes us all safer, in Europe & North America,' NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg wrote on X.\nAdvertisement\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that 'Ukraine deserves all the support it can get against Russia.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIn Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the approval of aid to Ukraine 'expected and predictable.'\nThe decision 'will make the United States of America richer, further ruin Ukraine and result in the deaths of even more Ukrainians, the fault of the Kyiv regime,' Peskov was quoted as saying by Russian news agency Ria Novosti.\n'The new aid package will not save, but, on the contrary, will kill thousands and thousands more people, prolong the conflict, and bring even more grief and devastation,' Leonid Slutsky, head of the Russian State Duma Committee on International Affairs, wrote on Telegram.\nThe whole aid package will go to the U.S. Senate, which could pass it as soon as Tuesday.

Kennedy Jr.'s presence in the presidential race is not ideal for their candidacies.\nOn Thursday, Biden appeared at an event with a bevy of other Kennedys, ones who supported him and not the family member. Trump, meanwhile, has been railing against how liberal Kennedy purportedly is, making not subtle suggestions to Democrats (a group with whom he admittedly has limited sway) that they back Kennedy rather than Biden.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nThat's the obvious point: the major-party candidates fear Kennedy will pull away voters they need to eke out a majority in a state. Each man won the presidency thanks to narrow margins in a handful of states, after all, so the prospect of seeing a swing state swing in the other direction because of Kennedy is particularly unappealing.\nAdvertisement\nNew data from Fox News's well-respected polling arm offers insight into how real that threat is. The verdict?\nMaybe? Sort of. Kind of?\nThe poll was conducted in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, four states that flipped from backing Trump in 2016 to preferring Biden in 2020. (The Michigan results weren't really that close last time, but whatever.) In every state except Georgia — where Trump has a stronger lead — the results in a head-to-head contest between the major-party candidates show a functionally tied race. When Kennedy is added to the mix? The results in every state except Georgia show a functionally tied race.\nYou can see the shifts below. On the outside of each graph are the results of the poll when Biden and Trump are the only offered options; the center three columns show the results when Kennedy is in the mix. At the top of each Biden and Trump column in the middle is the percentage-point drop the candidates experience when thrown into the larger field.\nPennsylvania and Wisconsin go from tied to one candidate having a two-point lead when the field is larger, but 'a two-point lead' and 'tied' are functionally the same thing when you consider margins of error. In other words, there's no obvious effect on the outcome shown in the polls. But there would be some effect on Election Day — an uncertain one that both major-party candidates want to shape.\nAdvertisement\nThe Fox News poll asked about the full field before the head-to-head matchup in each state. Asking both questions allowed it to break down the head-to-head support for Trump and Biden relative to how those same respondents had answered the question about the full field.\nIn each state, about 9 in 10 of those who picked either Trump or Biden in the head-to-head question had also chosen that candidate when presented with the full field. But anywhere from about 5 to 10 percent of those candidates' head-to-head support came from people who picked Kennedy when given the choice.\nIn Michigan, for example, 1 in 10 respondents who picked Trump in the head-to-head contest had picked Kennedy when given the fuller field. If Kennedy didn't make the ballot in Michigan, that would be better news for the former president. Unfortunately for Trump, he did.\nAdvertisement\nWe can summarize these findings accurately and unsatisfactorily. Kennedy's presence on the ballot in swing states would pull voters from both major-party candidates. The effect of doing so, however, is uncertain, and it's not clear that Kennedy would shift the winner in any state from Trump to Biden or vice versa. But, also? He might.",

Berliner's essay was accompanied by several glossy portraits and a nearly hour-long podcast interview with Weiss.\nConservative activist Christopher Rufo — who rose to fame for targeting 'critical race theory,' and whose scrutiny of Harvard president Claudine Gay preceded her resignation — set his sights this week on NPR's new CEO, Katherine Maher, surfacing old social-media posts she wrote before she joined the news organization. In one 2020 tweet, she referred to Trump as a 'deranged racist.' Others posts show her wearing a Biden hat, or wistfully daydreaming about hanging out with Kamala Harris. Rufo has called for Maher's resignation.\nhas called for Maher's resignation.\nAdvertisement\nMaher, who started her job as NPR CEO last month, previously was the head of the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that operates the online encyclopedia Wikipedia.

'Morning Edition' host Steve Inskeep, writing on his Substack on Tuesday, fact-checked or contextualized several of the arguments Berliner made. For instance: Berliner wrote that he once asked 'why we keep using that word that many Hispanics hate — Latinx.' Inskeep said he searched 90 days of NPR's content and found 'Latinx' was used nine times — 'usually by a guest' — compared to the nearly 400 times 'Latina' and 'Latino' were used.\n'This article needed a better editor,' Inskeep wrote. 'I don't know who, if anyone, edited Uri's story, but they let him publish an article that discredited itself. ... A careful read of the article shows many sweeping statements for which the writer is unable to offer evidence.'\n'Morning Edition' host Leila Fadel told The Post: 'Many feel this was a bad faith effort to undermine and endanger our reporters around the country and the world, rather than make us a stronger and more powerful news organization. He wrote what I think was a factually inaccurate take on our work that was filled with omissions to back his arguments.'\nAdvertisement\nIn the piece, Berliner accuses NPR of mishandling three major stories: the allegations of the 2016 Trump campaign's collusion with Russia, the origins of the coronavirus, and the authenticity and relevance of Hunter Biden's laptop. Berliner's critics note that he didn't oversee coverage of these stories. They also say that his essay indirectly maligns employee affinity groups — he name-checks groups for Muslim, Jewish, queer and Black employees, which he wrote 'reflect broader movement in the culture of people clustering together based on ideology or a characteristic at birth.' He also writes, without proper context, about the size of NPR's newsroom — that NPR's D.C. headquarters is politically homogenous because it employs 87 registered Democrats and zero Republicans.\nwithout proper context, about the size of NPR's newsroom — that NPR's D.C. headquarters is politically homogenous because it employs 87 registered Democrats and zero Republicans.\nTony Cavin, NPR's managing editor of standards and practices, told The Post that 'I have no idea where he got that number,' that NPR's newsroom has 660 employees, and that 'I know a number of our hosts and staff are registered as independents.'

Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) by interviewing him 25 times about Trump and Russia. Cavin told The Post NPR aired 900 interviews with lawmakers during the same period of time, 'so that's three percent.

            "summary": "MR. LYNCH: Hello, and welcome to Washington Post Live. I'm David J. Lynch, global economics correspondent here at The Post.\nToday we have two segments on American manufacturing and the emerging workforce. Later we'll hear from the president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Valerie Sheares Ashby. But first, I'm joined by Jay Timmons, the president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers.\nJay, welcome to Washington Post Live.\nMR. TIMMONS: Great to be here, David. Thanks for having me.\nMR. LYNCH: Well, we're glad you could join us.\nSo let's set the stage for how things look in manufacturing. The number of factory jobs is up almost 800,000 since President Biden took office. As a percentage of total employment, however, it's about flat. But spending on new factories has shot through the roof. It's roughly double what it was three years ago. So what's your assessment of the overall health of the American manufacturing sector right now?\nAdvertisement\nMR. TIMMONS: So David, I would say we're--you know, look, we're very strong right now. There's no question about it.\nI think it's important to put this into a historic perspective, if you will. I think back to the work that President Bush 43, and even before him, Clinton and Bush 41 and Reagan and then President Obama, the work that they did to expand our trade agreements so that we could sell more products overseas. I think of the investments that were made during the Trump administration because of those just record tax reforms that were put in place as well as the regulatory certainty. And then, of course, you fast forward to this administration, and you look at the investments that were made through the President's manufacturing strategy in terms of infrastructure investment, the CHIPS and Science Act, and many provisions of the IRA. All of that has led to a place today where manufacturing is stronger than we've seen it in more than a generation.\nAnd, in fact, you referenced the number of manufacturing workers that are out there today. It's the highest number since 2008. The sector is seeing record investment in new plants and equipment, and you've also seen record wage growth. That's all because of these policies that were put in place by administrations of different political stripes. Now our challenge is to maintain this momentum that we have and ensure that America continues to lead the world economically and certainly leads the world through manufacturing prowess.\nAdvertisement\nMR. LYNCH: Well, that's a perfect segue into a question from one of our viewers. Anthony Vance from Washington, D.C., asks, 'Is the surge in manufacturing a temporary phenomenon largely stimulated by government policies instituted in the last three years, or is it likely to remain with us for a decade or so?'\nMR. TIMMONS: Well, I guess the answer to that is yes to both of those questions, Anthony, depending on what public policies are put into place.\nI mentioned this continuum that we've seen, this focus by both political parties, which is great, on growing the manufacturing economy here in the United States and making manufacturing even stronger. But we have some choices to make. We're at a crossroads. There's no question about that, and those choices, they all relate back to all of those issues that I've mentioned. And I would add one other, which I'll get to in a second.\nAdvertisement\nBut you have tax policy that has expired in terms of our ability to really prioritize innovation through the research and development tax deduction, interest deductibility, and immediate expensing. Those three things alone contribute to a significant amount of manufacturing investment here in the United States, and the fact that that has ceased to exist in the last couple of years and we're waiting for Congress to renew those incentives, it's chilling future manufacturing investment--or current and future manufacturing investment.\nThen you have the tax reforms of 2017 that are up for discussion and action in 2025, and those are specifically the rates for small- and medium-sized manufacturers who file as S-corporations. Those rates expire at the end of 2025. And what I fear is that there will be politicians, probably of both political stripes, who are trying to appease a very important part of their constituency and a very important part of the manufacturing economy, small businesses, by saying, well, why don't we just capitulate on the C-corp rate and raise that a few percentage points so that we can keep the rate low for small and medium manufacturers? And I say that is a losing strategy. You've got to have competitive rates across the board, and right now we're at 21 percent at the C-corp level. We need to maintain that. We also have to get--and in the promo video, the initial video, David, that you ran, it said that I argued against--I'm arguing against additional regulation. That's not quite accurate.\nI'm arguing actually for smart regulation, and that means business and government sitting down together to talk about what the possibilities are. We all agree on what the issues are before us, whether it's lowering carbon intensity or making sure that our drinking water is safe and our air is cleaner and our communities are healthier for our children and our grandchildren, but you can't just be aspirational about what your objectives are. You have to be very pragmatic and level-headed, and you have to understand what is possible in the world today as well as what will be possible in the world tomorrow. And then that goes right back to those incentives like the research and development tax deduction. If you want to innovate here in America, you've got to have all of those tools.\nAdvertisement\nI would also add that it's important to have trade agreements. We haven't negotiated one for over 10 years.\nAnd then, lastly, I would say it's extraordinarily important, Anthony, that we have the workforce that we need to fill the jobs that are open. We have almost 600,000 open jobs in manufacturing today. We're doing really well. But by the year 2033, we're going to need to fill 3.8 million jobs in our sector because of retirements or growth in our sector, and if things keep going the way they are, it's going to be about 1.9 million of those jobs that we can't fill. That's not sustainable. That doesn't allow us to be the leader in the world.\nMR. LYNCH: Let's--I want to--I want to talk about the administration's industrial policies, which are, at least in part, in good part, probably, responsible for some of this manufacturing uptick, which is the good news.\nAdvertisement\nMR. TIMMONS: No question.\nMR. LYNCH: But this sort of government-directed steering of the economy or steering of capital represents a big change from the market-oriented policies that we've seen in recent decades. Are you uncomfortable at all with the notion of government getting bigger and more involved in the economy?\nMR. TIMMONS: So I don't think there's any pure system when it comes to a free market economy, David. I think--you know, I think you have to be, again, pragmatic.\nThe fact is that China, sure, they're an economic competitor, and, you know, we can--we can deal with that if we were dealing with a level playing field and they were truly a free market economy, but they're not. They're a command economy. They manipulate. They manipulate markets. They manipulate how products are made.\nAdvertisement\nBut even more important than that is our national security interests. So, for instance, CHIPS and Science, that legislation that passed that provided billions of dollars of grants to incentivize chip fab facilities being built here in the United States, that was absolutely critical for our national security. We could not allow these devices to be made in the country where we may not always have the ability to have decent relations.\nSo I was pleased from a national security perspective that we invested there, but it also adds to our economic security, because everything today, as we all know, has some sort of an electronic component or a chip in its manufacture, in its body. So we have to have that capability here as well as some of the other investments, I think, that have been really important for ensuring our worldwide mantle of leadership.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, many of these industrial policy projects that the administration is promoting are in the clean energy space aimed at addressing climate change. Many of them are located, as you know, in so-called \"red states,\" where Republican lawmakers often have voted against the legislation that has created the projects in the first place. So what do you think is the likelihood that that kind of work, that kind of funding would survive a change in administrations?\nAdvertisement\nMR. TIMMONS: Well, to the best of my understanding, a lot of these--a lot of these grants and loans are going to be moving very quickly. The administration is trying to move them through the process very quickly.\nBut, you know, I'd like to take the politics maybe out of some of--some of these discussions. Yes, there are philosophical disagreements on how we're enacting some of these policies that are part of the president's manufacturing strategy, but ultimately, we all have the same goal. And the same goal is for the United States to be the leader, for the United States to grow its manufacturing base, and for the United States to be able to increase the number of workers in the manufacturing sector, because, quite frankly, manufacturing has led to a stronger and healthier quality of life and economic status for Americans all across the board. And politicians of both parties understand that.\nThey might look at things a little bit differently, right? So you may see--you may see some elected officials say, well, let's have a program where we can spend money, and you might have others say, well, let's have a program where you can incentivize through tax policy. I think either of those can work, and we can debate all day about which one is more effective or which one is more free market oriented. But ultimately, we all want to get to the same objective.\nAdvertisement\nMR. LYNCH: You mentioned earlier the need for smart regulation. I'd be interested if you could provide sort of your favorite example of a grossly misguided regulation that puts burdens on your members that would strike the audience as almost ludicrous, not something that's a minor irritant that might take just a little bit more paperwork but something that you think is just obviously counterproductive and ought to be eliminated.\nMR. TIMMONS: Well, you want to make this really dramatic, it seems, so I--[laughs].\nMR. LYNCH: No, I want to--I want to give--I'm giving you a chance to--\nMR. TIMMONS: Yeah, I understand.\nMR. LYNCH: --help explain to viewers what changes you need to see.\nMR. TIMMONS: Yeah. Let me start with a positive because I think--I think--and then I'll get to a specific regulation that answers your question.\nOn the positive side, I can point to the Securities and Exchange Commission and their work about two years ago to introduce a climate emissions regulation that was going to be imposed on all businesses of all sizes. We had some real concerns with that proposal, because in the end, we couldn't comply. There was literally no way to comply with that regulation. This was an example of a regulatory agency, regulators, and the business community collaborating, talking, discussing what the goals and objectives are from the regulatory side or the regulator side of the aisle, and what the possibilities were and the realities were from the business side. And in the end, David, the SEC literally addressed every single thing that we said was problematic. So that's an example of how you can work together.\nNow, we don't love that regulation. Let me just be very clear about that. But it's a regulation that I think is at least achievable, and the agency listened. The other side of that is the particulate matter, PM2.5 regulation that was issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, which is--you know, it is onerous for manufacturers and actually is counter to what the president is trying to achieve through his manufacturing strategy. What the PM2.5 regulation will do, quite simply, is it will shut down the ability of businesses to invest and build new facilities in many communities across this country. It's going to cause mayors and governors to make a choice between, say, building a bridge that might be available or might be possible through the infrastructure funding legislation that was passed or having the private sector come in and build a new chips facility. These choices are going to be--these tradeoffs are going to be present very soon. That regulation is now in place, and it's going to cause a lot of very difficult decisions, and it's going to impede growth. It's going to impede the ability of manufacturers who could actually help solve the climate issue, to build facilities and innovate and create new products, to be a part of the solution. So it's one of those regulations that, frankly, is just not smart.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, you mentioned permitting issues a bit earlier, and that's been a perennial complaint for years. There was some movement, I think, at one point last year. There was a brief glimmer of hope for improvement that, I think, faded away. Are you at all optimistic about anything changing in that regard, say, in this calendar year, or is that inevitably something that gets pushed over to a new administration or the next administration?\nMR. TIMMONS: I am always an optimist, and on this, I am really optimistic. And the reason I am, David, is because Republicans and Democrats have both indicated--or they have all indicated to me that they're very concerned about the permitting process.\nIf you think about it, again, from the business perspective, where you want to put that shovel in the ground, but it's taking years for a permit to be able to do so, whether that's because of state agencies or federal agencies, and then you have--think about the clean energy investments that the administration is making right now, we simply can't get things built because of the lack of a streamlined permitting process.\nAnd then also think about if we're--if we're talking about our competition with China and China's ability to produce and mine critical minerals for many of those batteries and clean energy technologies that we're trying to employ here in the United States, but our inability to do so here because it takes 15 years to get a mine permitted, 15 years from now, I'm sorry, but China will have the advantage.\nSo we've got to figure out how to make sure that we are protecting safety, we're protecting environmental standards, but moving the process along much more quickly. And I would say also coordinating the various agencies that have to sign off on permits, coordinating their work, so that you have one--you know, one timeline rather than, say, 10 timelines, because you have 10 agencies that are part of the process.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, the unemployment rate remains quite low by historical standards, still plenty of job openings out there. What's the labor market look like for your members? Are they having trouble finding enough workers? And is that going to be a choke point, particularly for some of these projects in the chip world, where I think some of the efforts out in Arizona by TMSC have already run into snags in terms of the availability of skilled labor?\nMR. TIMMONS: Yeah, it is definitely a problem. As I mentioned, we have almost 600,000 jobs open in our sector.\nI'm really proud of our industry, though, because there are, of course, many open jobs throughout the entire economy. I don't know what it is now, eight-, nine-, ten million open jobs. But I'm proud of our industry because they took it head on, and they are continuing to do so. Not only are they upskilling and training the workers that are part of their--part of their employee base now so that those jobs are future-proofed as new technologies come on board, but they've also invested in programs to recruit the next generation of manufacturing workers.\nHere at the NAM, we had a campaign called Creators Wanted, and Creators Wanted went to communities all over the country to inspire young people with a--kind of a hands-on escape room concept to show them what skills are necessary in manufacturing. And, David, you could just see these young people come out beaming and saying, \"I want to be a part of manufacturing. How can I do this?\"\nWe went to my hometown of Circleville, Ohio, for the Circleville Pumpkin Show. We had thousands of kids going through that experience and coming out and saying, \"I want a job,\" and that's really important, because in central Ohio, you have two very big investments. You have the Honda and LG battery facility that's being created in the Mount Sterling area, and then you have the Intel facility that I was happy to attend the groundbreaking of with President Biden in the Columbus area. And those two plants alone are going to hire thousands and thousands of people.\nSo we've got an obligation, right, as the industry to take this on, but making sure that we have the right educational tools in place at the local level and having states work with us, which many are doing to ensure that we have the technical training that's necessary, that's important as well.\nMR. LYNCH: Yep. Well, Jay, I've still got several more questions for you, but unfortunately, we are out of time. So thanks for a great conversation. Jay Timmons, thanks for joining us today.\nMR. TIMMONS: Thanks for having me, David.\nMR. LYNCH: Next up, we'll hear from the President of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Valerie Sheares Ashby, right after this. So please stay with us.\n[Video plays]\nMR. ETZWILER: Hi. I'm David Etzwiler, CEO of the Siemens Foundation. Last fall, the Siemens Foundation created an EV charging workforce initiative called Everyone Charging Forward. Because the electric vehicle charging sector is experiencing rapid growth, there is and will be for the foreseeable future a significant need for workers in EV manufacturing, installation, and maintenance. What we recognized was a confluence of need and opportunity to draw more people from all backgrounds into this growing industry, and that's really what this initiative is all about, working together with our government, business, labor, philanthropy, and community partners to ensure everyone, especially those from underserved communities, has access to resources that can connect them to clean energy careers.\nHere with me today is Cheryl Sanford, director of Workforce Programming, MUST Careers, in Detroit, Michigan, which is developing a career readiness program with a heavy focus on the electrical field.\nHi, Cheryl. How are you?\nMS. SANFORD: I'm doing well, David. Thank you for having the conversation today.\nMR. ETZWILER: Absolutely, my pleasure.\nCheryl, MUST works with the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program, one of the foundation's partners, implementing statewide strategies and local partnerships. Tell us more about EVITP's and MUST's Electric Fast Track program and how it operates.\nMS. SANFORD: Thank you. I'm really excited about this new initiative in partnership with Siemens.\nThe program is really twofold, the purpose of the program is twofold. One is to upskill the current electricians with the EVITP training and certification, and that's for electricians that will be working on the EV charging installation projects going on all over the country.\nThe second part of the program--and this is really something that's new. It's only been piloted in--well, in our experience, we've piloted this program once in Michigan, and that is to provide a work-based learning opportunity for individuals who are thinking maybe they want a career in EV electrical industry but lack that hands-on experience. So this is an opportunity to provide career awareness and some of the hands-on experience that we always hear from our contractors. You know, when we're trying to help individuals make that connection and get into building trades, especially electrical, they lack the hands-on experience. So this is an opportunity to do that with a 10-week paid work experience component that will really take individuals who have had some classroom training and provide them with the kind of work-based learning, hands-on experience. So they'll get to work alongside journeyworker electricians and really decide if this is the best fit for them.\nMR. ETZWILER: Cheryl, that's great background. Help us understand the current demographic makeup of the electrical field and the future of the sector. Why the focus on new entrants?\nMS. SANFORD: Because we know over the foreseeable future that we are going to need more electricians, based on the historic investment in infrastructure in the country, which is fantastic.\nBut we know, for example, in the state of Michigan, that between now and 2030, we will need approximately 13.5 percent increase in electricians. In North Carolina, which is the other area where we will be piloting the program, the demand is expected to increase up to 17 percent.\nMR. ETZWILER: Wow.\nMS. SANFORD: And we know just looking at the demographics, again, in the state of Michigan, when you look at construction overall, less than 6 percent of the construction apprentices are females, approximately 17 percent for people of color, and for youth, it's less than 1 percent. So all of this investment provides a historic opportunity for us to really expand the pipeline of talent and to be more inclusive and diverse and to do it in a very intentional way. So we want to make sure that we are reaching out to those previously underserved populations to make sure that they are included, and the fact is that more and more of the skilled electricians are retiring.\nSo according to the National Electrical Contractors Association, approximately 10,000 electricians--this is nationwide, but 10,000 electricians retire every year. About 7,000 are coming in. So we--you know, we know that there's a gap, and again, that provides an opportunity for programs like the Electric Fast Track to fill that need and to reach out to those individuals who probably never thought they could work in this field. They never even thought about it. So with career exploration outreach, it just gives us an opportunity to be much more inclusive.\nMR. ETZWILER: Yeah. So much urgency in the statistics you give. What are the partnership trends or best practices that you're seeing around the country? What, for example, is necessary and helpful in these types of partnerships in local communities?\nMS. SANFORD: Well, we know from the work that we've done in this space, and MUST and EVITP have worked together for a long time working on providing those kind of programming opportunities for the building trades industry. And what we've learned is that industry engagement is key, and those partnerships are really key to the successful outcomes of this kind of program. So if we don't have industry at the table, then we're just training for the sake of training. We want to make sure that every participant who goes through this program will have a successful outcome, hopefully employment in the industry in a registered apprenticeship, and if by chance they decide after 10 weeks of working in the Electric Fast Track that this just isn't a good fit for you--maybe you've decided, you know, you thought you wanted to be an electrician, but you really don't--we have workforce development partners, community-based partners. And this provides an opportunity for us to redirect them back through the system.\nSo, you know, we don't want it to be a failure for someone because you decided you don't want to work in the construction industry or in the electrical industry. Our goal is to help those individuals find the occupation that is a better fit for them.\nMR. ETZWILER: That's great, Cheryl. That's a wonderful overview of all of that.\nAnd if I had to underline one takeaway from today's discussion, it's the importance of business, labor, and communities coming together to engage and support new and diverse entrants in the clean economy workforce. It's the right thing to do, and it's imperative to the success of our country's decarbonization, economic, and security goals. We simply must ensure participation by everyone in our economy.\nCheryl, thank you for being here today and for the insightful conversation. I look forward to our continued partnership, and with that, I'll turn it back to the Washington Post.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nMS.

Lynch, global economics correspondent here at The Post.\nI'm joined now by Valerie Sheares Ashby, president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Valerie, welcome to Washington Post Live.\nDR. ASHBY: Thank you so much. It's a pleasure to be here.\nMR. LYNCH: Well, we're glad to have you with us.\nNow, for any of our viewers who may not be familiar with UMBC and its historical role, its traditional role as an enormous pipeline of Black graduates in the STEM fields, perhaps you could just take a moment and educate us all. In particular, what was the opportunity that attracted you to the school a couple of years ago, and how do you plan to build on its already impressive legacy?\nDR. ASHBY: Well, I so appreciate that question. This is the question that energizes me daily.\nSo I'm really proud of UMBC. So for those who may not be familiar, UMBC is located in this Baltimore County area, which is very close to Washington, D.C., obviously, and so we are situated in a place where we have industry around us, we have government agencies around us, where the STEM workforce that they need is just tremendous. And we're also situated, obviously, in the state of Maryland that is very diverse, and so we are a public institution. It is our job to actually educate the Marylanders first and provide this workforce that is needed, and UMBC has been a leader for decades in this space.\nWe produce--we're number one in the production of Black undergraduates in the fields of the life sciences, mathematics, and computer science combined. That's quite a feat for us. And we produce these students, and they go on to do amazing things, not only in the state of Maryland but all over the country.\nWe're also the number one producer of Black graduates who go on to get MD-PhDs. So now they are scholar researchers in medicine, and so we're really proud of that. That has been our history.\nAnd I would just note that the goal is just to produce excellent scholars, and it turns out that when you actually have a goal of producing excellent scholars, you become more inclusive.\nAnd so for UMBC, part of what we say in our vision statement, in the very first sentence, is that we are not going to call ourselves excellent if we're not inclusive, and so that really then has been the impetus for everything that we do for years. And so we have now achieved this status, and it has become a part of our culture that we just expect all of our students to be excellent. And underrepresented minority students, in particular, are just thriving in this environment.\nAnd by the way, that's what drew me here. I am a chemist by training, as you know. So to come to an institution with this history and at this moment for our country, we really need to continue to do what we're doing, and we not only need us to do it, but we need all of higher education to really take this on as a priority.\nMR. LYNCH: Well, first of all, I promise not to ask you any questions about chemistry. That would be a\nshort conversation, at least on this side of the camera.\nDR. ASHBY: [Laughs] If I had a blackboard, I'd draw some organic chemistry formulas behind me, but, okay, not this time.\n[Laughter]\nMR. LYNCH: Not this time.\nSo Black students, in general, of course, are underrepresented in the sciences but not at your institution. So what's your secret? What should other universities be doing that they're not doing if they wanted to replicate your success?\nDR. ASHBY: So, you know, we can look back and really understand and learn, you know, some best practices that aren't rocket science, which that's the good news. It's not rocket science. Literally, anybody who has the desire can do this.\nAnd so what we have learned, mostly as a start from our Meyerhoff Scholars Program, which is nationally known, is that if you give students the opportunity, you give them the support, you give them a cohort, you give them the encouragement, you give them the opportunity to do research and to see themselves as scientists, then you really have given them everything that they need. And those students become successful. They get the highest grades in our courses. They go on to do internships and great research, and they go on to get PhDs and MDs and MD-PhDs. And so it's about this culture where our expectation is that our students will be successful, and so it is not about remedial anything. They're quite capable. The question is, are we giving them all the opportunities and the support in order to be successful in these disciplines? So that's the way we have approached this.\nMR. LYNCH: Let's talk a little bit about national policy now. I don't know if you caught our earlier segment, but we were talking a little bit about the Biden administration's industrial policies, particularly in the area of semiconductors, clean renewable energies, and the like. What's your assessment of the outlook for producing the size, skilled workforce that we're going to need to make those programs a success, and do you see that--those areas as an opportunity for your future graduates?\nDR. ASHBY: Without a doubt. These are the areas that we are training our students. It is the basic sciences. It is engineering. It's the social sciences. It's the fullness of the liberal arts education that's rooted in STEM. So absolutely, our students are qualified now and will be qualified for emerging technologies.\nThe other piece to this is that we are very clear about giving our students--I heard in a previous--in the previous segment--hands-on opportunities as a part of that preparation.\nSo for example, you were talking to Jay, who was mentioning about--talking about manufacturing. There, we have real digitized manufacturing facilities on this campus where students can now understand cybersecurity threats in relationship to digitized manufacturing, and not only that, we are upscaling those who are actually in the manufacturing fields, where these are professionals who come onto our campus. And they are allowed to now--they can upscale and really understand the connection between cybersecurity and manufacturing. And so it's a combination of tools that we are using to prepare our students, and we absolutely have students that are so well prepared. And the question is, how many more can we produce?\nMR. LYNCH: Now, artificial intelligence is obviously a topic that everyone in business and government and your neighborhood is talking about these days, and there seem to be broadly two views of it in a labor market context. Mark Cuban, I saw, quoted the other day, saying that the disruption we're going to experience in the next several years will dwarf anything we've seen in past technological changes.\nAt the same time, David Autor of MIT, who's a very well-known economist who popularized the term \"China shock\" in regard to the effect on unskilled labor in this country from the rise of China's manufacturing power, he's actually quite optimistic about the effects of AI. He says it may, in fact, revitalize the middle class. I'm curious what your view is, as someone who's in the field. Should we be worried about this from a labor market standpoint, or is it mostly upside?\nDR. ASHBY: So I would have to say to you, first of all, that I am an optimist, and as a scientist, new technology does not scare me. And I understand all of the downsides and the possibilities for people who--look, anytime you have new technology, people can use it for bad or they can use it for good, and so it's our job to actually train our students in order--so that they will be able to use the technologies for good. So it does not scare me.\nAnd also, I should just mention that not everybody needs a college degree. Let me just say that. So when we talk about the workforce that's going to be needed, it's going to be a number of college-educated students. It's going to be a number of students who have advanced degrees. But it's also going to be people who are going to community colleges or people who have high school diplomas who just have the skill set.\nSo we have an opportunity to have an impact on the education from high school all the way through an advanced terminal degree, and so with that kind of optimism, I'm confident that we can upscale a workforce that is broad. And also, by the way, I should mention this is why universities that educate their students in a liberal arts fashion are so important, because we will not only teach our students the science, but we will teach them the ethics. And that's critical for what we are talking about whether you--and by the way, we need to do that in high school and middle school and every other place. But that's why I am optimistic.\nI see our students. They are brilliant. They want to use this technology for good, and that gives me hope every day.\nMR. LYNCH: I think that last remark about liberal arts deserves a moment, because I think some people see a sharp choice between what they regard as meaningful, career-focused endeavors like the STEM fields, and then liberal arts, which is regarded as some sort of playground of listening to music and going to plays. But it's really much more than that, isn't it? It's about learning how to think and learning where ideas come from and learning the history even of scientific thought.\nDR. ASHBY: Yes, without a doubt. And so this is a place where we are not delivering a full education, if it is not a full liberal arts and sciences education. It is all of those disciplines that you just mentioned.\nBut just think about any of these scientific fields, and think about how you are going to apply that in a community where you don't understand their history. You don't understand the challenges. You don't understand the environment. You don't understand the culture. So we can produce all sorts of wonderful technologies, but communities may not adopt them or they may not trust our science if we don't understand how to enter communities and how to engage them as a part of the scientific process. So this is really important.\nAnd let me just throw in a little bit of data, because I know sometimes people say, oh, anecdotally, people love a liberal arts education. Ninety-two percent of my undergraduates walk out of this institution either going into employment or into graduate school, and 93 percent of them, of my undergraduates who have--with a college degree finished their four-year degree, are in disciplines that they studied. And so I just, you know--the talk about a liberal arts education and music and art and all those things and that's all you do--and let me just also say, I think it's a little bit of a matter of the mental health and well-being of our entire world.\nPeople need a whole life, and a whole life includes music and art and understanding religion and culture and the environment, all of those things, and there's something that happens in communities when people are happy. And so when you just think about just the ways that we don't even know how to have conversations with each other anymore, not just about STEM-related issues, but about anything--so I'm a real fan of a liberal arts and sciences education. I am a chemist, but I treasure my religion class and my philosophy class and my writing course and my communications courses. So it's a full package.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, UMBC obviously remains quite affordable, but colleges across the country are under pressure, deservedly so, for rising costs. There's a lot of frustration about tuition bills, and you hear a lot of voices saying, you know, with it being just so expensive, you know, college just isn't worth it anymore. What would you say to those folks, even acknowledging that, you know, college is not necessarily for everybody? But what do you say to folks who say it's just gotten way out of hand how expensive it is?\nDR. ASHBY: So several things. So first, let me say I am delighted to be in the University System of Maryland, which is a public system in the state of Maryland, and our costs in public higher education in the state of Maryland are, you know, relatively reasonable compared to many other institutions across the country.\nThat being said, there literally is not a single other game changer in a person's life that's more significant than a college education. It changes our health. It changes our communities. It changes our service. It changes the way we engage the political system. It changes everything that makes a life full.\nAnd for people particularly who come from economically challenged backgrounds, there is no greater game changer than a college degree, and so this is critical for us to state.\nNow, I do appreciate all of the talk about how expensive it is. Indeed, it can be. Even at our reasonable cost, it can seem expensive. Therefore, it's incumbent upon us to actually make it more accessible. So whether that's through increased need-based financial aid or various types of scholarships, it is important for us to make it available to students. It changes their lives. It changes their families' lives for generations. It changes communities. But it's our job in higher education to make our case and so to really help families understand the difference maker that this is.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, the Supreme Court last year severely limited the use of affirmative action and race in college admissions. How are universities adjusting to this change? How worried are you that that's going to be a further headwind working against efforts to increase minority representation in the STEM fields in particular?\nDR. ASHBY: So let me speak just about UMBC, and then maybe I can speak about it more broadly. I'm really proud. I go back to your original question of why I decided to come to UMBC and what drew me here.\nThis is an institution that, again, has understood that if you are not inclusive, you cannot be excellent. So when you think about STEM fields where we're talking about innovation and creativity, you need diverse teams of people from diverse backgrounds, diverse disciplines. All of that is necessary to be as creative and innovative as possible, and so for UMBC, this is not a challenge for us because we are simply looking for excellence. And by doing so, we are actually very inclusive, and so we have a campus that looks like our community, which is a beautiful thing.\nAnd so for me, this is just rooted in excellence. If we don't have multiple perspectives at the table and in the creation process and in the problem-solving process and the solution-making process, then we cannot be excellent.\nSo for us, it is not a challenge. If you walk across our campus, it looks like our community. It looks like the world, and because of that, students are getting a phenomenal education.\nNow, if you were actually using quotas to just check the box, to say that we have some diversity on our campus, you have a problem, because now you have to decide how serious are you about that, and do you really think you can be excellent without it?\nNow, that's--I'm glad that's not our question. It is not. But for universities and maybe some other institutions where it wasn't a priority, because you didn't really believe that excellence equaled diversity or diversity equaled excellence, now this is a challenge.\nAnd so I would say that my students who sit in a classroom, whether it's in the social sciences or humanities or natural sciences and they sit in that classroom with a diverse group of students to discuss hard, challenging topics, they are receiving a world-class education. And so it's a challenge for us in higher education to decide, do we really believe you can be excellent without diversity or not? And at UMBC, that's not our question.\nMR. LYNCH: Well, I think that's a great place to end on. Valerie Sheares Ashby, thanks so much for joining us today on Washington Post Live.\nDR. ASHBY: It's been my pleasure. Thank you so much.\nMR.

            "summary": "TOPEKA, Kan. — State universities in Kansas would be banned from requiring prospective students, potential hires and staffers seeking promotion to disclose their views on diversity initiatives under a policy change being considered by the state's higher education board.\nThe Kansas Board of Regents was set to discuss the policy change during a meeting Wednesday at Fort Hays University. The proposal would revise policy language that currently emphasizes 'multiculturism and diversity' on campus and replace it with language barring universities from requiring statements 'pledging allegiance to, support for or opposition to' diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in applications for admission, hiring or promotion — without setting any penalties for violations.\nThe proposed change comes as the state's Democratic governor faces pressure to enshrine the anti-DEI policy in law following Republicans' approval of a bill in the Legislature that would put the same policy into state law. That bill allows a fine of up to $10,000 for a violation and includes provisions in the next state budget to withhold nearly $36 million from the state universities unless they publicly confirm that they don't have such requirements. Gov. Laura Kelly has until Friday to act on the bill and until April 25 to act on the budget provisions.\nAdvertisement\n'I don't think we ever would have had a state law if this was their policy at the outset,' Republican state Sen. J.R. Claeys, the author of the budget provisions, said ahead of Wednesday's board discussion.\nRepublicans in at least 20 states have sought to limit DEI initiatives, arguing that they are discriminatory and enforce a liberal political orthodoxy. Alabama and Utah enacted new anti-DEI laws this year, and a ban enacted in Texas last year has led to more than 100 job cuts on University of Texas campuses.\nClaeys, who is also an adviser to GOP state Attorney General Kris Kobach, another DEI critic, said a new regents policy is a positive step because it ensures that all of the universities are following the same guidelines.\nBut, he added, 'I wouldn't expect them to enact any enforcement on themselves.'\nAdvertisement\nOthers say that such policies reflect 'a gross misrepresentation' of the purpose behind DEI statements from applicants.\n'The intended purpose is to provide an opportunity for prospective employees to reflect on their experiences and how those experiences complement the mission and values of an institution to support a diverse campus community,' said Paulette Granberry Russell, president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Educations, in an email statement.\nIt's unclear how widespread required DEI-related statements on applications are, but GOP lawmakers have said they are responding to complaints and applications they'd seen online. Granberry Russell said she was unaware of any university expecting students, job applicants or employees to actually 'pledge allegiance to diversity.'\nAdvertisement\nA legislative audit released in February said that just 1.6% of spending by Kansas' six state universities — $45 million — went to DEI initiatives but noted that each university defined DEI differently. Besides initiatives traditionally seen as DEI, such as training and recruiting, resources included food pantries for poor students and services for military veterans and disabled students.\nKelly told reporters after a Tuesday event that she has not had time to review the anti-DEI bill. While the bill specifically mentions diversity, equity and inclusion, it also says universities cannot require a statement about 'any political ideology or movement.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nLast year, Kelly used her power under the state constitution to veto individual budget provisions to scuttle anti-DEI provisions in the current budget, and GOP lawmakers did not have the two-thirds majorities necessary in both chambers to override her actions.\nAdvertisement\nBut Kelly also signed legislation last year that bars Kansas officials from using environmental, social and governance factors in investing public funds or deciding who receives government contracts.",

His debut novel, ' Next Stop ,' will be published in September.\nBenjamin Resnick is the rabbi of the Pelham Jewish Center in New York. His debut novel, 'Next Stop,' will be published in September. Every year, one of the highlights of my family's Passover Seder is when we all whip one another with green onions. It's a custom that originated in the historical Jewish communities of Persia and Afghanistan, and it's fun — a gentle way to remind ourselves of the lashes from ancient persecution. Until fairly recently I had never experienced it as anything other than a playful diversion.\nBut last spring something changed. As usual, we armed ourselves with scallions, and when it was time I cheerfully told my boys, 5 and 8, that they could hit each other. Like the other adults, our 8-year-old was alive to the ritualized aspect, and he gently flicked that scallion at our 5-year-old. His little brother, though, eyes full of mischief, reared back, whacked him as hard as he could and laughed. And then our 8-year-old cried.\nAdvertisement\nI have thought about this episode more than once over the past year. My children probably don't remember it. But for me, it looms large. And, in a fashion that feels almost mythic, it represents so many archetypal aspects of a Jewish childhood, or perhaps any childhood: the jokes that are not entirely jokes, the rigors of brotherhood, the specter of violence that is present even in our most precious and comforting stories.\nThe Seder is my favorite moment of the Jewish year. Part philosophical symposium, part feast, part story slam, part singalong, the Seder, at its best, is thrillingly evocative, a conversation that is haunted by the past and illuminated by the promise of a future.\nFor all of its complexity — the frightening narrative, the strange hermeneutics, the nagging hunger — it is also the most child-centered event on the Jewish calendar and, for this reason, it is arguably the most important. Nearly every aspect of the Seder, as conceived by the ancient rabbis, is meant to arouse children's curiosity and stimulate inquiry — the silly songs, the ritual foods (yes, kids, you must eat the horseradish), the hidden matzoh, the tradition that compels the youngest child to ask the scripted questions.\nmust eat the horseradish), the hidden matzoh, the tradition that compels the youngest child to ask the scripted questions.\nAdvertisement\nAll of this is meant to keep the kids awake and engaged and, in turn, to offer the grown-ups in their lives an opportunity to tell the most important Jewish story, the one that will simultaneously liberate and ensnare them and, in the end, let them know who they are. They are slaves, but one day they will be free. They are safe, but one day they won't be, and then they will be again.\nMore profound than scallions — and more urgent as we prepare for the first Seder in the long shadow of Oct. 7 — is one of the core statements in the Haggadah, the book used as an aid in telling the story of the Exodus: 'This is the promise — not only once did they arise to destroy us, rather in every generation they rise to destroy us. But the Holy One Blessed Be He will save us from their hands.' In every generation, indeed.\nI spend a lot of time worrying about how to help my children make sense of — and find their place in — a world that is complicated and often hostile. The world is not only hostile, of course. It is also beautiful and sometimes very kind. But for Jews it is hostile to us enough of the time that its hostility has become, over the past few millennia, a structural aspect of how we move through our lives and how we talk to our children. Ancient and protean, antisemitism is a dark thread woven into our every experience.\nonly hostile, of course. It is also beautiful and sometimes very kind. But for Jews it is hostile to us enough of the time that its hostility has become, over the past few millennia, a structural aspect of how we move through our lives and how we talk to our children. Ancient and protean, antisemitism is a dark thread woven into our every experience.\nAdvertisement\nIn confronting this, I am beset by dueling impulses. On the one hand I never want my children to be frightened. But when I think about sharing our most cherished stories with them, I (like my ancient colleagues who created the Haggadah) find myself telling them that we are hunted, perhaps not at every time and every place, but ultimately for all time and in all places. I tell them this because they will learn it one way or another and because, all else being equal, I'd rather they hear it from me.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare",

            "summary": "A strongman doesn't simply spring to power, but is elevated by the forces of his time. The rise of Vladimir Putin, from a deputy mayor who still drives his parents' car to de facto Russian dictator, is the most salient narrative thread in 'Patriots,' which opens on Broadway on Monday night. But the drama onstage at the Barrymore Theatre targets a less notorious figure: the blustering oligarch who plucked Putin from obscurity.\nWritten by royal-family annalist and 'The Crown' creator Peter Morgan, 'Patriots' tackles territory less familiar to audiences stateside or in London, where this production premiered at the Almeida Theater in 2022. 'In the West you have no idea,' Boris Berezovsky (Michael Stuhlbarg) says at the outset, as Morgan throws down his own gauntlet.\nIt proves tough territory to conquer, despite the Sturm und Drang of this staging by Almeida artistic director Rupert Goold (Netflix, a co-producer on the show, is reportedly developing a screen adaptation). Morgan's choice to focus on Berezovsky, a pivotal figure in shaping post-Soviet Russia (and installing its authoritarian leader), is a promising one. But 'Patriots' suffers from a slipperiness of both focus and scale, dramatizing historical incidents and backroom deals while only thinly sketching the characters behind them.\nAdvertisement\nSkip to end of carousel\nThe Style section\nThe Style section Style is where The Washington Post covers happenings on the front lines of culture and what it all means, including the arts, media, social trends, politics and yes, fashion, all told with personality and deep reporting. For more Style stories, click here\nEnd of carousel\nBerezovsky's motivation, at least, is clear. Fielding a flurry of calls from behind a desk (no to his teenage daughter, yes to his mistress), he tells an associate, 'It's always good to be rich.' On a raised platform encircled by a mottled and underlit red-brick wall (the set is by Miriam Buether and lighting by Jack Knowles), the pugnacious businessman looks like a mad scientist concocting new ways to make money.\nIn amber-lit flashbacks to Berezovsky as a young math prodigy, he tells his professor (Ronald Guttman) that he wants to win the Nobel Prize for the sake of a million dollars and gloating rights. Berezovsky's abandoned ambition is another tip-off that he's going to become a very greedy man who makes very big mistakes.\nStuhlbarg gives Berezovsky a stormy and gesticulating wittiness, but there is little more than pure avarice behind his actions — from striking a deal with ascendant oil mogul Roman Abramovich (Luke Thallon) to selecting an in-pocket replacement for Boris Yeltsin (Paul Kynman). Berezovsky's allegiance to democracy is entirely bound to his capitalist exploits, so an eventual fallout with his protégé on principle is tough to swallow.\nPutin, played with bone-chilling reserve by Will Keen, is clearly the most intriguing person onstage and the play's reason for being. 'Patriots' is most gripping when it delivers brief, often wordless, glimpses at the inner workings of a burgeoning mastermind: Watch Keen widen his stance to find the 5-foot-7 leader's signature bullish posture. Notice his right hand twitching like a lit fuse while the rest of body stands stiff as dynamite. Keen's quietly magnificent performance has the bottled intensity of a homemade bomb, and the show feels less dangerous in his absence.\nAdvertisement\nHis drastic devolution into a despot from an anti-corruption liberal is kept offstage and described secondhand (Thallon's Abramovich is almost exclusively saddled with factual exposition). We see that Putin learned to control the media from Berezovsky, and watch him destroy his maker at his own game (with help from wall-to-wall projection design by Ash J Woodward). But the play too often keeps its most compelling character at bay, instead scattering its attention among men whose fates are intertwined — including former FSB officer turned Berezovsky protector Alexander Litvinenko (Alex Hurt) — but whose characters are unevenly developed.\nUnlike Morgan's previous political plays, 'The Audience,' about the queen meeting with a succession of prime ministers, and 'Frost/Nixon,' about televised interviews between the two, 'Patriots' lacks a taut organizing principle. It also has a lot of contextual information to relay (broad declarations that begin with 'the West' and 'the Russian people' are frequent refrains), yet could still include more. The steady march of history, and flashy transitions between scenes (aided by sound designer and composer Adam Cork) lend the play its forward motion, rather than investment in its characters or their fates.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nSome may already know about Berezovsky's flight to asylum in the United Kingdom, where he sued Abramovich for billions (and lost), his associate Litvinenko was poisoned and Berezovsky himself died in disputed circumstances. The lone survivor among them, in 'Patriots' as in the present, remains inscrutably remote.",

            "summary": "StarSolid StarSolid StarOutline StarOutline ( 2 stars )\nStarSolid StarSolid StarOutline StarOutline ( 2 stars )\nAs much as Guy Ritchie's uber-violent, stakes-free, World War II action comedy caper 'The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare' milks its 'based on a true story' bona fides, it's more akin to the last decade's glut of slick, cool-guy popcorn pictures (including his own) than any meaningful retelling of real heroism.\nIts contemporary ties don't stop Ritchie (the man who brought us 'Sherlock Holmes,' 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.' and 'The Gentlemen') from aping famous bits from much better, more serious classic war films. Like the sequence on a fishing trawler straight out of 'The Guns of Navarone' that opens this liberally fictionalized account of a covert 1942 mission. Dubbed Operation Postmaster, its goal was to take down a German supply ship full of U-boat carbon dioxide filters, which would factor into a crucial turning point in the war.\nTo turbocharge the bro-historic intrigue and get the astronomical body count going in this shoot-'em-up grand theft aquatic, Ritchie must first assemble a ragtag squad of lethal (and lethally photogenic) heroes so rascally you know they'll get the bloody job done. You see, Hitler is marching across Europe, Britain's in a bind, and Winston Churchill (Rory Kinnear, beneath a mountain of prostheses) is desperate enough to clandestinely okay a deniable, off-the-books mission. Luckily, Brigadier Gubbins (Cary Elwes), head of the secret Special Operations Executive (SEO) org, knows just the rakish rule breaker for the job.\nAdvertisement\nEnter Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill), leader of a team of ruthless killers willing to play dirty to disrupt Nazi business off the African coast. His squad is Anders Lassen (Alan Ritchson), a Danish hulk with an exaggerated lilt and astounding archery skills; Freddy Alvarez (Henry Golding), a frogman with a talent for explosives; Geoffrey Appleyard (Alex Pettyfer), a master strategist; and cunning young Irish sailor Henry Hayes (Hero Fiennes Tiffin).\nThey're not in it alone. Already in place on the Spanish island of Fernando Po, where the Germans have set up shop in neutral territory, are SOE agent-slash-actress Marjorie Stewart (Eiza González, who holds her own, if not always her British accent), tasked with seducing a sadistic Nazi officer (Til Schweiger), and suave undercover fixer Richard Heron (Babs Olusanmokun), whose popular casino bar serves as such an unsubtle nod to 'Casablanca' that a character drops one of Humphrey Bogart's most iconic quotes while sitting in his cafe.\nOff in their own glam spycraft 'n' subterfuge romp for half the film, they're two of the more interesting figures in an overstuffed ensemble that includes Eton-educated West African prince Kambili Kalu (an excellent Danny Sapani), who lends his resources 'because the Nazis are gauche,' and young wartime secretary Ian Fleming (Freddie Fox), who must have gotten plenty of 007 inspiration from his wartime stint.\nAdvertisement\nShot on location in Turkey and Britain, the film's handsome production design is undone by its dull photographic patina. Costume designer Loulou Bontemps's standout achievement is a stunning replica of Claudette Colbert's 1934 'Cleopatra' cutaway gown that Stewart wields like a weapon. Christopher Benstead's score goes from whistling spaghetti Western motifs to jazzy percussives. Yet the plot breezes on with flimsy banter and bloodshed to go along with scant character development.\nAdapted from Damien Lewis's 2014 book 'Churchill's Secret Warriors: The Explosive True Story of the Special Forces Desperadoes of WWII,' the screenplay by Paul Tamasy, Eric Johnson, Arash Amel and Ritchie is oddly weightless given that its real-life commandos, heralded as precursors to the British Special Air Service (SAS) and modern black ops warfare, died in combat before war's end.\nIf you come, come for Cavill sniping Nazis by the hundreds with manic deadpan abandon, and stay for Ritchson looking like he stepped out of a Gold's Gym to destroy hordes of German hostiles with a bow and arrow. Then dive into the real history of the SOE, whose men and women could fill dozens more fascinating spy films without blunting the edges of history with fizzy bromantic antics.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare",

That's because a federal court this month granted the government a one-year extension to continue intelligence collection.\nSection 702 requires the government to seek approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for the categories of intelligence it wants to collect. The court has issued 'certifications' for collection involving international terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and foreign governments and related entities. Those certifications are good for one year and were renewed this month at the government's request.\nU.S. officials have long argued that the law is a vital means of collecting the electronic communications on foreign government adversaries and terrorist groups. But its renewal has become an unusually divisive flash point, aligning conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats who are wary of granting the government broad surveillance authorities without new restrictions.\nAdvertisement\nThe people familiar with the efforts to keep the companies in compliance declined to name them, but they said their loss would deal a significant blow to U.S. intelligence collection.\n'It's super concerning,' said one U.S. official of the potential loss of intelligence. 'You can't just flip a switch and turn it back on again.'\nU.S. officials began to hear Friday afternoon that the providers were planning to stop compliance unless Section 702 was reauthorized.\nSenators are attempting to come to an eleventh-hour agreement on amendments on the legislation Friday night to quickly reauthorize the measure and avoid any lapse. Last week, the House renewed Section 702, but only for two years — and only after privacy hawks failed to pass an amendment that would have required U.S. intelligence agencies to obtain a warrant to review Americans' communications collected under the program. That bid failed in a dramatic 212-212 tie vote.\nagencies to obtain a warrant to review Americans' communications collected under the program. That bid failed in a dramatic 212-212 tie vote.\nAdvertisement\nThe House approval came despite former president Donald Trump's entreaty on social media to 'KILL' the bill, in part due to the spurious charge that the federal surveillance power had been used to spy on his 2016 campaign.\nthe spurious charge that the federal surveillance power had been used to spy on his 2016 campaign.\nFirst passed in 2008 and reauthorized several times since then, the law enables the NSA to collect without a warrant from U.S. tech companies and communications providers the online traffic of non-Americans located overseas for foreign intelligence purposes. Communications to or from foreign targets deemed relevant to FBI national security investigations — about 3 percent of the targets, according to the government — are shared with the bureau. But the law is controversial because some of those communications may involve exchanges with Americans, which the FBI may view without a warrant.\n'The House bill represents the biggest expansion of surveillance in 15 years since Section 702 was originally created, and a shameful Congress would be expanding surveillance at a time when reforms are needed,' said Jake Laperruque, deputy director of the Center for Democracy and Technology's Security and Surveillance Project.\nAdvertisement\nU.S. security officials, for their part, for years have extolled the benefits of the law, with White House officials saying that the intelligence collected accounts for more than 60 percent of the president's daily briefing.

            "summary": "LONDON — During her 49 days as Britain's shortest-serving prime minister, Liz Truss sparked mayhem on the financial markets and turmoil within her Conservative Party.\nNow she is speaking up, and her message is: It wasn't me.\nIn interviews and a new book, Truss robustly defends her economic record, blaming the 'deep state,' 'technocrats,' 'the establishment,' civil servants and the Bank of England for her downfall.\n'I'm not saying I'm perfect,' Truss told the BBC. But, she added, 'I'm frankly not going to let them get off the hook.'\nTraditionally, former British prime ministers keep quiet for an extended period after leaving office. Not Truss. In her grandly titled tome 'Ten Years to Save the West' — which is being released on Tuesday — the former prime minister defends her actions, excoriates her many critics and offers her prescription for a better world.\nAdvertisement\nHer ideas include abolishing the United Nations and backing Donald Trump for reelection — a departure from the convention that senior British politicians stay out of U.S. elections.\n'I believe that we need a strong America,' Truss told the BBC, adding that 'the world was safer' when Trump was president.\n'I think that our opponents feared the Trump presidency more than they fear the Democrats being in office,' she said.\nTim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said Truss' media onslaught 'confirms her transformation into a radical right-wing populist.'\nTruss became prime minister in September 2022 when she was elected by the governing Conservative Party to replace Boris Johnson after he was toppled by scandals.\nHer promise to spur economic growth with tax cuts and deregulation enthused Tory members, but a budget containing 45 billion pounds ($54 billion) in unfunded tax cuts rocked the financial markets, drove up the cost of government borrowing and sent the pound to its lowest-ever level against the dollar.\nAdvertisement\nThe Bank of England had to step in to prop up the bond market and prevent a wider economic meltdown. Millions of people still have higher mortgage payments because of the soaring interest rates.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nA tabloid newspaper set up a live camera on a head of lettuce and a photo of Truss and asked which would last longer. The salad leaf won, and the nickname 'Lettuce Liz' was born.\nIn October 2022, Truss resigned and was replaced by Rishi Sunak, the rival she'd defeated just a couple of months earlier.\nTruss has found plenty of other people to blame. She said that the central bank had kept interest rates too low, while the Office for Budget Responsibility — which provides the government with economic forecasts — had failed to warn her that British pension funds were heavily exposed to interest-rate fluctuations.\nAdvertisement\nShe is calling for the OBR to be abolished and for Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey to resign.\nOpposition parties are incredulous — though also quietly pleased that Truss has popped up to remind voters of the mayhem the Conservative Party has presided over. A national election is due to be held later this year.\n'Liz Truss blaming others for the economic chaos she caused will just add insult to injury for families suffering from soaring mortgage costs,' said Liberal Democrat economy spokeswoman Sarah Olney.\nGiven ample airtime this week to expound on her political views, Truss has railed against 'extremist environmentalist dogma and wokeism' and said Britain's institutions 'have been captured by leftist ideas.'\nHer targets include judges who have disagreed with government decisions. Truss wants to abolish the U.K.'s Supreme Court and let the government appoint the judiciary.\nAdvertisement\nShe's also called for the abolition of Britain's Human Rights Act and urged the United Kingdom to leave the European Convention on Human Rights. She also wants to ax the U.N, whose security council, she told the BBC, is 'positively damaging.'\nBale, author of 'The Conservative Party After Brexit: Turmoil and Transformation,' said Truss is 'a human hand grenade at the moment that the Conservative Party can't seem to bury or defuse.'\nTruss, 48, remains a lawmaker, and plans to run for reelection. She has a good chance of holding on to her seat, even if the Conservatives are defeated nationwide, as polls suggest they will.\nShe does not rule out running for the party leadership again.",

'Hello, Exodus students,' she said, addressing the group of 90 fifth- through 12th-graders who would eventually watch the video as part of their lessons from the Exodus Institute, an online Christian K-12 school Kali and her husband founded in 2021 with the motto 'Exit Public Education.' The video, which Kali was recording in her guest bedroom-turned-office, was the latest in a special enrichment program dubbed the 'Young Patriots Academy,' which aims to 'debunk the ‘woke' lies taught in most public schools,' per the Exodus website.\nAdvertisement\nKali, who is half Black and half White, had a particular target that Friday: what she calls the left's unquestioning advocacy of reparations, the theory that the government should pay restitution to descendants of enslaved Americans.\nShe told her virtual class they were about to learn of the Quakers, and how White members of that religion helped fight slavery. She said that, throughout American history, there were good people and bad people. But focusing only on the bad, like she believes many public school teachers do, would be wrong.\n'Whenever you learn history,' she said, 'it's important to learn the full context of it.'\nKali Fontanilla leads 'Young Patriots Academy,' a program that aims to counter 'left-wing indoctrination' and the 'lies taught in most public schools.\" (Video: TWP)\nKali's online job marked a sharp departure from the years she and her husband, Joshua Fontanilla, spent teaching middle- and high school English in California's deep-blue Salinas district. The couple quit their jobs a year after the coronavirus pandemic began, disillusioned by school shutdowns and displeased by some colleagues' embrace of the Black Lives Matter movement, which both thought was wrongheaded and hateful for what they saw as its anti-police stance.\nKali, 41, and Joshua, who is 42 and of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent, had also grown convinced their school was teaching harmful ideas about race and history, including what they believe is the false theory America is systemically racist. Across the nation, mostly conservative mothers and fathers were raising similar alarms — anxiety that soon fueled an explosion of legislation restricting how educators can teach about race, sex and gender.\nBy April 2024, such laws had spread to affect half the nation's students. The claim that public schools teach left-wing 'indoctrination, not education' had become a commonplace on the right, repeated by parents, politicians and pundits.\nBut not, usually, by teachers. And that's why the Fontanillas felt compelled to act: They came direct from the classroom. They had seen firsthand what was happening. Now, they wanted to expose the propaganda they felt had infiltrated public schools — and offer families an alternative.\nIn 2021, eager to fulfill their mission, the couple moved to Florida to found their own Christian school in a state which, under Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), had become a haven for people with views like theirs. In the years since, they have grown their school to nearly 200 students, partly through Kali's appearances on conservative media like Fox News — but mostly through her social media.\nKali's Instagram videos, filled with right-wing rhetoric and delivered almost daily to her 333,000 followers, proved a powerful recruiting tool. But they also spurred thousands of critical messages from online observers who contended she was indoctrinating students into a skewed, conservative worldview. 'RACIST, ONE SIDED, WHITEWASHED OPINION,' one wrote on a recent post, just above someone else who declared: 'No one [is] impressed by the trash you are trying to sell.'\nNow, half an hour into her lesson on slavery, Kali told students how some Quakers risked prison time to assist people fleeing enslavement.\n'There are certain people that are saying, ‘oh, White people owe Black people for slavery,'' Kali said. 'But what about the White people who were descendants of the Quakers, who actually had a lot of negative consequences that happened to them for helping free the slaves?'\nShe urged her students to keep pondering the question as they turned to their next assignment.\nK ali was a few years into studying for her master's degree in education at the University of California at Santa Cruz when, she recalled, a professor told her class to take a 'privilege walk.'\nKali was a few years into studying for her master's degree in education at the University of California at Santa Cruz when, she recalled, a professor told her class to take a 'privilege walk.'\nHe formed the students into a line, Kali said, and asked a series of questions: Have you ever seen a play? What about a concert? Students stepped forward if the answer was 'yes,' backward if the answer was 'no.'\nKali hated it. Although she came from a challenging background — her Jamaican father left her White mother early on, she said, and the family was always strapped for money — she wound up standing ahead of wealthier White classmates because her grandmother had insisted she be exposed to the arts. And she couldn't believe the professor didn't ask about sexual abuse. 'Even if you are the richest young person, White, whatever, if you've been sexually abused, that's the worst trauma you could ever receive,' Kali said.\nA spokesman for UC Santa Cruz confirmed Kali attended the school, but said he could not 'easily verify anything beyond that.'\nYears later, teaching English in Salinas, she was horrified when she saw other teachers giving students a 'privilege quiz' during a ninth-grade ethnic studies class. (The course became a statewide requirement a year later.) Curious and worried, Kali looked up the ethnic studies lesson plans in the school's internal systems and found evidence some colleagues were using the class to introduce students to 'critical race theory,' a college-level academic framework that holds racism is baked into American institutions. Kali had encountered the theory in graduate school — and loathed it, fearing it would convert students into victims who lay blame on racist systems rather than accept any individual responsibility.\nAdvertisement\nIn the ethnic studies class, teachers were urging students to study school policies 'through a Critical Race Theory framework,' according to screenshots of a presentation that Kali shared with The Washington Post, meaning they should analyze how 'race affects our experiences.' Students were told to take three 'Steps Against Hegemony,' per the power point: 'Analyze ‘hidden curriculum.'' 'Use Critical Race Theory.' 'Be Active participants.'\nAsked about the ethnic studies course, district officials wrote in a statement that 'embedded in the lesson outcomes was the question for students to analyze whether or not race may be viewed as a contributor to one's experiences.' The district surveyed students who completed the class in 2022, officials wrote, and their 'feedback was overwhelmingly positive.'\nAround the same time, Joshua Fontanilla said he was also spotting what he perceived as bias at school. His suspicions stirred, he said, when he noticed his high school always announced meetings of the Gay-Straight Alliance club over the loud speakers — but not those of other clubs, like his chess group.\nbias at school. His suspicions stirred, he said, when he noticed his high school always announced meetings of the Gay-Straight Alliance club over the loud speakers — but not those of other clubs, like his chess group.\nJoshua then began combing through the 'American Dream' unit of the English curriculum, researching the politics of every author. He concluded that too many (at least 12 of 19) were 'left-leaning,' including — as Joshua saw it — 'leftist' historian Studs Terkel, 'socialist' poet Langston Hughes and 'Dem' Walt Whitman.\nDistrict officials wrote in a statement that 'there is no evidence nor complaint ever brought forward regarding inequity in clubs being recognized during the announcements' and noted that the English curriculum conforms to California state standards. Officials added that the Fontanillas 'never made a complaint formally or informally to any district official.'\nA decade ago, Kali and Joshua said, they would have agreed with what their school was teaching. Both were raised in a blue slice of California by what they described as liberal families, and for a long time accepted those views without question.\nWhen Sira Taylor hired Kali to tutor her son in 2012, Kali was 'definitely left-leaning in her politics,' Taylor recalled. But Taylor, a Santa Cruz-area mother of two and self-professed independent, didn't care: She just knew Kali was good for her son, who was struggling to read and focus. Under Kali's tutelage, Taylor said, the boy's reading skills and academic performance soared. She still remembers how Kali let him run around the block whenever he got antsy.\n'She just really got the fact he was a young little boy who had a lot of energy,' Taylor said. 'He's a sophomore in college and an amazing student now, and he wouldn't be without her.'\nBy the time Kali finished tutoring Taylor's son, she and Joshua had begun to reconsider their Democratic allegiances.\nKali grew disillusioned with President Barack Obama when he signed a 2014 law cutting $8.7 billion in food stamps — a benefit that she, her mother and two siblings relied on throughout her childhood, she said. Joshua came to realize he agreed with many of President Donald Trump's policies, including his hard line stance on immigration.\nAnd both were disgusted with liberal politicians' response to the pandemic, especially their willingness to shut down schools, which Kali and Josh believed should have been last to close. The couple's concern over curricula, most notably the ethnic studies class, was the final straw.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIn summer 2021, her mind made up, Kali wrote a letter to the school board.\n'If the district continues to move forward with all these divisive teachings, it will only harden the hearts of many of our students,' she wrote in the letter, which the superintendent read aloud at a June board meeting after she submitted it for public comment. 'I have decided to resign from the district, which is the only reason I feel brave enough to speak out without fear of repercussions.'\nSalinas Union School District Superintendent, Dan Burns, reads a letter by Kali Fontanilla at a school board meeting on June 22, 2021. (Video: TWP)\nAt the board meeting following the letter-reading, several students gave speeches in favor of the ethnic studies course that helped prompt Kali's resignation. 'I would like to be able to learn my people's history at schools,' said one student, noting she is of Mexican and Latina heritage.\n'I feel like ethnic studies unites us more because we have a new understanding,' another student told a local reporter. It 'makes us understand why certain stereotypes are in our communities and how to fix them.'\nBut Kali wasn't there to hear them. Before that summer ended, she and Joshua packed their bags, put their chihuahua in a travel crate and headed for the Sunshine State.\nT he couple cashed out their California teacher retirement pensions to start up Exodus — and more than two years later, the school is just profitable enough to break even. Students pay between $2,000 and $8,000, based on need, for the standard K-12 offerings at Exodus, which include lessons on a wide variety of subjects including math, science, horticulture, French, business and the Christian faith. The Fontanillas said their student body is 50 percent Hispanic and Black, and 60 percent non-Christian. The degree Exodus confers counts as a regular high school diploma.\nThe couple cashed out their California teacher retirement pensions to start up Exodus — and more than two years later, the school is just profitable enough to break even.

The Fontanillas said their student body is 50 percent Hispanic and Black, and 60 percent non-Christian. The degree Exodus confers counts as a regular high school diploma.\nKali and Joshua said their K-12 curriculum and accredited status come courtesy of Southlands Christian Schools, a 45-year-old private school located in California which in the past five years spun up an online, faith-based schooling program. Joshua said he discovered Southlands in 2019 at an event for the California chapter of Blexit, right-wing commentator Candace Owens' campaign to make Black Americans leave the Democratic Party.\nAt the event, Joshua met Joshua Duncan, an employee of Cornerstone Education Management Organization Inc., the company Southlands pays to manage the logistics of its online schooling arm — including hiring teachers and finding people, like the Fontanillas, who want to start their own schools.\nThe two Joshuas hit it off, and eventually, the Fontanillas won approval to launch the Exodus Institute. 'Josh and Kali are good people, they have a good message, there is definitely a market for what they're doing,' Duncan said.\nUnder the deal, the Fontanillas use the Southlands standard K-12 curriculum and teachers provided by Cornerstone. Tuition payments go directly to the companies, and the Fontanillas get a commission for every pupil, Duncan said.\nAdvertisement\nThe Fontanillas also offer their 'Young Patriots Academy,' which Kali leads, as a special enrichment program. Classes cost $29 a month and revolve around topics of the couple's choosing. The first class asked 'The American Dream: Is it just a dream?'\n'There's actually people in America, and some of them are teachers, that are teaching kids that the American Dream is not real,' Kali said in that video, which she shared with The Post. 'We're going to look at that and see if that's true or not.'\nKali and Joshua declined to make students and parents available for interviews, citing worries over privacy, but shared screenshots of enrollees' reviews of academy lessons.\n'I love love LOVE your teaching Ms. Fontanilla,' one student wrote. 'It is so encouraging that you explain and exposing [sic] the stupid things on the internet in a logical way.'\nThe couple have ambitions to scale up: Kali and Joshua hope to eventually cross 1,000 students, at which point, they calculate, they will no longer have to pursue side jobs like Kali's current gig as a senior fellow at the Capital Research Center, a conservative think tank. So far, Kali has found most success attracting clients through Instagram, despite the fact her account is regularly suspended for 'community violations,' she said.\nThe more right-wing and 'out there' Kali's commentary, the more attention and families she draws to Exodus, she said. In one recent video, she complained that 'Black history month has turned into Black idolatry month.' In another, she exhorted her followers to be 'preppers' and stock up on food and medicine in case 'all hell breaks loose' after what she predicted will be Trump's victory in November.\nafter what she predicted will be Trump's victory in November.\nBut the videos also inspire hate — messages by the dozen every day telling Kali to shut up, according to screenshots she shared with The Post. Online commenters regularly sling racial slurs and derogatory names: 'slave sellout roach.' 'dumb fukn bitch.' 'wish dot com Candice Owen.' 'Auntie Tomella.'\nThe harassment got so bad last year that, coupled with her chihuahua's death and an injury that prevented her daily workouts, it proved too much for Kali. She went into a depressive spiral and had to take a break from social media. She barely managed to film her lessons.\nJoshua and her faith pulled her through. Kali said she was raised Seventh-day Adventist; Joshua discovered the religion online after researching dozens of faiths. Their beliefs also brought the couple together: They met in their 20s through a Seventh-day Adventist dating website.\nThe enforced quiet of their religion's Sabbath had proven healing for the couple. Close to sunset almost every Friday, the Fontanillas took a walk by the water to usher in their 24 hours of rest, during which they were supposed to refrain from schoolwork, housework and social media.\nOn a recent Friday, they strolled hand-in-hand through a grassy park with ocean views. Joshua led the way to a bench, tapping the space beside him.\nWalking over to join him, Kali passed a series of posters featuring student artwork, erected every spring as part of a public art installation. This year's iteration included a painting of a book in chains — and another of a student wearing earrings that each bore the slogan, 'ASK ME ABOUT MY PRONOUNS.'\nIt was just one more reason, Kali told herself, to pray. She sat beside her husband and closed her eyes. Together, they bent their heads to thank God.\nB ack in the guest bedroom-office, Kali prepared to finish out her lesson on slavery, reparations and the Quakers.\nack in the guest bedroom-office, Kali prepared to finish out her lesson on slavery, reparations and the Quakers.\nShe told her students how Quakers formed some of the first anti-slavery organizations in American history.

She spoke about how Quakers lacked official clergy and advocated spiritual equality for men and women.\nShe did not mention that 19th-century slaveholding Quakers sometimes offered financial compensation to the enslaved people they freed. Or that, in 2022, British Quakers committed to make reparations for their past involvement in the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism.\nAdvertisement\nAsked about this, Kali said in an interview that she knows not all Quakers were perfect, and that some owned slaves, but that her lesson was meant to give a contrast and a balance to the 'overemphasis' on reparations coming from the left. She also noted that some Quakers have become 'very left-leaning now.'\nThe most important thing to know about the Quakers, Kali told her class that Friday, is they lived out their values. They 'put their values into practice.' Everything the Quakers did — from what they ate to where they shopped to how they prayed — upheld their values.\n'And what does that mean, to actually live your values?' she asked.",

            "summary": "KYIV — Ukrainian officials expressed gratitude and relief Saturday after the U.S. House of Representatives approved $60.8 billion in aid to Ukraine, overcoming months of intense Republican opposition to fund urgently needed weapons for the country's military.\n'The vital U.S. aid bill passed today by the House will keep the war from expanding, save thousands and thousands of lives, and help both of our nations to become stronger,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on X.\nThe decision on the bill, which also includes funds to help keep Ukraine's government running, came after airstrikes hit several major cities in the past week, including Chernihiv and Dnipro, killing dozens of people. Ukraine, which is also running low on air defense, said the strikes could have been avoided if it had better supplies.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, on the front lines in the country's east, Russian forces have also been pushing toward the strategic town of Chasiv Yar, outside of Bakhmut, which fell to Russia last year. Ukrainian troops have for many months complained that they are rationing shells as they run out of key ammunition, making it impossible to push the Russians back — let alone prevent their advance.\nThe U.S. Senate will still need to vote on the bill before it goes to President Biden to sign. But Ukraine and its supporters have now passed through the largest hurdle in the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) refused for months to take the aid to a vote. His change of heart ignited fury among far-right members of Congress who oppose sending further aid to Ukraine and threatened to oust him if he moved forward with the vote.\n'The people of Ukraine are sincerely grateful to the U.S. Congress,' Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine's presidential office, posted on X after the Saturday vote.\nAdvertisement\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who has recently intensified his quest to secure more Patriot air defense systems for Ukraine, wrote on X that Saturday marked 'a bad day for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.'\n'A bad day for anyone who dared to believe that America could waver when it comes to defending what and who it stands for,' he wrote.\nUkraine has said that it will need 26 Patriot systems to cover the entire country. It has only three, and Germany recently pledged to send another. Kuleba is pushing European partners to hand over their Patriots, insisting they are more urgently needed in Ukraine than in the European Union.\nUkraine's pleas intensified this week after the United States and other partners helped deflect a massive Iranian missile and drone attack on Israel, engaging in a way they have refused to in Ukraine. Kyiv saw the intervention as setting a double-standard, made more frustrating due to the aid package also being delayed on the Hill.\nAdvertisement\nEuropean leaders echoed Ukraine's thanks to the House on Saturday — with some hinting that months of delays were unnecessary.\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk thanked Johnson on X, then wrote: 'Better late than too late. And I hope it is not too late for Ukraine.'\nE.U. foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who had urged Congress to act on the bill, said he welcomed the vote. 'Ukraine will have the transatlantic support it needs to stand up to Russian aggression,' he wrote on X.\nE.U. Council President Charles Michel said the vote 'sends a clear message to the Kremlin: Those who believe in freedom and [the] U.N. charter will continue to support Ukraine and its people.'\nKatarina Mathernova, the E.U. ambassador to Ukraine, wrote that the bill's passage was 'much much needed good news for all Ukrainians!!!!'\nAdvertisement\n'Historic decisions change history,' wrote Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis. 'Good to have you back, America.'\nReactions from Moscow were far more critical.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted in Russian state media outlet Tass as saying that the aid 'will further enrich the United States of America and ruin Ukraine even more, by killing even more Ukrainians because of the Kyiv regime.'\nStill, support for the vote resonated throughout much of Europe, and Ukrainian lawmakers added to the chorus of gratitude.\nKira Rudik, who belongs to the liberal Holos party, posted on X: 'Omg, on behalf of Ukrainian people; THANK YOU!!!!'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nLawmaker Oleksandra Ustinova wrote that American 'support will save lives in Ukraine.'\nOpposition lawmaker Oleksiy Goncharenko, who traveled to Washington to try to secure support for the vote, urged the world not to forget that Russia's military budget still far exceeds Ukraine's. 'Today we won the time — not the war,' he wrote. 'We will need to finish the job.'\nAdvertisement\nHe added that it 'would be great' for another message to come out of Washington during the NATO summit in July. 'To invite Ukraine to NATO,' he wrote. 'That will be decisive.'\nInna Sovsun, also from the Holos party, wrote on X that 'Ukraine is very grateful!'\nShe added: 'Just a question: was it necessary to delay half a year in order to vote? How many lives could have been saved?'",

            "summary": "NEW YORK — The judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial ordered the media on Thursday not to report on where potential jurors have worked and to be careful about revealing information about those who will sit in judgment of the former president.\nJudge Juan Merchan acted after one juror was dismissed when she expressed concerns about being 'outed' for her role in the case after details about her became publicly known.\nThe actions pointed to the difficulties involved in trying to maintain anonymity for jurors in a case that has sparked wide interest and heated opinions, while lawyers need to sift through as much information as possible in a public courtroom to determine who to choose.\nDespite the setback, 12 jurors were seated by the end of Thursday for the historic trial over a $130,000 hush money payment shortly before the 2016 election to porn actor Stormy Daniels to prevent her from making public her claims of a sexual meeting with Trump years earlier. Trump has denied the encounter.\nAdvertisement\nThe dismissed juror told Merchan she had friends, colleagues and family members contacting her to ask whether she was on the case. 'I don't believe at this point I can be fair and unbiased and let the outside influences not affect my decision-making in the courtroom,' she said.\nMerchan directed reporters not to report it when potential jurors told the court their specific workplaces, past or present. That put journalists in the difficult position of not reporting something they heard in open court, and some media organizations were considering whether to protest having that onus placed on them.\nEven if that specific information wasn't released, there was some concern that enough information about potential jurors would get out that people might be able to identify them anyway.\nAs an example of what is getting out there, Politico on Thursday identified one potential juror as 'a woman who lives in Manhattan and works as an asset manager.' She grew up in England and Hong Kong and lives with a self-employed boyfriend.\nAdvertisement\nAnother potential juror was identified as 'an attorney for a large media company who lives in Gramercy Park.'\nOn Fox News Channel Wednesday night, host Jesse Watters did a segment with a jury consultant, revealing details about people who had been seated on the jury and questioning whether some were 'stealth liberals' who would be out to convict Trump.\n'This nurse scares me if I'm Trump,' he said. 'She's from the Upper East Side, master's degree, not married, no kids, lives with her fiance and gets her news from The New York Times and CNN.'\nBesides his order about employment history, Merchan said he was asking the media to 'simply apply common sense and refrain from writing about anything that has to do, for example, with physical descriptions.'\nHe said 'there was really no need' for the media to mention one widely-reported tidbit that a juror speaks with an Irish accent.\nAdvertisement\nAnonymous juries have long existed, particularly in terrorism and mob-related cases or when there is a history of jury tampering. They have been ordered more frequently in the last two decades with the rising influence of social media and the anonymous hate speech that is sometimes associated with it. Usually courtroom artists are told they aren't permitted to draw the face of any juror in their sketches; New York courts do not permit video coverage of trials.\nDuring the Trump defamation trial in Manhattan federal court earlier this year, jurors had heightened protection of their identities by a security-conscious judge who routinely did not allow anyone in his courtroom to have a cellphone, even if it was shut off. Jurors were driven to and from the courthouse by the U.S. Marshals Service and were sequestered from the public during trial breaks.\nWhen asked general questions about themselves during jury selection in that case, prospective jurors often gave vague answers that would have made it nearly impossible to determine much about them.\nAdvertisement\nAfter the ruling in that case, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan ordered the anonymous jury not to disclose the identities of any of the people they served with, and advised jurors not to disclose their service. So far, none have come forward publicly.\nNew York criminal defense lawyer Ron Kuby said New York state law requires trial attorneys be provided the names of jurors, even when they are otherwise anonymous. However, he said, the right can be overridden by the need to protect jurors' safety.\nAs for the media, he said the judge can't control what is reported but he can severely restrict what reporters see and hear if necessary.\n'There are actions the judge could take. Courts have extraordinary powers to protect jurors from tampering and intimidation. It is really where a court's power is at its peak,' Kuby said.\nAdvertisement\nHe said the ability of lawyers at Trump's trial to research the social media history of jurors was important.\n'Both sides have interest in preventing sleeper jurors who have their own agenda from serving on the jury,' he said.\nNeama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who is president of the West Coast Trial Lawyers, said the difficulty at the Trump trial is weeding out people with extreme viewpoints.\n'Everyone in the entire country knows who Donald Trump is,' Rahmani said. 'Some think he's a criminal traitor and insurrectionist. Others think he's a hero. You don't have a lot of people in the middle.'\n___",

            "summary": "SYDNEY — A teenager has been accused of wounding a Christian bishop and priest during a church service in a second high-profile knife attack to rock Sydney in recent days that authorities on Tuesday declared an act of terrorism.\nThe 16-year-old was overpowered by the shocked congregation at Christ the Good Shepherd Church after he allegedly stabbed Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel and Fr. Isaac Royel during a service on Monday night that was being streamed online.\nPolice have not commented on reports that the boy's fingers were severed by parishioners in the Orthodox Assyrian church in suburban Wakeley, but confirmed his hand injuries were 'severe.'\nVideo of the attack spread quickly on social media and an angry mob converged on the church demanding vengeance. They hurled bricks and bottles at police, who temporarily barricaded the boy inside the church for his own safety.\nAdvertisement\nSeveral people including police officers required hospital treatment following the hourslong riot.\nPolice and community leaders said that public anxiety had been heightened by a lone assailant's knife attack in a Sydney shopping mall on Saturday that killed five women and a male security guard who attempted to intervene. The 40-year-old assailant Joel Cauchi had a history of mental illness. He was shot dead by police.\nNews South Wales Police Commissioner Karen Webb on Tuesday declared the church attack a terrorist incident, but not the shopping mall rampage.\nThe terrorism categorization allows more law enforcement resources to be focused on the crime. The declaration also gives police expanded powers to stop and search people, premises and vehicles without a warrant.\nWebb said the teen's comments and actions pointed to a religious motive for the attack. She didn't detail the wording of the comments that led her to believe he had been religiously motivated.\nAdvertisement\n'We believe there are elements that are satisfied in terms of religious-motivated extremism and of course the intimidation of the public through that person's acts, by attending that church, whilst it was being live-streamed, intimidating not only the parishioners in attendance but those parishioners who were watching online and subsequently, those people that turned up to the church on the outside and the subsequent riot that happened,' Webb said.\nThe Australian Security Intelligence Organization, the nation's main domestic spy agency, and Australian Federal Police have joined state police in a counterterrorism task force to investigate who else was potentially involved.\nASIO director-general Mike Burgess agreed with Webb that the mall attack was not terrorism.\nTo call it a terrorist attack, there must be 'information or evidence that suggests actually the motivation was religiously motivated or ideologically motivated,' Burgess said. 'In the case of Saturday, that was not the case. In this case, the information we and the police have before us ... would indicate strongly that that is the case and that's why it was called an act of terrorism.'\nAdvertisement\nA coronial inquest will investigate the circumstances of the six knife deaths in the mall attack and what policy changes could be made to prevent similar attacks from occurring in the future. The coroner will also consider whether security guards should be armed. Westfield Bondi Junction mall guards, including knife victim Faraz Tahir, do not carry guns.\nNew South Wales Premier Chris Minns said he was reviewing government restrictions on how security guards could be armed following the knife attack. But he has ruled out allowing them to carry guns, saying the fewer firearms in the community, the better.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nMass killings are relatively rare in Australia because assault rifle-style semi-automatic firearms are banned from public ownership under tough national gun laws.\nThe risk of a terrorist attack in Australia is rated as 'possible,' according to ASIO's tier system. That is the second-lowest level after 'not expected' on the five-tier National Terrorism Threat Advisory System. The threat was downgraded from middle-tier 'probable' in 2022 with the decline of the Islamic State group.\nAdvertisement\nWebb said the teen suspect in the church attack had been known to police, but had not been on a terror watch list. He had been convicted in January of a range of offenses including possession of a switchblade knife, being armed with a weapon with an intention to commit an indictable offence, stalking, intimidation and damaging property, Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported.\nA Sydney court released him on a good behavior bond, the ABC reported.\nThe boy used a switchblade, which is an illegal weapon in Australia, in Monday's attack, the ABC reported.\nJuvenile offenders cannot be publicly identified in New South Wales.\nThe church in a message on social media said the bishop and priest were in stable condition and asked for people's prayers.\n'It is the bishop's and father's wishes that you also pray for the perpetrator,' the statement said.\nAdvertisement\nThe church said in a statement on Tuesday the 53-year-old Iraq-born bishop's condition was 'improving.'\nEmmanuel has a strong social media following and is outspoken on a range of issues. He proselytizes to both Jews and Muslims and is critical of liberal Christian denominations.\nHe also speaks out on global political issues and laments the plight of Palestinians in Gaza.\nThe bishop, described in local media as a figure sometimes seen as divisive on issues such as COVID-19 restrictions, was in the national news last year over comments about gender.\n__",

Overall, Biden leads former president Donald Trump by eight points, 45 percent to 37 percent. Among registered voters, though, he's up 13 points — 50 percent to 37 percent. And among those who say they're most likely to vote, he's up 19 points. Biden has 56 percent of support and Trump, again, 37 percent.\nThat Trump doesn't gain ground as the pool of respondents is narrowed is important. It suggests that indifference to the candidates and voter apathy are linked — and that there's potentially an opportunity for Biden if his campaign can compel more young Americans to vote.\nAdvertisement\nThis comes back to the initial question: What's the pitch?\nRecent YouGov polling conducted for the Economist included a battery of issues on which respondents were asked to offer their opinions. This allows us to see where Americans stand on the election and also how younger (those under 30) voters differ from older ones.\nWhat we find is that there are only a handful of issues to which younger voters ascribe more importance than older ones, whether we're considering issues respondents identify as the most important (red, below), very important (purple) or at least somewhat important (orange). Younger Americans are more likely to point to jobs and abortion as the most important issue to them, but the gap between younger voters and voters overall is wider when describing climate change or civil rights as very important issues.\nThe issue that scored the highest in importance to younger Americans? Inflation, same as everyone else.\nThat holds in the Harvard Youth Poll as well. Its methodology was different, presenting respondents with two options from a lengthy list and asking them to identify which was more important. The issue that was most commonly selected as most important relative to alternatives was, once again, inflation.\nBy virtue of focusing on younger respondents, the Harvard poll allows a breakdown by gender. You can see that, on several issues, there's a substantial difference in the views of young men and women, like reproductive rights. The three issues on which there's the widest difference by gender are three of the most commonly associated with liberal politics: reproductive rights, climate change and gun violence. Young women were at least 10 points more likely to identify those issues as important than were young men.\nA key finding in the Harvard poll centers on the divide by gender. Support for Biden is higher among likely voters than among young people overall — but among young men who are likely to vote his advantage is only six points compared with a 33-point advantage with young women who are likely to vote.\nSince 2020, the Harvard Youth Poll has seen the partisan advantage for Democrats evaporate among young men. In 2020, men and women were about 20 points more likely to identify as Democrats than as Republicans. Now, women are 26 points more likely to, while among men, there's virtually no difference.\n(It's worth noting that Gallup polling of partisan identity shows a rightward shift among young voters that comports with the data above.)\nAdvertisement\nOn the issue importance question, the views of young women correlate strongly to the views of young Democrats. The views of young men correlate slightly less strongly to the views of young Republicans.\nThe question of how Biden appeals to these voters, though, remains unanswered. He's put a big focus on student loan relief, as you're probably aware, and it's the issue on which Harvard found the highest level of approval for Biden from younger Americans. It is also the issue that was least likely to be identified as important in Harvard's battery. On inflation and gun violence, issues seen as more important, his approval rating was around 25 percent. On the issue of Israel — which was also surprisingly low on the importance list — his approval was under 20 percent.\nYouGov found that younger Americans were more critical of Biden across the board than Americans overall, including on education and civil rights, issues that they were more likely to identify as important.\nThe situation, then, is that the issues important to young people and those important to Americans overall don't differ that much as Biden's party has lost ground with young men. (A plurality of young men in the poll identified as independent.) Analysis from Pew Research Center found that voters under 30 backed Biden by a 26-point margin in 2020, down from the 30-point margin Hillary Clinton enjoyed four years before. If the margin had instead matched that seen in this poll — 19 points — it would have meant a shift of more than 4 million votes from Biden to Trump.",

            "excerpt": "In ‘Out of the Darkness,' Frank Trentmann covers 80 years to assess the reckoning with the Nazi legacy",
            "summary": "The final capitulation of Nazi Germany after years of devastating war, brutal repression and genocidal persecution left the country a ruin. The horrors the regime had inflicted on the continent were all around for anyone wishing to look, and as Frank Trentmann recounts in 'Out of the Darkness: The Germans, 1942-2022,' an eventual reckoning with those horrors would define Germany's national identity.\nBut for many of the principal characters in this book — Germans depicted in diary entries, letters and interviews who surveyed the rubble during what's long been called the country's 'zero hour' — it was their own misery that dominated their thoughts, not the magnitude of their nation's crimes.\n'We constantly get to hear what the others have suffered,' Renate Bock, who had survived the Allied firebombing of Hamburg during the war, wrote in a diary in May 1945, just weeks after Germany's surrender. 'But no one is allowed to talk of our own terrible suffering.' Other Germans focused on the fate of prisoners of war, the desperate housing situation in bombed-out German cities, shortages of food, rumors of bloody retribution exacted by the victorious Allies.\nSuch voices fill the opening chapters of Trentmann's book, showing how an insular focus persisted for years after the Nazi defeat, even as West Germany reinvented itself as a flourishing liberal democracy and East Germany built its 'socialist workers' and peasants' state' on a founding anti-fascist myth. The new communist regime rationalized even its most repressive measures, such as the Berlin Wall, in supposedly anti-fascist terms (in official jargon, the wall — meant to keep Easterners in — was an 'anti-fascist protection barrier' meant to keep spies out).\nAdvertisement\n'Out of the Darkness' is a rich, ambitious account of Germany's improbable rise from a moral abyss to a prosperous democracy that is sometimes held up as a bulwark of stability and liberal values. Trentmann acknowledges the remarkable 'moral and material regeneration,' but he also sets out to complicate the simple narrative that Germans' 'eventual reckoning with the past' made them 'moral crusaders in the present.'\nFor starters, the moral reckoning was never as clear-cut as sometimes portrayed, with questions of guilt, responsibility and reparations remaining sharply contested and controversial for years. As Trentmann points out, the very term that Germans use to describe efforts to right the wrongs done to Nazi victims — 'Wiedergutmachung' — is ambiguous. It literally translates as 'making good again' but can be understood variously as reparations, redress, restitution, indemnity or compensation, and Germans spent years debating which form it should take.\nWest Germany's first postwar chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, hoped that payments to Israel and Jewish refugees might settle accounts. But the bureaucratic nightmare into which some compensation claims descended — with former Nazi civil servants sometimes handling the cases of Holocaust survivors they once persecuted — left a bitter taste for some, even as that compensation eased West Germany's path out of international isolation.\nAdvertisement\nTrentmann has little patience for the way some pundits describe contemporary Germany as a 'moral superpower,' noting how the country has been more than willing to set aside its scruples for the sake of commerce and to take moral stances often conveniently aligned with self-interest.\nAlthough the book runs to more than 800 pages and its scope is extensive, in some ways encyclopedic, it remains fresh and surprising throughout, thanks in part to Trentmann's knack for drawing on an astounding range of voices.\nThe utter depravity of Nazi Germany is well known, of course, but Trentmann highlights the perverted value system that the Nazis instilled at every level of the country's life, and the contortions of soldiers, bureaucrats and civilians under the system.\nOne young German officer fighting in the Balkans and Moravia fretted that he was 'surrounded by repulsive cruelty, badness, betrayal, and cowardice.' But he still portrayed himself as a righteous knight fighting in a just battle and sought to rouse his men with poems from Goethe and Rilke. Trentmann writes, 'What would happen to this solipsistic sense of moral superiority is a major theme of this book.'\nAdvertisement\nHe also quotes the diary of Willy Peter Reese, who joined the war in 1941 on the eastern front, where he witnessed brutal fighting and war crimes. He described himself and his fellow soldiers as not only 'unwashed, unshaven, lice-eaten, and sick' but 'spiritually decayed, nothing more than a sum of blood, intestines, and bones.' Despite his disillusionment, Reese remained committed to the war and volunteered to return to the front, where he was killed in 1944.\nWhen the SS commander and convicted war criminal Kurt 'Panzer' Meyer was released from prison in 1954, he was greeted with flowers and a brass band. Meyer had initially been sentenced to death for executing Canadian prisoners of war, and he was also implicated in other atrocities.\nThe cloying self-pity expressed by many Germans around the end of World War II is outrageous and has been well-documented in previous books. In addition to offering his own examples of that self-pity, Trentmann interrogates the totality of the image, highlighting the voices of Germans who recognized the enormity of their country's crimes. The very first German movie made after the war, premiering the day before the Allies executed a dozen Nazi war criminals who had been condemned at the Nuremberg trials, was titled 'The Murderers Are Among Us.'\nAdvertisement\nTrentmann also rejects as a myth the idea that Germans largely avoided grappling with the war until their conspiracy of silence was smashed by a generation of young, middle-class radicals in 1968. He instead dates the key shift in German attitudes toward the war to the mid-1950s, citing growing public unease over lenient treatment of Nazi criminals as well as West Germany's reparations policies.\nReckoning with the Nazi legacy is at the center of the book, but Trentmann also explores the changes in German attitudes over the last 80 years toward a range of matters, from gender relations and military service to pets, nature, nuclear power and meat consumption.\nTrentmann, who was raised in Hamburg but has taught history in the United States and Britain for decades, points out that the 'moral reorientation' of Germans has been a largely internal process, with a fundamentally provincial view that remained 'preoccupied with rebuilding the country and coming to terms with the Nazi past.' Those were, and still are, central and laudable tasks, but they have sometimes left Germans bizarrely blinkered, out of touch or even absent when confronting new challenges and moral debates.\nAdvertisement\n'The long and bitter conflict over guilt and memory eventually provided Germans with a new identity and self-assurance, giving them a sense of pride in not being proud that, at times, turned into self-satisfaction,' Trentmann writes. The result was a country growing rich from global trade with dubious regimes but often scrupulously keeping its own hands clean of the realities of geopolitics.\nTrentmann shines light on just how rarely victims had a direct voice in Germany's conversations about amnesty, compensation and forgiveness. In the immediate aftermath of the war, Germans found themselves isolated, in a more ethnically homogenous country than ever before or since. The Nazis had driven Jews into exile, then murdered many of those who didn't escape. Although millions of survivors of Nazi persecution found themselves in occupied Germany after the war, few had any interest in remaining among their tormentors and, as Trentmann points out in painful detail, few Germans took serious interest in their fate.\n'By 1955, there were just 15,000 Jews in Germany,' Trentmann writes, before adding with astounding understatement: 'The history of postwar Germany might have been far more antagonistic if more victims had decided to stay.'\nAdvertisement\nInstead, Germans were left to confront their past themselves, with their victims largely a distant and impersonal force. Trentmann shows how even anti-fascist Germans who had fled and missed the war often met with a cold reception when they returned home from exile.\nOccupied Germany saw an influx of millions of ethnic Germans from the former eastern territories, first fleeing the advancing Red Army and then driven out by the postwar governments in Poland, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. 'Hitler had called on all Germans to come ‘Heim ins Reich' (‘back home to the Reich'). It was his defeat that accomplished it,' Trentmann writes. 'Instead of a greater Germany, they found themselves driven into a smaller one, a country amputated and divided.'\nHe gets at a central irony of postwar German history: For all the efforts to repudiate the Nazi past and the debates about how to atone for the oppression and murder of German Jews, Germans have hewed closely to an ethnic understanding of the nation — even more so than countries like France, Britain or the Netherlands, where colonial legacies have complicated things. That helped make Germany an unwelcoming place for the waves of immigrants in subsequent decades who came as workers to East and particularly West Germany. Trentmann astutely notes that postwar Germany's focus on guilt and atonement excluded those from outside the 'Volk.'\nAdvertisement\n'By the 1990s, German responsibility for the Holocaust had become a civil religion that defined national identity,' he writes. 'The sins of their fathers gave ethnic Germans a monopoly on the national past and made them gatekeepers of collective memory.'\nTrentmann takes a particularly critical view of Germany's harsh stance toward Greece and other debtor countries during the eurozone crisis, noting how Germany has long been the big winner in a trade bloc that guaranteed the country's mighty exporters access to markets, cheap suppliers and a devalued currency. He also notes how West Germany's postwar economic boom was powered in part by massive sovereign debt forgiveness in the 1950s.\nTo borrow a frequently invoked expression, Germany — especially under then-Chancellor Angela Merkel — became deeply dependent on the United States for security, China for exports and Russia for energy. Trentmann invokes that framework and convincingly shows how the pursuit of those relationships was often framed in flattering, morally superior terms while conveniently working to Germany's advantage, at least in the short term.\nAdvertisement\nTrentmann's generally negative assessment of Merkel's legacy (although he praises her decision to throw open the country's borders to refugees in 2015) is part of a growing wave of criticism, particularly around the subject of foreign policy, since she left office in 2021.\nTrentmann apparently finished his book before the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, and the response to the all-out Russian invasion of Ukraine looms largest in his consideration of contemporary Germany. But he anticipates the ways in which Germany's failure to integrate more recent immigrants into its culture of memory and attrition, and the country's official policy of unquestionable support for Israel, have left an internal conflict between an entrenched view that sees a special German responsibility toward Israel, keen to police criticism of Israel for signs of resurgent antisemitism, and the view of more recent arrivals — especially Muslims — who think about the conflict through a starkly different historical lens.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIn his introduction, Trentmann poses a question: 'How did a people emerge from totalitarianism, conquest, and genocide, and where did they go from there?' In many ways, the account that follows only makes it more stunning that Germany turned into a stable and relatively tolerant democracy, despite so many continuities with the Nazi past. Trentmann cites the blunt comments of Hamburg's Social Democrat mayor, Max Brauer, in December 1946: 'Ninety-five per cent of the German people had worked in one way or another with the Nazi regime. With just 5 per cent, though, it is not possible to build a state.'\nWhat emerges is a picture of a divided nation focused on its own very particular circumstances and only rarely on the wider world. The achievements of Germany over the period Trentmann covers are considerable: from the shattered remains of a genocidal dictatorship to a thriving, stable democracy selling its wares around the world.\nHe writes, 'What Germans want from the world has been clear — that it buys their cars and chemicals — what they think they owe the world far less so.'\nBryn Stole is a journalist in Berlin.\nBryn Stole is a journalist in Berlin.\nOut of the Darkness\nThe Germans, 1942-2022\nThe Germans, 1942-2022\nBy Frank Trentmann",

            "summary": "For decades, the federal government has prioritized oil and gas drilling, hardrock mining and livestock grazing on public lands across the country. That could soon change under a far-reaching Interior Department rule that puts conservation, recreation and renewable energy development on equal footing with resource extraction.\nThe final rule released Thursday represents a seismic shift in the management of roughly 245 million acres of public property — about one-tenth of the nation's land mass. It is expected to draw praise from conservationists and legal challenges from fossil fuel industry groups and Republican officials, some of whom have lambasted the move as a 'land grab.'\nInterior's Bureau of Land Management, known as the nation's largest landlord, has long offered leases to oil and gas companies, mining firms and ranchers. Now, for the first time, the nearly 80-year-old agency will auction off 'restoration leases' and 'mitigation leases' to entities with plans to restore or conserve public lands.\nAdvertisement\n'Today's final rule helps restore balance to our public lands as we continue using the best-available science to restore habitats, guide strategic and responsible development, and sustain our public lands for generations to come,' Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement.\nUnder President Biden, the BLM has put a greater emphasis on protecting public lands from the twin threats of climate change and development. Tracy Stone-Manning, the bureau's director, has warned that hotter, drier climates are driving longer and more intense wildfires and drought across the American West. At the same time, development has fragmented and destroyed wildlife habitat and migratory corridors.\n'We oversee 245 million acres, and every land manager will tell you that climate change is already happening. It's already impacting our public lands,' Stone-Manning said during a Washington Post Live event last year. 'We see it in pretty obvious ways, through unprecedented wildfires.'\nAdvertisement\nThe fossil fuel industry, a frequent foe of the Biden administration, has chaffed at the BLM's approach. It has called the public lands rule an example of regulatory overreach that will stifle domestic energy production, even as the United States pumps more oil than any nation in history.\nKathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, which represents oil and gas companies, said the group plans to challenge the BLM rule in court. She said the policy appears to violate the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the 1976 law that tasked the bureau with overseeing 'multiple uses' of public lands for current and future generations.\n'We have no choice but to litigate,' Sgamma said. 'These conservation leases seem to be designed to preclude energy development on federal lands.'\nThe BLM's proposed rule released last year sparked especially intense outrage in Wyoming, an energy powerhouse that accounts for nearly one-tenth of U.S. fossil fuel production. Some Wyoming Republicans have claimed that the BLM is colluding with liberal environmental groups to put millions of acres off-limits to development — and to push a form of imperialism.\nAdvertisement\n'It does seem to me this is a very top-down, Washington-centric approach that has kind of cut the legs out from the local people,' Gov. Mark Gordon (R) told The Post last year. 'Unfortunately, Wyoming finds itself imposed upon by these colonial forces of national environmental groups who are pushing an agenda onto Wyoming.'\nAaron Weiss, deputy director of the Center for Western Priorities, an advocacy group, said some Republican officials have spread 'disinformation and the conspiracy theories' about the rule. He noted that during a House Natural Resources Committee hearing last year, South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem (R) claimed the draft rule would allow Chinese citizens to purchase leases on U.S. lands.\nUnlike the proposed rule, the final rule clarifies that 'leases cannot be held by foreign persons.' It also offers 'restoration leases' and 'mitigation leases' rather than 'conservation leases' — a linguistic tweak that seems designed to skirt the politicization of the word 'conservation,' Weiss said.\nAdvertisement\nMitigation leases will allow lease holders to offset the impact of their activities. For example, a rancher whose cattle grazing is degrading the land could be required to purchase a mitigation lease during the permitting process. The rancher could then work with a local conservation group to restore nearby habitat for the greater sage grouse, an imperiled bird of the West.\nto offset the impact of their activities. For example, a rancher whose cattle grazing is degrading the land could be required to purchase a mitigation lease during the permitting process. The rancher could then work with a local conservation group to restore nearby habitat for the greater sage grouse, an imperiled bird of the West.\nThe final rule also directs the BLM to prioritize landscape health for the first time and to incorporate Indigenous knowledge into its decision-making. The latter is a top priority of Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary and lead a department that once oversaw the removal of Indigenous people from their land.\nThe Trump administration took a vastly different approach to managing public lands than Biden officials. President Donald Trump briefly moved the BLM's headquarters from Washington to Grand Junction, Colo., a hot spot for natural gas production. More than 87 percent of the affected employees either resigned or retired rather than move to Colorado, depriving the agency of expertise and disrupting its operations.\nTo lead the BLM, Trump tapped William Perry Pendley, a conservative lawyer who had previously advocated for selling off public lands across the country. Pendley, who was never confirmed by the Senate, pushed the bureau to maximize oil, gas and mineral development.\ntapped William Perry Pendley, a conservative lawyer who had previously advocated for selling off public lands across the country.

            "summary": "For three years, Australians have been consumed by a rape allegation that sparked a criminal trial; a slew of civil cases; legislative change; reviews of police, a prosecutor and workplace conduct; tens of thousands marching to protest gendered violence; and a national reckoning over the treatment of women.\nIn 2021, former political staffer Brittany Higgins came forward in media interviews, alleging that about two years earlier she had been raped by a colleague inside Australia's Parliament House, on a couch in the office of their mutual boss Linda Reynolds, a high-ranking lawmaker.\nThis week, a federal judge ruled that she was telling the truth. The finding concluded an at-times salacious trial that gripped the country and its media — including the accusation that one outlet, Seven Network, paid for drugs and sex work services to secure an interview with the man accused of rape, Bruce Lehrmann. The network has denied those claims.\nAdvertisement\nThe ruling Monday was in a defamation suit brought by Lehrmann against a journalist, Lisa Wilkinson, and the television channel, Network 10, that had aired Higgins's story. Lehrmann continues to deny the allegation.\nWilkinson told reporters outside the court: 'I feel glad for the women of Australia today.' She and Network 10 had relied on a truth defense, meaning they could not have defamed Lehrmann if the court concluded their story was correct.\nHiggins's allegation was central to Australia's #MeToo moment, with outrage laser-focused on goings-on at Parliament.

A former producer testified that Lehrmann received perks from the network including reimbursement for cocaine and services from sex workers — which Seven denies. Lehrmann testified that he received a year's rent worth about $65,000 from the channel, public broadcaster ABC reported.\nLee did not rule on the veracity of the producer's claims, which he thought were tangential to the central legal question.\nSeven and Lehrmann's attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.\nPeter Bartlett, a defamation law expert who successfully represented a media outlet in another recent headline-grabbing trial, said the ruling against Lehrmann could 'be a boost for freedom of speech in Australia,' which is not constitutionally protected there.\nAdvertisement\nIn Australia, editors and in-house lawyers tend to be more conservative than in the United States when deciding what to publish, Bartlett said. Under Australian law, someone sued for defamation usually must prove that a claim was true — rather than the aggrieved party proving it was false — except in limited protected contexts.\nBartlett defended Fairfax Media when it was sued by a decorated soldier, Ben Roberts-Smith, over stories that alleged he had illegally killed unarmed prisoners in Afghanistan. In June, the judge in that case also found the stories were substantially true.\n'In the two most recent high-profile decisions in Australia, Roberts-Smith and Lehrmann, the plaintiffs have both failed,' Bartlett said, calling it a 'very rare' period in the Australian defamation world. In both cases, 'the trials have been far more damaging than the original publication,' he added.\nAdvertisement\nHiggins's allegation also became a political issue. She and Lehrmann were both employed by the Liberal Party — which heads Australia's conservative coalition, in government at the time — when the rape happened. In 2022, Prime Minister Scott Morrison issued a public apology to Higgins for 'the terrible things that took place' in Parliament.\nBurgin said that the question of what happened in the early hours of March 23, 2019, in Reynolds's office has been 'omnipresent' in Australia, the subject of 'arguments around the dinner table, disagreements among friends.'",

That raised the question: Why in the world did such a popular measure take so long? It could have been done long ago, when President Biden requested the aid in October, had Johnson simply ignored the histrionics from pro-Putin House members who take their cues from Donald Trump.\nWhy in the world did such a popular measure take so long? It could have been done long ago, when President Biden requested the aid in October, had Johnson simply ignored the histrionics from pro-Putin House members who take their cues from Donald Trump.\nA week … a month … six months ago, the vote to deliver critical aid could have prevented countless Ukrainian deaths. Just last week, Russian missiles struck an apartment building in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, killing 17 people and injuring at least 61. That was merely one strike among many Russia has successfully carried out in recent months while Ukraine has been hampered by munitions shortages and inadequate antimissile defenses.\nAdvertisement\nThe delay had serious, widespread consequences for Ukraine. Max Bergmann, a former State Department official and director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia program for the Center for Strategic and International Studies, tells me, 'Their power sector has been decimated by lack of air defense, which will be incredibly costly to repair.' He adds that on the front 'Ukrainians have lost a lot of soldiers because if you don't have artillery you have to hold the line with men.' In other words, Ukraine has 'lost a lot of people simply because we stopped providing them ammo.'\nAmnesty International, tracking one of Russia's many ongoing human rights violations, reported just days before the vote, 'In what may be cumulatively one of Russia's most destructive series of strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, several power facilities were attacked, resulting in further suffering and disruption to Ukrainian civilians.' The organization noted, 'Deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, such as power stations and electricity supplies, and causing overwhelming harm to civilians is a violation of international humanitarian law.' Count that among the consequences of delayed U.S. aid.\nThe shortages of ammunition and antimissile systems for Ukraine meant Russia paid little price for continued aggression. The American Enterprise Institute's Kori Schake tells me that Ukrainian losses 'can be counted in bodies, in lost territory, in squandered momentum on the battlefield.' Those losses are at least in part attributable to Republicans' dithering.\nFollow this author Jennifer Rubin 's opinions\nFollow this author\nJennifer Rubin\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nAdvertisement\nThe damage, in part, can be quantified. 'We assess that Russian forces seized 583 square kilometers since Oct. 1, 2023, approximately 100 square kilometers more than what the Ukrainian forces liberated during the 2023 counteroffensive,' George Barros, head of the Russia and Geospatial Intelligence teams at the Institute for Study of War, tells me. He adds, 'We continue to assess that material shortages are forcing Ukraine to conserve ammunition and prioritize limited resources to critical sectors of the front, increasing the risk of a Russian breakthrough in other less-well-provisioned sectors and making the front line overall more fragile than the current relatively slow rate of Russian advances makes it appear.'\nGiven Ukraine's ammunition shortages, Barros says, Russia gained 'flexibility in how they conduct offensive operations,' which can lead to 'opportunities for Russian forces to make operationally significant gains in the future.' In particular, the Institute for the Study of War reported on Friday, 'Russian forces recently made confirmed advances near Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and Donetsk City.'\nMoreover, the damage attributable to this U.S. delinquency extends beyond Ukraine. 'The greater loss is that of U.S. credibility, to use that old term,' veteran diplomat Daniel Fried tells me. 'Trumpist Republicans have damaged it and that will not be easy to repair.' He says, 'Some countries may hedge, including in Asia. Russia and China are exploiting this new opportunity. Iran as well, likely.'\nAdvertisement\nThese losses to Ukraine and to U.S. national-security interests were entirely avoidable. Had Johnson simply listened to U.S. intelligence experts or even traveled to Ukraine, as several House and Senate members did, and witnessed the carnage, he would have quickly grasped the urgency of a vote.\nNot until last week did Johnson issue a full-throated defense of Ukraine aid. 'I think Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed,' he told reporters. 'I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys.' He stressed, 'This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is so many American families. This is not a game, this is not a joke.' And yet for months, Republicans let the fire rage; they treated their solemn obligations like a joke.\nAlthough Johnson insisted to Jake Tapper on CNN that Republicans 'know the urgency in Ukraine and in Israel,' they showed no concern for roughly six months for the price Ukraine paid for Republicans' dawdling. Either Republicans were extremely slow to learn about the harm they were causing, or they knew all along the danger they were visiting on Ukraine but didn't care. Johnson's apparent fear of Trump's wrath or an attempt to oust him as speaker — in which no Republicans other than Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) appeared much interested — seemed to outweigh concern for a U.S. ally.",

            "summary": "During a visit to a small convenience store in Upper Manhattan on Tuesday, Donald Trump distilled his party's approach to crime — and, really, everything else.\nTrump had come directly from the courthouse where, for the second day in a row, he observed as prospective jurors were questioned for the trial in which he stands accused of falsifying business records, part of an effort before the 2016 election to hide an alleged sexual encounter with an adult-film actress. The stop at the bodega was meant to draw a contrast between how Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg handled a killing that occurred at the store in 2022 — charges were eventually dropped against a clerk who argued he was acting in self-defense — and Trump's situation.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\n'Everything is screwed up in New York, and the whole world is watching,' Trump insisted while speaking to reporters. In his case, he added, 'there's no crime. You know where the crime is? In the bodegas, where they come and rob them every week.' As is his recent habit, he included a separate excoriation of recently arrived immigrants, who, he insisted, were taking all the jobs and who were 'prisoners and people from mental institutions, largely.'\nAdvertisement\nViewed through a sympathetic lens, you see what Trump is arguing: They're coming after me when there's real crime out there? Step back one degree from that sympathetic view, though, and you come to a more useful position: Rather than being assessed on a sliding scale, crimes should generally be subject to accountability.\nFor years, Trump has offered his base a bifurcated view of law enforcement. Local police are lionized, both as a statement of allegiance and as the thin blue line keeping America safe from salivating hordes of leftist rioters, urban criminals and immigrant savages. Federal law enforcement, though, is suspect and corrupt, a position intertwined with long-standing investigations into Trump at the federal level. With his indictments at the local level in Georgia and Manhattan, Trump simply tied the local district attorneys back to his federal political opponents. ('By the way, this trial that I have now?' he said at the bodega. 'That's a Biden trial.')\nAt the moment, though, this divergent view of crime — Trump and his allies are innocent political targets while liberal prosecutors let other criminals slide — is more distant from reality than usual.\nAdvertisement\nCrime, by most available metrics, is down in recent years. That includes homicides, which, as the Wall Street Journal reported this week, have dropped sharply in several cities. In New York City, violent crime is down 3 percent year-to-date. Grand larceny is similarly down 3 percent, though the number of robberies is up 4 percent.\nBut it is an election year, so, as was the case in 2020 and 2022, warnings from Trump and his allies about criminal activity are omnipresent and breathless.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'The next six months is going to be intense,' Kari Lake, a Republican candidate for Senate in Arizona, said at a rally over the weekend, as the New York Times reported. She told listeners to get ready: 'We are going to put on the armor of God. And maybe strap on a Glock on the side of us just in case.'\nThe New York Post — a perpetual engine of fearmongering about crime — reported that 'Californians are buying up guns after Border Patrol starts dumping thousands of migrants on streets.' In March, there were about 131,000 background checks conducted in California, a process that generally precedes a gun sale. Last March there were 128,000; the March before that, 129,000. In March 2021, there were 144,000.\nAdvertisement\nNone of this is to say that violent crimes don't occur; they do. It is, instead, to point out that heightened rhetoric about the dangers of crime doesn't comport with the reality of trends in crime data.\nThis rhetoric sits alongside a willingness to give Trump and his allies a pass. Polling from the Associated Press, conducted by NORC this month, shows that only a small fraction of Republicans think Trump did anything illegal concerning the four indictments he faces. Only 6 percent of Republicans think he did anything illegal in the New York case.\nThis idea that Trump is being unfairly targeted for scrutiny and sanction — an idea Trump has relentlessly promoted for obvious reasons — extends to his allies. On Tuesday night, Newsmax host Greg Kelly (son of the former commissioner of the New York Police Department) encouraged viewers to write to former Trump adviser Peter Navarro, imprisoned in Florida.\nLet's all WRITE Peter Navarro. He's in JAIL and that's a TOTAL CRIME. Send him a note! (Message: We Care!) PS: No contraband. pic.twitter.com/QSPjxcAAXK\n— Greg Kelly (@gregkellyusa) April 17, 2024\n'He's in JAIL and that's a TOTAL CRIME,' Kelly wrote on social media on Wednesday morning. The reality is that Navarro ignored a congressional subpoena and was found guilty of contempt of Congress.\nAdvertisement\nBut Navarro was just stonewalling the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, hardly something a Trump supporter is going to be overly worried about. Likewise the actions of Trump: Oh, he tried to block Joe Biden's presidency? Why not focus on the real criminals?\nreal criminals?\nIt's all about how the criminal actions are perceived. Trump keeping classified documents gets a shrug, but the specter of tattooed immigrants lying in wait in the dingy streets of New York is indelible. That the former happened and the latter is wildly overheated is neither here nor there. They are the bad guys, not us. They deserve to be cracked down on, to be constrained or punished. Not us. They are the ones we should be worried about.\nThey are the bad guys, not us. They deserve to be cracked down on, to be constrained or punished. Not us.

She married a handsome lawyer whom she rescued from prison during the Russian Revolution, and they both fled west, ultimately settling in Paris. There, Lempicka parlayed her formidable skills as a painter into a successful career as an artist, socialite and glamorous denizen of the interwar demimonde.\n'History's a b----,' says Tamara, played by Eden Espinosa in the new musical 'Lempicka.' 'But so am I.'\nSkip to end of carousel\nThe Style section\nThe Style section Style is where The Washington Post covers happenings on the front lines of culture and what it all means, including the arts, media, social trends, politics and yes, fashion, all told with personality and deep reporting. For more Style stories, click here\nEnd of carousel\nThe creators of 'Lempicka' — book, lyrics and concept by Carson Kreitzer, music by Matt Gould — want their title character to be many things: feminist, sexual revolutionary, trailblazing entrepreneur, tortured artist, victim and survivor, and martyr to the passing fads of art and history. There's enough evidence in the life of the real Lempicka to justify most of those claims to some degree, but this musical wants to prove all of them, absolutely, in the space of two and a half hours. The result is a breathless, up-tempo force march through some of the darkest decades in European history, and a big, messy, fascinating life is processed into a theater piece that is just big and messy.\nAdvertisement\nThe musical, first seen at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in 2018, is framed as flashback: an old and embittered artist alone on a park bench in Los Angeles in 1975, ruminating on her life and career, wondering, 'How did I wind up here?' Her work is forgotten and out-of-fashion, and she is exiled in a world far from the wit and sophistication with which she once surrounded herself.\nSuddenly it's 1916, she is young again, about to be married, and her mother implores her to give up painting and live a proper, respectable life. Revolution intervenes and we're off, on a highway built by 'Hamilton,' careening to the first of the major traumas. After she fails to win her husband Tadeusz's freedom by offering her jewelry to the menacing Bolsheviks, she is forced to yield her body.\nThe young couple flee west, their flight traced on a map above the stage (scenic design by Riccardo Hernández), which will also bear fragments of the luminous, sensual, slightly chilly art deco paintings of the real Lempicka, whose work has been collected and promoted by Madonna. An appealing ensemble of dancers (choreography by Raja Feather Kelly), by turns androgynous, louche, menacing and camp, set the tone for a frenetic idyll of ambition, success and debauchery during the interwar years in Paris.\nAdvertisement\nLempicka's art is represented onstage mainly with empty easels and vacant picture frames, and history gets the same treatment: present as shadow, not substance. The revolution that disrupts the lives of our main characters is cruel, but the actual grievance that sparks it is passed over lightly. Decades of want, misery and political violence scroll by, seen in black-and-white film clips. If you want to learn more about that, and how it intersected with art, go see the Museum of Modern Art's Käthe Kollwitz show, an artist a generation older than Lempicka, who left a far greater legacy.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIn 'Lempicka,' history is, as they say, just one dance number after another. It summons the shocks and jolts that forge the identity and resiliency of the artist, which doesn't yield an actual character, but more of a ready-made hero for contemporary political tastes. Espinosa does heroic work tying the threads together, but instead of inhabiting a character with multiple facets, she's left to reconcile multiple characters serving various theatrical purposes.\na character with multiple facets, she's left to reconcile multiple characters serving various theatrical purposes.\nLempicka has an affair with Rafaela, a self-reliant prostitute (magnificently played and sung by Amber Iman), and her work — portraits of confident women and statuesque nudes — is celebrated as liberating by the LGBT habitués of the Monocle nightclub, which feels a lot like the Kit Kat Club of 'Cabaret.'\nAdvertisement\nShe also wrests significant independence from Tadeusz, played with starchy elegance by Andrew Samonsky, but when she tells him a terrible secret, the scene falls flat because their relationship has never been coherent. She goes her own way, resisting the grim, modernist ideology of the futurist prophet, Marinetti, depicted as an obnoxious drunkard and brutal social seer by George Abud. But it's unclear if we should admire the artist for her independence, or her pragmatic, even cynical submission to elite taste. The show seems to credit her not just with embodying the New Woman ideal of the 1920s, but with inventing it. 'Your women,' says a ghostly apparition of Rafaela, 'they're taking over the world.'\nThat's a big stretch.\nDirector Rachel Chavkin's production is stylish and fast-paced, and opens up just enough room for a few genuine theatrical moments. Iman's 'The Most Beautiful Bracelet' is an Act I showstopper, as is the highlight of the evening, Beth Leavel's tender, determined yet resigned song about love and memory in Act II in which she plays an aristocratic woman facing up to her own death.\nshowstopper, as is the highlight of the evening, Beth Leavel's tender, determined yet resigned song about love and memory in Act II in which she plays an aristocratic woman facing up to her own death.\nAdvertisement\nGould's music lacks a strong melodic profile, and tends to move quickly to the big, fortissimo notes that flatter his singer's voices. But the text setting is clear and effective and the music seems to disappear when the drama — Leavel's heartbreaking acknowledgment of mortality — is the essential thing.\nThe real Lempicka is having a moment right now. Her work is on view at an exhibition at Sotheby's, and will be given museum treatment later this year at a retrospective in San Francisco. She is not as well known as she deserves to be, but she was not quite as forgotten and forlorn as this musical claims she was. Her career sputtered after she emigrated to the United States and later Mexico. But it was already being rediscovered in the 1960s, subject of a major retrospective in Paris in 1972, and has been cropping up in Madonna's videos and spectacles for decades.\nIn a review, published in the late 1980s in the Woman's Art Journal, a slightly dyspeptic critic argued Lempicka's art was more rejected than forgotten: 'Her Art Deco portraiture is largely unknown today for two good reasons: it is hopelessly out of date, and none of it was very good to begin with.'\n'Lempicka' challenges both those assumptions. Audiences may be inspired by the show to seek out the art itself, which offers a more measured and reasonable riposte.",

            "excerpt": "Rep. Summer Lee's criticism of Israel's response to the Oct. 7 attacks initially set her apart. But the Israel-Gaza war has shifted U.S. public opinion.",
            "summary": "PITTSBURGH — Rep. Summer Lee, a freshman Democrat who faces a primary challenge Tuesday from an opponent who has characterized her as extreme on foreign policy, was one of the first members of Congress to criticize Israel's military response to the Oct. 7 attacks in which Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages.\nLee, a member of the 'Squad' of lefty Democrats, called for a cease-fire a little over a week after the attack and suggested Israel was guilty of 'blatant human rights violations.'\nThat reaction initially set Lee apart from many in her party. But as Israel has continued its retaliatory assault on Hamas-run Gaza, U.S. public opinion has shifted. Approval of Israel's military actions among Democrats nationwide dropped from 36 percent in November to 18 percent in March, according to a recent Gallup poll.\nAdvertisement\nSome in this community, which is home to the Tree of Life synagogue, the site of the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history, have come around to their congresswoman's position.\nLee made 'some missteps with the Jewish community' in the early days after Oct. 7, making statements that some people here viewed as sympathetic only to Palestinians, Annie Weidman said as she shopped for Passover groceries this weekend.\nIn the months that followed, Lee 'calmed down her rhetoric,' said Weidman, 63. 'And I do understand her position of being very much for the Palestinian people because it's really, really awful, and I totally get it.'\n'Everybody has sort of moved to her position rather than the other way around,' Weidman, who voted early for Lee, added later.\nSince October, some 34,000 Palestinians, including 13,000 children, have been killed in Gaza, according to local health authorities. And although the House of Representatives approved a new tranche of aid for Israel on Saturday over the objections of 58 members, including Lee, top Democratic leaders, including President Biden and Sen. Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), have sharpened their criticism of the Israeli government in recent weeks.\nAdvertisement\n'What we're seeing slowly but surely is not voters catching up to the Squad — it is other Democratic politicians catching up to where voters have been for months,' said Usamah Andrabi, the communications director for Justice Democrats, which works to elect liberals to Congress and has supported Lee's reelection campaign.\nBoth Lee and her opponent, Edgewood Borough council member Bhavini Patel, dispute the idea that Tuesday's election is primarily about the war. But voters here volunteer their thoughts on the topic without prompting. In Squirrel Hill, home to Patel's campaign office, lawn signs bearing her name appear frequently next to ones reading 'we stand with Israel.'\nPatel has continued to criticize Lee's position on the conflict.\n'She's clearly picked a side in this situation and completely disregards her entire district,' Patel said in an interview Saturday. 'I think it's important that any call for a cease-fire should acknowledge that hostages are still being held,' she added.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Lee first ran for this seat two years ago, pro-Israel outside groups, including Democratic Majority for Israel and a PAC associated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) spent heavily in an attempt to defeat her, holding her to a 1,000-vote victory in the primary.\nBut neither the AIPAC-affiliated group nor Democratic Majority for Israel have intervened in this year's primary, according to the most recent federal campaign finance filing data. Asked about the race, an AIPAC representative said the group is 'already involved in several races, and we will be engaged in additional campaigns where we can have the greatest impact.' A representative for DMFI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nInstead, the Moderate PAC, a group backed by Republican megadonor Jeffrey Yass, has intervened in the race, airing television ads attacking Lee for 'opposing Biden' as images of pro-abortion-rights protests and the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection played on-screen.\nAdvertisement\nPatel has denounced Yass and said that she considers herself 'a principled progressive Democrat,' but Lee and her allies have worked to make the billionaire's involvement in the race a liability for Patel. At a Sunday rally with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), supporters of Lee waved black-and-yellow signs reading 'Move, Yass! Get out of the way' and 'Stop Republican billionaires.'\nOcasio-Cortez characterized the Moderate PAC's involvement as 'an attempt to purchase and buy the seat back.' Attendees booed as she mentioned Yass and AIPAC. She stressed the importance of showing the world and 'the people in that big White House' that Lee 'is not alone,' and reminded voters that Tuesday's primary is the first of several challenges to members of the Squad, including Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri.\nVoters here frequently bring up their faith when describing their vote, and religious leaders have expressed strong opinions about the candidates. Last fall, 40 Pittsburgh rabbis and cantors wrote an open letter denouncing Lee for being one of only nine Democrats to vote against a resolution avowing support for Israel and condemning Hamas. In a follow-up letter in March, many of the same rabbis and cantors accused her of using 'divisive language, which, at times, we have perceived as openly antisemitic.'\nAdvertisement\nIn Squirrel Hill, home to a politically active and sizable Jewish community, the 14th Ward Independent Democratic Club, a local group that's not formally affiliated with the party, endorsed Patel this year after backing Lee two years ago.\n'Some people are not interested in combating antisemitism, and they're not interested in hearing and talking with and representing the Jewish community in the same way they necessarily are other communities,' said Jeremy Kazzaz, a member of the club's board and the president of the Beacon Coalition, a recently launched organization that aims to provide 'voter education on issues of concern to the Jewish American community' and that has endorsed Patel.\nBut the city's religious communities are far from united behind either candidate.\n'This has been a very, very painful couple of years for the Pittsburgh Jewish community,' said Jared Magnani, 55. He is supporting Lee, noting he was 'proud of her for the rapidity of her response calling for a cease-fire' because 'just because we're American Jews, it doesn't mean that Israel merits an exemption from allegations of significant human rights abuses and crimes against humanity.'\nWeidman's husband, Larry, 71, said he seriously considered supporting Patel before deciding to vote for Lee. 'But it was never because of comments that Summer Lee made right after Oct. 7,' he said. 'Some of the comments that she made, they're not so out of the mainstream now.'",

But the move only intensified infighting among House Republicans, who split sharply on the strategy to deliver assistance to foreign allies including Ukraine and Israel.\nIn social media posts and TV interviews afterward, House Republicans took aim at one another — in unusually sharp terms — over the events that led up to the vote. Ultimately, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) had to rely on a majority of Democrats to push through the most controversial piece of the package — $60 billion in aid to Ukraine for its war against Russia — in a gamble that could cost him his speakership.\n— in unusually sharp terms — over the events that led up to the vote. Ultimately, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) had to rely on a majority of Democrats to push through the most controversial piece of the package — $60 billion in aid to Ukraine for its war against Russia — in a gamble that could cost him his speakership.\n'It's my absolute honor to be in Congress, but I serve with some real scumbags,' Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Tex.) said Sunday on CNN's 'State of the Union,' calling out two GOP colleagues — Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.) and Bob Good (Va.) — who have broken with Johnson and voted against other legislation proposed by the GOP majority.\nAdvertisement\nGaetz and Good have also endorsed Gonzales's primary challenger, something Johnson has warned members against doing. Gonzales's CNN comments prompted a third hard-line GOP colleague, Rep. Eli Crane (Ariz.), to announce his support for Gonzales's opponent, Brandon Herrera, a gun enthusiast with a large YouTube following.\nMost House Republicans have grown weary of colleagues who consistently vote against legislation that must be addressed rather than work to seek compromise within the party. Since eight Republicans voted with all Democrats to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), more pragmatic Republicans have become irate at the 'no' bloc of the conference and encouraged GOP leadership to punish those members.\nof colleagues who consistently vote against legislation that must be addressed rather than work to seek compromise within the party.

But in voting against conservative measures they do not believe go far enough, other Republicans say, hard-liners are weakening Johnson's hand in negotiations because the conference is not united around a set of demands.\nBut in voting against conservative measures they do not believe go far enough, other Republicans say, hard-liners are weakening Johnson's hand in negotiations because the conference is not united around a set of demands.\nAdvertisement\nThe hard-line bloc has long objected to considering further Ukraine aid without legislation to secure American borders. In a nod to such demands, Johnson proposed voting on a border security bill Saturday that largely mirrors a tough conservative proposal House Republicans passed last year. But in protest of Johnson's foreign aid proposal, three hard-liners on the House Rules Committee — GOP Reps. Chip Roy (Tex.), Ralph Norman (S.C.) and Thomas Massie (Ky.) — prevented the bill from being considered under rules that would require only a simple majority for passage.\nOther Republicans urged Johnson to still put the bill up for a vote under rules that would require two-thirds of the House for passage. The measure fell short.\n'Those who voted to fund Ukraine's borders instead of America's KNEW for certainty that the separate (unattached to Ukraine) border security was going to die in the Senate, and are now dying for cover — so they're casting blame,' Roy said after the vote on X. 'Own it.'\nAdvertisement\nRep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) shot back at Roy on X, saying the 'isolationist Republicans' were standing in the way of at least forcing Senate Democrats to take a politically difficult vote on border security.\non border security.\nRep. Dan Bishop (R-N.C.) came to Roy's defense.\n'After each sellout, once the fury of Republican voters sets in, the self-serving lies begin,' Bishop said in his own post directed at Barr.\nMassie told Barr, a fellow Kentucky Republican, to 'quit blaming conservatives for your votes.'\nThe intraparty fights have spilled over on to the campaign trail, where Gaetz has taken the lead in ignoring Johnson's warnings and campaigning against GOP colleagues. Gaetz visited San Antonio last month to hold a rally with Herrera where he bashed Gonzales and pushed for a more aggressive GOP conference.\nThere is no love lost with Gonzales.\nAdvertisement\n'Matt Gaetz, he paid minors to have sex with him at drug parties,' Gonzales claimed Sunday, referencing allegations against Gaetz that the Department of Justice investigated but declined to prosecute last year.\nbut declined to prosecute last year.\nThe House Ethics Committee is still investigating Gaetz, who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and said Sunday on X that Gonzales was 'laundering lies on CNN.'\nGonzales also targeted Good for his support of Herrera, apparently referencing a report by Jewish Insider that cited instances of Herrera posting videos 'replete with imagery, music and jokes about the Nazi regime and the Holocaust.'\n'Bob Good endorsed my opponent, a known neo-Nazi,' Gonzales said. 'These people used to walk around with white hoods at night; now they're walking around with white hoods in the daytime.'\nAfter Gonzales's CNN interview, Herrera objected to the congressman's characterization of him as a 'neo-Nazi,' writing on X: 'This is the death spiral ladies and gentlemen. He has to cry to his liberal friends about me, because Republicans won't listen anymore.'\nAdvertisement\nFor Johnson, the infighting looms over his fate as speaker.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) had promised to try to remove Johnson from the speakership if he moved Ukraine aid, but she held back in hopes that her colleagues hear from angry constituents before returning to Washington.\nMassie, who co-sponsored Greene's resolution to oust Johnson, said he hopes Johnson resigns and predicted that if he does not, someone could trigger a 'motion to vacate' even though much of the Republican conference does not want to devolve into chaos again.\nIn a tense Tuesday evening meeting with Johnson and several rank-and-file Republicans, Gaetz told the speaker that if he moved ahead with his foreign aid plan that GOP colleagues would seek to oust him. He also threatened others in the room, saying the far-right bloc would target them on social media and campaign against them.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, some GOP critics of the hard-line faction have advocated for leadership to take harsher measures against the bloc.\nLast week during a meeting with the speaker and lawmakers of the conservative Main Street Caucus, who prioritize governing, conversations revolved around how to punish members based on what could improve House functions. Several members suggested removing the three hard-liners — Roy, Massie and Norman — who sit on the House Rules Committee.",

We'll be publishing accounts from these writers at key moments leading up to Election Day. Dave Barry: We Floridians are hopeful (for a meteor strike)\nGreetings from the Sunshine State! The mood down here, as we anticipate the 2024 presidential election, is one of hopefulness. Specifically, we're hoping that a large, previously undetected meteor will strike the planet before November. Granted, this would mean the end of human civilization, but at least we wouldn't have to go through with the election.\nHa ha! I'm kidding, of course. No, wait, I'm not. Floridians are wildly unexcited about this election. I know this because I have personally spoken to nearly six of the state's 23 million residents — in professional journalism, we call this 'assessing the public mood' — and in every single case, when the election came up, these residents assumed the facial expression of a person who has just opened the door to a port-a-potty on the last day of a midsummer chili festival.\nThis is not to say Floridians don't care about the issues. For example, we're deeply concerned about the border. I don't mean the border with Mexico; I mean the border with Georgia. That's how the New Yorkers are getting in. Tens of thousands of them move to Florida every year, lured by our abundant sunshine, our low taxes, our relaxed standards regarding the storage of highly classified government documents and our policy of permitting people to continue to legally drive long past the point where they have essentially the same neural reaction time as a zucchini.\nAdvertisement\nThe problem is, the New Yorkers are buying property down here, and they're very aggressive. If you go to a party and have too much to drink, you could very well wake up the next morning to discover you sold your house to a New Yorker. I myself have done this a half-dozen times, and it has to stop.\nAnother issue we have in Florida is bears on crack. I am not making this issue up. The Florida legislature recently passed a bill that would relax the penalties for killing bears, and one of the sponsors, Rep. Jason Shoaf (R), made the following statement (Google it if you don't believe me): 'We're talking about the ones that are on crack, and they break your door down, and they're standing in your living room growling and tearing your house apart. When you run into one of these crack bears, you should be able to shoot it, period.'\nPeriod!\nOf course, these are not the only issues we Floridians care about. We don't live in a bubble down here. We're well aware that the nation faces critical challenges, both at home and abroad, and as the presidential election approaches, we share the same concern felt by all Americans in these uncertain times, namely: What happens if some New Yorkers buy a house occupied by crack bears? In that scenario, my money would be 100 percent on the New Yorkers. But I think we can agree, as a nation, that it would be fun to find out.\nDave Barry is a novelist and a former humor columnist for the Miami Herald.\nDave Barry is a novelist and a former humor columnist for the Miami Herald.\nAngela Garbes: This election is as exciting as Washington's dreary weather\nIn much of Washington state, winter consists of approximately six months of interminable gray and drizzle. Survival means endurance — living in perpetual dampness and managing your expectations. When the sun makes its brief, brilliant appearance in March, you mustn't get your hopes up; it will be months before you can reliably count on sunshine and blue skies.\nIt seems a little basic to turn the weather of the Pacific Northwest into a metaphor for this year's presidential election, but if the cloud cover fits …\nAny buzz surrounding the state primaries, which were settled weeks ago, has mostly faded. Both President Biden and Donald Trump won handily. The prevailing sentiment of Washingtonians runs along the lines of 'Meh, what does it matter, they don't even campaign here.' Indeed, neither candidate visited Washington state ahead of its primary elections, and it's unlikely they will spend much time campaigning here for the general.\nThough Biden garnered 84 percent of the Democratic vote, 10 percent of party voters marked 'uncommitted delegates' as a way of officially registering their discontent with the president's financial and military support of the Israeli genocide of Palestinians. It was another tactic in the regular series of nonviolent protests in the past five months that have shut down Seattle's Space Needle; clogged Interstate 5, the highway that runs through Seattle's city center; disrupted city council meetings in Spokane; and seen high school and university students walk out of classrooms across the state.\nAdvertisement\nTrump won the Republican primary easily with 76 percent, though Nikki Haley — who dropped out of the race a week before the primary — still garnered nearly 20 percent of party votes. The familiar liberal-conservative divide found across the United States corresponds to urban-rural areas of Washington. In small towns across Washington, where properties are bigger, Trump flags and banners also tend to be large. But if you look closely, many are weathered and dirty, having endured four years of elements and hanging outside. They flap in the wind, passive, with the same sort of resignation found in voters.\nBiden will almost certainly win Washington in the general, but there's no sense of pride, excitement or energy around this fact. 'We've been reading for months how the election will come down to 10,000 votes in like six states,' a father at an elementary school pickup said. Washingtonians, like so many Americans, understand this as a rematch between two old men no one seems to particularly like. The election will come down to the same battleground states far from our corner of the country, and we'll sit back and watch. Summer will come and go, warming our skin and spirits. But by November, we'll have settled back into the familiar gloom.\nAngela Garbes is a nonfiction author based in Seattle.\nAngela Garbes is a nonfiction author based in Seattle.\nMelissa Fay Greene: Look to Atlanta's ever-changing suburbs\nAriel Baverman, an agent for Coldwell Banker Realty, sells homes north of Atlanta to a diverse array of clients in neighborhoods that once epitomized White flight. Her territory includes counties her Jewish parents once felt uncomfortable driving through. It includes long-ago 'sundown towns,' so named because Black people would find themselves in extreme peril if still in the vicinity after dark.\nReal estate promotions now describe these towns — with their boutiques, coffee shops, breweries and alfresco dining — as 'cute.' 'You know, they'll have the cute railroad tracks that go through downtown,' Baverman says. 'You can have brunch and walk around and shop. The bookstores host children's authors. There's live music.'\nBig houses with front porches and deep backyards are more affordable out here than their equivalents near most big cities. With nearly 328,000 transplants in 2022, Georgia ranks fifth-highest in the number of residents who lived in a different state the previous year. Thousands are unpacking in precincts that voted for Donald Trump in a landslide in 2016 and in 2020 delivered Georgia to Joe Biden. 'Republicans like breweries and walkable neighborhoods, too,' says Bernard Fraga, associate professor of political science at Emory University. 'But young people move more and highly educated young people move even more — they're the ones who have the money to move around — and those cohorts are, on average, more liberal. Outsiders still see these counties as conservative strongholds, like in the 1980s. As they turn purple, some observers mistakenly conclude: ‘Older white voters must be rejecting Trump and favoring Democrats again.' That's not the case.'\nAdvertisement\nThey're turning purple because older White voters are being swamped by newcomers. 'Georgia is purple at the federal level,' Fraga continues, 'and still very red at the state level, but people from East Coast and West Coast cities see Atlanta now as one of these cool destinations where they'll be okay. Atlanta is a beacon.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBaverman recently helped a Seattle couple buy a spacious house in Acworth, northwest of Atlanta. They worked remotely and couldn't afford Seattle. 'They literally told me that once all the other priorities checked out, they wanted a state where their votes would matter.\n'I drove around Lawrenceville with an Atlanta family looking for more space and less traffic,' she continues. '‘Don't Tread on Me' and ‘Let's Go Brandon!' signs and banners were everywhere that day. The couple found the perfect house, but the wife said, ‘I don't feel safe here.'' They ended up buying in a neighborhood where yards signs are not permitted, even though the surrounding area — Cherokee County — was super conservative. 'However those people were voting,' Baverman tells me, 'they kept it to themselves.'\nTogether, we look at BestNeighborhood.org, a site frequented by real estate agents. It offers detailed maps of political diversity, county by county, with the commentary: 'Southern states are considered quite Republican, but the map below shows that variation exists everywhere.'\nCherokee County was so red, it looked burgundy, with a sprinkling of tiny blue dots. 'Are those the Democrats?' I ask. 'Like, three Democrats live east of Holly Springs?'\nBaverman laughs. 'No,' she says, 'I think those are ponds.'\nMelissa Fay Greene is a nonfiction author based in Atlanta.\nMelissa Fay Greene is a nonfiction author based in Atlanta.\nJohn Grogan: My Pennsylvania community wasn't always like this\nThe banner was hard to miss. Three feet tall and some 15 feet long, it stretched across the garage of a modest house a few blocks from mine in our little town.

Our Pennsylvania Dutch roots run deep, but so do our vibrant Hispanic, Middle Eastern and African communities.\nAdvertisement\nI've lived here for a quarter of a century and always considered my adopted home to be a place of moderate, mild-mannered folks who all got along pretty well. Conversations tended to focus on family and our tomato harvests. Then came 2016 and the ascension of Donald Trump as divider in chief and normalizer of egregious behavior. I have watched dinner parties devolve into shouting matches, friendships end and neighbors stop talking. It's a new age of hostility and incivility. From my observation, most of the vitriol is coming from the die-hard defenders of Trump and is aimed at anyone who dares disagree. As yet another yard sign in my town put it: ' Blank your feelings.'\nBlank your feelings.'\nFor months, on my walks, I considered knocking on my neighbor's door and having a respectful conversation. 'Knock yourself out with your Trump signs,' I wanted to say, 'but could you please cool it with the angry obscenities? Could you show a little respect?' But, of course, like all the mild-mannered among us, I avoided what I knew would be an uncomfortable confrontation.\nAnd then one day, I walked by, and the weathered banner was gone. Could it be? Could my neighbor have finally realized there are more constructive ways to voice a political point? The answer, I regret to report, is no. Within days, a new banner was up in its place. This one proclaimed: 'Biden Sucks.' Which I will take as a small victory in the decency wars. At least these words I can repeat in a family newspaper.\nJohn Grogan is a nonfiction author and former columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer.\nJohn Grogan is a nonfiction author and former columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer.\nCharles Yu: In Orange County, the 2024 campaign goes on spring break\nSeven months out, the election is everywhere, but it comes to me largely through my phone. As the survivors of California's jungle primaries look toward November, the waves of emails and texts — bolded and capped and full of exclamation points — have subsided. For now.\nTraveling from Orange County to Los Angeles International Airport to D.C. not long ago, I did not see a single MAGA hat. No bumper stickers, either, for President Biden or Donald Trump. I did not overhear one conversation about the election in the security line, the boarding line, on the plane, in the hotel, in the hotel gym, in a restaurant. In the airport shuttle, the driver was listening to show tunes.\nFriends, wanting to stay friends, have learned the lessons of 2016 and 2020. We talk about it behind closed doors, with spouses and children. Or we just talk less about it because we already discussed it. And what good did it do? Did anything any of us said actually change anyone's mind? It's hard to continue a conversation when the starting point is: 'I just don't really like either of them.' Eight years ago, I was looking to argue. Four years ago, I was watching the news at home. This year, I'm staying mostly quiet. Because what do I know? About anything? Am I so sure I'm right?\nEveryone's shouting online and on television. As Irvine (and the rest of this formerly solid red county) continues its shift from purple to blue, the talk is of local races, not national, and the chatter is about Shohei Ohtani, or college admissions, or the rain.\nAt the National Archives, my family and I shuffled through security, climbed the stairs to the rotunda, waited in line to see the founding documents. It was the longest line we encountered. The atmosphere was electric. The crowd was comprised almost entirely of student groups and families. Museum staff directed us: You all are forming lines. Why?\nThere is no line. Just human nature. It's funny and true, but I can't figure out which way it cuts. Are we sheep? Or just self-organizing? Don't be shy, they tell us. Get in there, get a good look and move on so the next person can see.\nWhen it was our turn, we found ourselves being crowded out by an eager family. The dad kept pushing through, taking and retaking photos. For his personal collection? For posterity? His daughter recited portions of the text from memory. Others waited patiently while these folks got what they needed from this experience. And I was momentarily irritated by their lack of awareness until I realized: This is what exclamation points look like in real life. These people are just really excited about the Constitution.",

            "summary": "A bipartisan coalition in the House, led by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), has overcome a key procedural hurdle to advance a $95 billion foreign aid bill, despite objections from far-right lawmakers.\nfrom far-right lawmakers.\nThe vote now puts the legislation to fund Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan on a likely track of passing the House Saturday and comes after Israel carried out a strike on Iran early Friday in retaliation for a barrage of missiles and drones launched last weekend, an Israeli official said.\nThe latest news from the Middle East did not appear to change the likelihood that the House would pass more aid to Israel, despite some Democrats being bluntly critical of the mounting civilian casualties in Gaza. Most Republicans are expected to back it includes humanitarian aid for Gaza, which Democrats want.\nA rare coalition of Democrats and Republicans — 316 — voted overwhelmingly to pass the procedural measure, known as a rule, to advance the four-part legislation Friday morning. In a sign of how tenuous this move is for Republicans, more Democrats — 165 — voted for the rule than Republicans — 151.\nAdvertisement\nThis is a pivotal moment for Johnson who has held the speaker's gavel for nearly six months as he has had to navigate infighting among Republicans over disparate views on policy and tactics. But Relying on the support of Democrats could cost Johnson his job as speaker of the House as at least two Republicans — Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) — angry that he is advancing money for Ukraine without first locking down the southern border, are threatening to trigger a motion to remove Johnson.\nIt was unclear Friday morning when such a vote would be triggered.\nLawmakers in support of the legislation praised the rare show of bipartisanship on the House floor Friday morning.\nRep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a senior member of the party and chair of the Appropriations Committee, said, 'I'm so proud of members on both sides of the aisle'\nAdvertisement\nRules Ranking Member Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said he is pleased the series of bills will advance despite his 'deep, deep problems about the unconditioned aid to Israel. I was among the first calling for a ceasefire.'\nRep. Michael Burgess (R-Tex.), chair of the Rules Committee, said he wishes border security was part of this package of bills but, \"the requirement for America to assert itself as the leader of the free world is not optional, it's not a requirement we can put on pause.'\nJohnson's plan is to put the four votes on the floor on Saturday, with voting starting midday.\nOne bill provides $60 billion for Ukraine. Most of the money goes to U.S. weapons manufacturers to build back depleted U.S. weapons supply and about 20 percent of that goes directly to the country in the form of a loan. The president can cancel Ukraine's debt, however, after November 15, 2024.\nAdvertisement\nA second bill would provide about $17 billion in offensive and defensive weapons for Israel as well as just over $9 billion in humanitarian aid for Gaza and elsewhere. The third bill would provide $8.1 billion for the Indo-Pacific region to deter China and a fourth bill is full of Republican priorities, including banning TikTok and seizing Russian assets.\nEach bill, because they will be voted on separately, will have a different coalition of members supporting them.\nThe House will also vote Saturday under special rules -- because this bill did not clear the Rules Committee -- on a fifth bill full of Republican priorities to secure the border and limit migrants entering the U.S., but it is most certainly likely to fail because it will need the support of two-thirds of the House.\nSaturday under special rules -- because this bill did not clear the Rules Committee -- on a fifth bill full of Republican priorities to secure the border and limit migrants entering the U.S., but it is most certainly likely to fail because it will need the support of two-thirds of the House.\nThe bills will then go to the Senate where they will have to vote on foreign aid bills again before it can be sent to President Biden, who has endorsed the package, to sign.\nAdvertisement\nJohnson has sat on foreign aid funding passed by the Senate for more than two months as he prioritized funding the government and approving an extension of foreign surveillance legislation known as FISA. He had received a tremendous amount of pressure from different factions of his conference — with the anti-Ukraine faction loudly and publicly threatening Johnson's job while the pro-Ukraine funding faction quietly lobbied him behind the scenes.\nan extension of foreign surveillance legislation known as FISA. He had received a tremendous amount of pressure from different factions of his conference — with the anti-Ukraine faction loudly and publicly threatening Johnson's job while the pro-Ukraine funding faction quietly lobbied him behind the scenes.\nUltimately, Johnson decided to advance funding to Ukraine, defending his decision Tuesday as 'the right thing' to do. But he wasn't able to muscle it through relying on just Republican votes with his slim majority, having to depend instead on a significant number of Democrats as 55 members of his conference didn't back Friday morning's procedural measure. More than three dozen Democrats defected, most of them the most liberal in the caucus.\nDemocrats stepped in. They didn't provide the votes Friday morning for the procedural vote until it became overwhelmingly clear Republicans could not pass the rule on their own. 'We won't let it fail,' one senior Democratic aide said.\nAdvertisement\nDemocrats have been signaling they would support Johnson but they withheld an outright announcement, wanting to ensure that they weren't going to be forced to take votes on overtly political amendments as well as ensure the bill was structured so that funding for Ukraine would actually pass.\nDemocrats first sin that they'd help Johnson came as the clock approached midnight Thursday. The four Democrats on the Rules Committee provided their votes, a rare bipartisan move in the partisan Rules Committee, to allow the legislation to advance to the House floor as three far-right Republicans, Massie, Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) and Chip Roy (R-Texas), bucked their party by voting against it. It was the first time Massie has opposed a rule in committee since he was put there by former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).\nUkraine funding has deeply divided a dysfunctional Republican Party and some Republicans are urging Johnson to be more forceful and seize control of the House and his party. Republicans from the conservative Main Street Caucus, one of the GOP's five ideological groups, urged Johnson to penalize members who block regular order and vote 'no' on rules, according to multiple Republicans.\nAdvertisement\nBut Johnson refused Thursday to raise the number of Republicans needed to threaten his job — known as a 'motion to vacate,' which for now can be brought by just one Republican.\nGreene told reporters Thursday that she would 'absolutely' move forward with her motion if Johnson attempts to raise the threshold required to oust him.\nIntraparty tensions are reaching a boiling point. A verbal altercation erupted on the House floor Thursday morning when Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.) got into a heated argument, aggressively daring members of the Freedom Caucus to introduce their measure to oust Johnson and calling Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) 'tubby,' according to a person who witnessed the argument. Gaetz responded by asking Van Orden if he has an IQ over 40, a Gaetz spokesperson said.",

            "excerpt": "Democratic Senate hopefuls Angela D. Alsobrooks and Rep. David Trone lay out why they should be the one to take on Maryland's former GOP governor Larry Hogan.",
            "summary": "In their first televised primary debate, Rep. David Trone and Prince George's County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks each sought to position themselves as the Democratic Party's best chance of defeating the state's popular, two-term former Republican governor in November.\nWith similar stances on key issues such as education and reproductive rights, the leading Democrats in the race for U.S. Senate emphasized contrasting experience in making their pitch to primary voters — all while agreeing on the stakes. The race is one of a handful of contests across the country with the power to determine control of the chamber in November, which Democrats currently hold by a razor-thin margin.\nTrone, a multimillionaire founder of Total Wine & More, highlighted his record in Congress, his business experience and a challenging upbringing over the course of an hour-long live program on Fox45 and WJLA7. Alsobrooks, who was previously Prince George's state's attorney, pointed to her own experiences as a woman and mother, her criminal justice background and her record leading the state's second-most populous county.\nAdvertisement\nTrone swiftly declared victory in a news release after the debate. Alsobrooks hailed her 'standout performance.' Each claimed momentum heading into the next phase of the contest.\nAs May 14 approaches, attention is building on what had largely been seen as a sleepy contest for a reliably blue seat until Hogan launched a surprise bid two months ago. Endorsements are flying, yards signs are popping up and airwaves are thrumming with campaign messaging — and money.\nThis week alone saw the liberal super PAC Fight Corporate Monopolies launch the cycle's first negative ad, swiping at Trone's business practices and comparing him to former Republican president Donald Trump. On Wednesday, Hogan deployed a nearly $1 million television ad buy half bankrolled by national Republicans eager to flip the open Senate seat red.\nAdvertisement\nNational dollars are flowing into a contest that had been largely shaped by Trone's deep pockets. He has loaned his campaign at least $41.7 million since the start of the primary race, campaign finance records show.\nAlsobrooks, an underdog in the race, according to recent polls, repeatedly focused attention on Trone's fortunes and interrogated his argument that self-funding helps insulate him from special interests — repeating a line of attack she and her surrogates have raised about him 'buying' the seat.\nDuring the debate, she took aim at contributions Trone has made in a personal capacity and through his company, Total Wine & More, to conservative leaders such as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) who have worked to quash abortion access.\nThat fact, she said, contrasts with a record of giving that Trone has touted. He helped establish an abortion clinic in Western Maryland near the border with West Virginia after that state effectively shut down the procedure.\nAdvertisement\n'He cannot claim credit for the good his company does and distance himself from the bad that it does,' Alsobrooks said.\nTrone, in turn, swatted at her accusations by insinuating her interests would lie with companies that have supported her campaign, referencing by name Exxon, Pfizer and Cigna.\n'When you take the money … then they must expect something [of politicians],' Trone said. 'They're not charities.'\nAlsobrooks has brought in more individual contributions than any other candidate so far, and filings show she has just under $3.2 million on hand. Still, Alsobrooks's performance Friday carried extra weight in a race with lopsided resources at a time when she is seeking to boost name recognition.\nPolls released over the past six weeks show Trone consistently leading her, and Hogan, who left office last year with high favorability ratings, leading them both.\nHogan has maintained that he is an underdog in a state where registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans 2 to 1. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll conducted in March found that while Hogan is better known than Trone and Alsobrooks, he faces a crosscurrent Democrats hope to exploit: Maryland voters said by a 20-point margin that they prefer Democratic control of the U.S. Senate.\nHogan was out front in a poll released this week by FOX45 News, the Baltimore Sun and the University of Baltimore and conducted by OpinionWorks. The results show Trone leading Alsobrooks, 49 percent to 28 percent.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Trone on Friday detailed a bipartisan spirit he said helped him compete with Hogan, Alsobrooks took the opportunity to question a record of political giving to the man he hopes to beat. In 2014, eight of Trone's businesses gave $30,000 to Hogan in an effort to help him get rid of campaign debt, The Post reported.\n'What we don't need is a Larry Hogan donor trying to take on Larry Hogan in the fall,' Alsobrooks said.\nAmong the sharpest jabs Friday was an exchange on endorsements, with Trone noting he had secured the support of prominent politicians from the county Alsobrooks represents.\nOn Thursday, he received an endorsement from Aisha Braveboy (D), the Prince George's County state's attorney who holds Alsobrooks's former position. Democratic Prince George's County Council members Krystal Oriadha and Edward Burroughs III — both of whom have endorsed Trone and been critical of Alsobrooks in the past — were in the studio Friday, at times huddling around Trone during commercial breaks.\nAdvertisement\n'The folks that really matter the most are those that know you the best,' Trone said. 'Prince George's County supports us. The list goes on and on and on.'\nAlsobrooks has picked up Democratic heavyweights from the local to the federal level. Among her supporters are Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Rep. Jamie Raskin and former Prince George's county executive Rushern Baker IV.\nThe pair didn't spar over topics such as the Israel-Hamas war, on which they both agree that Hamas should be defeated, a cease-fire is needed and that hostages must be released. They also said cities should have access to federal data currently withheld from the public to enhance law enforcement's ability to trace guns and quell crime.\nand that hostages must be released. They also said cities should have access to federal data currently withheld from the public to enhance law enforcement's ability to trace guns and quell crime.\nBoth contenders have made protecting abortion rights a centerpiece of their campaign, tapping into an issue that has galvanized voters since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the constitutional right to abortion.\nprotecting abortion rights a centerpiece of their campaign, tapping into an issue that has galvanized voters since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the constitutional right to abortion.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAdvertisement\nThey have sought to paint Hogan, who would not say in an interview whether he would codify abortion protections in federal law, as an enemy of reproductive rights. Hogan said he would not vote for a national abortion ban, but he also said he would not take a position on hypothetical legislation that would codify Roe v. Wade .\nRoe v. Wade.\nCracks in their positions appeared when asked about repealing the death penalty.\nAlsobrooks supported the death sentence of a man convicted of killing four people including two children when she was Prince George's state's attorney, a panelist noted. But as the federal government reconsiders the death penalty, Alsobrooks noted that she, too, has evolved on the issue.\nMarylanders have decided that the death penalty is no longer the law of the land in Maryland, 'and I agree with Maryland voters,' Alsobrooks said. I can tell you that I would also not support the death penalty on the federal level. … Having said that, what I believe is that anyone who harms a child or who murders a child in particular deserves the stiffest penalty available to that person. And right now in Maryland, that penalty is life without parole.\nIn his rebuttal, Trone emphasized his steadfast opposition to it. 'It's clearly cruel and unusual punishment, and it's clearly racist,' he said.\nEarly voting in Maryland's Democratic and Republican primaries begins May 2.",

            "summary": "Donald Trump, whose social media posts fueled his improbable rise to the presidency, has found a new use for his favorite political tool — as ammunition in his legal battle against charges that he falsified business records in New York.\nThat strategy became clear on the second day of jury selection on Tuesday, as Trump lawyer Todd Blanche repeatedly used old social media posts by prospective jurors to argue that the judge should remove them from the panel for bias.\nBehind the scenes, Trump's defense team is scrambling to find and review potential jurors' social media accounts, and when they find ones critical of the former president and presumptive GOP presidential nominee, they are racing to show them to the judge to try to get those people dismissed.\nThe turnaround time for such work is tight — lawyers on the case have been given lists of names of potential jurors, some of whom they have to start questioning in a matter of hours, according to a person familiar with the work, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal operations.\nAdvertisement\nThe defense team is worried it will have to overcome long odds to win an acquittal from jurors drawn from liberal Manhattan, according to people familiar with their thinking who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. On Wednesday, Trump issued a social media post calling it the '2nd Worst Venue in the Country.'\nTo fight back against what he says is an inherently unfair jury pool, Trump's defense team hired a jury consulting firm that is analyzing all posts from jurors, according to the person, who declined to identify the firm.\nThat is not a particularly novel strategy among wealthier defendants who can afford to pay for such work, but it is unique in that it is being applied in a case involving Trump, someone about whom millions of Americans have gossiped, joked, criticized and praised for years — meaning there is far more potential social media material for his lawyers to seize on.\nin a case involving Trump, someone about whom millions of Americans have gossiped, joked, criticized and praised for years — meaning there is far more potential social media material for his lawyers to seize on.\nAdvertisement\nBut that work exploring the social media posts of potential jurors is happening under tremendous time pressure.\nNew York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan has been focused on moving jury selection along quickly — seven jurors were sworn in after less than a day and a half of jury selection earlier this week. Ultimately, the process will select 12 jurors and six alternates.\n'We had to rush to get all the research done and will have to rush again' on Thursday, when jury selection resumes, said one person familiar with the effort.\nThat digging is made more difficult by the fact that Manhattan has so many people, meaning it is more difficult to ensure they are reviewing posts from the right person with any given name. In addition, any one person might use multiple social media accounts under nicknames or pseudonyms.\nAdvertisement\nThe jury in this case is partly anonymous — their names are known to the lawyers in the case but will not be made public.\nSome on the defense team wonder if, now that they showed their tactic in open court, some prospective jurors will start deleting old online posts before court resumes Thursday, this person said.\nTrump spokesman Steven Cheung said the charges against the former president were unfair and deliberately filed in jurisdictions that are most hostile to him.\n'The deck has been stacked against President Trump in a gross abuse of our legal system, wherein his persecutors have deliberately targeted some of the most Democrat-heavy jurisdictions in the country to bring forth their bogus cases,' Cheung said.\nTrump's defense team used old social media posts to argue against the person in the very first seat of the jury box.\nAdvertisement\nBlanche said that woman 'has a series of extraordinarily hostile Facebook posts.'\nMerchan appeared confused by Blanche's assessment. The post at issue was a video on Facebook of a spontaneous street celebration for Joe Biden's 2020 election victory, with comments suggesting she was also happy about the result.\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass called the claim 'ridiculous.'\nQuestioned about it in court, the woman explained that she found herself witnessing a historic event near her home when she left the house to move her car that day, and she emphasized that she knew she could still be a fair juror.\nIf Merchan decides a person would not be fair and impartial, he can excuse any prospective juror. Otherwise, if either side objects, they too can strike some jurors from the panel — but each side only gets 10 so-called peremptory challenges.\nAdvertisement\nIn the matter of the prospective juror's old Facebook video, the judge refused to dismiss her for cause, so Blanche used one of Trump's challenges to dismiss her. The back-and-forth made it clear the defense was scrambling, even as his lawyers argued in court, to do quick searches on the people who seemed most likely to be chosen as jurors from a larger pool that had been summoned for jury duty.\nTrump's defense team has taken the position that old critical or mocking online statements about him are evidence of bias and grounds for removal. Steinglass argued that in many instances, the age of the posts alone may make them largely irrelevant, not to mention that some of those raised in court appeared to be internet humor.\nOn Tuesday, Merchan's judgment on the social media hewed closer to the prosecutors, but he did agree with the defense that one old comment crossed the line.\nAdvertisement\nIn that instance, the prospective juror years ago had written 'lock him up' in reference to Trump, who was president at the time.\n'Everyone knows that if Mr. Trump is found guilty in this case, he faces a potential jail sentence, which would be ‘lock up,'' Merchan said. 'I don't think that I can allow this juror to remain.'\nAt Merchan's mention of the possibility of jail, Trump shook his head slightly in disgust.\nSo far, the judge has been mostly skeptical of the defense claims of dangerous bias exhibited by old social media posts.\nJurors questioned in court about their old social media posts were often defensive and dismissive of the suggestion that the old posts revealed anything important about their views or ability to be fair.\n'If you look at my social media, you can see there is very little on there that I post now that has anything to do with politics, it got too vitriolic for people, people that I knew for years,' said one woman who had posted political parody and humor items in 2018 that the defense said showed she was anti-Trump. 'I may have posted this, but I learned a good lesson from it.'\nAdvertisement\nIf the judge continues to disagree with the defense's arguments about most of the jurors' social media posts, Trump could burn through his allotted number of challenges quickly and be left with little say over the remaining members of the panel. Trump is also allowed two peremptory challenges for every alternate juror.\nIn court Tuesday, Blanche suggested he might make future challenges to juror selections based on additional discoveries of social media posts related to his client.\nMerchan said the pace of jury selection means opening statements could take place Monday, and if that schedule holds, Trump's online researchers have only a few days more to try to influence the makeup of the jury.\nIncreasingly, courts have had to wrestle with problematic social media posts that came to light only after a jury is seated or after a verdict has been rendered.\nAdvertisement\nThat was the case in the prosecution of longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone, who tried to get his conviction for lying to Congress dismissed after finding out that the forewoman of his jury had posted on social media about his arrest and posted again shortly after his conviction.",

            "excerpt": "The former attorney general foresaw the problem with a law being used to charge Jan. 6 rioters in a Supreme Court case the justices heard on Tuesday.",
            "summary": "In 2018, as a private citizen and former attorney general, William P. Barr sent the Justice Department a 19-page memo criticizing the theory of obstruction that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was using to pursue President Donald Trump. The memo became public after Trump nominated Barr to lead the Justice Department. Democrats and liberal commentators assailed it and defended Mueller, but in 2019 Barr was confirmed anyway and sworn in as attorney general.\nThe obstruction issue faded after the Mueller investigation ended with a whimper later that year. Barr resigned as attorney general after the 2020 election over Trump's efforts to overturn it. But six years after his memo, in a case arising from the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, the Supreme Court might finally vindicate Barr's legal reasoning and repudiate Mueller's. There are lessons in this saga about the law's unpredictability — and insights for the justices as they grapple with the scope of prosecutorial power in the political system.\nRecall, if you can, 2018. Mueller was at work probing allegations that Trump's campaign secretly colluded with Russia during the 2016 election. No charges for collusion were ever brought, but Mueller investigated at length whether Trump committed a crime by obstructing the investigation — including by asking then-FBI Director James B. Comey to go easy on Michael Flynn, who was briefly Trump's national security adviser. Barr's memo argued that Mueller's notion that Trump committed obstruction 'is premised on a novel and legally insupportable reading of the law.'\nAdvertisement\nCongress had passed the 2002 law in question — 18 U.S.C. Section 1512(c), in legalese — after the Enron corporate fraud scandal, targeting people who shredded documents to evade subpoenas. Backed by a 20-year maximum penalty, the statute prohibits 'corruptly' altering or destroying 'a record, document or other object' to impair its 'availability for use in an official proceeding' — and tacks on a prohibition against 'otherwise' obstructing or influencing a proceeding.\nThat statute, Barr wrote in his 2018 memo, 'previously has been exclusively confined to acts of evidence impairment.' But he warned, correctly as it turned out, that Mueller wanted to give 1512(c) 'a new unbounded interpretation' based on the 'otherwise' clause — turning the statute into an 'all-encompassing provision prohibiting any act influencing a proceeding if done with an improper motive.' According to Barr, that interpretation ripped the statute from its context and ignored its text and structure. It would have 'astounding' implications for government.\nexclusively confined to acts of evidence impairment.' But he warned, correctly as it turned out, that Mueller wanted to give 1512(c) 'a new unbounded interpretation' based on the 'otherwise' clause — turning the statute into an 'all-encompassing provision prohibiting any act influencing a proceeding if done with an improper motive.' According to Barr, that interpretation ripped the statute from its context and ignored its text and structure. It would have 'astounding' implications for government.\nNow the Supreme Court will have its say. Apparently unpersuaded by Barr's reasoning, the Biden administration's Justice Department has charged some 350 out of 1,300 defendants in Capitol riot cases with violating 1512(c) by disrupting the joint session of Congress. One defendant challenged the statute's application to him in Fischer v. United States , which reached the Supreme Court for oral arguments on Tuesday.\nFischer v. United States, which reached the Supreme Court for oral arguments on Tuesday.\nAdvertisement\nSolicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar, who worked on the Mueller probe, argued that 1512(c) swept far beyond evidence tampering. Any efforts to obstruct a current or future proceeding could potentially be covered, including, she conceded, nonviolent acts of protest. A majority of the justices — including President Biden's appointee, Ketanji Brown Jackson — seemed skeptical that the law could apply to conduct so different from the type it was drafted to prohibit in the wake of Enron.\nAny efforts to obstruct a current or future proceeding could potentially be covered, including, she conceded, nonviolent acts of protest.

But Barr's memo warned that 'courts have evinced a lot of confusion' over that term. Under Mueller's theory, Barr worried, controversial acts Trump took as president aimed at influencing the Justice Department could become felonies if Mueller judged that Trump had nefarious intent. That would be a subjective, political conclusion. Historically, Barr argued, corrupt obstruction of a proceeding meant something more concrete: 'compromising the honesty of a decision-maker or impairing evidence.'\nBarr's observations also foreshadowed the problems of presidential immunity that the Supreme Court will consider this week. Trump's lawyers will argue Thursday that he cannot be criminally prosecuted for 'official acts' he took as president under the logic of a 1982 Supreme Court decision that barred civil lawsuits against a president for official acts. The government (represented again by a Mueller probe veteran, Michael Dreeben) will argue that there is no such immunity.\ncivil lawsuits against a president for official acts. The government (represented again by a Mueller probe veteran, Michael Dreeben) will argue that there is no such immunity.\nAdvertisement\nTrump 'has not argued — and could not plausibly argue — that the Constitution vests the President with authority to perform the conduct prohibited by' the obstruction law, Dreeben's brief says. But Barr saw in 2018 that this was not true. The once and future attorney general was deeply concerned that an overbroad definition of obstruction would infringe on the president's constitutional duties. After all, a big part of a president's job is 'to make decisions ‘influencing' proceedings,' he observed. An untold number of proceedings take place simultaneously in the executive-branch departments and agencies the president oversees, and the president also often tries to influence Congress. If that influence can by itself be a crime based on a subjective judgment of the president's state of mind, it would seem to suggest a need for presidential immunity for the government to function.\njob is 'to make decisions ‘influencing' proceedings,' he observed.

If that influence can by itself be a crime based on a subjective judgment of the president's state of mind, it would seem to suggest a need for presidential immunity for the government to function.\nBarr's preferred solution for this constitutional problem was simply to rein in prosecutors' implausible definition of obstruction under 1512(c). As Barr explained, 'if a President knowingly destroys or alters evidence, suborns perjury, or induces a witness to change testimony ... then he, like anyone else, commits the crime of obstruction.' Under a correct reading of the obstruction law, it would 'in no way' infringe on a president's constitutional powers, Barr wrote.\nOne problem for the Biden administration is that it is asking the justices to bless a sweeping interpretation of 1512(c) at the same time it tells them there is no need for presidential immunity. It's hard to see how both of those positions could prevail.\nat the same time it tells them there is no need for presidential immunity.

The more extravagantly prosecutors construe criminal laws such as 1512(c), the greater the need for presidential immunity to prevent bullheaded prosecutors from disabling the presidency. But if the Supreme Court continues to rein in prosecutors' novel legal theories, as it likely will do in Fischer , then the president's prerogatives are less likely to be criminalized in the first place and the need for immunity is diminished.\nFischer obstruction case and the presidential immunity case.

Walking onto the stage, she performed a comedic slip after stepping on a banana peel. Since then, she has worn yellow more than any other color.\nstuffed plush banana at her crotch. Walking onto the stage, she performed a comedic slip after stepping on a banana peel. Since then, she has worn yellow more than any other color.\nAdvertisement\n'Yellow represents the color of my skin,' she said in an interview ahead of the finale of 'RuPaul's Drag Race' on Friday, preferring to let her outfits rather than her words remind viewers that she's the only Asian contestant in the season. 'By wearing yellow, I hope to raise more Asian awareness and appreciation.'\nNymphia Wind, the drag persona of 28-year-old Taiwanese American fashion designer Leo Tsao, has made it to the final three contestants, putting her on track to become only the second Asian winner in 16 years of the show's main franchise. Her first name comes from a fairy-type Pokémon character, while 'Wind' reflects her aspiration 'to be free and invisible,' she said. In Chinese, 'wind' is a homophone of 'craziness,' and that has been the mood for her fans back home ever since the announcement of her participation in the race.\nEach Saturday — the day the show airs in Taiwan — crowds pack gay bars in Taipei to watch the latest episode, wearing yellow to support the queen they call the 'Banana Buddha.' (She calls her fans the 'Banana Believers.')\nWith her ascendancy, Nymphia Wind, who was born in Los Angeles but grew up in Hong Kong and Taiwan, has found an international stage where Beijing — which often pushes Taiwan out of such spaces — has no influence and where she can promote the vibrant inclusiveness of Taiwanese society.\n'Even politicians who work hard abroad may not gain this kind of exposure for Taiwan,' said Lawrence Jheng, 32, part of a cheerful crowd gathered at a Taipei club for the airing of the episode in which Nymphia Wind would declare she was 'very proud to call myself Taiwanese.'\n'It never occurred to me that drag could have such power to break through Taiwan's diplomatic struggle,' Jheng said.\nTaiwan's place on the world stage is often overshadowed by China, which claims sovereignty over the self-governing democratic island and won't allow it to be recognized in most international organizations, including the United Nations. Its sports teams are even compelled to participate under the designation 'Chinese Taipei.'\nBut while China stifles its LGBTQ community, Taiwan has a vibrant drag scene and promotes queer rights — the island's government became the first in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage. And Nymphia Wind is becoming a cultural ambassador for that openness: She will represent Taiwan as a performer at cultural events during the Paris Olympics this summer.\n'The government of Taiwan is very supportive of gay rights. We are the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm very proud to say I'm Taiwanese,' she said.\nBeginnings of drag in Taiwan\nCross-dressing is not a new concept in Taiwan. In the years after martial law ended in 1987 and Taiwan began its transition to democracy, underground drag shows started to appear in Taipei's nightclubs. Male cross-dressers flourished on the local entertainment scene in the 1990s, performing traditional Taiwanese songs and bringing commercial success to shows that blurred gender difference.\nWestern-style drag performances took off about the same time, although usually featuring foreign queens. They became more popular as Taiwanese society became more socially liberal and inclusive, with the emergence of Taiwanese queens.\nBut Nymphia Wind's rise to stardom helped the culture broaden its mainstream appeal.\nAdvertisement\nInfluenced by K-pop girl groups in high school, she ventured into cross-dressing and later embraced drag during her fashion design studies in London. Her first performance was at a Taipei drag competition in 2018 and propelled her into the spotlight. She has since been featured in documentaries and TV programs, broadening the reach of drag culture on the island, as she continues to perform in bars.\n'Whenever she performs, she would fill the whole place with laughter,' said Alvin Chang, who has been hosting drag shows since 2001 and now runs Cafe Dalida, known as 'the birthplace of drag queens in Taiwan.' He's also hosting 'RuPaul' viewing parties.\n'She doesn't just give you a talent show. She interacts with the audience to make everyone laugh. You see her and you just feel happy,' Chang said. Nymphia Wind's mother, who has been supportive of her drag career since day one, often brings her friends to sit in the first row at the cafe to watch her perform.\nNymphia Wind still calls Cafe Dalida her 'home bar,' but that stage was not enough. In 2022, to challenge herself, she moved to New York and auditioned — successfully — for 'RuPaul's Drag Race.'\nIn the eyes of Taiwanese drag queens, Nymphia Wind has been an inspiration. 'She's ambitious and dares to dream, but she is also under immense pressure to represent such huge community,' said Bagel Rimrim, one of Nymphia Wind's six 'drag daughters,' as her protégés are known.\nas her protégés are known.\n'She always told us to stop doing things by halves and show determination, and you can see her perfectionism in her outfits,' she said. 'If I'd been able to see her performances when I grew up, I would feel less lonely and see what I could become.'\nWhile Nymphia Wind is a role model for younger queens, she's trying to reach a wider — and older — audience in Taiwan.\nAdvertisement\nShe hosted a groundbreaking drag show at a Taoist temple in Taipei in October, unfurling a giant rainbow flag from a pagoda-like stage as young and old celebrated a queen who, as she put it, had 'descended from heaven to bless the queer mortals.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'Old people are my target audience. I just feel like they could have a bit more fun, you know?' she said in an interview after the temple performance.\nShe planned to continue her experimentation, incorporating traditional Asian folklore into her drag performances, and hopefully becoming a tourism ambassador for Taiwan.\n'I won't limit myself,' she declared. 'Maybe in my next temple show, I'll hop off a helicopter.'\nGrowing appeal across Asia\nNymphia Wind — who has sought to infuse her self-made outfits and her performances with Asian culture by incorporating elements such as Taiwanese opera, Japanese Butoh dance and traditional Chinese knots — is also gaining appeal across Asia. Her efforts have earned praise from judges for showcasing 'Asian excellence' on the runway, and she has been booked for shows in Japan and the Philippines.\nBut she won't be going to China any time soon.\nIn fact, Chinese fans of 'RuPaul's Drag Race' seem to be going out of their way to avoid talking about Nymphia Wind's success, apparently afraid of being caught up in the escalating tensions across the Taiwan Strait. 'Drag Race' fan accounts on the Chinese microblogging site Weibo said they would minimize discussions about Nymphia to 'protect their nascent drag scene.'\nThe episode in which she spoke about Taiwan as a country in its own right has drawn attacks on Chinese social media.\nTo capitalize on her success in the show, Nymphia Wind wants to promote drag culture across Asia.",

And that is one step removed.'\nAdvertisement\nThe FDF itself puts it more ominously on its website: 'Our confidence in the rule of law is wavering!'\n___\nThis story, supported by the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting, is part of an ongoing Associated Press series covering threats to democracy in Europe.\n___\n'DON'T LET UP!'\nIn March, protesting farmers from Belgium ran amok at a demonstration outside EU headquarters in Brussels, setting fire to a subway station entrance and attacking police with eggs and liquid manure. In France, protesters tried to storm a government building.\nIn a video from another protest, in front of burning tires and pallets, FDF leader Mark van den Oever said two politicians made him sick to his stomach, saying they would 'soon be at the center of attention.' The FDF denies this was a threat of physical violence.\nAcross the EU, over the winter, tractor convoys blockaded ports and major roads, sometimes for days, in some of the most severe farm protests in half a century.\nAdvertisement\nFarmers and the EU have had a sometimes testy relationship. What's new is the shift toward the extreme right.\nDestitute after World War II and with hunger still a scourge in winter, Europe desperately needed food security. The EU stepped in, securing abundant food for the population, turning the sector into an export powerhouse and currently funding farmers to the tune of over 50 billion euros a year.\nYet, despite agriculture's strategic importance, the EU acknowledges that farmers earn about 40% less than non-farm workers, while 80% of support goes to a privileged 20% of farmers. Many of the bloc's 8.7 million farm workers are close to or below the poverty line.\nAt the same time, the EU is seeking to push through stringent nature and agricultural laws as part of its Green Deal to make the bloc climate-neutral by 2050. Agriculture accounts for more than 10% of EU greenhouse gas emissions, from sources such as the nitrous oxide in fertilizers, carbon dioxide from vehicles and methane from cattle.\nAdvertisement\nCutting these emissions has forced short-notice changes on farmers at a time of financial insecurity. The COVID-19 pandemic and surging inflation have increased the cost of goods and labor, while farmers' earnings are down as squeezed consumers cut back.\nAnd then there's the war next door. After Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, the EU granted tariff-free access for agricultural imports from Ukraine, many of them exempt from the strict environmental standards the bloc enforces on its own producers. Imports surged from 7 billion euros in 2021 to 13 billion euros the following year, causing gluts and undercutting farmers, particularly in Poland.\n'Don't let up,' Marion Maréchal, the lead candidate for France's extreme right Reconquest! party in the June elections, exhorted farmers at a protest earlier this year. 'You have to be in the streets. You have to make yourself heard. You have to —' she tried to finish the sentence but was drowned out by shouts of 'Don't Let Up! Don't Let Up!'\nFERTILE GROUND\nFarming in Europe is about more than just food; it touches on identity. In France, the far right taps into the love of 'terroir,' that mythical combination of soil, location, culture and climate.\nAdvertisement\n'The French realize that the farmers are the roots of our society,' said Maréchal.\nSuch sentiments echo across Europe. In Ireland, where more than a million people died in the famine of 1845-1852, farming 'is deep in our culture, in our psyche,' said Environment Minister Eamon Ryan, a Green Party lawmaker.\nThe far right has used farming as a way to attack mainstream parties. In Italy, the far right has mocked the EU's efforts to promote a low-carbon diet, playing on farmers' fears that lab-grown proteins and insects could one day replace meat.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'Revolt is the language of those who are not listened to. Now, back off,' warned far-right Italian lawmaker Nicola Procaccini in February. In a few months, he said, the European elections 'will put people back in place of ideologies.'\nSuch calls fall on fertile ground. According to predictions by the European Council on Foreign Relations, the radical right Identity and Democracy group could become the third biggest overall in the next European Parliament, behind the Christian Democrats and the Socialists, but edging out the Liberals and Greens. The farm protests are providing vital leverage.\nA SPADE IS A SPADE\nOne farmer sidestepping militant demonstrations is Bart Dochy in western Belgium. As the Christian Democrat mayor of the farming town of Ledegem and a regional parliamentarian in Flanders, he represents the traditional forces in European farming communities: Christianity and conservativism. When Socialism took the big cities, the countryside and its farmers remained staunchly Christian Democrat.\nAdvertisement\nThat's now changed. Once, billboards with the cry, 'Save our farmers!' would have come from his party; now, they bear the logo of the far-right Flemish Interest, predicted by polls to become the biggest party in Belgium in June.\n'In a sense it is only logical that the extreme parties have specialized in capturing that discontent. They call a spade a spade. And that is good,' he said. But farming is complicated, he warned: nature, trade, budgets, commodity prices and geopolitics are all involved. Solutions will have to come from common sense, 'not from the extremes.'\nDochy's Christian Democrats are part of the biggest group in the EU parliament, the European People's Party, once a strong proponent of the EU's Green Deal. Farmers, after all, are among the biggest losers from climate change, affected at different times by flooding, wildfires, drought and extreme temperatures.\nAdvertisement\nBut ever since the demonstrations started, EU politics on agriculture and climate have shifted rightwards, outraging many of the center right's old allies with whom it set up the Green Deal. Measures to reduce pesticide use and protect biodiversity have been weakened, while the protesters' demands to cut regulation have been heard.\nBut as the rhetoric heats up, so too does the climate. Data for early 2024 shows record-breaking temperatures in Europe. In Greece — where an estimated 1,750 square kilometers (675 square miles) burned in 2023, the worst fire in EU records — wildfires are already breaking out, weeks earlier than expected.\nThe far right offers no detailed solutions to the climate crisis but it has proved adept at tapping into farmers' frustrations. In its program for the June elections, the Dutch far-right party, the PVV, is short on details but big on slogans about 'climate hysteria' and its 'tsunami of rules.' Nature and climate laws, it said, 'should not lead to whole sectors being forced into bankruptcy.'\nUbels made the case for farmers' realpolitik.",

            "excerpt": "A closer look at Item No. 1 in the now-former editor's indictment of NPR's news coverage.",
            "summary": "Uri Berliner is offended.\nIn an April 9 essay in the Free Press, Berliner, who worked at NPR for 25 years, rapped his employer for allegedly running a newsroom fueled by progressive sensibilities that seep into a skewed on-air product. Stories on Trump-Russia, Hunter Biden and covid-19 have all suffered from acute NPRitis, he writes. And racial and identity considerations — as well as affinity groups — shape workplace culture.\nThe essay triggered a bona fide media drama that concluded on Wednesday with Berliner's resignation. On his way out, he delivered a parting shot at CEO Katherine Maher. 'I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new C.E.O. whose divisive views confirm the very problems at NPR I cite in my Free Press essay,' Berliner wrote on X.\nJust what had Maher done to deserve such a diss? She had published a statement pushing back against Berliner's essay: 'Questioning whether our people are serving our mission with integrity, based on little more than the recognition of their identity, is profoundly disrespectful, hurtful, and demeaning.' As NPR's own David Folkenflik reported, Berliner took exception to that commentary.\nAdvertisement\nWhich is to say, Berliner is now an expert in disparagement and umbrage. In his Free Press essay, he deplores his colleagues' 'advocacy' and alleges that it had 'veered toward efforts to damage or topple [Donald] Trump's presidency.'\nNow that is disparagement. Even in the rough-and-tumble world of journalism, slamming your colleagues for their published work — especially in another outlet — is a rare undertaking. As Berliner suggests in his essay, it was something of a last resort, considering that he had raised his concerns internally to little effect. He invited people to sample NPR's coverage and 'make their own judgment.'\nthat is disparagement. Even in the rough-and-tumble world of journalism, slamming your colleagues for their published work — especially in another outlet — is a rare undertaking. As Berliner suggests in his essay, it was something of a last resort, considering that he had raised his concerns internally to little effect. He invited people to sample NPR's coverage and 'make their own judgment.'\nInvitation accepted. Over the past several days, I have sifted through roughly three years' worth of NPR's coverage of Russiagate, the effort by federal investigators and the media to discover the truth about the Trump campaign's connections to Russia. Since NPR's alleged tilt on this story serves as Exhibit No. 1 in Berliner's onslaught — and since it's central to the claim that the network sought to topple Trump — I chose to limit my efforts to this portion of the essay.\nAdvertisement\nAnd what a portion it is! The NPR Russia-Trump coverage plume under fire from Berliner consists of thousands of articles, podcasts, segments and so on. Berliner links to one. His serious allegations, accordingly, are backed by scant evidence, if any at all. It's a lazy, summary approach to evaluating a large body of work — a feelings-based critique of the sort that passes for media reporting these days. Too often, essayists write their conclusory broadsides against this or that outlet, confident in the knowledge that their fellow ideological travelers will applaud no matter how threadbare the supporting material.\nFollow this author Erik Wemple 's opinions\nFollow this author\nErik Wemple\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nBerliner's opus was published by the Free Press, an outlet dedicated to covering stories 'ignored or misconstrued in the service of an ideological narrative' — and not by NPR, which requires infinitely greater substantiation for its media reporting, whether the crisis lies in its own newsroom or somewhere else.\nThe irony there: Berliner has edited many of the stories carrying the byline of Folkenflik, NPR's media correspondent. He knows better.\nAdvertisement\nHere's how Berliner supports his conclusions on NPR's Russia work: '[Rep. Adam] Schiff, who was the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, became NPR's guiding hand, its ever-present muse. By my count, NPR hosts interviewed Schiff 25 times about Trump and Russia. During many of those conversations, Schiff alluded to purported evidence of collusion. The Schiff talking points became the drumbeat of NPR news reports.'\nYes, Schiff is a recurring presence in the broadcasts. 'Like many broadcast news organizations, NPR interviewed Rep. Schiff often during the Trump administration, as he was a principal figure in the Russian interference investigation — a story we covered with caution and perspective,' says an NPR spokesperson in a statement. 'Rep. Schiff's perspective was only one element of our coverage of the Russian interference story, in no way did he commandeer the reporting of NPR.' According to the spokesperson, NPR did 900 interviews with congressional lawmakers between January 2017 and December 2019 — including Paul Ryan, Jim Jordan, Eric Swalwell and others.\nNumbers matter less than the content of those Schiff interviews, which tend toward procedural mishmash, recitation of previously reported revelations and the centrality of oversight. In this interview, Schiff says that if former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort cooperates with authorities, 'we could learn a lot more.' In this one, the congressman speaks to his committee's investigative imperatives: 'I think we need to use subpoenas, and we need to stand up and say, we're going to get the answers here.' In this one, Schiff is asked whether Trump gets 'especially agitated' when the topic turns to Russia. 'Well, absolutely,' he responds.\nAdvertisement\nIs this the prejudicial poison of which Berliner writes? We asked him to supply instances of in which Schiff's talking points suffused NPR's independent reporting. After several emails and a phone call, Berliner hasn't responded with supporting material.\nHad NPR wished to addle its lefty audience with suggestive reporting about Trump's alleged criminality regarding Russia, it had a tool at its disposal. The so-called Steele dossier, published in early January 2017 by BuzzFeed News, contained explosive allegations presented by a former British intelligence officer. Various news outlets and commentators bathed the dossier in credibility that it didn't deserve, as noted in an extensive thread by Drew Holden and a series in this space. Top offenders include McClatchy, which ran stories bolstering the dossier's claims that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen had traveled to Prague for collusive business; and dossier believer in chief Rachel Maddow of MSNBC, who cheered for the document throughout Russiagate.\nNPR's dossier work was by no means perfect. 'Fresh Air' host Terry Gross, for example, occasionally failed to properly smack down dossier boosters during interviews. Yet the outlet was careful to avoid McClatchy's 'scoops' on Cohen and otherwise to cordon off its descriptions of the dossier with police tape. 'NPR has never detailed the document because so much of it remains unproved,' reads a 2019 NPR story. The NPR spokesperson said in a statement: 'We were not able to find any examples of NPR corroborating unconfirmed elements of the Trump dossier.\"\nAdvertisement\nAs further evidence of his employer's errant ways, Berliner argues that after the Mueller report found 'no credible evidence of collusion, NPR's coverage was notably sparse. Russiagate quietly faded from our programming.' It's an immutable law of media physics, of course, that coverage peters out when a story comes to an end. Who, after all, is doing continuing coverage of Abscam these days?\nBut there's more flimsiness afoot here. Berliner's dismissal of Robert S. Mueller III's findings — technically misguided, because the special counsel's investigation didn't apply the 'concept of 'collusion'' in its work — leaves the impression that the media's pursuit of the various Russiagate strands was a fool's errand. In fact, journalists as well as official investigations documented a spreadsheet's worth of scandalous activity that didn't amount to an international conspiracy, in Mueller's view. Trump will have you believe that the absence of criminality signifies the absence of wrongdoing, a logical atrocity abetted by Berliner's essay.\ninvestigation didn't apply the 'concept of 'collusion'' in its work — leaves the impression that the media's pursuit of the various Russiagate strands was a fool's errand.

Trump will have you believe that the absence of criminality signifies the absence of wrongdoing, a logical atrocity abetted by Berliner's essay.\nDitching the nitty-gritty, Berliner's claim of an NPR campaign to 'topple' Trump grinds against the measured claims in NPR's day-to-day coverage. Examples abound. In this segment, NPR correspondents struggle to wrap their heads around the just-released Mueller report. In this one, NPR's Mary Louise Kelly interviews a former CIA official who presciently shoots down liberal fever dreams related to Russia and Trump. In this piece, published months before the Mueller report, an NPR editor argues that the Russia case is 'weakening' and even attributes an 'important kernel of truth' to the famous tweet by Trump citing 'No Smocking Gun … No Collusion.' This piece highlights Trump's point of view regarding the Mueller investigation. And this one bears the headline, 'Trumps Exult Following Reports Of No Phone Contact Ahead Of 2016 Russia Meeting.'\nAdvertisement\nFollowing the Russia experience, writes Berliner, NPR compounded its mistakes by moving on with 'no mea culpas, no self-reflection.' By all means, self-reflect — it's a good step for any news organization after a big story. Presumably, Berliner would have supplied various URLs for such a review, but he didn't share any with me. After skulking around in the NPR search box, I'd nominate the Gross interviews on the dossier and other pieces that faced challenges or turned out to be inconsistent with other reporting.\nWith his tendentious claims, however, Berliner doesn't merely overstep the paltry evidence in his piece. He positions his now-former workplace as a hive of ideologues driven by political outcomes instead of the facts — basically a left-wing analogue to Fox News. That salvo appeared to diminish his appeal as a newsroom collaborator.",

            "summary": "If Nicole Eisenman were not there to make them acquainted, the paintings she makes in the morning wouldn't recognize those she makes in the afternoon. Her artworks, the subject of a glorious career retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, feel like determined exercises in how to bear the complexity of her own mind.\nSkip to end of carousel\nThe Style section\nThe Style section Style is where The Washington Post covers happenings on the front lines of culture and what it all means, including the arts, media, social trends, politics and yes, fashion, all told with personality and deep reporting. For more Style stories, click here\nEnd of carousel\nHer prime method is dark humor. But there's plenty of room, too, for righteous anger, tenderness and love.\nEisenman, 59, is our most inventive and irreverent — and often times our most startlingly intimate — contemporary painter. Her style is really several styles, across several media — not just painting but also printmaking, collage and sculpture.\nHer best-known works combine strains of socialist realism (both parodic and sincere) with cartoons, caricatures and flattened stylizations derived from modernist abstraction. She paints elaborate political allegories, intimate depictions of loneliness and screen dependency, and beautiful, at times breathtakingly ambitious pictures of parties, protests and gatherings in beer gardens.\nAt first, as you watch Eisenman switch between modes, something about the performance can feel hammy, like a costumed reenactment of a 19th-century séance. But the drama deepens, the hammy-ness mysteriously dissolves, and you can't look away.\nEisenman likes to work on a large scale and to pack her pictures with detail. A connoisseur of textures and colored patterns, she is alive to all the different varieties of work that paint can do in any given composition. She uses the paint's facture not only to seduce but also, on occasion, to repel, converting the promise of sensuousness into ashes in the mouth.\nHeads are important to her. One gallery at the MCA is filled with them, executed in every conceivable style and medium. Important, too, are toes and hands, often bulbously enlarged, cartoonlike, peculiarly foreshortened and made to do all kinds of psychic work.\nAdvertisement\nYou can feel the influence of scores of artists behind what she does. The ones that came most often to my mind in Chicago were Max Beckmann (his taste for crowded compositions and allegory), Marsden Hartley (Eisenman's huge sculptural installation explicitly honors him), Philip Guston and Neo Rauch.\nbehind what she does. The ones that came most often to my mind in Chicago were Max Beckmann (his taste for crowded compositions and allegory), Marsden Hartley (Eisenman's huge sculptural installation explicitly honors him), Philip Guston and Neo Rauch.\nEisenman, who lives in Brooklyn, was born in France (her father was stationed there as an Army psychiatrist) and is of German-Jewish descent. She emerged in the 1990s, just as the revival in figurative painting was gathering steam. In those years, many artists, turned off by abstraction and conceptualism, felt the only viable way to make figurative art (passé for so long) was in a high ironic mode.\n'Bad painting' became the order of the day. Inspired by the naughtiness of late-period Francis Picabia, who painted girlie pinups when others were gnashing their teeth over the problem of how to live and paint authentically, many artists were moved to do precisely what their art teachers were telling them they shouldn't.\nAdvertisement\nJohn Currin and Lisa Yuskavage taught themselves to paint sexy nudes in Old Master styles. Glenn Brown painted airbrushed copies of Frank Auerbach's heavily encrusted oil paintings. Elizabeth Peyton painted delicate fangirl portraits of beautiful pop stars and young actors. Meanwhile, careening between abstraction and figuration, Martin Kippenberger, Kai Althoff and Albert Oehlen trashed the very idea of a consistent personal style, painting whatever and however they wanted.\nEisenman was heir to all this. She embraced the ambient irony and eclecticism, channeling Picabia's devil-may-care, kaleidoscopic attitude to style (Dada one minute, pseudo-classicism the next). Immersed in her queer and bohemian milieu, she painted and drew parodies of Old Masters, magazine advertisements and Disney cartoons.\nEisenman's aim, broadly speaking, was subversion. She mastered multi-figured compositions from High Renaissance and Baroque painting, emulating them with a kind of manic, mocking intensity. 'Captured Pirates on the Island of Lesbos,' for instance, plays out a castration scene in an ink wash drawing rendered in classical chiaroscuro.\nAdvertisement\nLike Currin and Yuskavage, Eisenman was interested in how the rules and conventions of established historical styles contained their own corruption, their inherent tendencies toward perversion. So she translated their religious, phallocentric subjects into broad lesbian fantasies, often stepping on taboos. One of Eisenman's Old Masterly compositions combines the innocence of a lemonade stand with the sexual kink known as the 'golden shower.' No one wanted to have to think about that — but Eisenman went there, laughing out loud.\nstepping on taboos. One of Eisenman's Old Masterly compositions combines the innocence of a lemonade stand with the sexual kink known as the 'golden shower.' No one wanted to have to think about that — but Eisenman went there, laughing out loud.\nAnother of her Baroque-style inventions shows a pregnant woman giving birth while suspended from a tree branch with a noose around her neck. In a compressed, vertical composition that reads like a Nativity scene for a church altarpiece, the woman is surrounded by men, one of whom blows a party horn at her, while another stares at the emerging baby through a telescope.\nAt a certain point in the early 2000s, Eisenman seemed to tire of these postmodern caperings. Without losing any of her dark humor, her anti-establishment politics or her penchant for perversity, she began to deepen the game.\nAdvertisement\nHer work from this period expresses a crisis familiar to most artists: the crisis of audience. As in: 'Who am I doing this for?' If the answer (as it had been until then) was 'myself and my people' — a small group of intimates who convene life drawing classes and poetry readings at one another's homes, attend protest rallies and sunbathe on Fire Island in the summer — that no longer felt quite sufficient.\nGradually, after a difficult period when her career seemed becalmed, Eisenman transformed herself from a niche artist talking to her people in a coded language into a deeper kind of creative provocateur — someone prepared to address not just politics but also intimacy, solitude and the problem of communal existence.\nIn the process, she became a MacArthur fellow, participated in multiple Whitney Biennials and became an officially sanctioned art star, haggled over by savvy collectors, rubber-stamped by museum curators. What made this happen was neither art world machinations nor market manipulation. It was what Eisenman did with paint (and sculpture). It was a step up in ambition, a palpable raising of the stakes.\nYou feel it in this show — appropriately subtitled 'What Happened' — as you move from one gallery to the next. (The exhibition, which has come to Chicago from Munich and London, was organized by Monika Bayer-Wermuth and Mark Godfrey with the assistance of Cameron Foote and, in Chicago, Jadine Collingwood and Jack Schneider.)\nI understood 'What Happened' (not a stupefied question but a blunt statement) as a reference to everything that has lately gone wrong with the world. But it could also apply to Eisenman's career: 'What happened' is, in essence, that she just got very, very good.\nShe also became (I think) more melancholy. One gallery here is filled with works addressing politics, mostly in rambunctious allegorical terms. 'The Triumph of Poverty,' for instance, is a response to the 2008 financial and political crisis. It draws on a lost painting of a procession of vices by Hans Holbein and includes a quotation from Pieter Bruegel the Elder's 'The Blind Leading the Blind.' The resulting masterpiece is a lot of things, none of them optimistic.\nAnother gallery has works that reflect, grimly, on our fixation with cellphones, television remotes and screens generally. The compositions make you question who is looking at whom and are fantastically inventive. But their general aura is bewildered and lonely.\nWhy, I wondered as I lingered in this gallery, are the artists who speak most powerfully to us so rarely happy? The question no doubt requires an elaborate answer, hedged with qualifications. But we could also say it simply:\nAdvertisement\nArt, at its best, starts from a premise of aliveness. Aliveness (in the forms of humor, sensuality, richness of response) is attached at the hip to awareness. Awareness (the human brain and body liberated from sentimentality, propaganda and all other forms of denial) involves registering the full extent of the debacle. But acknowledging the debacle, in turn, plunges us into depression — the very opposite of aliveness.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nSomething like this dynamic inheres in Eisenman's work. Her paintings and brilliant sculptural ensembles are totally alive — sometimes almost maniacally so. But they're also continually collapsing into a stunned stasis. When they emerge again, it's into states of bafflement as the artist tentatively gropes after community, which she tenderly, gratefully celebrates.\nEisenman's art, in other words, both registers the debacle and provides her — and the rest of us, her happily proliferating audience — with an expanded repertoire of how to feel alive (none of the options involving our cellphones). She uses art for play and laughter and lamentation and, above all, for cracking open the possibilities — lately so tragically diminished — of who we might be.",

All the stories and madness occupy way too much time in my head. My spouse went through cancer diagnosis and treatment (including three surgeries) over the past nine years. That kind of experience changes your perspective. Life is too short and precious to be sucked in and dragged down the rabbit hole.\nAdvertisement\nLiz Cunningham , Halifax, Nova Scotia\nLiz Cunningham, Halifax, Nova Scotia\nAre there ways you change your behavior during presidential elections? What strategies do you use to manage your feelings and personal relationships?\nI bring in horizons of time and space. I stop thinking about the world my grandson will grow up in and instead enjoy his newfound skills, such as feeding himself and climbing on the couch.

Last time, it was Ecuador; this fall, it's Portugal. Almost no one wanted to discuss our toxic politics. It was a breath of fresh air.\nAdvertisement\nEllen Rosfeld , Dewey, Ariz.\nEllen Rosfeld, Dewey, Ariz.\nDuring the past few presidential elections, I have become very careful when meeting new people, waiting to determine someone's political views before mentioning anything having to do with the issues of the day. Even views that, to me, are just pragmatic ways of handling problems push the hot buttons of so many people. I have many friends who become noticeably agitated and angry when I question their political beliefs to learn more about them. Even talking about the weather brings up climate change!\nI have started a grass-roots movement by establishing two groups of citizens. Each group comprises liberals, conservatives and independents who meet twice per month for political discussions. We are the Political Peace Posse. I hope to spread the word to other communities and train facilitators to organize and lead citizens in their own communities to come together for peaceful, civil discussions of political issues.\nAdvertisement\nTara Tuck , Marco Island, Fla.\nTara Tuck, Marco Island, Fla.\nMy golf group has agreed not to discuss politics.

The hours spent on the golf course give a nice respite.\nJoseph Buckhalt , Auburn, Ala.\nJoseph Buckhalt, Auburn, Ala.\nI like reaching out and maintaining relationships with relatives and friends whose political points of view are almost completely different from mine. In those conversations, we rarely discuss politics, but we talk about all the other fascinating topics we can explore together.\nGary Jusela , Seattle\nGary Jusela, Seattle\nWe silence all political ads that appear on our TV or computer. We do not inhabit any social media platforms. We keep our phones turned off during the day and check for messages once in the evening. We do not discuss politics with people we do not know or with family and friends who would take exception to our views. We discard all political mail without reading it. We do not watch or listen to cable news outlets. We get our daily news updates solely from reputable TV and newspaper sources. And, we avoid news altogether when our psychological states tell us we have had enough negativity for a while. As a clinical psychologist, I can tell you that taking these measures has improved our sense of well-being and psychological balance.\nAdvertisement\nPatrick Knowles , Fond du Lac, Wis.\nPatrick Knowles, Fond du Lac, Wis.\nI journal, read the Bible and pray. I also end most days by watching some late-night satire, because somehow, I must laugh despite it all. Despite all of this, I cannot ignore the danger that Donald Trump poses to our democracy.

Now, it is my turn!\nAfter being a permanent resident of the United States for 34 years, I am finally becoming a citizen so that I, too, can cast my ballot. I look forward to volunteering for get-out-the-vote initiatives and, possibly, running for local office. Despite having friends and family across the political spectrum, we all share a commitment to being responsibly informed citizens and participating in American democracy. I look forward to doing so for the first time this election cycle.\nAdvertisement\nMaureen Halford Spillane , Phoenix\nMaureen Halford Spillane, Phoenix\nThe writer passed her citizenship test shortly after submitting her letter.\nThe writer passed her citizenship test shortly after submitting her letter.\nSince 2016 and the fall of a legitimate Republican Party, everything is different.

I believe we are, as a nation, being destroyed by the Republican Party, which Donald Trump has taken over with lies and fear.\nCharlene Fitzpatrick , Tucson\nCharlene Fitzpatrick, Tucson\nI don't talk about politics unless I know exactly where a person lands on the issues.

            "excerpt": "Unlike in most democracies, women and young people tend to be relatively conservative in India and represent key support for Prime Minister Modi and his BJP party.",
            "summary": "NEW DELHI — From the United States to South Korea, it is a political axiom in many parts of the world: Women and young people tend to be less conservative than their husbands and fathers.\nNot in India.\nAs more than half a billion Indian voters cast ballots in the world's largest election starting Friday, two unlikely blocs of voters — women and young voters — could give Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government a significant boost in their bid to return to power for a third consecutive five-year term.\nThe emergence of these two constituencies marks a curious divergence between India and other democracies. It's born from Modi's unique appeal, which blends Hindu nationalism, personal charisma, big-ticket infrastructure spending and generous welfare programs into a powerful pitch that overshadows his failure to deliver enough jobs to precisely these voters.\nAdvertisement\nBut it also speaks to the broader social changes underway in India, where women in particular have increasingly voted independently from their husbands and become a highly sought-after electorate of their own.\nIf Modi secures reelection on June 4, as is widely expected, he'll have women like Prachi Kanherkar to thank.\nAround their dinner table in Gwalior in central Madhya Pradesh state, Kanherkar's husband regularly laments about how Modi has injected religion into politics. But Kanherkar, a 37-year-old engineering professor, counters that Modi's record fills her with pride.\nModi, she says, unveiled a grand Hindu Ram temple at the site of a razed mosque in January. He landed a rover on the moon last year. He encourages Indians to speak Hindi rather than English, the language of India's foreign colonizers.\n'It can turn into a big fight, especially as we sit with guests and our opinions are so clearly different,' said Kanherkar, who is part of a local women's prayer group formed two years ago by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a Hindu nationalist organization affiliated with the BJP. 'But my vote is my right, and it is for my country,' she said. 'I will use it.'\nAdvertisement\nCourting women voters has long been a tactic pursued by Indian parties, but political experts say Modi's party has taken it further than any previous government. In the last decade, the prime minister has announced programs to distribute free cooking gas cylinders, handed out bags of grain featuring his bearded visage, extended loans specifically for female entrepreneurs and even trained women to become drone pilots. The BJP has also taken Modi's strongman image and given it a twist to appeal to women by framing him as tough on rape and domestic violence, observant of traditional Indian values and committed to seva, or selfless service.\nMoreover, political scientists say, Indian women — like women in many other countries — display higher levels of religiosity compared to men, which has benefited the Hindu nationalist ruling party. BJP-hosted blood donation drives, temple cleanings and prayer events like the ones that attracted Kanherkar have all been a key 'bridge' to draw women into political life in recent years, said Anirvan Chowdhury, a political science postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University.\nwomen in many other countries — display higher levels of religiosity compared to men, which has benefited the Hindu nationalist ruling party. BJP-hosted blood donation drives, temple cleanings and prayer events like the ones that attracted Kanherkar have all been a key 'bridge' to draw women into political life in recent years, said Anirvan Chowdhury, a political science postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University.\n'When BJP talks about culture, when BJP talks about the temple, it is natural for the women to come toward the BJP,' said Vanathi Srinivasan, the head of the BJP's women's wing. She said the BJP has found women are more likely to attend prayer song meetings than typical male-dominated political rallies, and the party has leaned into that as a strategy.\nToday, the BJP is reaping the rewards of its recruitment drive.\nIn 2019, the gap between men and women in voter turnout significantly narrowed for the first time in decades, and in several recent state elections, the number of women voters has exceeded that of men, according to Sanjay Kumar, co-director at the Lokniti program for comparative democracy at the Center for the Study of Developing Societies, a premier polling organization in New Delhi.\naccording to Sanjay Kumar, co-director at the Lokniti program for comparative democracy at the Center for the Study of Developing Societies, a premier polling organization in New Delhi.\nAdvertisement\nAnd in six state assembly elections over the past two years in India's Hindi-speaking heartland, where the BJP is strongest, four saw women vote at a higher rate for that party than did men, according to Lokniti polls. For instance in India's largest state of Uttar Pradesh, home just by itself to more than 230 million people, women favored the BJP by two percentage points more than men.\nThis emerging gap in preferences, cited by five consultants across the political spectrum, has fascinated political observers. They say such differences did not exist a generation ago in a patriarchal society where men had greater control over where women went, how they lived — and how they voted. Today, that's considered 'outdated medieval thinking' by Arjun Dutta, a strategist at the Indian Political Action Committee political consultancy, who has been telling his clients, mostly regional political parties, to target women voters.\nIn Kanherkar's household, she and her husband, Anmol, not only differ in their politics, but where they get their news, a divergence made possible by the explosion of social media in India over the past decade that has given rise to a proliferation of political content — and disinformation.\nAdvertisement\nShe says she receives information from Hindi-language newspapers, WhatsApp, Facebook and DailyHunt, a news aggregator app. Her husband, a supporter of the Congress opposition party, says he mostly watches liberal commentators on YouTube because TV channels only serve up pro-Modi fare.\n'Fifteen years ago, information sources for a household used to be the same, whether the same TV channel or newspaper or interacting with the same set of people,' said Rahul Verma, a political fellow at the Center for Policy Research. Now, he added, 'individual mobile devices in our hands' have led to 'differed decision-making.'\nThe strong support for Modi among women has confounded his critics, who point out that women are in some ways faring worse, not better, since he entered office in 2014.\nWhile some health indicators for Indian women have improved, their labor participation rate fell steadily from 39 percent as recently as 2000 to a low of 24.5 percent in 2019, before spiking in 2022 to 33 percent, according to the International Labor Organization. Ten years into Modi's rule, India still sits in the bottom 25 countries in terms of female labor participation.\nAdvertisement\n'Every woman is asking us, they want money in their hands, they want jobs. They really want work to fight their poverty, unemployment, and inflation,' said Alka Lamba of the opposition Congress party, which has been running a 'Justice to Women' campaign to draw attention to what it says are persistently high levels of domestic violence, poverty and price rise in India under BJP rule.\nModi's ability to avoid blame for high unemployment has similarly preserved his position among another key constituency: the 18.5 million young Indians who are registered to vote for the first time. For many of these young Indians, pollsters say, the sense that India under Modi is rising as a geopolitical and economic power makes him attractive.\nFor many of these young Indians, pollsters say, the sense that India under Modi is rising as a geopolitical and economic power makes him attractive.\nAlthough India's economic trajectory remained largely unchanged for decades under successive governments, averaging 7 percent a year since 2004, Indian headlines frequently compare India's growth to China's slowdown and highlight new highways, railways and airports inaugurated by Modi. All fuel a popular perception that under Modi, India's moment has finally arrived, political analysts say. Indians between the ages of 18 and 24 prefer Modi by about five to six percentage points more than other age groups, according to Lokniti data.\nAdvertisement\nIn a recent survey in New Delhi, Vibha Attri, a Lokniti researcher, found that young Indians felt their most pressing worry was a lack of jobs — 42 percent of college graduates under 25 are jobless, according to a 2023 study by Azim Premji University. Yet 70 percent of respondents said the BJP is best suited to run India, with two opposition parties trailing in single digits, Attri found.\n42 percent of college graduates under 25 are jobless, according to a 2023 study by Azim Premji University.

'It's because there is no alternative. Modi is the only leader they have known.'\nIn the capital of Madhya Pradesh, Bhopal, one of the first-time voters will be Saloni Parashar, a 21-year-old law student who said India's jobs crisis cannot be pinned on Modi alone. She was still confident in Modi's campaign promise that India will become a developed country by 2047, and said the BJP simply needed more time to show results.\nAdvertisement\n'Ten years is not enough time for any government,' she said. 'They're doing the best they can.'\nFor now, Parashar said she was thrilled about the thousands of kilometers of roads Modi has paved at home and the respect he's won abroad. He has been courted by the United States, and stood strong enough to resist U.S. pressure to side with Ukraine against Russia, she noted.\n'The U.S. tried to sanction all the countries that import Russian oil, but you see they didn't sanction India,' she said. 'India is an important player now.'",

This is true both for natural disasters — floods, fires, hurricanes, etc. — and man-made disasters, such as this one. All 50 states have taken advantage of the additional highway grants that flow from this program. Presumably, pursuing the ship's owners and insurers will reduce the state's costs, and thus the federal costs.\nAdvertisement\nThat said, these federal budgetary obligations cannot be liquidated — paid — without adequate appropriations. Again, Congress has always provided such appropriations. Not doing so would mean that no cleanup/rebuilding efforts could be paid nationwide, and it is highly doubtful that Congress would fail to provide such appropriations.\nOne historical event worth mentioning in this context is the Minneapolis bridge disaster. That rebuild would not have been eligible for funding under the disaster relief program, because the collapse resulted from inadequate maintenance — neither a natural nor man-made disaster. However, Minnesota had the appropriate senior legislators in Congress — one in the House, one in the Senate, one Republican, one Democrat — and legislation providing 100 percent funding was approved.\nBoth the Key Bridge and Baltimore harbor are extremely important to much of the East Coast. One can easily conclude that 100 percent funding is appropriate.\nAdvertisement\nVic Miller , Washington\nVic Miller, Washington\nThe writer was a senior fellow at Federal Funds Information for States.\nThe writer was a senior fellow at Federal Funds Information for States.\nProtecting our pets\nRegarding the April 9 Home & Garden article 'How to (responsibly) let your cat outside':\nBravo to the growing number of responsible guardians such as Colleen Grablick, who protect cats and wildlife by allowing their feline companions outdoors only on a leash and harness or in a securely enclosed 'catio.'\nIronically, many animal shelters and 'rescue' groups are putting the animals they should be protecting in grave danger — and setting an irresponsible example — by dumping cats on the streets.

However, the article failed to highlight the extensive criminal behavior of Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces, and Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) commander who is better known as 'Hemedti.'\nHuman Rights Watch has documented extensive evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity by both the Sudanese Armed Forces and RSF, and of ethnic cleansing in Darfur. The United States has not only a moral responsibility but also an obligation under international law to protect civilians from war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. After mass killings in Rwanda, the Congo and Sudan, our soldiers, scholars and politicians eagerly lined up to say 'never again.' Now, it is happening again and the United States has responded with light sanctions and an empty U.N. Security Council resolution. Though there are no good options in Sudan, our failure to act demonstrates shameful cowardice and callousness on the world stage. The United States must do more to protect civilians in Sudan.\nAdvertisement\nElsie Levine , Rockville\nElsie Levine, Rockville\nConvenience isn't always good for us\nThe April 11 news article 'Lunchables under fire after report finds elevated lead and sodium levels' reported that Lunchables, a popular brand of lunch food for children, was found to contain harmful levels of lead, according to Consumer Reports.\nThis is concerning because Lunchables are consumed very often by a significant number of children, as they are convenience-food items that are an easy and affordable option for busy parents.\nAs a public health student and an active member of the community, my perspective is that we cannot overlook the possibility that the reported levels of lead in Lunchables could expose children to serious health hazards and risks. This can lead to negative long-term health effects that include cognitive development issues and other various neurological problems.\nAdvertisement\nWhat people don't realize is that reputable convenience-food brands can also contain harmful substances that detrimentally affect children's health in the long-term. Though convenience is important for families in which parents have busy schedules, it should never come at the expense of overall well-being. It is essential that we prioritize making a change by advocating increased transparency and stricter food-safety regulations within the industry.\nOne thing that would really make a difference is increased regulations that require comprehensive testing measures for food products to ensure their safety. Emphasis can initially be placed on products that are predominantly consumed by children. By implementing a rigorous testing process for food products, we can protect the long-term health of children.\nDiya Doshi , Orange, Calif.\nDiya Doshi, Orange, Calif.\nWhy stop with the parents?\nRegarding the April 10 news article 'Parents of Michigan school shooter sentenced in unprecedented case':\nAdvertisement\nThe conviction of a mother and father for the sins of their child is beyond comprehension. It defies every tenet of American jurisprudence. Obviously, these parents did not participate in the unthinkable act of murder committed by their son. There are three charges that a person can face even if they did not participate or know that someone was about to commit a crime: accessory before the fact and accessory after the fact and felony murder. These parents did not plot or plan the murders, which is accessory before the fact. They did not cover them up or shield the defendant, which is accessory after the fact. They did not drive a getaway car during commission of the crime, which would be felony murder.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nParents struggle every day to pay their bills and take care of their children and are grateful for a good night's sleep. If a child has a mental illness, the parents should not be presumed to know the diagnosis and consequences. They love their child and will defend them come what may. The paradigm of parenthood is not constant suspicion or investigation into the mental state of their child. It is based upon love, commitment, devotion and knowing that if their child faces a struggle, the parents have their back.\nAmerican jurisprudence demands that you separate emotion, revenge and bias from judgment. So, if you are going to lock up these parents for lack of focus in the context of struggling to raise a family, then lock up the spouses of those who commit crimes, lock up the sisters and brothers of those who commit crimes and lock up the teachers, friends and babysitters. The slippery slope of these convictions is obvious and entirely contrary to justice under American jurisprudence — and the chilling effect these convictions will have on adoption, foster parents and parenting in general will be felt across the nation.\nAdvertisement\nJonathan Dailey , Bradenton, Fla.\nJonathan Dailey, Bradenton, Fla.\nThe politics of Trumpism\nIn his April 9 Tuesday Opinion column, 'Trump fills a void in an increasingly secular America,' Fareed Zakaria notes that the void created by secularization is at least partly filled by populism, nationalism, authoritarianism and support of Donald Trump on the political right.\nLeft unsaid is that the much more secular liberal side of the political spectrum is hardly immune to the trend. Since at least the 1960s (and arguably since Karl Marx, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Jean-Jacques Rousseau), secular progressives have been filling Blaise Pascal's 'God-shaped hole' with theology-tinged causes. The historical list is long, but current enthusiasms seek the faux-Eden of equity, salvation through the elimination of fossil fuels, redemption from the original sin of structural racism and playing God via the physical transformation of the gender dysphoric.

In Chicago and Seattle, protesters blocked the entrance to those cities' international airports, forcing travelers and flight crews to walk to airline terminals or potentially miss their flights. In San Francisco, police had to use welding equipment to free demonstrators from the Bay Bridge after they had locked themselves together with pipes.\nThe chaos unfolded as the United States is heading into a sensitive time related to the presidential election. Both Biden and former president Donald Trump will appear at their parties' nominating conventions this summer, and both events appear poised to draw a large number of demonstrators. This summer also marks four years since protests exploded nationwide following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\nformer president Donald Trump will appear at their parties' nominating conventions this summer, and both events appear poised to draw a large number of demonstrators. This summer also marks four years since protests exploded nationwide following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\nAdvertisement\nAlready, members of Congress, college administrators, and some big-city mayors have started more closely controlling who gets into their events to try to minimize disruptions. Some colleges, including the University of Michigan, are now expressly warning students they could face expulsion if they disrupt end-of-the-semester campus events.\nAt least so far, the pro-Palestinian protests have been relatively small compared to the Black Lives Matter demonstrations in 2020. Analysts also caution there are historical limits to how large a social movement can grow when the matter at hand is not taking place in the United States or directly involves American troops.\nBut with pro-Palestinian protest organizers vowing Monday's action was just the beginning of more direct engagement, analysts now believe that the demonstrations are almost certain to add even more unpredictability to this year's political calendar.\nAdvertisement\n'If this continues for another six months, I would expect that the types of tactics deployed do escalate and we do see more extreme protests,' said Omar Wasow, assistant professor in political science at the University of California, Berkeley, who has extensively studied protest movements since the civil rights era. 'There will become a more militant faction, that advocates for more extreme tactics.'\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, one organizer of Monday's demonstrations in California suggested just that.\n'Today is proof that people are going to fight and keep escalating until there is a permanent cease-fire,' said Sha Wiya Falcon, who participated in a demonstration that shut down a freeway in Oakland.\nAnalysts note that the pro-Palestinian movement is now a sprawling network of groups, many of which have different views about what tactics are acceptable or effective. Many of the groups also have a diffuse leadership structure — or no leader at all — and that can make it especially hard to predict the movement's next steps. During the civil rights era, Wasow noted, there was a more cohesive group of leaders who set guideposts for what sort of tactics could be used at different moments in time.\nor effective.

During the civil rights era, Wasow noted, there was a more cohesive group of leaders who set guideposts for what sort of tactics could be used at different moments in time.\nAdvertisement\nBut analysts say whatever protest activity materializes in the coming weeks will pose a new challenge for Biden, who has struggled to balance his administration's support for Israel against the growing demands from his liberal coalition that he press for an immediate end to the conflict.\nconflict.\nFour years ago, amid the Black Lives Matter protests, it was Trump who was in the White House as some demonstrations became disruptive and shook some Americans' confidence in the stability of the nation.\nwas in the White House as some demonstrations became disruptive and shook some Americans' confidence in the stability of the nation.\nThis year, it is Biden who will be forced to reassure voters if disruptive protests become commonplace. Biden must also win over younger voters who now form a sizable chunk of the overall pro-Palestine protest movement.\nVincent Pons, an associate professor at Harvard University Business School, recently released a study that shows protest movements in general do not factor in Americans' political considerations at the ballot box. Of 14 protests and movements studied from 2017 through 2021, Pons concluded that only the Black Lives Matter demonstrations in 2020 'increased votes for Democrats.'\nprotest movements in general do not factor in Americans' political considerations at the ballot box.

'The fact the protests will take place so close to a presidential election could imply that the administration will be more likely to pay attention.'\nWasow agrees, saying one lesson from the civil rights era is that protesters' 'more extreme tactics' tend to be more influential 'with the elites' who are trying to guard against upheaval.\n'When protesters use extreme tactics, they might lose the public but nevertheless they get to signal to leaders who then want to manage the issue,' Wasow said. 'So, in that way, more extreme tactics might hurt you at the ballot box, … but they also could help you get policy responses from leaders.'\nAdvertisement\nThe evolution of the pro-Palestinian protest is occurring as public opinion about the Israel-Palestinian conflict has shifted.\nIn late March, Gallup released a poll indicating 55 percent of Americans disapproved of Israel's military operation in Gaza, while 36 percent approved. Just 18 percent of Democrats now approve of the action, down from the 36 percent of Democrats who approved of it in November.\nBut analysts caution pro-Palestinian demonstrators may undermine popular opinion if the public feels that demonstrators are undertaking too radical of protest tactics.\nRobb Willer, a professor of psychology and sociology at Stanford University, has done research that shows 'extreme tactics reduce popular support for social movements.' Willer said public support begins shifting away from movements that engage in 'property destruction, physical harm to other people or major disruption to day-to-day life.'\nAdvertisement\nBlocking access to major airports or highways, as pro-Palestinian protesters did Monday, would generally fall into the category that could result in backlash from the public, Willer said. Those tactics, however, tend to increase media attention, so some activists consider the trade-off to be worth it.\n'We call it the activist dilemma,' Willer said. 'They are really good at getting you media attention … so different movements, at different stages of mobilization, may have a different calculus of whether the trade-off is worth it.'\nKhalil Abualya, a second-generation Palestinian American who has helped organize some low-profile demonstrations at the University of Mississippi, worries about internal disagreements within the pro-Palestinian movement.\ninternal disagreements within the pro-Palestinian movement.\nAbualya believes that over the past six months Americans have become more familiar and sympathetic with the Palestinian cause.

'There are real-life consequences to everything we do.'\nStill, Abualya sees some value in making Biden feel uncomfortable.

            "summary": "For many Americans, November's presidential election is about one issue: abortion. President Biden hopes that a pro-abortion rights message will carry him to reelection, and Donald Trump regularly brags about his role in the end of Roe v. Wade , the Supreme Court decision that protected abortion rights nationwide.\nPresident Biden hopes that a pro-abortion rights message will carry him to reelection, and Donald Trump regularly brags about his role in the end of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that protected abortion rights nationwide.\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., the longshot independent hopeful with a famous family name whose candidacy has centered heavily on his skepticism of vaccines, barely mentions abortion. When he does, he often sends mixed signals.\nKennedy has said he believes the decision to seek an abortion should be left to women and their doctors. But he has held just one campaign event focused on abortion, an October visit to an Atlanta facility founded by Angela Stanton King — an anti-abortion and criminal justice reform activist and former Trump supporter whom the ex-president pardoned for her role in a car theft ring. In the months that followed Kennedy's appearance at Stanton King's facility, which aims to convince women to carry their pregnancies to term, he has repeated her false and inflammatory claims that abortion providers systematically target Black women.\nAdvertisement\nKennedy has avoided taking a concrete stance on the nation's patchwork of abortion bans and U.S. House Republicans' efforts to pass federal restrictions, calling abortion a 'culture war issue' used to divide people. He has said that 'every abortion is a tragedy,' but has few plans to take on the issue in the White House.\nKennedy mentioned abortion just twice in the 11 speeches and campaign events that appear on his YouTube page. He mentioned the word 'vaccine' 10 times. On X, formerly Twitter, he's mentioned the word 'abortion' five times since the start of last year. He posted the word 'vaccine' 64 times in the same period.\nTwitter, he's mentioned the word 'abortion' five times since the start of last year. He posted the word 'vaccine' 64 times in the same period.\n'He's trying to avoid what's probably the most salient issue right now,' Roy Behr, the author of 'Third Parties in America: Citizen Response to Major Party Failure.\"\nKennedy's ambiguity on abortion — an issue many voters say is a major motivator for them this race — may not hurt him in November. Kennedy, the nephew of a former president and son of a former U.S. attorney general, has appealed to a politically diverse group of supporters with nuanced views, including some who identify as conservative but weary of Trump and others who describe themselves as liberals unenthused with Biden. Outlining a clearer abortion position could hurt his standing with one or more of those groups.\nAdvertisement\nKennedy doesn't focus on abortion in speeches because it is a divisive issue, his campaign told The Washington Post.\n'Mr. Kennedy does not want to add fuel to the fire,' campaign spokeswoman Stefanie Spear wrote in an email, citing issues including chronic disease, infrastructure, disarmament and farming practices that protect the environment. 'These issues also have the potential to unify the country, unlike abortion, which is fundamentally divisive. So, Mr. Kennedy makes his position plain, but does not dwell on the subject.'\nSpear said Kennedy, who has not previously shared his thoughts on Arizona's state Supreme Court decision to revive a near-total ban on abortion earlier this month, opposes the ruling. She said he also disagreed with Trump's proposal to leave abortion restrictions up to the states.\nAdvertisement\nAfter The Post enquired about Kennedy's abortion position, the campaign added a new abortion policy page to its website, proposing 'a massive subsidized daycare initiative' paid for by funds Kennedy would reroute from Ukraine war aid. The page doesn't provide any more information about how Kennedy would respond to abortion bans in states.\nTwelve percent of voters, including two-thirds of Democrats, say abortion is the 'most important issue' in their 2024 vote, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll last month. Down the ballot, voters have signaled their disapproval of strict bans on abortion, supporting statewide referendums and candidates that would protect or expand abortion access.\nThis election marks the first time many voters will be able to weigh in post-Roe, and Kennedy's opponents could use his near-silence on abortion rights to cast doubt on his commitment to them, Democratic pollster Nancy Zdunkewicz said. New stories of women in dangerous, difficult circumstances who are unable to get abortions resonate with voters, she argued.\nAdvertisement\n'It's all way too real for people in a way that it just wasn't before,' Zdunkewicz said.\nKennedy is likely to attract voters who agree with him on vaccines and feel disaffected with the two major political parties, but will face more difficulty attracting people who aren't interested in one of his primary concerns such as vaccine safety, said Bernard Tamas, a political science professor at Valdosta State University and author of 'The Demise and Rebirth of American Third Parties.'\nvaccines and feel disaffected with the two major political parties, but will face more difficulty attracting people who aren't interested in one of his primary concerns such as vaccine safety, said Bernard Tamas, a political science professor at Valdosta State University and author of 'The Demise and Rebirth of American Third Parties.'\n'I don't think that very many people are going to make decisions for or against Kennedy based on abortion,' he said.\nKennedy's lone campaign stop focused on abortion was an October visit to Auntie Angie's House, a center for pregnant women in a Black community in Atlanta run by Stanton King. When Trump pardoned Stanton King, he cited her advocacy for people reentering society after being released from prison.\nAdvertisement\nKennedy's campaign says he 'misspoke' when he referred to the percent of Black women receiving abortions, but neither of the claims he repeated is correct according to multiple research studies.\nMore than 6 in 10 abortion clinics were located in predominantly White neighborhoods and about 1 in 10 clinics were in predominantly Black neighborhoods, according to a 2014 report from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy group that favors abortion rights. The group told The Post that post-Roe abortion bans in states with large Black populations have likely led to fewer clinics in Black neighborhoods since that analysis was completed.\nAdvertisement\nStanton King told The Post she did not ask Kennedy during his visit when he believes life begins, whether he would sign an abortion ban or his thoughts on the abortion restrictions passed in neighboring states. But Stanton King came away with the belief that Kennedy could do a better job than the major party candidates in bridging the partisan divide, and she later joined his campaign as an advisor. She said she appreciated Kennedy's promise to invest the same amount of federal resources that are committed to abortion services in social safety net programs for new mothers who need aid.\nMany of Kennedy's rare comments about abortion have come during media interviews, providing a patchy view of his policy and personal beliefs.\nAt the Iowa State Fair in August 2023, Kennedy said he would support a federal ban on abortion after 15 weeks of gestation, then said he would not 'personally' restrict abortion but added, 'I think the states have a right to protect a child once the child becomes viable, and that right, it increases.' (His campaign later clarified that he would not sign a ban.)\nIn an interview with PBS News in November, Kennedy said he didn't know what Biden could do to help protect women's access to abortions.\nAdvertisement\nIn a video released the same day as Biden's State of the Union address, in which the president called for Congress to restore Roe , Kennedy didn't mention abortion rights at all.\nRoe, Kennedy didn't mention abortion rights at all.\nBiden's allies have emphasized the president's efforts to expand access to contraception, abortion medication and emergency abortion care and point out the stark contrast with Trump's work to restrict abortion access. When Kerry Kennedy, Kennedy's sister, endorsed Biden along with more than a dozen other members of her family at a campaign rally Thursday, she cited Biden's support for abortion rights as one of the main reasons to back him.\nKennedy's running mate, Nicole Shanahan, funded research into the longevity of women's reproductive health and criticized in-vitro fertilization as 'one of the biggest lies that's being told about women's health today.' In a lengthy post on X on April 9, after Arizona's state Supreme Court decision, Shanahan wrote she 'can hold both beliefs,' suggesting bans are 'coercive' and 'wrong' but that women should carry pregnancies to term unless the mother or baby's health is at risk.\nMost voters who have already said they plan to vote for Kennedy said he talks about abortion enough.\nMike Roy, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel in Annapolis, Md., said he is voting for Kennedy because he believes the independent can keep America out of other countries' wars, close the Southern border and more aggressively regulate polluters. Abortion is not a top issue for the 46-year-old, but he agrees with Kennedy that women should have the right to choose the procedure. Still, he sees little point in Kennedy focusing on the topic.\nAdvertisement\n'I don't think he needs to talk about it more,' Roy said. 'It's such a polarizing issue and the theme of the campaign is to heal the divide.'\nLori Spencer, a Kennedy campaign volunteer in Oklahoma City who voted for the libertarian candidates in the last two presidential elections, disagrees. The 54-year-old was once a loyal Democratic voter but she left the party in 1996 after she felt like its leaders weren't keeping their promises, arguing Democrats could have protected Roe when they had the chance. Biden is no different, she believes.\nRoe when they had the chance. Biden is no different, she believes.\n'He talks the talk, but he doesn't walk the walk,' she said.\nSpencer said Kennedy might benefit from talking about abortion rights more and appealing more to voters like her who believe the government should not be involved in medical decisions.\n'I personally would like to see him be more vocal about his pro-choice beliefs,' Spencer said. 'But he'll talk about it when asked and he'll give you a clear answer. I don't think there's any ambiguity or misunderstanding of his position. He's very clear. So I'm happy enough with that.'\nKennedy's campaign has also used his abortion position to appeal to conservative voters. Rita Palma, who worked for Kennedy gathering ballot access signatures in New York, told voters in this month that the candidate's position was comparable to Trump's. Palma was later fired after being caught on video saying Kennedy could help Trump win.\n'Bobby believes and I heard this out of his own mouth: ‘Every abortion is a tragedy,'' she said in the video. 'He's definitely not, you know, 100% pro-life. But none of the candidates are. Even Trump is saying that they have to find that, quote-unquote sweet spot in order to win elections.' Palma declined to comment for this story.",

            "summary": "PHILADELPHIA — The symbolic mix of soul food and Palestinian dishes had been eaten to conclude the Ramadan fast, and remarks from Palestinian Americans about the war in Gaza had just wrapped up at the Masjidullah community center when Suad Islam stepped to a microphone seeking some political advice.\n'This presidential election is very disappointing. Is there a candidate that you would suggest that we vote for? Because I don't know any Muslim that could vote for Biden,' said Islam, who is Black and a lifelong Philadelphia resident. 'Who should we vote for? I'm just very disappointed.'\nIslam, who has lived in Philadelphia since the 1970s, has voted in every election since she was 18, almost always for Democrats. She picked President Biden over former president Donald Trump in 2020, and even volunteered at a polling place. But she said she cannot fathom punching a ballot for Biden again, not with more than 33,000 dead in Gaza, many of them fellow Muslims.\nAdvertisement\n'The economy, the crime rate. I want to cry every time I go to the gas station,' Islam said in an interview, ticking off the things that are on her mind as she mulls voting in November. 'It's just a whole bunch of stuff that's going on. It's disappointing. But of course, this war is at the top of my list.'\nAs the Gaza war enters its seventh month, some Black Americans say Biden's handling of the conflict makes them question whether he deserves a second term, according to interviews with nearly two dozen voters, opinion leaders and activists working through a political and moral conundrum in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\nFor some, the conflagration 6,000 miles away has already changed their vote, edging out domestic concerns such as the economy, inflation and crime. Others say the war in the Middle East, which has already cost thousands of lives and has a region on the brink of famine, mirrors other tragedies afflicting people of color — and that Biden's support for what they see as a moral disaster should have consequences at the ballot box.\nshould have consequences at the ballot box.\nAdvertisement\nStill others see the biggest threat as something else entirely: another Trump presidency.\nWhere these voters ultimately land could play an outsize role in who occupies the White House next year. Pennsylvania is one of a handful of battleground states that both Republicans and Democrats see as pivotal to winning the presidency. In 2020, Biden won the state by just over 80,000 votes, including a 4-to-1 margin in heavily Black Philadelphia. But there are signs that the coalition that elected him is fragmenting.\nIn a nod to the importance of the state and its largest, most diverse city, Biden has been to Philadelphia more than 20 times as president — more than anywhere else except his hometown of Wilmington. Biden is spending most of this week in Pennsylvania: two days in Scranton, where he was partially raised, a day in Pittsburgh and Thursday in Philadelphia.\nAdvertisement\nBut even while he visits their city, some Black Philadelphians are focused on how his policies are playing out half a world away.\n'I want the president to get it right because it's right. That's the first reason, but beyond that, there is a political ramification if he does not get it right,' said Rev. Mark Tyler, the senior pastor of Mother Bethel AME Church, who is planning to attend the Democratic National Convention this summer. He said he's lost count of the number of conversations he's had with parishioners about the Middle East conflict.\n'And to think that this (conflict) is not going to have an impact on Black voters in particular, who connect with this story in a way that maybe other Americans cannot — it would be a mistake to think that it won't be a problem going into November,' Tyler said.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas militants rampaged through the Israel-Gaza border fence and killed 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and took 250 others hostage. In response, Israel has commenced a military campaign that has devastated much of the enclave while severely restricting humanitarian aid.\nComplicating matters, last weekend Iran launched a salvo of rockets and drones into Israel in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian consulate in Syria. Most of the weapons were shot down by Israel and its allies, but the episode has raised fears of a broader conflict.\nSupporters of Israel reject the notion that its incursion into Gaza is racist or mirrors American racial dynamics. Rather, they say, the 150-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict is rooted in a territorial dispute between two groups with historical ties to the same land. The country's backers also note that Jews themselves have been victims through history, and giving them a safe haven is a central reason for Israel's existence.\nAdvertisement\nBut as the Gaza war has raged on, Biden and other Democrats have faced protesters at virtually all of their public events, over the Palestinian death toll. In Scranton on Tuesday, after Biden gave a campaign speech on tax policy, the president's motorcade was met by protesters chanting, 'Biden Biden, you can't hide. We charge you with genocide,' and 'Welcome home, Scranton Joe — make sure Gazans have a home also.' Demonstrators also shouted at Biden as he visited his childhood home.\nIn several states, Muslims and Arab Americans have organized movements urging members of their communities — as well as people of color, liberals and others dissatisfied with Biden's support of Israel — to choose 'uncommitted' in Democratic primaries, an effort that notched more than 100,000 votes in Michigan.\nFor seven months, organizers in Philadelphia have been stoking a similar movement in advance of Pennsylvania's April 23 Democratic primary. They contend that Israel's military onslaught resembles other racist oppression that called for a global moral response: Jim Crow in the American South, or apartheid in South Africa.\nAdvertisement\nThat sentiment has resulted in a growing link between Black and Arab American activists.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBlack Americans 'have been struggling through this for many, many years,' said Osama Al-Qasem, who directs the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. 'They understand what we're going through, and therefore they empathize and sympathize and support our struggle, as well. So the built-in relationship becomes a hub we leverage.'\nBiden has made racial justice a central tenet of his administration, and as his reelection campaign intensifies he has highlighted the strides Black Americans have made during his presidency. Putting Trump back in the White House, he and his surrogates argue, would stymie that progress.\nBiden has stressed that he needs Black voters to help put him in the White House again. but recent polls have shown declining support among the demographic, particularly in battleground states that will probably swing the election.\nSome 92 percent of Black voters picked Biden over Trump in 2020. A Wall Street Journal poll of swing states, however, found that 57 percent of Black men planned to vote for Biden in the 2024 election, while 30 percent said they were likely to vote for Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.\nAdvertisement\nSimilarly, 11 percent of Black women in the 2020 poll said they would 'definitely' or 'probably' vote for Trump, compared to 6 percent of Black women who voted for him in 2020.\nBiden's campaign announced in August that it was spending $25 million to reach key voters in battleground states, including what it called the largest and earliest investment in Black media for a reelection campaign in history. Those ads highlight Biden's efforts to close the racial wealth gap and note that he has presided over the lowest Black unemployment rate in history.\nIn addition Biden launched a pair of ads last month aimed at Black voters in battleground states, touting his administration's pandemic relief checks and its successful effort to cap the price of insulin at $35 a month.\n'At both the national and state level, this campaign is committed to engaging with Black voters earlier and more often than any other campaign to date,' Kellan White, a senior adviser in Pennsylvania for Biden-Harris 2024 and a Philadelphia native, said in a statement.\nBiden's defenders say critics have a dangerously myopic view of the conflict in the Middle East, and that efforts to turn Black voters away from Biden will play directly into the hands of Trump, who would be far worse for both Black Americans and Palestinians.\nAdvertisement\nBiden is handling the Gaza war as best he can, they add. 'You can't solve the problem of the Middle East as a purist or idealist,' said Marshall Mitchell, a pastor at Salem Baptist Church of Abington, a Black church in Montgomery County, Pa. 'They don't understand the power of quiet diplomacy. And they're going to force a hand, and then you won't be able to turn Pennsylvania back.'\nAt the mosque and community center where Islam voiced her electoral concerns, many who came to learn about the Palestinian cause acknowledged that it was just one of the issues that would affect Black voters' decisions.\nSalima Suswell, leader of the Black Muslim Leadership Council and one of the organizers of the cross-cultural event, said she feels a connection to the suffering of those in Gaza who share her faith. But she said she also understands that it may be difficult for people to sublimate their own self-interest to make a political point, even on such a searing issue.\n'Some folks feel that there are domestic issues that require priority, like gun violence in a city like Philadelphia, where Black Muslim children are being murdered,' Suswell said. 'So many people feel like we need a cease-fire right here in our city. And to some level, there is some frustration also with people who feel that Trump is a huge threat to our community.'\nSuswell was one of a handful of Muslim leaders invited to the White House this month to discuss the war in Gaza and other issues. She has also hosted events in her hometown aimed at helping Black Philadelphians understand the plight of Palestinians and what the community can do to influence U.S. policy.\nOthers are disenchanted with the notion that they must choose between two parties whose policies toward Israel may not be substantively different.\n'I think there's a recognition that neither the Democrats nor Republicans are really representing our interests. They're not representing Black interests. They're not representing the interests of poor and working-class folks,' said Melina Abdullah, who recently became the running mate of third-party presidential candidate Cornel West.\nIn 2015, she and other founding members of Black Lives Matter issued a statement of solidarity with Palestinians. 'We don't have to take a lesser-of-two-evils approach,' Abdullah said. 'Lesser of two evils is still evil.'\nIn contrast, Rahima Abdullah, 67, a lifelong Philadelphia resident, said the events of the past six months have not deterred her desire to vote for Biden. Voting 'uncommitted' or staying home 'is a vote for Trump,' she added.\n'I just feel like we've got to do it,' she said of voting for Biden. 'And then we've got to pray.'\nScott Clement and Yasmeen Abutaleb in Washington contributed to this report.\nScott Clement and Yasmeen Abutaleb in Washington contributed to this report.",

Moreover, given the rapid strides in medicine, I don't know how doctors can be so certain about a six-months-to-live prognosis. I also worry about the slippery slope (expanding assisted suicide from terminal patients to chronically ill ones). While I support giving patients the full range of palliative care at the end of life, I remain deeply conflicted about assisted suicide laws.\nAnswer: The bill under consideration in the British Parliament would allow a patient to request life-ending medication under very strict circumstances (e.g., two independent doctors and a judge to verify that the patient has a terminal illness with six months or less to live, and is not under duress).

The judge on Monday methodically struck down Trump's objections to evidence demonstrating his fear that the alleged sexual encounters would ruin his election chances in 2016. Oh, and a hearing on whether he should be held in contempt for his ongoing Truth Social threats against witnesses will be held next week.\nAdvertisement\nThis is what justice looks like: slow but effective, imperfect but satisfying. When the rule of law operates as it should, it's something to behold.\nJournalism 101\nPeople on social media and other critics justifiably mocked, derided and denounced the New York Times for the headline, 'Two Imperfect Messengers Take On Abortion.' The sub-headline was nearly as bad: 'Neither side of the abortion divide would probably design the exact candidate they have in 2024.' This could be the crown jewel of 'both-sidesism,' accomplishing that feat in multiple ways.\nFor starters, it blurs the distinction between Biden's clear and unwavering position (to write Roe v. Wade into a federal statute) with Trump's well-documented inconsistencies, deflections and contradictions. These two men simply are not equally deficient communicators. That imbalance in clarity and sincerity actually might determine the campaign's outcome.\nRoe v.

You could not imagine a 1942 headline: 'Two imperfect messengers take on world war.' Awarding style points, as the story does, trivializes the abortion issue.\nFinally, the Times headline amounts to a self-parody of gamified political coverage: 'Neither side of the abortion divide would probably design the exact candidate they have in 2024.' (Well, neither team in the World Series would design the exact lineup they have.) In essence, the Times tells us, 'No one's perfect!' — an empty platitude.

In this case, the court's dissenting justices excoriated the majority for inventing an ambiguity in a law. A plain reading of the text should have required implementation of a 15-week restriction and an exception when the health of the mother is at risk, not a complete ban.\nshould have required implementation of a 15-week restriction and an exception when the health of the mother is at risk, not a complete ban.\nAdvertisement\nVice Chief Justice Ann Timmer wrote for the dissenting opinion: 'Relying on a statutory construction note tucked within a session law predating Dobbs , the majority interprets [the abortion law] as providing that if Roe was overruled, the state would turn back the clock to 1973 by enforcing the near-total abortion ban against physicians, even if they comply with [the law] by performing elective abortions before the fifteen-week gestation point or performing abortions when necessary to prevent serious impairment to the pregnant woman's health.' Timmer slams the majority's assumption that a legislature would 'hide elephants in mouseholes.' Translation: Lawmakers wouldn't throw a monumental edict into what amounts to a footnote.\nDobbs, the majority interprets [the abortion law] as providing that if Roe was overruled, the state would turn back the clock to 1973 by enforcing the near-total abortion ban against physicians, even if they comply with [the law] by performing elective abortions before the fifteen-week gestation point or performing abortions when necessary to prevent serious impairment to the pregnant woman's health.'

He lives in Los Angeles these days and has joked in interviews that he was struck, upon first moving to the city, by how pretty everyone seemed to be. In a way, he fit right in. But most actors strive to stand out, to avoid being put into a box. Hathaway, Galitzine's more experienced co-star, writes in an email that 'how an artist defies their typecasting … says as much about them as their performances.'\n'Part of the reason you get cast as something when you are in the unknown phase of your career is because the powers that be have an easy time seeing you in that part — but that doesn't mean that's a full expression of all you are,' Hathaway continues. 'Nick is innately handsome, intelligent, sensitive, funny, sporty and dashing. … And I know he's got much, much more to show.'\nBack to Hugh Grant real quick. During our Zoom, Galitzine indulges a tangent to discuss how Grant's career has taken a turn for the weird. Once a romantic lead, Grant now goes for the villains and creeps. He reunited last year with 'Paddington 2' director Paul King to play a fussy Oompa-Loompa in 'Wonka.' And 'he's kind of become even more respected than he already was, which is cool,' Galitzine says.\ncareer has taken a turn for the weird. Once a romantic lead, Grant now goes for the villains and creeps. He reunited last year with 'Paddington 2' director Paul King to play a fussy Oompa-Loompa in 'Wonka.' And 'he's kind of become even more respected than he already was, which is cool,' Galitzine says.\nAre these the sorts of choices Galitzine hopes to emulate? Maybe one day. He covets versatility and runs through a list of actors he admires: James McAvoy, Brad Pitt, Matt Dillon, Michael Pitt. 'I'm in such awe of my contemporaries,' he adds, naming Barry Keoghan, Paul Mescal and Leo Woodall. His current North Star might be Ryan Gosling, whose Oscar-nominated performance in 'Barbie' underscored what loyal fans have long known: Gosling can do drama, but he is very good at comedy.\nGalitzine can be, too. He has been acting for a decade — appearing in the 2019 psychological horror series 'Chambers,' the 2021 movie-musical 'Cinderella,' the 2022 romantic drama 'Purple Hearts' — but broke out with last summer's 'Red, White and Royal Blue.' While he plays the straight man opposite co-star Taylor Zakhar Perez — not literally, as the film's buzzy gay sex scenes make clear — portraying Prince Henry still called for a fair share of physical comedy.\nHe recently noticed that his projects tend to be released in pairs. 'Red, White and Royal Blue' came out during the Hollywood actors and writers strikes around the same time as 'Bottoms,' a gonzo comedy about lesbian high-schoolers (Ayo Edebiri and Rachel Sennott), who start an extracurricular fight club to spend more time with their crushes. Galitzine plays a football player who cheats on his girlfriend and is constantly humiliating himself. Despite working on recent projects with Hathaway and Julianne Moore, his on-screen mother in 'Mary and George,' he says he learned the most on 'Bottoms' by leaning into its emotional nakedness.\nAdvertisement\n'Nick was down to be a goofball,' says Sennott, who wrote the film with director Emma Seligman. But Galitzine admits that he had to overcome a decent amount of anxiety to put his most ridiculous foot forward.\n'I think that's acting, in a way,' he says. 'It's trying to channel fear in a productive way.' And if that sounds pretentious, he jokes, that's because 'we are, as actors, very self-important and pretentious.'\nRaised in the Hammersmith district of London by an English father and Greek mother, Galitzine thought he might pursue rugby professionally until injuring his rotator cuff. He didn't start acting until 'late in my life,' by which he means right out of high school. He was scouted after auditioning for an Edinburgh Fringe Festival production of the musical 'Spring Awakening' in 2013.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nRoughly a decade later, he sings onstage again, this time on-screen in 'The Idea of You' as Hayes Campbell, one of five members in the fictional boy band August Moon.

Hayes encounters Solène Marchand (Hathaway) at a Coachella meet-and-greet, which the divorcée attends with her teenage daughter; they begin sneaking around after he swings by her Los Angeles art gallery. Screenwriters Jennifer Westfeldt and Michael Showalter, who also directed the film, adapted it from a 2017 novel by Robinne Lee, who previously told Vogue that 'this was never supposed to be a book about Harry Styles' but instead 'a story about a woman approaching 40 and reclaiming her sexuality and rediscovering herself.'\n'Hayes, for me, needed to be obviously sexy and charming, and someone who audiences could fall in love with similarly to the way Solène does,' Showalter says. 'There needed to be a humility there, and a real person there.' In other words, Hayes needed to come across as a 24-year-old that a single mother might actually want to date, mature and grounded beneath his playful exterior.\n'Nick could have chemistry with a lamp,' Hathaway says. 'He's so easy to connect with.'\nGalitzine was interested in how Hayes handles the claustrophobia of fame — once their relationship hits the press, he and Solène face all sorts of online hate — and encourages Solène's self-discovery. 'I just feel, both in Hayes and in myself, this responsibility of support and allyship and partnership,' Galitzine says. 'It's been such a joy working with Annie. … I think we can all see how important [this film] is for her, as well.'\nLately, he has tried choosing roles he believes 'move the needle' somehow. He and Moore began shooting 'Mary & George' early last year, almost immediately after he wrapped 'The Idea of You.' The series also contrasts how a young man and older woman each navigate the world — albeit in 16th-century England, when George Villiers infiltrates the king's court at the behest of his conniving mother, Mary. He initially acts as a pawn in her scheme to boost the family's rank, but over time he learns to exploit King James (Tony Curran) for his own purposes. 'He dominates a lot of people through sex,' Galitzine says of George, a fictionalized version of the real duke. 'His sexuality liberates him in a powerful way.'\nAdvertisement\nGalitzine, who is straight, has played multiple characters who aren't. 'I never want to be taking up a space that feels like it would be best played by someone who is queer,' he says. 'For me, I just saw these people as wonderfully textured humans.' Despite 'Mary & George' taking place centuries ago, George isn't ostracized for his queerness — nor is the king. The duke may have additional motives, but the series still depicts their connection as authentic, and their sexual encounters as tender and loving.\nCreator D.C. Moore says he 'wanted, fundamentally, for this show to not be afraid of men's bodies.' He credits the two actors with developing a rapport that served what Galitzine describes as their shared 'responsibility to portray this relationship in an honest, compelling light.' The humor in 'Mary & George' is sharp, sometimes cruel and often littered with ahistoric F-bombs. But when George lies on the floor next to a stressed-out King James, their banter softens, becoming the sort of everyday chatter exchanged between two longtime lovers. Galitzine and Curran improvised that bit of dialogue.\n'On some level as a writer, I should be furious,' Moore says playfully. 'But that's two actors playing intimacy.'\nActing opposite stalwarts like Hathaway and Julianne Moore reminded Galitzine of his relative youth. 'By the people I'm working with, I'm still regarded as very green and very young,' he says. It can be nice to feel like his career is only beginning, but also quite jarring. He's been acting for 10 years, after all. He can't even remember who he played in that staging of 'Spring Awakening.'\n'Was it Moritz?' he wonders aloud, racking his brain. 'Good God, that feels like a lifetime ago.'\nWe return to the topic of his future aspirations. Sci-fi extravaganza? Absolutely. Stage acting? Hmm, no thanks. ('My English agents really want me to do theater, but I don't know, not just yet,' he says. 'The last thing I auditioned for was ‘The Iceman Cometh,' which Austin Butler ended up doing.') He would love to do another project as outlandish as 'Bottoms' — if not more so — and has been trying to be a voice actor for a couple years now. 'They won't have me,' he laments. 'But let's manifest that.'\nAdvertisement\nHe doesn't take it as a slight. On the cusp of 30, Galitzine espouses some wisdom: 'The closer we get to death, the less we give a s---.' This is a tricky period to navigate, anyway, as he lingers in the space between coming-of-age stories and robust leading-man roles. While he will probably play young and hot — but interesting! — for the foreseeable future, he notes that most of his favorite actors have 'wonderful lines' on their faces now. They not only sound wise, but look it. He can't wait to join them.\nwisdom: 'The closer we get to death, the less we give a s---.'

Johnaton Babb's favorite place to sleep is a few feet from the river where his twin brother died when they were teenagers.\nThey are two among hundreds of people living outside in this small, conservative city in Southern Oregon's Rogue Valley, wedged between the Siskiyou and Coast mountains, and their experiences are part of an escalating humanitarian crisis.\namong hundreds of people living outside in this small, conservative city in Southern Oregon's Rogue Valley, wedged between the Siskiyou and Coast mountains, and their experiences are part of an escalating humanitarian crisis.\nAdvertisement\nThat fact does not make Grants Pass exceptional, especially in the American West, where soaring housing costs and a collage of other causes have driven a growing number of vulnerable residents into homelessness. Even so, Grants Pass now finds itself in a unique position: This city of 40,000 will have a chance to shape policy decisions countrywide when it defends its anti-camping regulations in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday.\nThe case will decide whether governments can enforce laws against people sleeping outside when they have nowhere else to go. The decision, expected in late June, could be the most consequential ruling on the rights of the unhoused in decades, and either sanction or derail increasingly punitive efforts across the country that seek to deal with homelessness.\nMore than 60 government entities large and small — from Honolulu to Maryland to the United States Department of Justice — along with dozens of advocacy organizations, academics and lawmakers, have filed court briefs in the case, underscoring the widespread interest in the outcome and its potentially sweeping implications for the nation's state capitals and city streets.\nBut in the public parks of Grants Pass, where residents with no access to shelter beds take refuge in tents each night, the case is about something much more elemental: Whether they'll be able to continue to survive in a city many have called home for most of their lives.\n'It wasn't that long ago that I was part of the community,' said Gutowski, sitting at a picnic table in a park about a mile from her old house. 'But the more I'm out here, the more angry I get. … They're not trying to make things better for us, or help us have another shelter, or keep us safe — or help us even medically or mentally. They're just trying to push, push, push until we give up and say, ‘Fine, I'll leave town.''\nA political paralysis\nThe events that sparked the Grants Pass case unfolded with little fanfare.\nevents that sparked the Grants Pass case unfolded with little fanfare.\nIn 2013, city leaders convened a roundtable meeting to address complaints from businesses and residents about increased crime they blamed on the local unhoused population, which they said had spiked after steep budget cuts reduced jail capacity. Officials floated a range of responses, including compiling a 'most unwanted list' that would exclude homeless people who break the law from social services and loading offenders onto a bus and shipping them out of town, according to a copy of the meeting's minutes.\nFollowing the roundtable, the city began strictly enforcing measures, most of which were already on the books, that outlawed sleeping or camping in public spaces like parks and in parked cars, imposing fines ranging from $75 to $295 that increase substantially when unpaid and that could eventually result in jail time or a park ban. That sparked an initial legal complaint, which was filed in 2018 on behalf of Debra Blake, Gloria Johnson and John Logan, three unhoused individuals, who said the city was punishing them unconstitutionally 'based on their status of being involuntarily homeless.'\nsparked an initial legal complaint, which was filed in 2018 on behalf of Debra Blake, Gloria Johnson and John Logan, three unhoused individuals, who said the city was punishing them unconstitutionally 'based on their status of being involuntarily homeless.'\nJust as the city stepped up enforcement, its population soared and housing construction fell behind. Over the past decade, the city has built roughly half the number of units it needs to house everyone, said Doug Walker, a member of the Grants Pass Housing Advisory Committee. The average rental price for a studio apartment hovers around $1,000 per month.\nto house everyone, said Doug Walker, a member of the Grants Pass Housing Advisory Committee. The average rental price for a studio apartment hovers around $1,000 per month.\n'The homeless crisis is a symptom of the housing crisis,' Walker said. 'We have very little housing and the housing we do have is very expensive, and that drives people onto the street.'\nThe most recent reliable estimate puts the number of unhoused Grants Pass residents at more than 600, with another 1,000 living on the edge of homelessness, but local service providers say at least twice as many are homeless.\nMaking matters worse, Grants Pass does not have a homeless shelter. Its only large-scale transitional housing program, the Gospel Rescue Mission, is a privately run religious facility with 138 beds and stringent requirements for participants, such as twice-daily chapel attendance and abstinence from substances and romantic relationships.\nThe mission's executive director, Brian Bouteller, supports the city's position in the case because he believes an outright camping ban will drive more people into the organization's program and off the street. Allowing unhoused people to stay in the parks, he said, was akin to enabling unlawful behavior. He said he would also welcome additional, privately funded shelters in the city.\n'I believe that lawbreakers should be coerced into being law-abiding citizens,' Bouteller said.\nIn 2020, a district court judge sided with the unhoused individuals behind the lawsuit and barred the city from enforcing its anti-camping ban in parks at night if no other shelter was available. Grants Pass Mayor Sara Bristol said the ruling plunged the city into political paralysis.\nBristol said if it were up to her, the city would spend less time fighting this legal battle and more time building new housing and shelters. But that decision rests with the city council, she said, and a majority has wanted to push ahead with the case. The council president, Vanessa Ogier, declined to comment and directed questions to the city's legal representatives.\nAdvertisement\nGrants Pass residents have also opposed proposed locations for new shelters and outdoor campsites, and some backed a recall petition that unsuccessfully sought to oust Bristol over her handling of the crisis. A neighborhood watch group has continued to raise alarms about conditions in the city's cherished green spaces.\nAt one park on a recent Saturday, parents combed a baseball diamond for drug paraphernalia before their kids took the field and recovered several used needles, said Grants Pass police chief Warren Hensman.\n'What we're seeing from a lot of people in the unhoused community,' Hensman said, 'is we have this unpredictable behavior' when individuals are using drugs or experiencing a mental health episode.\nBristol, for her part, said she knows the situation in the parks is untenable, which is why, no matter what the Supreme Court decides, she wants the city to build more shelters fast.\n'I want our public spaces to be safe and clean and used as they were intended,' Bristol said. 'And I also want to make sure that homeless people have a place where they can be safe and sleep and get help if they want to get help. And I think we can have both, but not everybody thinks that.'\nHigh legal stakes\nThe Supreme Court agreed to weigh in on this case after hearing pleas from an unlikely coalition that spanned the political spectrum, including liberal standard-bearers such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and officials in deep-red states such as Montana and Alabama. Their legal briefs described governments overwhelmed by the scale and complexity of the problem: Across the country, more than 600,000 people are homeless, according to federal data, and nearly half sleep outside.\ndeep-red states such as Montana and Alabama. Their legal briefs described governments overwhelmed by the scale and complexity of the problem: Across the country, more than 600,000 people are homeless, according to federal data, and nearly half sleep outside.\nIn most places, there are not enough shelter beds to accommodate everyone who needs one. That gap between the need for services and their availability is at the heart of the Supreme Court case. Lawyers for the homeless residents say the Grants Pass laws violate Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment when applied to individuals who have no access to shelter.\n'This combination of ordinances makes it unlawful for people to live outside on every inch of public property in Grants Pass 24 hours a day,' said Ed Johnson, the director of litigation at the Oregon Law Center and lead attorney for the plaintiffs. 'It's terrible policy, it's morally wrong and it's unconstitutional.'\nAdvertisement\nJohnson has insisted that state and local officials are still free to restrict tents in public spaces, clear encampments and even fine homeless people who decline other shelter options, which some do for a range of reasons. The issue, he said, is when a city punishes people who have no alternatives.\nMeanwhile, the Grants Pass legal team has maintained that fines and short jail terms for camping on public property are neither cruel nor unusual, but instead are tools used by governments throughout the country to preserve public spaces and protect public health.\n'These laws are essential to running a city, and cities across the country, as well as the federal government, rely on camping laws just like the ones in Grants Pass,' said Theane D. Evangelis, the city's lead attorney. If the court were to rule in favor of the plaintiffs, she said, 'cities across the country would find their hands tied as they work to address the urgent homelessness crisis.'\nIn a legal brief filed in advance of the oral arguments, the Biden administration charted something of a middle path. Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar told the court that anti-camping laws are unconstitutional when they target homeless people who have no access to indoor shelter.\nBut Prelogar urged the justices to return the case to the lower courts to ensure that the city's laws are not blocked across the board. Such bans should still be allowable, she argued, if an investigation shows that a given person does in fact have access to shelter.\nGarrett Epps, a law professor at the University of Oregon, said he expects a majority of the court to be sympathetic to the city's arguments, but cautioned that the justices could issue a more narrow decision than Grants Pass is advocating.\nA ruling that allows cities wide discretion to pass restrictive homelessness laws, Epps said, could touch off 'a race to the bottom,' where neighboring localities pass increasingly severe policies to drive unhoused residents into other jurisdictions.\n'The stakes in that sense are pretty high,' Epps said. 'Anybody who lives out here understands how important this issue is and how important the precedent being tested here is.'\nSmall victories\nCassy Leach is a near-constant, indefatigable presence among the unhoused in Grants Pass.

'They have nothing.'\nLast month, the city council tried to restrict organizations like MINT from operating in the public parks, but Bristol, the mayor, vetoed the measure. Unhoused residents say the city has become hostile, even dangerous. People camping in parks report waking up often to the sound of revving trucks and drivers screaming profanity-laced tirades, telling them to 'get a job,' 'get out of our parks' or to 'go die.'\nPolice recently announced they had arrested an 18-year-old 'vigilante' who had been roaming one park, shaking tents and yelling. When one unhoused woman emerged from her tent, the suspect hit her in the face with a thick tree branch, authorities said.\nAdvertisement\nMany homeless people in Grants Pass have strong ties to the area — like Gutowski, whose family moved to the city when she was 10. She grew up loving the outdoors and she raised her own children here.\nAfter her husband died of a pulmonary embolism in 2021, Gutowski, now 55, found herself without a job or savings. She wound up living in her car, until that broke down and she moved outside, traversing the often muddy landscape with her walker.\nGutowski said she understands the community's frustration over the condition of the parks. But like so many, she said, she has no other option. Gutowski has been trying desperately to secure subsidized housing. She's on more waiting lists that she can track.\n'This is our home. This is where we have to be,' she said. 'Otherwise we're going to be on your sidewalks, in the doorways of your businesses, in the alleyways. We're going to be more visible to people driving through town.'\nAt Baker Park, less than a mile north of Gutowski's tent, Babb, 52, was walking along the Rogue River on a recent drizzly afternoon, still processing his father's death that week. It was a similar event — his mother's death a couple of years earlier — that spiraled him into addiction and homelessness.\ndeath a couple of years earlier — that spiraled him into addiction and homelessness.\nBut this park — the site of another family tragedy decades ago, when Babb's brother died after leaping off a tall bridge into the river below — now brings him peace. When he's here, he feels closer to his late twin.\nBabb isn't optimistic about the Supreme Court case — the court, like his hometown, is a conservative place, he said.\n'As soon as the spotlight's gone, it's just going to go back to business as usual,' Babb said. 'And business as usual was don't ask, don't tell, let's just pretend they don't exist.'\nInstead, these days, he's focusing on what he calls 'small victories.' Replacing his lost Social Security card: Small victory. Learning to put a park's address, rather than its name, on his state-issued ID so it wouldn't be immediately obvious to potential employers he was homeless: Small victory.

It consists of nearly every Democrat and about half of Republicans.\nThe pattern was reinforced this weekend with a vote to pass Ukraine aid, but it has played out over and over again this Congress with the passage of major pieces of legislation.\nThe Republican majority has been unable to unite around must-pass bills and has thus repeatedly relied on Democrats to push bills past the finish line.\nAdvertisement\nThis weekend's vote on $60 billion for Ukraine: 112 Republicans opposed it. (Every Democrat voted for it.)\nVote earlier this month on extending FISA provisions: 88 Republicans opposed it.

(Forty-six Democrats opposed it.)\nJune vote to lift the debt limit and set spending caps: 71 Republicans voted against it. (Forty-six Democrats opposed it.)\nThe group of Republicans who have joined with Democrats is slightly different each time, but the pattern is the same. What holds the coalition together is a desire to avoid government shutdowns and, in the case of the Ukraine and FISA votes, a commitment to traditional national security priorities.\n'House Democrats have risen to the occasion. President Biden has risen to the occasion. Traditional conservatives led by Speaker Mike Johnson have risen to the occasion,' House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said, touting the bipartisan coalition ahead of Saturday's passage of four national security bills.\nPresident Biden has risen to the occasion.

Democrats also control the Senate and the White House.\nAdvertisement\nSome hard-right House Republicans have tried to ignore that reality. They defeated procedural rules, a tactic that was nearly unheard of until this Congress. They kicked out one speaker and are threatening another for daring to pass bills with big bipartisan majorities.\n'This is a sellout of America,' said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who is leading the effort to depose Johnson from his job as speaker.\nRep.

It's not better for the country,' Moore said.\nFormer House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had a similarly narrow coalition last Congress, when she passed major bills with consequential policy changes. But she kept her caucus united — which might have been easier because the Senate and the White House were in Democratic hands, too.\nFormer House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had a similarly narrow coalition last Congress, when she passed major bills with consequential policy changes.

The House turned a portion of the Ukraine funding — the 20 percent that goes directly to the Ukrainian government — into a loan, and the House passed a fourth bill that seizes Russian assets and would ban TikTok if it isn't sold by its Chinese parent.\nAdvertisement\nWhile the House passed the four parts separately, the bills are combined into one in the Senate. It will hold a vote Tuesday at 1 p.m. to move on the measure.\nThe earlier package received 70 votes in February. The vote tally this week should be similar.\nWhat happens next on that effort to oust Johnson\nThe House adjourned for the week without Greene trigging her motion to remove Johnson from the speakership. She continues to insist that she will do it but hasn't provided a timeline.\nBased on her comments, it appears she doesn't have widespread support beyond the definitive other two Republicans who have signed on: Reps.

            "summary": "The internet's most reviled site was a place rife with sex crimes. Now, a lawyer and former rabbi is attempting to rebrand it as a 'safe space'\nLOS ANGELES\nSolomon Friedman is addressing a standing-room-only crowd in Hollywood, rooster-printed socks peeking out from his New Balance sneakers from his perch onstage.\n'I come from a big Jewish family. I've had some raucous Passover Seders … but what we have in common, and we as an industry have in common, is this fundamental belief that we have a right to exist,' he says.\nFriedman isn't referring to antisemitism, but pornography. After all, he's giving a keynote address at one of the biggest porn conferences in the world: the XBIZ show.\nThe audience visibly begins to relax, their heads nodding in agreement. Performer Melody Melons, clad in pink pants and a tight shoulder-baring black top, sits rapt.\nLast year, Friedman, 38, co-founded a private equity firm to purchase MindGeek, the parent company of Pornhub, one of the largest porn streaming and entertainment sites in the world. He attended XBIZ to introduce himself to a skeptical audience whose livelihoods were initially wrecked by the site's free content offerings. After his keynote, when asked if he planned to attend the convention's lingerie-themed Wonderland party, he replied no. 'Who wants to see this,' he told The Washington Post, pointing to himself, 'in silk pajamas?'\nFriedman, a lawyer who is also trained as a rabbi, is an unlikely face of Pornhub, which offers free, usually short, adult videos classified by content to 130 million daily visitors, according to the site. He speaks with the confidence and clarity of a college professor because he is one at the University of Ottawa. He certainly looks the part with his black-rimmed glasses, closely cropped beard and gray sport coat.\naccording to the site.

It was one of the first adult 'tube sites,' like YouTube, where anybody could upload clips, resulting in a site rife with child porn, rape and sex trafficking. The company faces opposition from all corners: state legislators, international governments, anti-trafficking groups, credit card companies and the adult entertainment industry itself. The company was so disliked that its previous owner's house was burned down. Friedman said he has received death threats and that he and his three kids have been subjected to 'horrific antisemitism.'\nThe company faces opposition from all corners: state legislators, international governments, anti-trafficking groups, credit card companies and the adult entertainment industry itself. The company was so disliked that its previous owner's house was burned down. Friedman said he has received death threats and that he and his three kids have been subjected to 'horrific antisemitism.'\nAnd so Friedman wants to reform Pornhub, he said, with plans to compensate performers more fairly, keep nonconsensual material off the site, and vet studios and performers more closely. The company's recent press materials speak of 'core values of consent' and describe it as 'a safe space for verified content creators.' It also touts its 'supportive partnership' with a national social justice network for sex workers. Critics remain skeptical.\n'I don't think that there is any other … product where the gulf between private consumption and public criticism is so broad,' Friedman told The Post. 'The people that don't like guns, they don't secretly have big vaults full of guns.'\nPorn has been decried as a public health crisis, with age verification laws, which are supposed to prevent kids from accessing online porn, sweeping the nation. Eight states now require some form of official ID, such as a driver's license, or commercially available information such as mortgage data, to access online porn; five more have passed similar laws that will go into effect by Jan. 1, 2025; and at least 16 states have bills requiring ID pending. The Texas legislature even passed a law requiring porn websites to include a controversial warning that 'pornography is potentially biologically addictive' and 'proven to harm human brain development.'\nPornhub has fought back against these laws. The company was a co-plaintiff in a lawsuit against the state of Texas, arguing that the state's age-verification law was unconstitutional. In March, a judge ruled that the law could stand, but struck down the warning requirement. Now, the company blocks access to Pornhub in Texas, as they do in Virginia, Montana, North Carolina, Arkansas, Utah and Mississippi.\nOne of Pornhub's most outspoken opponents is the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE), formerly Morality in Media. In a Jan. 25 press release, NCOSE said despite new ownership, Pornhub 'is likely still infested with videos of rape, sex trafficking, child sexual abuse.' NCOSE is a co-plaintiff in two lawsuits against Pornhub's parent company (filed before Friedman bought MindGeek), alongside a woman who had videos of her being sexually abused as a child posted to the site. Another group, the religious anti-porn organization Exodus Cry, has created TraffickingHub, a website and campaign aimed at shutting down Pornhub, claiming the site profits from child abuse and sex trafficking.\nAdvertisement\nNot all critics of Pornhub are anti-porn. The #NotYourPorn group — founded when a woman's hacked iCloud videos ended up on Pornhub — got the site to remove numerous nonconsensual videos in 2019, but only after months of campaigning. The group's director, Elena Michael, thinks Pornhub can redeem itself by implementing new safety policies, but she wants the company to apologize publicly for harming victims. 'We have expressed regret,' Friedman said, pointing to a previous company statement.\nMichael, thinks Pornhub can redeem itself by implementing new safety policies, but she wants the company to apologize publicly for harming victims. 'We have expressed regret,' Friedman said, pointing to a previous company statement.\nPornhub also has few friends within the industry. Its original business model was ripping off copyrighted content, streaming it on its website free and raking in cash from advertising. People stopped paying for porn. Eventually, Pornhub gave performers and directors a way to monetize their content, but the damage was done.\n'It was an absolute disaster for the porn industry,' said sex worker Cherie DeVille, who spoke on the condition that The Post use only her stage name for safety reasons. 'Their entire business model, like Napster back in the day, was to steal. … The first time Pornhub came to AVN [another porn conference] people spat on them.'\nA few hours before his keynote, Friedman is standing by the water dispensers at the Kimpton Everly Hotel bar, far from the busty BongaCams girls bouncing pink and white balloons. He appears to be figuring out his place in all of this, though he smiles and laughs easily. Still, he's prepared to talk, occasionally resorting to sound bites and repeating phrases such as 'trust and safety' and 'constitutionally protected.'\nFor Friedman, porn isn't the problem. It's just that it peels away social niceties to reveal the human condition. 'Pornography is a mirror and reflects society back at itself,' he said. 'So when people complain about porn, it's like looking in the mirror, being unhappy [and saying], ‘I gotta smash that mirror.''\nFriedman, who was one of nine kids, grew up 'in a house with more computers than children,' he said. His dad was a computer programmer, and Friedman had a Unix terminal in his bedroom. Friedman followed a typical Orthodox Jewish path: he married young, had three kids and studied Torah. He moved to Israel to attend rabbinical school at age 18. After returning to Canada, he became ordained as a rabbi, then went to law school. Friedman clerked for the Supreme Court of Canada, then became a criminal defense lawyer in private practice, a job he held for 15 years.\nDominic Lamb, Friedman's friend and former law partner, said that when Friedman joined the firm Edelson and Associates in the early 2010s, he was 'a super bright young man' and a 'hustler' with 'a great business mind.' Friedman was particularly skilled at teaching and mentoring young lawyers, Lamb said. The two worked on a number of child pornography cases. 'It gives you a nuanced sense of how the legitimate world of pornography works … and where things go wrong,' Lamb said. In 2019, Friedman left to create a law firm with Fady Mansour.\nIronically, it was Nicholas Kristof's scathing December 2020 op-ed in the New York Times, which argued that exploitation and assault were endemic to Pornhub, that put the site on Friedman's radar. About three months after the article was published, Bruinen Investments, which was trying to acquire MindGeek, brought Friedman on board as a partner to assess the company's criminal and regulatory compliance. He'd read Kristof's article and said he was predisposed to think the company was a possible cesspool. 'In a million years, I never thought that I would have anything to do with an adult entertainment company,' Friedman said.\nthat exploitation and assault were endemic to Pornhub, that put the site on Friedman's radar.

He'd read Kristof's article and said he was predisposed to think the company was a possible cesspool. 'In a million years, I never thought that I would have anything to do with an adult entertainment company,' Friedman said.\nBut Pornhub was using 'probably the most sophisticated content fingerprinting tool' to find and eradicate child sexual abuse material, Friedman said. 'As a defense lawyer involved in cases with respect to online exploitation … [I learned] how difficult it is for … mainstream social media platforms to block unlawful content and how difficult it is for police to investigate and ultimately prosecute these offenses,' Friedman said.\nPornhub was using 'probably the most sophisticated content fingerprinting tool' to find and eradicate child sexual abuse material, Friedman said.

According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, in 2022, Facebook self-reported 21,165,208 instances of suspected CSAM in comparison to Pornhub's 1,996. These reports are required by law.\nAdvertisement\nThe initial acquisition failed. Then, last year, Friedman set up a private equity firm with Mansour, his law partner; political strategist Sarah Bain; investor Rocco Meliambro; and Derek Ogden, the former chief superintendent of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The group, which has members with ties to Canada's cannabis industry, was named Ethical Capital Partners (ECP) — an audacious moniker given the porn industry's reputation — and bought MindGeek for an undisclosed sum, renaming it Aylo.

(According to Toronto's the Globe and Mail, Bruinen had been prepared to pay $475 million for a 'distressed' Pornhub in 2021.)\nLamb wasn't surprised by the move. Though the company was controversial, Lamb said, as a former criminal defense lawyer, Friedman was used to dealing 'with baggage.' He thinks Friedman's experience will allow him 'to bring a fresh set of eyes … so that those who are engaged in pornography as a business can make money and that nobody is going to get hurt.'\nLater on at a 'Meet Market' event, Friedman stood next to a palm tree and an open bar on the fifth-floor patio of the hotel, surrounded by buxom content creators in sky-high heels, goateed directors and gold-jewelry-clad business executives, all vying for his attention. He had become the star of the show, although he maintained he was there to listen.\nThe next day, Friedman gives up his seat to an older attendee and stands next to the exit sign to listen to Pornhub executive Sana Gaziani and the company's vice president of community and brand, Alex Kekesi, speak. They're updating a packed room on Pornhub's newest services — the TikTok-like video streamer Shorties and an OnlyFans competitor called UVIU — as well as increasingly stringent verification requirements for performers.\nPornhub doesn't want kids anywhere near porn for ethical reasons, Kekesi tells the crowd, her cherry red nails and studded clogs betraying her punk-rock past. And the company isn't 'against age verification in principle.' But the laws are 'ineffective and designed to kill our industry,' she insisted. Kids can use virtual private networks (VPNs) to get around restrictions. She prefers device-level verification, which Apple and Android phones offer, where parents can use built-in controls to block pornography.\nThe mood shifts when Gaziani projects a slide about the company's new performer verification requirements, which spark several complaints about onerous paperwork. Everyone in a scene must be verified, not just the performer who uploads the video. 'We want to make sure everybody's over 18 [and] the IDs … match the individuals in the videos,' Gaziani said. If the content doesn't have people's faces in it, 'sometimes we ask for a full-body scan,' she continued. 'We're doing it in the name of safety. We're not trying to make anyone's life more difficult.'\nA lack of verification is what got Pornhub into trouble before. Kristof's piece condemned the Wild West-like nature of Pornhub, which allowed anyone to upload videos. In response to the article and U.S. and Canadian government investigations, '8 million pieces of unverified content were removed,' Friedman said. And Pornhub started the verified upload program.\ncondemned the Wild West-like nature of Pornhub, which allowed anyone to upload videos. In response to the article and U.S. and Canadian government investigations, '8 million pieces of unverified content were removed,' Friedman said. And Pornhub started the verified upload program.\nAfter the conference, Friedman would conduct a walk-through of it over Zoom. 'We're now up to about 35,000 forbidden words [and] phrases in 32 languages,' he said of the program, which also checks IDs for authenticity, running them through a known fraud list, and requires facial scanning. Once a performer is verified, each video needs to be approved before it goes up. Titles that include banned words — say, 'underage' — are rejected. Once a title is approved, the video is run through multiple databases to check for nonconsensual imagery and CSAM. If there's a match, the company reports it to law enforcement.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'This is now the strictest set of guidelines that I have to comply with,' said Siri Dahl, who spoke on the condition that The Post use only her stage name for privacy reasons, and works for the Aylo-owned porn studio Brazzers as a content creator.\nwho spoke on the condition that The Post use only her stage name for privacy reasons, and works for the Aylo-owned porn studio Brazzers as a content creator.\nOne group Friedman works with is Crime Stoppers International (CSI). 'You go where the risk is, and if there's an organization that's looking to reduce harm to children online, then we're all for it,' said Shane Britten, CSI's director. 'They [Pornhub] go through a far more rigorous check than YouTube or Facebook.'\nWhat Friedman is most proud of is the Safeguard program. It provides digital fingerprints for each item on the site. When content is flagged for CSAM, nonconsensual videos or terms-of-service violations, Safeguard fingerprints it, prevents the video from being uploaded, and searches the 4.5 million videos on the website for copies.\nThe user side has been amped up as well. At the bottom of every page of Pornhub is a 'content removal request form.' If someone fills it out, the video gets taken down immediately.\nPornhub doesn't offer AI-generated adult videos, and while it does use AI for moderation and safety, every piece of content goes through human moderation as well, according to Friedman. Pornhub has 'always considered deep fakes to be nonconsensual content' and the company is 'at the forefront of combating them,' he said. The Taylor Swift deepfakes that 'spread like wildfire' on social media, he added, 'never would have passed even the most basic cursory review by a Pornhub moderator.'\nAdvertisement\nJust how significant are these reforms? Samantha Cole, a journalist who focuses on sex work and technology and is the author of 'How Sex Changed the Internet and How the Internet Changed Sex,' said that Pornhub is 'one of the very few online platforms that's actually made meaningful changes to the way it operates following criticism.' Though she believes it is now 'the safest tube site on the internet,' the company hasn't always been this way.\n'People working directly in the industry — including employees of Pornhub as well as performers themselves — urged the company to make meaningful moderation changes for years, to stop content theft as well as nonconsensual abuse imagery,' she said. 'Corporations almost always put profit over safety, and are usually reactive instead of proactive when it comes to moderation. Pornhub was forced to act following a serious blow to its business [Mastercard, Visa and Discover pulling services from the site] due to an intense anti-porn and ‘anti-trafficking' campaign.'\nOthers are harsher in their assessment. Becky Holt, a PhD candidate at Concordia University who is writing her dissertation on Pornhub's history and content moderation policies, said that the company's rebranding is nothing new. 'It feels very familiar to me in terms of language. … I've seen the company go through a pretty similar cycle,' she said. 'I remain skeptical, I guess, of what they mean when they say ‘ethical.''\n'They will make significant changes under the banner of ethics, if it's something that seriously impacts their profit,' Holt continued. This includes preventing kids from accessing the site, she added. 'There's a lot of evidence to suggest that they've always been extremely careful about content featuring minors … because this could shut down their business … but it's very, very hard to do the kind of proper level of nitpicking that you really need to do in order to find this type of content.'\nAylo, meanwhile, has another audience to convince: the dozens of state senators who think the company shouldn't exist. On March 14, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) tweeted: 'Pornhub has now disabled its website in Texas … good riddance.'\nMontana state Sen. Willis Curdy (D) told The Post that he didn't expect Pornhub to block access to his state after the age-verification bill he sponsored became law on Jan. 1, 2024. He said he sponsored the legislation because he believes access to porn websites has led to sexual assaults and suicides. Pop singer Billie Eilish's claim that 'watching porn destroyed my brain' also influenced his decision. His bill was modeled on Louisiana state Sen. Laurie Schlegel's (R) age-verification bill, the first in the nation, which went into effect Jan. 1, 2023.\n'I got bipartisan signatures on the bill. And it sailed through both the House and Senate,' Curdy said. 'This is not a party issue. It's a human health, a human psychology, issue.'\nThe rebrand does, however, appear to be working within the adult entertainment industry itself. When it was announced that Mastercard had resumed processing payments on the site, a cry of 'Hallelujah!' could be heard from the conference crowd.\n'I really liked the fact that they're willing to put a face to the name out there and talk to regulators or talk to government officials. I think that's absolutely critical. It opens the door ... to say, ‘Hey, this is a legitimate business,'' said Jimmy James, COO and VP of adult video company ATKingdom, adding that the new leadership is 'potentially removing the stigma' of the adult industry.\nThe conference 'went better than expected,' Friedman said on its final day. He was standing in the hotel restaurant holding a bag full of business cards. 'This is a tough industry … but being here re-energized me. You meet the real human beings,' he said.\nHe felt welcomed. And he was optimistic about his mission. Pornhub's executives 'share the very same values of the general public,' he insisted. 'We want to respect people's bodily autonomy. We want to protect young people. We cherish freedom of expression, individuality and sexuality. There's a reason why adult content is constitutionally protected in every single Western liberal democracy.'",

He campaigned in the Great State of Louisiana on TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP, and was absolutely thrilled when he was able to get my very important Endorsement. His advertisements were all about 'TRUMP,' and our relationship, which basically didn't exist in that I did not know him well. In any event, he easily won Re-Election. Cassidy is a total 'stiff,' but Louisiana didn't need him to protect them, because they had ME, 100%! Nevertheless, when the Democrats' Impeachment Hoax started, this Lamebrain Senator actually voted against me. He thought it was so 'cool,' until he got home, and was literally pelted with everything that could be used for such an inglorious happening, especially words, with lots of foul language thrown in….\nHAPPY EASTER TO ALL, INCLUDING CROOKED AND CORRUPT PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES THAT ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO INTERFERE WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2024, AND PUT ME IN PRISON, INCLUDING THOSE MANY PEOPLE THAT I COMPLETELY & TOTALLY DESPISE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DESTROY AMERICA, A NOW FAILING NATION, LIKE 'DERANGED' JACK SMITH, WHO IS EVIL AND 'SICK,' MRS.

HAPPY EASTER EVERYONE!\nJudge Engoron and Letitia James should be forced to explain why he ruled that Mar-a-Lago was worth $18,000,000 when, in fact, it is worth from 50 to 100 times that amount. How did the Attorney General of the State of New York force this Corrupt Judge to do that in order to help her narrative - AND WHY?\nAccording to The Righting's Analysis of Election Year Traffic, CNN is down 19%, The New York Times is down 22%, Slate is down 42%, The Washington Post is down 43%, The Daily Beast is down 45%, and The Drudge Report is down 81%!\nJudge Juan Merchan is totally compromised, and should be removed from this TRUMP Non-Case immediately. His Daughter, Loren, is a Rabid Trump Hater, who has admitted to having conversations with her father about me, and yet he gagged me. She works for Crooked Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Adam 'Shifty' Schiff, and other Radical Leftists who Campaign on 'Getting Trump,' and fundraise off the 'Biden Indictments' - including this Witch Hunt, which her father 'presides' over, a TOTAL Conflict - and attacking Biden's Political Opponent through the Courts.

It would say Roger Ailes. I would say, ‘He's my future husband.' It never stopped. I'd ask him to twirl for me. I adored him.'\nVanity Fair: 'You also confessed to sexually harassing Roger Ailes while you had a show on his cable channel America's Talking. He is also on your list of hideous men, but was once a friend.'\nGovernor Chris Sununu, the now failing Governor of New Hampshire, where I am beating his endorsed candidate, Nimbra, by big numbers, and DeSanctimonious by even bigger numbers, should spend more time keeping Democrats from voting in the Republican Primary - How ridiculous is that? Anyway, it doesn't matter, because Nimbra doesn't have what it takes. She's weak on China, Russia, Borders, and Crime, but never saw a war she didn't like. I defeated ISIS, Rebuilt our Military, and brought our soldiers back home. I hope Sununu's endorsement of Nimbra has more strength than Kim Reynolds' Iowa endorsement of DeSanctus! How did that work out? MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\nHas everybody seen the revelation, just announced in the Great State of Georgia, that the Fulton County D.A., Fani Willis, who Criminally Indicted your Favorite President, ME(!), & many other Innocent People/Patriots, HIRED & EXORBITANTLY PAID a 'Romantic Partner' to Prosecute the 45th President of the United States of America, & then 'financially benefitted from their relationship.' In other words, he was paid a 'fortune,' & then took 'Beautiful' Fani on expensive, but all paid for by Georgia, vacations to faraway lands! THE ATLANTIC JOURNAL CONSTITUTION: 'The bombshell public filing alleged that Special Prosecutor Nathan Wade, a private attorney, paid for lavish vacations he took with Willis, using the Fulton County funds his law firm received. County records show that Wade, who has played a prominent role in the [FAKE!] ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE against TRUMP & others, has been paid nearly $654,000 [WOW!] in legal fees since January 2022. The DA authorizes his compensation.'…..\nCrooked Joe Biden's errand boy, Deranged Jack Smith, is obsessed with attacking your favorite President, me, and with interfering in the 2024 Presidential Election, which I am Dominating. Deranged Jack is so Viciously and Desperately Angry that the Supreme Court just unanimously rejected his flailing attempt to rush this Witch Hunt, that he is ignoring the Law and clear instructions from the D.C. Court that this 'case' should be stayed, and there cannot be any more filings. Today's pathetic motion is not just Illegal, it is also another Unconstitutional attempt to take away my First Amendment Rights, and to prevent me from saying the TRUTH — that all of these Hoaxes are nothing but a political persecution of me, the MAGA Movement, and the Republican Party by Crooked Joe and his Despicable Thugs. The Radical Left Communists, Marxists, and Fascists are petrified of me speaking the TRUTH because the American People don't want them destroying our Country. Make America Great Again!\nOh, really bad news! The Owned by China Forbes Magazine deal with Russia just fell apart, so China will continue to own and run it, and say bad things about your favorite President, ME. But eventually it will cease to exist, be worthless. BAD WRITERS! Anyone that pays more than $50 Million for this pathetic outlet of Fake News is a fool!\nRemember when I told you that the poorly rated and not at all funny Late Night Talk Shows are nothing less than a major Campaign Contribution to the Radical Left Democrat Party. Watch what is going on - so interesting!\nMark Milley, who led perhaps the most embarrassing moment in American history with his grossly incompetent implementation of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, costing many lives, leaving behind hundreds of American citizens, and handing over BILLIONS of dollars of the finest military equipment ever made, will be leaving the military next week. This will be a time for all citizens of the USA to celebrate! This guy turned out to be a Woke train wreck who, if the Fake News reporting is correct, was actually dealing with China to give them a heads up on the thinking of the President of the United States. This is an act so egregious that, in times gone by, the punishment would have been DEATH! A war between China and the United States could have been the result of this treasonous act. To be continued!!!\nWhy does FoxNews constantly put on slow thinking and lethargic Bill Barr, who didn't have the courage or stamina to fight the Radical Left lunatics while he was A.G., and who, even more importantly, refused to fight Election Fraud. He knew what was going on, just look at his past remarks! Unless FoxNews starts putting the RIGHT people on, their Ratings will never recover.\nHOW CAN MY CORRUPT POLITICAL OPPONENT PUT ME ON TRIAL(S) DURING A CAMPAIGN THAT I AM WINNING (BY A LOT!), BUT FORCING ME TO SPEND TIME AND MONEY AWAY FROM THE 'CAMPAIGN TRAIL' IN ORDER TO FIGHT BOGUS ACCUSATIONS & CHARGES? IS THIS GOING TO BE THE FUTURE OF ELECTIONS IN AMERICA? CAN A PRESIDENT ORDER HIS DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO INDICT AN OPPONENT JUST PRIOR TO AN ELECTION? WHY DIDN'T THEY DO THIS 2.5 YEARS AGO? WHY NOW? NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE IN THE USA. THIS IS ALL ABOUT ELECTION INTERFERENCE!\nCONSIDERING THE FACT THAT I HAD TO FLY TO A FILTHY, DIRTY, FALLING APART, & VERY UNSAFE WASHINGTON, D.C., TODAY, & THAT I WAS THEN ARRESTED BY MY POLITICAL OPPONENT, WHO IS LOSING BADLY TO ME IN THE POLLS, CROOKED JOE BIDEN, IT WAS A VERY GOOD DAY!\nRebecca Lavrez, also known as the 'J6 Praying Grandma,' has been unfairly targeted by Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, and now faces up to 1 YEAR in prison for peacefully walking around the Capitol, and praying for our Failing Nation on January 6th! Rebecca is a 72-year-old Grandmother and Small Business Owner from Colorado, and now she is one of Joe Biden's J6 HOSTAGES!!!

He also regularly goes after members of Congress who investigated his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks and, of course, President Biden — Trump recently shared a video that featured an image of the president with his hands and feet tied together.\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nSome of the people Trump has attacked say they have received threatening calls, emails and letters, leading them to request enhanced security. Three judges have issued gag orders limiting what Trump can say about people in the cases. Just days into his hush money trial in Manhattan, prosecutors said Trump had violated a gag order there by posting links critical of Michael Cohen — his former lawyer and a key government witness — and prospective jurors. (His attorneys denied the accusation.)\nAlongside the attacks, Trump's feed is packed with links to right-wing news sites and conservative influencers.\nChart that compares Trump's top 10 most-linked-to websites on Truth Social vs. Twitter\nIt wasn't always this way. On Twitter, he used to link to a mix of mainstream and partisan sources.\nBut on Truth Social, he has largely walled himself off from mainstream political discussions. Instead, he posts a blend of polarized riffs on the news, fawning op-eds and interviews, and content from far-right accounts.\nDonald J.
