            "excerpt": "Focusing on disaster hasn't changed the planet's trajectory. Will a more upbeat approach show a way forward?",
            "summary": "The philanthropist Kathryn Murdoch has prioritized donations to environmental causes for more than a decade. She has, she said, a deep understanding of how inhospitable the planet will become if climate change is not addressed. And she and her colleagues have spent years trying to communicate that.\n'We have been screaming,' she said. 'But screaming only gets you so far.'\nThis was on a morning in early spring. Murdoch and Ari Wallach, an author, producer and self-proclaimed futurist, had just released their new PBS docuseries, 'A Brief History of the Future,' and had hopped onto a video call to promote it — politely, no screaming required. Shot cinematically, in some never-ending golden hour, the six-episode show follows Wallach around the world as he meets with scientists, activists and the occasional artist and athlete, all of whom are optimistic about the future. An episode might include a visit to a floating village or a conversation about artificial intelligence with the musician Grimes. In one sequence, marine biologists lovingly restore a rehabbed coral polyp to a reef. The mood throughout is mellow, hopeful, even dreamy. Which is deliberate.\n'There's room for screaming,' Wallach said. 'And there's room for dreaming.'\n'A Brief History of the Future' joins some recent books and shows that offer a rosier vision of what a world in the throes — or just past the throes — of global catastrophe might look like. Climate optimism as opposed to climate fatalism.\nHannah Ritchie's 'Not the End of the World: How We Can be the First Generation to Build a Sustainable Planet' argues that many markers of disaster are less bad than the public imagines (deforestation, overfishing) or easily solvable (plastics in the oceans). In 'Fallout,' the television adaptation of the popular video game that recently debuted on Amazon Prime Video, the apocalypse (nuclear, not climate-related) makes for a devastated earth, sundry mutants and plenty of goofy, kitschy fun — apocalypse lite.\n'Life as We Know It (Can Be),' a book by Bill Weir, CNN's chief climate correspondent, that is structured as a series of letters to his son, centers on human potential and resilience. And Dana R. Fisher's 'Saving Ourselves: From Climate Shocks to Climate Action' contends that the disruptions of climate change may finally create a mass movement that will lead to better global outcomes. Fisher, a sociologist, coined the term 'apocalyptic optimism' to describe a belief that humans can still avoid the worst ravages of climate change.\nIn confronting the apocalypse, these works all insist that hope matters. They believe that optimism, however qualified or hard-won, may be what finally moves us to action. While Americans are less likely than their counterparts in the developed world to appreciate the threats that climate change poses, recent polls show that a significant majority of Americans now agree that climate change is real and a smaller majority agree that it is human-caused and harmful. And yet almost no expert believes that we are doing enough — in terms of technology, legislation or political pressure — to alleviate those harms.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "For the past two years, world leaders, economists and activists have called for sweeping overhauls to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund that would make the two lending institutions more adept at combating climate change.\nDiscussions about how to reform lumbering multilateral bureaucracies can get tedious quickly. But ultimately the debates are all about money. How to make more money available for developing nations that are being battered by extreme weather? And how to make sure poor countries don't spend too much money servicing their debt?\nExperts estimate that at least $1 trillion a year is needed to help developing countries adapt to hotter temperatures and rising seas, build out clean energy projects and cope with climate disasters.\n'For many countries, they will only be able to implement strong new climate plans if we see a quantum leap in climate finance this year,' Simon Stiell, the United Nations climate chief, said in a speech last week.\nStarting in 2022, a burst of activity had made the prospect of such a quantum leap seem within reach.\nPolicymakers and economists gathered in Barbados and hashed out an ambitious reform agenda. The president of the World Bank stepped down after coming under fire for not doing enough to address climate change, and was replaced by an executive who promised to embrace climate work. Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, hosted a summit aimed at building momentum for the work.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "Despite significant progress, Scotland was falling short on cutting vehicle emissions, switching to heat pumps and even restoring peatland, the government said.",
            "summary": "Climate promises are hard to keep. Scotland is the latest, perhaps most surprising example.\nScotland, an early industrial power and coal-burning behemoth, was also an early adopter of an ambitious and legally binding government target to slow down climate change. It had promised to pare back its emissions of planet-heating greenhouse gases by 75 percent by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.\nThis week, its Net Zero minister, Màiri McAllan, said that goal was now 'out of reach.' She said Scotland, which operates semi-autonomously from Britain, would scrap its annual targets for cutting emissions and instead review targets every five years.\nThat is a sharp contrast to the bullishness of the Scottish government in 2021, when diplomats from around the world gathered in Glasgow for international United Nations climate talks. At that time, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called Scotland's climate targets 'not just amongst the most ambitious anywhere in the world — they are also amongst the toughest.'\nThe reversal shows how difficult it can be for governments to follow through on ambitious promises to slash emissions, despite the growing urgency to act as climate change rapidly warms the world and fuels extreme weather.\nWell beyond Scotland, the setback stands to play out in global climate diplomacy. It could bolster claims by some emerging economies, whose emissions continue to grow, that historic polluters, like Scotland, aren't doing enough to cut their fair share.\nThere are also domestic political ramifications in an election year in Scotland. It's an embarrassment for the ruling coalition, led by the Scottish National Party, which favors greater independence from Britain, of which Scotland is a part.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Global Monitoring Laboratory\nThe chart shows monthly numbers of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. Because of seasonal differences, levels are higher in May than in August.\nCarbon dioxide acts like Earth's thermostat: The more of it in the air, the more the planet warms.\nIn 2023, global levels of the greenhouse gas rose to 419 parts per million, around 50 percent more than before the Industrial Revolution. That means there are roughly 50 percent more carbon dioxide molecules in the air than there were in 1750.\nAs carbon dioxide builds up in the atmosphere, it traps heat and warms the planet.\nSource: NOAA (carbon dioxide); NASA (temperature)\nThe chart shows the change in global surface temperature relative to 1951–1980, versus global carbon dioxide levels. The dotted line shows the trend line.\nEvery additional amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere contributes to more warming, which is why climate scientists stress the need to get to zero emissions.\nCurrently, carbon dioxide levels are rising at near-record rates.\nAccording to data released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Global Monitoring Laboratory earlier this month, last year had the fourth-highest annual rise in global carbon dioxide levels.\nSource: NOAA's Global Monitoring Laboratory\nThe chart shows the increase in global carbon dioxide levels over the course of each year. In 2023, they grew by around 2.8 parts per million.\nThe long-term rise in carbon dioxide levels is caused by burning fossil fuels, as well as other human activities such as deforestation and concrete production.\nBut there is also a lot of variation from year to year, which you can see in the chart above.\nHow much carbon dioxide levels rise in a given year depends on two factors: the amount of fossil fuels burned globally, and the share of these emissions that are absorbed by the land and the ocean.\nConsider the first factor: While it's true that clean energy production is rising globally, so is the demand for energy.\nFossil fuels have made up the difference. This is why global fossil fuel emissions are still at record-high values (with a brief dip during the pandemic). And they stayed high in 2023, according to a projection by the Global Carbon Budget.\nNot all of these emissions end up in the air. The ocean and land absorb roughly half of the carbon dioxide that humans emit, while the rest stays in the air, said Glen Peters, a senior researcher at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research.\nSource: Global Carbon Budget\nThe chart shows the net amounts of carbon dioxide emissions absorbed by the atmosphere, land and ocean. The emissions are produced by burning fossil fuels, deforestation and other human activities. Data does not include 2023.\nThat one-half figure is an approximation. It varies from year to year depending on weather conditions and other environmental factors, resulting in the jagged lines you see in the chart above. For example, in a warm and dry year with many wildfires, the land may absorb less carbon dioxide than usual.\nAs the Earth warms further, climate scientists expect the land and the ocean to absorb a smaller share of carbon dioxide emissions, causing a larger share to end up in the air, said Doug McNeall, who studies these effects at Britain's Met Office.\nXin Lan, the lead scientist responsible for NOAA's global carbon dioxide measurements, referred to the natural absorption as a 'carbon discount.'\n'We pay attention to it because we don't know at which point that this discount is gone,' she said.\nIn addition to carbon dioxide, the levels of other potent greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide are also on the rise, which further contribute to warming.\n2023 was unusually hot, both on land and in the ocean. (The oceans absorb over 90 percent of the excess heat caused by global warming.) It was the hottest year in over 170 years of record keeping, even exceeding scientists' predictions.\nOne contributing factor to 2023's extreme heat was El Niño, a climate pattern that tends to raise global temperatures. During El Niño, warm ocean currents in the Pacific Ocean cause warmer and drier weather in the tropics. This can lead to droughts that slow the growth of trees and increase the risk of wildfires.\nWhen this happens, the land tends to absorb less carbon dioxide, and more of it ends up in the air. Several climate scientists said this may be why last year's rise in carbon dioxide levels was substantially higher than in the years preceding it.\nThe current high emissions levels make the climate goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius increasingly difficult to reach.\nTo limit warming to this threshold, experts say countries need to slam the brakes on global emissions and bring them down to near-zero in about a decade. And some are even considering more extreme technological solutions to help bridge the gap.\nEven if global emissions were brought down to half of their current value, we would still continue to add carbon dioxide to the air, causing further warming.\n'You need to bring them essentially down to zero in order to stop warming,' Mr. McNeall said.\nHow much more warming will occur depends on how long it takes for this to happen.\nOn one hand, clean energy investments are booming, and renewable energy production is rising globally. But energy demand is also projected to rise, coal power plants are still being built, and some sectors of the economy — like construction and manufacturing — are harder to decarbonize, making the task ahead a steep challenge.\nEven if the world exceeds the 1.5-degree threshold, 'every fraction of a degree matters,' Mr. McNeall said.\n'The closer that you can get to that threshold, the better.'\nAbout the data\nNOAA's annual global carbon dioxide measurements are an average of thousands of measurements made near sea level at about 30 locations around the world. To account for local differences in humidity, measurements are made using dry air.",

Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, have passed a dangerous new threshold as people continue to burn fossil fuels. Is anyplace making progress on climate change?\nThe short answer is: It's complicated, but yes.\nIn South America, one country has pivoted in less than a decade to generating almost all its electricity from a diverse mix of renewables. In China, an electric car that costs just $5,000 is suddenly one of the biggest sellers. Paris is transforming itself into a city of bikes.\nSteps like these, taken individually, aren't enough to avoid the most serious consequences of climate change — worsening droughts, intensified storms and human suffering. Still, they show how some places are pulling off significant local changes very quickly.\nGlobally, 'we're not moving as fast as we need to,' said Thomas Spencer, an analyst at the International Energy Agency. 'But we definitely have the tools to go much faster.'\n'Climate solutions actually do exist. They're here now,' said Jonathan Foley, the executive director of Project Drawdown, a nonprofit organization focused on climate action.\nTo mark Earth Day (and to try to reach young, environmentally-minded voters) President Biden is promoting a new national program to train and employ people in climate-related jobs, and reminding voters of the clean-energy investments underway following the Inflation Reduction Act.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

He slammed fossil fuel companies for ramping up plastics production and promoting technology to suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which he called 'utterly preposterous.'\nAfterward, Mr. Gore explained in an interview why he was not surprised that major oil and gas companies have walked back their pledges to decarbonize. And he said he believed that former President Donald J. Trump would lose his campaign to return to the White House. Here are excerpts from that conversation, edited and condensed for clarity.\nOil and gas companies recently gathered in Houston for the industry's annual conference. Many of the major companies have walked back their promises to decarbonize. In Houston, the head of Saudi Aramco said the 'fantasy of phasing out oil and gas' should be ditched.\nOil and gas companies recently gathered in Houston for the industry's annual conference. Many of the major companies have walked back their promises to decarbonize. In Houston, the head of Saudi Aramco said the 'fantasy of phasing out oil and gas' should be ditched. I don't think their pledges were sincere in the first place. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there was this pinch in Europe's access to fossil fuels which translated into a crunch and in demand elsewhere in the world. There was a sudden surge to try to replace the Russian supplies. That had a global impact on the price of fossil fuels, and on the profits of the large companies.\nWhen they got a taste of these higher windfall profits, they came under pressure from their investors to capitalize while the getting was good. So they just decided en masse to abandon their pledges and just go forward, without regard to what they had pretended to be doing in the past. I think it was always a fraud. It remains to be seen whether they are going to be able to walk back their pledges without incurring significant damage politically and in the business community.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

A formal denial of the project would come later this year, they said.\nThe road was essential to reach what is estimated to be a $7.5 billion copper deposit buried under ecologically sensitive land. There are currently no mines in the area and no requests for permits have been filed with the government; the road was a first step.\nBlocking the industrial road would be an enormous victory for opponents who have argued for years that it would threaten wildlife as well as Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing.\nEnvironmentalists, including many young climate activists, were infuriated last year by President Biden's decision to approve Willow, an $8 billion oil drilling project on pristine federal land in Alaska. The proposed road would be several hundred miles south of the Willow project.\nThe move comes as the Biden administration tries to find a balance between two different and sometimes opposing goals.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "An estimated 20 million people in southern Africa are facing what the United Nations calls 'acute hunger' as one of the worst droughts in more than four decades shrivels crops, decimates livestock and, after years of rising food prices brought on by pandemic and war, spikes the price of corn, the region's staple crop.\nMalawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe have all declared national emergencies.\nIt is a bitter foretaste of what a warming climate is projected to bring to a region that's likely to be acutely affected by climate change, though scientists said on Thursday that the current drought is more driven by the natural weather cycle known as El Niño than by global warming.\nIts effects are all the more punishing because in the past few years the region had been hit by cyclones, unusually heavy rains and a widening outbreak of cholera.\nThe rains this year began late and were lower than average. In February, when crops need it most, parts of Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Angola, Mozambique and Botswana received a fifth of the typical rainfall.\nThat's devastating for these largely agrarian countries, where farmers rely entirely on the rains.\nIn southern Malawi, in a district called Chikwawa, some residents were wading into a river rife with crocodiles to collect a wild tuber known as nyika to curb their hunger. 'My area needs urgent help,' the local leader, who identified himself as Chief Chimombo, said.\nElsewhere, cattle in search of water walked into fields still muddy from last year's heavy rains, only to get stuck, said Chikondi Chabvuta, a Malawi-based aid worker with CARE, the international relief organization. Thousands of cattle deaths have been reported in the region, according to the group.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The world's coral reefs are in the throes of a global bleaching event caused by extraordinary ocean temperatures, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and international partners announced Monday.\nIt is the fourth such global event on record and is expected to affect more reefs than any other. Bleaching occurs when corals become so stressed that they lose the symbiotic algae they need to survive. Bleached corals can recover, but if the water surrounding them is too hot for too long, they die.\nCoral reefs are vital ecosystems: limestone cradles of marine life that nurture an estimated quarter of ocean species at some point during their life cycles, support fish that provide protein for millions of people and protect coasts from storms. The economic value of the world's coral reefs has been estimated at $2.7 trillion annually.\nFor the last year, ocean temperatures have been off the charts.\n'This is scary, because coral reefs are so important,' said Derek Manzello, the coordinator of NOAA's Coral Reef Watch program, which monitors and predicts bleaching events.\nThe news is the latest example of climate scientists' alarming predictions coming to pass as the planet heats. Despite decades of warnings from scientists and pledges from leaders, nations are burning more fossil fuels than ever and greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Or a charismatic opportunist luring people into his latest scam.\nThese descriptions apply equally to characters from 'A Different World' — a sitcom that ran from 1987 to 1993 — and to today's social media influencers. So it's little wonder that the show, which streams on Amazon and Max, resonates with Gen Z.\nThe series began as a spinoff of 'The Cosby Show' centered on Denise Huxtable (Lisa Bonet), and it became a hit in its own right.\n'A Different World' broke ground by giving high visibility to an ensemble of aspirational Black young adults, following an eclectic cross-section of coeds attending Hillman College, a fictional historically Black university. There they dealt with typical collegiate growing pains — studying, partying, falling in love and stumbling into adulthood — and also with more serious subject matter, including racism, domestic abuse, gun violence, homelessness and mental health struggles.\n'These things mattered, and these are issues which are still relevant today,' said Darryl M. Bell, who played the Hillman huckster Ron Johnson.\nNow, more than three decades after the series finale, Bell and other core cast members, including Charnele Brown, Jasmine Guy, Kadeem Hardison, Dawnn Lewis, Cree Summer and Glynn Turman, have reunited for a campus tour of historically Black colleges and universities. Their mission is to raise awareness and enrollment for such institutions, to establish a 'Different World' scholarship fund and, of course, to give newer, younger fans a chance to see their parents' hand-me-down TV idols in person.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

At least 62 people have died in the storms in neighboring Pakistan, which has been hammered by rainfall at nearly twice the average rate for this time of year, according to Pakistani officials.\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, the Pakistani region bordering Afghanistan, appears to be the hardest hit. Flash floods and landslides caused by torrential rains have damaged homes and destroyed infrastructure. Photos and videos from the province show roads turned into raging rivers, and homes and bridges being swept away.\n'The rains have caused significant damage,' Bilal Faizi, spokesperson for the provincial disaster management authority, said in a phone interview. He added that at least 33 people had died in the province over the past four days, and 336 houses had been destroyed.\nAround midnight on Monday in Swat Valley, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Akbar Zada woke up to a thunderous crash after a boulder tumbled down a nearby mountain in the rain and destroyed a room of his home where two of his sons were sleeping. The boys, 14 and 16, were both killed.\n'The rain has been relentless these past years, and now it's taken my sons,' Mr. Zada said in a phone interview.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Its movies have won 21 Academy Awards.\nBut the company never quite managed to do good while also making money, at least not consistently. Matt Damon in a fracking drama ('Promised Land,' a 2012 Participant effort) has a hard time competing with 'Avengers: Infinity War' in 3-D.\nOn Tuesday, the company's founder and financial lifeline, the eBay billionaire Jeff Skoll, pulled the plug — a decision based, at least in part, on the atrophying entertainment business. Participant relies on studios and streaming services to distribute its content, and those partners are cutting back — especially on the 'niche' films and shows in which Participant specializes — as they contend with ongoing weakness at the box office, higher labor costs and increased profit pressure from Wall Street.\nStreaming services like Disney+ and Netflix have started to sell ads, and advertisers prefer all-audience, apolitical content. Eat-your-broccoli documentaries and dramas that explore underrepresented communities (both Participant sweet spots) are harder to sell than ever.\n'The entertainment industry has seen revolutionary changes in how content is created, distributed and consumed,' Mr. Skoll said in an email to Participant employees that was viewed by The New York Times. A spokesman said Mr. Skoll was unavailable for an interview.\nParticipant will immediately lay off most of its 100 employees.

            "summary": "As China's cities grow, they are also sinking.\nAn estimated 16 percent of the country's major cities are losing more than 10 millimeters of elevation per year and nearly half are losing more than 3 millimeters per year, according to a new study published in the journal Science.\nThese amounts may seem small, but they accumulate quickly. In 100 years, a quarter of China's urban coastal land could sit below sea level because of a combination of subsidence and sea level rise, according to the study.\n'It's a national problem,' said Robert Nicholls, a climate scientist and civil engineer at the University of East Anglia who reviewed the paper. Dr. Nicholls added that, to his knowledge, this study is the first to measure subsidence across many urban areas at once using state-of-the-art radar data from satellites.\nSubsidence in these cities is caused in part by the sheer weight of buildings and infrastructure, the study found. Pumping water from aquifers underneath the cities also plays a role, as do oil drilling and coal mining, all activities that leave empty space underground where soil and rocks can compact or collapse.\nBeijing is among the places in the country sinking the fastest. So is nearby Tianjin, where last year thousands of residents were evacuated from high-rise apartment buildings after the streets outside suddenly split apart. Within these cities, sinking is uneven. When pieces of land next to each other subside at different rates, whatever is built on top of that land is at risk of damage.\nOther countries, including the United States, have similar problems.\n'Land subsidence is an overlooked problem that almost exists everywhere,' said Manoochehr Shirzaei, a geophysicist at Virginia Tech who has studied subsidence in American coastal cities using similar methods. Dr. Shirzaei also reviewed the new study on Chinese cities.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump. Shortly before noon, lawyers began directly questioning the first group of prospective jurors to make it through initial queries. Questions involved their opinions on campaign finance law and on the trial's potential witnesses, including a porn star and a tabloid publisher. Earlier, some prospective jurors who had previously indicated that they would be able to be impartial had changed their minds after taking a night to think about it. 'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I hoped I could be,' one admitted. He was excused. It could take two weeks or more to pick the 12 jurors who will decide the case, which centers on allegations that the former president falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star, Stormy Daniels. The pool of possible jurors being scrutinized on Tuesday came from an initial group of 96, dozens of whom were dismissed immediately on Monday after indicating that they felt they could not fairly reach a decision. The dismissals underscored the difficulty of picking a jury in a city where the defendant is widely reviled. Mr. Trump, who may take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied all wrongdoing. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records that hid reimbursements to his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who had paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to buy her silence. Prosecutors say that Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election. Here's what to know about the case: The case was brought a year ago by Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. It is one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, but may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nA day after Mr. Trump appeared to nod off during pretrial motions, he was back at the defense table. He appeared somewhat bored as the jury selection process continued, with prospective jurors responding to a series of mostly yes or no questions.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America.\nMr. Trump has repeatedly complained that the case is a politically motivated witch hunt and has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and his family, as well as key witnesses, including Mr. Cohen. Justice Merchan has imposed a gag order on Mr. Trump that bars him from attacking witnesses, jurors, prosecutors or the judge's family. Even before the trial began on Monday, prosecutors asked Justice Merchan to hold the former president in contempt of court over social media posts about Mr. Cohen; the judge said he would hold a hearing later this month.

Asked about the fairness of Trump being on trial in Manhattan, where he's an unpopular figure, Adams replied, 'That is beyond my pay grade.' But, he added, 'This city is a fair city.'

After stressing that the trial was proceeding in an 'orderly fashion,' he was escorted down Centre Street away from the news media. Video Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, accused Donald J. Trump of falsifying business records connected to a hush money payment to a porn star. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony counts. Credit Credit... Andrew Seng for The New York Times All 34 felony counts at the center of the Manhattan criminal case against former President Donald J. Trump stem from a $130,000 hush-money payment handed over to a porn star in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign. The specific charges are far less titillating: falsifying business records in the first degree. But a conviction could still result in jail time. The payment was made by Mr. Trump's fixer, Michael D. Cohen, to Stormy Daniels in order to buy her silence about a sexual liaison she said she had with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump directed him to make the payment. Paying hush money is not illegal. But while serving as the commander in chief, prosecutors say, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen in a manner that constituted fraud: In internal records, Mr. Trump's company classified the reimbursement as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet there were no such expenses, according to prosecutors, who say the agreement was also fictional. Those records underpin the 34 counts of falsifying business records: 11 involve the checks, 11 center on monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted to the company and 12 involve entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust. Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing. In announcing the charges a year ago, Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, said that his office must keep a close eye on how companies conduct business in New York. 'This is the business capital of the world,' Mr. Bragg said. 'We regularly do cases involving false business statements. The bedrock — in fact, the basis for business integrity and a well-functioning business marketplace — is true and accurate record-keeping.' The charges against Mr. Trump are all Class E felonies, the lowest category in New York. Each count carries a maximum prison sentence of four years. Nothing in the law requires the judge, Juan E. Merchan, to imprison Mr. Trump if the jury convicts him. The judge could instead sentence him to probation. But Justice Merchan has made it clear that he takes white-collar crime seriously and could put Mr. Trump behind bars. It's possible, however, if Mr. Trump is convicted of more than one count, Justice Merchan would impose a concurrent sentence, under which Mr. Trump would serve all time simultaneously. Key Players in the Trump Criminal Trial ›  April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET Olivia Bensimon Reporting from outside the courthouse Journalists still vastly outnumber the Trump supporters who have gathered near the courthouse today. One man's Stars and Stripes flag flaps in the breeze, two other people are sitting on benches. Neighborhood workers on their lunch breaks bask in the spring sun. Jury selection is often a lengthy process, but in the first criminal trial of a former American president, currently taking place in a Manhattan criminal courthouse, it's going more slowly than normal. In part, that is because of the nature of the case: Jurors, once seated, will be asked to decide whether Donald J. Trump committed a crime. Prosecutors have charged him with 34 felonies, accusing him of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal that could have hurt his first presidential run. But the process has been particularly drawn-out because, once would-be jurors say they can be fair and impartial, they are being asked a series of 42 questions. After that, they face additional scrutiny from lawyers for the prosecution and the defense. Here are the 42 questions: 1. Without telling us your address, in what neighborhood do you live? For example, Upper East Side, Lower East Side, Inwood, etc. How long have you lived there? Are you a native New Yorker? If not, where did you live previously? 2. What do you do for a living?

The United States Constitution provides that a defendant has no burden to introduce any evidence or to testify in a criminal case. If Mr. Trump chooses not to testify, or to introduce any evidence, can you give us your assurance that you will not hold that against him? 42. Is there any reason, whether it be a bias or something else, that would prevent you from being fair and impartial if you are selected as a juror for this case? New York State makes no provision for anonymous juries, even in a case as sensitive as this one. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Last month, Justice Juan M. Merchan ordered that prospective jurors' names would be shielded from the public, underscoring the need for privacy for those who may decide Donald J. Trump's criminal fate — and tempt the anger of his followers. Yet on the first two days of jury selection, several prospective jurors revealed potentially identifying information, reflecting the difficulty of having an anonymous jury in a case with an intense media spotlight. On the first day, a woman said she worked for a city agency of approximately 500 people and revealed its name. Later, a man who identified himself as a bookseller revealed the name of the small store where he works. This continued on Tuesday when others revealed the names of employers. While some worked for companies that were large, where the potential jurors could likely remain unidentifiable, others were less cautious. One woman revealed the name of the three-person company she owns with her husband. Justice Merchan did not interject as the prospective jurors divulged the information, nor did he caution them against doing so. Juries are not completely anonymous in New York State. Mr. Trump, his lawyers and the prosecutors have access to the names of the prospective jurors. But after a request by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, Justice Merchan decided to withhold the names from the public. Mr. Trump did not oppose the request. The accidental self-identifications are a notable departure from how federal Judge Lewis A. Kaplan conducted jury selection in Mr. Trump's defamation trial in January, brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. In the federal system, jurors are allowed to remain anonymous, even to parties in the case. Before potential jurors answered basic questions about their backgrounds, Judge Kaplan instructed them not to reveal personal information. 'Don't give us anything that could enable anybody to pin you down geographically,' he said. He also cautioned them not to reveal their names to each other, and when the trial concluded, he left them with these ominous words: 'My advice to you is that you never disclose that you were on this jury,' Judge Kaplan said. 'And I won't say anything more about it.'

There are currently 18 remaining from yesterday's initial group who have been interviewed by lawyers, and six more who have yet to be interviewed. The judge, Juan Merchan, said that he's hoping to bring in a new group of prospective jurors — likely around 100 of them — in the afternoon. Soon, we may have some actual jurors. Maybe we can give the word 'prospective' some much-needed rest.

We can see prosecutors huddling and going over their notes, presumably evaluating the jurors and their responses. It's no exaggeration to say that this is one of the highest-stakes moments of the trial: evaluating who may help or sink the case based on little more than appearance, disposition and responses to a few questions.

But at one point, he smiled tightly when a potential juror said, 'I was a big fan of The Apprentice when I was in middle school.'

But the man refused to talk about it multiple times, saying it had \"absolutely no bearing on the case.' After some back and forth, he finally said he was a Democrat, but he did not budge further.

He takes issue right away with one of the analogies made by Joshua Steinglass, a prosecutor, who compared jurors analyzing information to spectators at a baseball game disagreeing with an umpire's calls.

April 16, 2024, 12:16 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 12:16 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse It sounds as if Trump has waived his right to be present for the small conferences held out of earshot of jurors, known as sidebars. Justice Merchan knows the importance of getting this little piece of the process right: an appeals court two years ago overturned a conviction in a case he presided over when a defendant did not appear at an important sidebar, and the defendant hadn't waived the right to do so.

We are running 5 to 7 minutes per person. The very premise of the trial is that prosecutors believe Donald J. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times Donald J. Trump first ran for president nearly a decade ago. Now, as he runs again in a political climate that he helped create, his Manhattan criminal trial is partly a referendum on his tactics during that first campaign. The trial's very premise is that prosecutors believe Mr. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign — sex scandals involving a porn star and a Playboy model, for example — he concealed them, the prosecutors say. But in a development that will bolster their case, prosecutors on Monday secured permission from the judge to admit evidence connected to Mr. Trump's overall political strategy in 2016. Much of it bears the former president's imprint: aggressive tweets, false denials, coordination with a tabloid publisher and more. The judge's ruling showed how the weapons that worked so well for Mr. Trump then are being turned against him in the courtroom now. The techniques prosecutors highlighted Monday were not invented by Mr. Trump for use in his campaign; they are behaviors he exhibited throughout his life as a businessman and a reality-television star. But in modern American political history, such raw tactics had rarely been seen at such a high level. One example is Mr. Trump's relationship with The National Enquirer tabloid and its publisher, David Pecker, who is expected to appear as a witness. The Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case, obtained permission from the judge on Monday to introduce evidence related to a 2015 meeting among Mr. Trump, Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump's former fixer, Michael D. Cohen. A prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, said on Monday that the three men had 'conspired to influence the 2016 election.' That meeting laid the groundwork for hush-money deals with a porn star, Stormy Daniels, and a Playboy model, Karen McDougal. But another result of that meeting, Mr. Steinglass said, were explosive headlines about Mr. Trump's opponents in the Republican primary, including those claiming that Ben Carson had committed 'medical malpractice' and that Senator Ted Cruz had a 'family connection to J.F.K.'s assassin.' A lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, protested the admission of evidence related to that meeting, saying that newspaper publishers met with candidates 'all the time,' and that there was nothing improper about it, let alone illegal. That admission worked against him. The judge, Juan M. Merchan, said that he was glad that Mr. Blanche believed that there was nothing wrong with the meeting — because it meant that he should not mind that the evidence would be introduced. 'There is no reason not to allow it in,' Justice Merchan said. Mr. Steinglass won again when he persuaded Justice Merchan to admit evidence of the Trump campaign in crisis after the publication in 2016 of the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump boasted about grabbing women by their genitals. 'The video sent the campaign into a tailspin,' Mr. Steinglass said. He offered up an email sent by a Washington Post reporter to Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump's campaign spokeswoman. Mr. Steinglass said that Ms. Hicks had forwarded the exchange to Stephen K. Bannon, Kellyanne Conway and other members of the campaign team, 'suggesting that their response should be to deny, deny, deny.' Eventually, he said, Mr. Bannon sent it to Mr. Cohen. Mr. Blanche again protested, but was again rebuffed. The judge said he would allow jurors to see the email, saying that the ensuing thread was relevant. The exchanges that prosecutors and defense lawyers debated on Monday underscored Mr. Trump's penchant for delegating dirty work to others, giving himself some distance in the process. The hush-money deals worked that way: Mr. Cohen paid off Ms. Daniels, while The National Enquirer bought Ms. McDougal's silence. (Mr. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to his reimbursement of Mr. Cohen.) That habit is still on display this year, and can be helpful given that Justice Merchan has barred Mr. Trump from attacking witnesses, prosecutors and the judge's own family. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump posted on social media a video of Laura Loomer, a political ally, in the park outside the courthouse. Ms. Loomer, speaking into a bullhorn, insinuated that the judge's family was politically compromised. Had Mr. Trump said that himself, he would have risked violating the judge's gag order.

Her honesty led to hearty chuckles among the reporters in the overflow room. Trump did not laugh.

But a few of those who have made it to this stage have realized while answering questions that they may have a tougher time than they thought. One prospective juror just admitted: 'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I hoped I could be.' He was excused.

Occasionally he fidgets, appears to write notes, whispers to his lawyer and at one point examined his tie. He largely stares ahead, not looking in the direction of the prospective jurors. But his glare fixates on the jury box when prospective jurors bring up conflicts, including a woman who said she realized overnight that she could not be impartial and unbiased. April 16, 2024, 10:03 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 10:03 a.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse Prosecutors have now filed court documents claiming that Trump violated the gag order barring him from attacking witnesses. They are asking that he be fined $1,000 for each violation, so $3,000 in all. It will be some time before the motion is decided. On Tuesday, the spectacle of the first trial of a president was fading into New York's usual urban bustle. Credit... Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The scene outside Manhattan's Criminal Court on Tuesday morning was placid — by New York standards — after the tense crush on the first day of Donald J. Trump's trial. On Monday, cable news stations had staked out every concrete surface bordering Centre Street. On Tuesday, there were swaths of open ground in the space reserved for media organizations. As the sun rose and workers in Collect Pond Park removed overflowing trash cans around 5:30 a.m., only five people were in the line for those holding official passes for entry. In the line for the general public were some familiar faces among court-watchers, including Ron Sinibaldi, whose hobbies include following high-profile cases. He's previously attended proceedings involving Senator Robert Menendez, who is accused of taking bribes, and New Jersey officials involved in closing the George Washington Bridge as political retribution. Everyday street scenes played out nearby. Around 7 a.m., a lone man fed pigeons in the park, which was sparsely populated by the time Mr. Trump's motorcade arrived nearly two hours later. An exception: one older man holding up a red Trump 2024 flag and shouting at television reporters: 'Fight! Fight! Fight for Donald Trump!' Shortly after, a line of young children toddled through, flanked by teacher's aides and clutching a rope, their neon orange vests a pop of color. Anusha Bayya contributed reporting.

One of the prospective jurors who was next to answer questions was experiencing flu-like symptoms and was sent home. Two other jurors, who answered questions yesterday, are running late. Justice Merchan has decided to proceed without them for now but will keep them in the larger jury pool.

Justice Merchan kindly reminded them to be on time going forward.  In court Monday, former President Donald J. Trump scowled and scoffed, and apparently slept. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab New York City courtroom as Mr. Trump looked on. Before jury selection began, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, rejected another effort to force his recusal by the defense, which cited several issues, including his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. He also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost. But Mr. Trump's lawyers did persuade Justice Merchan that mentioning sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump was recorded bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial. Entering the courtroom Monday, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here,' but he looked less enthusiastic in front of Justice Merchan. He quietly slouched and scowled — and at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep. By afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into the courtroom. Some quickly left: When the judge asked the first group of 96 if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused. The remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.   The jury selection process in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan could take two weeks or more. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Lawyers representing the State of New York and Donald J. Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate. The potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair. The process could take two weeks or more — and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court. 'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.' The stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County — Manhattan, as most people know it — which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020. Mr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated. Prosecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28. Unlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.' Some may not be completely forthcoming. 'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said. Mr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors. 'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'  Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Not since Eugene V. Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning. Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases: two federal, one in New York and another in Georgia. The first of those to go to trial is the sex scandal cover-up in New York, where jury selection began on Monday. For now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, beyond having to be present in a courtroom, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But some of the cases are proceeding at a pace that could bring verdicts before the election — and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that will arise if he is convicted. Others would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges. Here is what we know, and what we don't know. This is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes. The Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be 'natural born' citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years. There are no limitations based on character or criminal record. While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices. The Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground. 'We let states set the time, place and manner' of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, 'but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don't let the state add new substantive requirements.' While that view is not universal among legal experts, it prevailed in court in 2019, after California passed a law requiring candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the law from taking effect, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' after taking an oath to support the Constitution. Numerous lawsuits had argued that Mr. Trump's actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, met this bar. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine's secretary of state did the same. But the Supreme Court — led by a conservative supermajority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself — concluded that only Congress had the power to enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. (Four of the justices, including the three liberals, wanted to allow a wider range of options for disqualification.) Congress is not going to do that with Republicans in control of the House. And the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal cases, meaning convictions would not disqualify Mr. Trump either. Congress can designate either groups of people to whom Section 3 applies (such as people who fought for the Confederacy) or specific crimes that, upon conviction, would trigger disqualification, said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University. But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty. 'Whether or not Trump is tried, convicted, acquitted, that's a separate question from whether or not he's disqualified,' said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. One of the charges in the federal case related to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election — conspiracy to violate civil rights — once carried a disqualification penalty, Mr. Kreis said, but Congress removed it decades ago. Now that Mr. Trump has secured a majority of delegates to the Republican convention, the party has no mechanism to nominate somebody else. Under the party's official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, 'such support shall not be recognized.' Nor have top Republicans shown any interest in another nominee. If he were forced to withdraw from the race after the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him. Probably not. Mr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony. Most felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day. He could also petition for clemency, which would require the approval of the governor — Ron DeSantis, who ran against Mr. Trump in the Republican primary — and two Florida cabinet members. Chris Taylor, the director of external affairs for the Florida Commission on Offender Review, confirmed that a Florida resident convicted of a felony could apply to have their voting rights restored through that process even if their conviction happened outside Florida. Since Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison. So if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he could be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote. No one knows. 'We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 'It's just guessing.' Legally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. 'I don't think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,' Professor Levinson said. In practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts. In theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself. More likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump's lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch. On the federal charges only, he could also try to pardon himself — or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a 'self pardon' was constitutional. Or President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that 'the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,' Professor Chemerinsky said. But that wouldn't apply to the New York or Georgia cases, because the president does not have pardon power for state charges. Again, no one knows, particularly when it comes to the New York and Georgia cases. In the two federal cases, a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges. The Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents — that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties — applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario. 'The reasons why we wouldn't want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn't want to prosecute a sitting president,' said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department's reasoning. 'My guess is, if the Trump prosecution were still ongoing in some way and Trump were elected, the Justice Department — which would be the Trump Justice Department — would say, ‘We're following the 1973 memo.'' Like so much else here, this would be legally untested, and it is impossible to say what the Supreme Court would do if the question reached it. In its Clinton v. Jones ruling in 1997, the court allowed a lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed. But that case was civil, not criminal, and it was filed by a private citizen, not by the government itself. Charlie Savage contributed reporting.  © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe challenging process of choosing a jury in the first criminal trial of a former American president proceeded slowly on Tuesday, as prospective jurors were questioned individually about their ability to fairly consider the charges against Donald J. Trump.\nShortly before noon, lawyers began directly questioning the first group of prospective jurors to make it through initial queries. Questions involved their opinions on campaign finance law and on the trial's potential witnesses, including a porn star and a tabloid publisher.\nEarlier, some prospective jurors who had previously indicated that they would be able to be impartial had changed their minds after taking a night to think about it. 'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I hoped I could be,' one admitted. He was excused.\nIt could take two weeks or more to pick the 12 jurors who will decide the case, which centers on allegations that the former president falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star, Stormy Daniels.\nThe pool of possible jurors being scrutinized on Tuesday came from an initial group of 96, dozens of whom were dismissed immediately on Monday after indicating that they felt they could not fairly reach a decision. The dismissals underscored the difficulty of picking a jury in a city where the defendant is widely reviled.\nMr. Trump, who may take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied all wrongdoing. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records that hid reimbursements to his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who had paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to buy her silence. Prosecutors say that Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election.\nHere's what to know about the case:\nThe case was brought a year ago by Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. It is one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, but may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nA day after Mr. Trump appeared to nod off during pretrial motions, he was back at the defense table. He appeared somewhat bored as the jury selection process continued, with prospective jurors responding to a series of mostly yes or no questions.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America.\nMr. Trump has repeatedly complained that the case is a politically motivated witch hunt and has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and his family, as well as key witnesses, including Mr. Cohen. Justice Merchan has imposed a gag order on Mr. Trump that bars him from attacking witnesses, jurors, prosecutors or the judge's family. Even before the trial began on Monday, prosecutors asked Justice Merchan to hold the former president in contempt of court over social media posts about Mr. Cohen; the judge said he would hold a hearing later this month.\nApril 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET Anusha Bayya\nAnusha Bayya Reporting from outside the courthouse A midday addition to the crowd here, albeit briefly: Mayor Eric Adams has come by, flanked by his security detail, and was soon peppered with questions by reporters.

Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, accused Donald J. Trump of falsifying business records connected to a hush money payment to a porn star. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony counts. Credit Credit... Andrew Seng for The New York Times All 34 felony counts at the center of the Manhattan criminal case against former President Donald J. Trump stem from a $130,000 hush-money payment handed over to a porn star in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe specific charges are far less titillating: falsifying business records in the first degree. But a conviction could still result in jail time.\nThe payment was made by Mr. Trump's fixer, Michael D. Cohen, to Stormy Daniels in order to buy her silence about a sexual liaison she said she had with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump directed him to make the payment.\nPaying hush money is not illegal. But while serving as the commander in chief, prosecutors say, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen in a manner that constituted fraud: In internal records, Mr. Trump's company classified the reimbursement as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet there were no such expenses, according to prosecutors, who say the agreement was also fictional.\nThose records underpin the 34 counts of falsifying business records: 11 involve the checks, 11 center on monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted to the company and 12 involve entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust. Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing.\nIn announcing the charges a year ago, Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, said that his office must keep a close eye on how companies conduct business in New York.\n'This is the business capital of the world,' Mr. Bragg said. 'We regularly do cases involving false business statements. The bedrock — in fact, the basis for business integrity and a well-functioning business marketplace — is true and accurate record-keeping.'\nThe charges against Mr. Trump are all Class E felonies, the lowest category in New York. Each count carries a maximum prison sentence of four years.\nNothing in the law requires the judge, Juan E. Merchan, to imprison Mr. Trump if the jury convicts him. The judge could instead sentence him to probation.\nBut Justice Merchan has made it clear that he takes white-collar crime seriously and could put Mr. Trump behind bars. It's possible, however, if Mr. Trump is convicted of more than one count, Justice Merchan would impose a concurrent sentence, under which Mr. Trump would serve all time simultaneously.\nKey Players in the Trump Criminal Trial › Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET Olivia Bensimon\nOlivia Bensimon Reporting from outside the courthouse Journalists still vastly outnumber the Trump supporters who have gathered near the courthouse today.

Neighborhood workers on their lunch breaks bask in the spring sun.\nJury selection is often a lengthy process, but in the first criminal trial of a former American president, currently taking place in a Manhattan criminal courthouse, it's going more slowly than normal.\nIn part, that is because of the nature of the case: Jurors, once seated, will be asked to decide whether Donald J. Trump committed a crime. Prosecutors have charged him with 34 felonies, accusing him of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal that could have hurt his first presidential run.\nBut the process has been particularly drawn-out because, once would-be jurors say they can be fair and impartial, they are being asked a series of 42 questions.

Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Last month, Justice Juan M. Merchan ordered that prospective jurors' names would be shielded from the public, underscoring the need for privacy for those who may decide Donald J. Trump's criminal fate — and tempt the anger of his followers.\nYet on the first two days of jury selection, several prospective jurors revealed potentially identifying information, reflecting the difficulty of having an anonymous jury in a case with an intense media spotlight.\nOn the first day, a woman said she worked for a city agency of approximately 500 people and revealed its name. Later, a man who identified himself as a bookseller revealed the name of the small store where he works.\nThis continued on Tuesday when others revealed the names of employers. While some worked for companies that were large, where the potential jurors could likely remain unidentifiable, others were less cautious. One woman revealed the name of the three-person company she owns with her husband.\nJustice Merchan did not interject as the prospective jurors divulged the information, nor did he caution them against doing so.\nJuries are not completely anonymous in New York State. Mr. Trump, his lawyers and the prosecutors have access to the names of the prospective jurors. But after a request by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, Justice Merchan decided to withhold the names from the public. Mr. Trump did not oppose the request.\nThe accidental self-identifications are a notable departure from how federal Judge Lewis A. Kaplan conducted jury selection in Mr. Trump's defamation trial in January, brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll.\nIn the federal system, jurors are allowed to remain anonymous, even to parties in the case. Before potential jurors answered basic questions about their backgrounds, Judge Kaplan instructed them not to reveal personal information.\n'Don't give us anything that could enable anybody to pin you down geographically,' he said.\nHe also cautioned them not to reveal their names to each other, and when the trial concluded, he left them with these ominous words: 'My advice to you is that you never disclose that you were on this jury,' Judge Kaplan said.

We are running 5 to 7 minutes per person.\nThe very premise of the trial is that prosecutors believe Donald J. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times Donald J. Trump first ran for president nearly a decade ago.\nNow, as he runs again in a political climate that he helped create, his Manhattan criminal trial is partly a referendum on his tactics during that first campaign.\nThe trial's very premise is that prosecutors believe Mr. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign — sex scandals involving a porn star and a Playboy model, for example — he concealed them, the prosecutors say.\nBut in a development that will bolster their case, prosecutors on Monday secured permission from the judge to admit evidence connected to Mr. Trump's overall political strategy in 2016. Much of it bears the former president's imprint: aggressive tweets, false denials, coordination with a tabloid publisher and more.\nThe judge's ruling showed how the weapons that worked so well for Mr. Trump then are being turned against him in the courtroom now.\nThe techniques prosecutors highlighted Monday were not invented by Mr. Trump for use in his campaign; they are behaviors he exhibited throughout his life as a businessman and a reality-television star. But in modern American political history, such raw tactics had rarely been seen at such a high level.\nOne example is Mr. Trump's relationship with The National Enquirer tabloid and its publisher, David Pecker, who is expected to appear as a witness.\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case, obtained permission from the judge on Monday to introduce evidence related to a 2015 meeting among Mr. Trump, Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump's former fixer, Michael D. Cohen. A prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, said on Monday that the three men had 'conspired to influence the 2016 election.'\nThat meeting laid the groundwork for hush-money deals with a porn star, Stormy Daniels, and a Playboy model, Karen McDougal. But another result of that meeting, Mr. Steinglass said, were explosive headlines about Mr. Trump's opponents in the Republican primary, including those claiming that Ben Carson had committed 'medical malpractice' and that Senator Ted Cruz had a 'family connection to J.F.K.'s assassin.'\nA lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, protested the admission of evidence related to that meeting, saying that newspaper publishers met with candidates 'all the time,' and that there was nothing improper about it, let alone illegal.\nThat admission worked against him. The judge, Juan M. Merchan, said that he was glad that Mr. Blanche believed that there was nothing wrong with the meeting — because it meant that he should not mind that the evidence would be introduced.\n'There is no reason not to allow it in,' Justice Merchan said.\nMr. Steinglass won again when he persuaded Justice Merchan to admit evidence of the Trump campaign in crisis after the publication in 2016 of the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump boasted about grabbing women by their genitals.\n'The video sent the campaign into a tailspin,' Mr. Steinglass said.\nHe offered up an email sent by a Washington Post reporter to Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump's campaign spokeswoman. Mr. Steinglass said that Ms. Hicks had forwarded the exchange to Stephen K. Bannon, Kellyanne Conway and other members of the campaign team, 'suggesting that their response should be to deny, deny, deny.' Eventually, he said, Mr. Bannon sent it to Mr. Cohen.\nMr. Blanche again protested, but was again rebuffed. The judge said he would allow jurors to see the email, saying that the ensuing thread was relevant.\nThe exchanges that prosecutors and defense lawyers debated on Monday underscored Mr. Trump's penchant for delegating dirty work to others, giving himself some distance in the process.\nThe hush-money deals worked that way: Mr. Cohen paid off Ms. Daniels, while The National Enquirer bought Ms. McDougal's silence. (Mr. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to his reimbursement of Mr. Cohen.)\nThat habit is still on display this year, and can be helpful given that Justice Merchan has barred Mr. Trump from attacking witnesses, prosecutors and the judge's own family.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump posted on social media a video of Laura Loomer, a political ally, in the park outside the courthouse. Ms. Loomer, speaking into a bullhorn, insinuated that the judge's family was politically compromised.\nHad Mr. Trump said that himself, he would have risked violating the judge's gag order.\nApril 16, 2024, 10:51 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 10:51 a.m. ET Kate Christobek\nKate Christobek Reporting from the courthouse Jury selection has been a slow and slogging exercise but there are occasional moments of levity.

Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab New York City courtroom as Mr. Trump looked on.\nBefore jury selection began, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, rejected another effort to force his recusal by the defense, which cited several issues, including his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant.\nHe also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost.\nBut Mr. Trump's lawyers did persuade Justice Merchan that mentioning sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump was recorded bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial.\nEntering the courtroom Monday, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here,' but he looked less enthusiastic in front of Justice Merchan. He quietly slouched and scowled — and at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep.\nBy afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into the courtroom. Some quickly left: When the judge asked the first group of 96 if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused.\nThe remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT The jury selection process in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan could take two weeks or more. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Lawyers representing the State of New York and Donald J. Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate.\nThe potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair.\nThe process could take two weeks or more — and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court.\n'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.'\nThe stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County — Manhattan, as most people know it — which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020.\nMr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions.\nMr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated.\nProsecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28.\nUnlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.'\nSome may not be completely forthcoming.\n'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said.\nMr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors.\n'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Not since Eugene V. Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning.\nFormer President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases: two federal, one in New York and another in Georgia. The first of those to go to trial is the sex scandal cover-up in New York, where jury selection began on Monday.\nFor now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, beyond having to be present in a courtroom, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But some of the cases are proceeding at a pace that could bring verdicts before the election — and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that will arise if he is convicted.\nOthers would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges.\nHere is what we know, and what we don't know.\nThis is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes.\nThe Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be 'natural born' citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years.\nThere are no limitations based on character or criminal record. While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices.\nThe Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground.\n'We let states set the time, place and manner' of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, 'but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don't let the state add new substantive requirements.'\nWhile that view is not universal among legal experts, it prevailed in court in 2019, after California passed a law requiring candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the law from taking effect, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' after taking an oath to support the Constitution.\nNumerous lawsuits had argued that Mr. Trump's actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, met this bar. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine's secretary of state did the same. But the Supreme Court — led by a conservative supermajority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself — concluded that only Congress had the power to enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. (Four of the justices, including the three liberals, wanted to allow a wider range of options for disqualification.)\nCongress is not going to do that with Republicans in control of the House. And the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal cases, meaning convictions would not disqualify Mr. Trump either.\nCongress can designate either groups of people to whom Section 3 applies (such as people who fought for the Confederacy) or specific crimes that, upon conviction, would trigger disqualification, said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University. But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty.\n'Whether or not Trump is tried, convicted, acquitted, that's a separate question from whether or not he's disqualified,' said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nOne of the charges in the federal case related to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election — conspiracy to violate civil rights — once carried a disqualification penalty, Mr. Kreis said, but Congress removed it decades ago.\nNow that Mr. Trump has secured a majority of delegates to the Republican convention, the party has no mechanism to nominate somebody else. Under the party's official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, 'such support shall not be recognized.'\nNor have top Republicans shown any interest in another nominee.\nIf he were forced to withdraw from the race after the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him.\nafter the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him. Probably not.\nMr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony.\nMost felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day.\nHe could also petition for clemency, which would require the approval of the governor — Ron DeSantis, who ran against Mr. Trump in the Republican primary — and two Florida cabinet members. Chris Taylor, the director of external affairs for the Florida Commission on Offender Review, confirmed that a Florida resident convicted of a felony could apply to have their voting rights restored through that process even if their conviction happened outside Florida.\nSince Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison.\nSo if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he could be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote.\nNo one knows.\n'We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 'It's just guessing.'\nLegally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. 'I don't think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,' Professor Levinson said.\nIn practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts.\nIn theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself.\nMore likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump's lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch.\nOn the federal charges only, he could also try to pardon himself — or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a 'self pardon' was constitutional.\nOr President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that 'the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,' Professor Chemerinsky said.\nBut that wouldn't apply to the New York or Georgia cases, because the president does not have pardon power for state charges.\nAgain, no one knows, particularly when it comes to the New York and Georgia cases.\nIn the two federal cases, a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges.\nThe Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents — that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties — applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario.\n'The reasons why we wouldn't want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn't want to prosecute a sitting president,' said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department's reasoning. 'My guess is, if the Trump prosecution were still ongoing in some way and Trump were elected, the Justice Department — which would be the Trump Justice Department — would say, ‘We're following the 1973 memo.''\nLike so much else here, this would be legally untested, and it is impossible to say what the Supreme Court would do if the question reached it.\nIn its Clinton v. Jones ruling in 1997, the court allowed a lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed. But that case was civil, not criminal, and it was filed by a private citizen, not by the government itself.\nCharlie Savage contributed reporting.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",
