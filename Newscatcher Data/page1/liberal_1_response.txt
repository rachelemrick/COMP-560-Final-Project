Pryor, a liberal Democrat who won two terms as governor of Arkansas and three in the United States Senate, and who paved the way for the political rise of his young ally Bill Clinton in an era of changing racial attitudes in the South, died on Saturday at his home in Little Rock. He was 89.\nHis death was announced by his son Mark, himself a former two-term United States senator.\nMr. Pryor was eight years older than Mr. Clinton, and they didn't know each other well until they became accomplished politicians. But they had much in common. They both grew up in segregated small towns in Arkansas, raised by families of modest means and liberal outlook, who resisted pressures to scorn their Black neighbors.\nMr. Pryor's mother played the piano for services in a Black church, cooked meals for Black prisoners in a county jail and, at 56, became a missionary among the descendants of slaves in British Guiana. Mr. Clinton's maternal grandparents, who raised him, ran a small grocery store and during the harsh winters sold goods on credit to people of all races.\nAlong with another white liberal Democrat, Dale Bumpers, Mr. Pryor and Mr. Clinton courted union members and Black voters. All three won their first primary elections for governor against the same notorious segregationist, former Gov. Orval E. Faubus, who had called out the National Guard in 1957 in a futile effort to block the integration of Little Rock High School.\nMr. Pryor, center, with President-elect Bill Clinton and his fellow Arkansas senator Dale Bumpers at the Capitol in January 1993, shortly before Mr. Clinton's inauguration. Credit... Laura Patterson/CQ Roll Call, via Getty Image Attempting comebacks three times, Mr. Faubus lost Democratic primaries to Mr. Bumpers in 1970, Mr. Pryor in 1974 and Mr. Clinton in 1986. In heavily Democratic Arkansas, each man crushed his Republican opponent in the general election. Their governorships became springboards to national prominence \u2014 for Mr. Bumpers and Mr. Pryor in the Senate, and for Mr. Clinton in the White House for two terms.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump and embracing liberal causes.\nThe posts, published on the social media platform Twitter, which is now called X, were written before she was named chief executive of NPR in January. They resurfaced this week after an essay by an NPR staff member who argued that the broadcaster's leaders had allowed liberal bias to taint its coverage.\n'Also, Donald Trump is a racist,' read one of Ms. Maher's posts in 2018, which has since been deleted. Another post, from November 2020, shows Ms. Maher wearing a hat with the logo for the Biden presidential campaign.\n'Had a dream where Kamala and I were on a road trip in an unspecified location, sampling and comparing nuts and baklava from roadside stands,' Ms. Maher wrote, an apparent reference to Vice President Kamala Harris. 'Woke up very hungry.'\nMs. Maher, who had not worked in the news industry before joining NPR, was the chief executive of the Wikimedia Foundation, a nonprofit that supports the popular online resource Wikipedia, when she wrote many of the posts that are now being criticized.\nAn NPR spokeswoman, Isabel Lara, said in a statement that Ms. Maher\n'was not working in journalism at the time and was exercising her First Amendment right to express herself like any other American citizen.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

After their deaths, her world crumbled and she had to rebuild on her own.","summary":"The first time the musician Judith Hill performed her anguished requiem 'Black Widow' for an audience, she wept, right onstage.\nThe song's title is an epithet that has been directed at her for years by tabloids and trolls because as a vocalist and artist, she had been close with two of pop's biggest stars shortly before their deaths. She was Michael Jackson's duet partner and performed at his televised memorial in 2009. And for two years before Prince's fatal overdose in April 2016, she was his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, collaborator and more. They shared what she has called 'an intense relationship'; he told her he loved her.\nPrince's sudden, accidental death derailed her promising career \u2014 which he had been guiding \u2014 and she spiraled into deep grief, depression and self-doubt as online cruelty rained down. It took years before she was able to face what happened, personally or musically.\n'It was a deep wound,' she said onstage at a recent showcase at Mercury Lounge in Lower Manhattan, after the soulful, fierce 'Black Widow.' Then she brushed her tears away \u2014 'enough of that' \u2014 and soon started another number, 'Dame De La Lumi\u00e8re,' a detailed tribute to her mother and grandmother, with a rippling, urgent chorus that has become her anthem: 'Bad times make strong women.'\nBoth songs are on 'Letters From a Black Widow,' her new record, due Friday. It is a concept album that reckons forcefully with her past \u2014 not just the boldfaced part, but also the myriad woes and distortions that conspired to make her feel fearful and less-than. The dozen tracks that finally tumbled out chart her path of self-reflection and forgiveness, with achingly personal lyrics paired with muscular funk, soul and blues, and backed by her shredding, soaring guitar. It's a new reach for an artist known mostly for her acrobatic and emotional vocals; she wanted her determined message to resonate, too.\n'I felt unmuted,' she said, 'like I was free to say something now, because I felt like I had really put a muzzle on myself for so long, and was just afraid. And it was very, very liberating to do that.'\nAnd it was very, very liberating to do that.' Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

She was 89.\nThe cause of her death, in an assisted living facility, was cardiopulmonary failure, her son Howard Schwartz said.\nMs. Joans, Brooklyn-born, plucky and outspoken, began her career as an instructor at the New School for Social Research in Greenwich Village, with a focus on women's issues, producing papers on topics like the anthropological aspects of menopause.\nStarting in the 1960s, she was also a feminist crusader, helping women arrange illegal abortions in the days before Roe v. Wade. In 1970, she participated in a daylong occupation of The Ladies' Home Journal's editorial offices in New York to demand the opportunity to put out a 'liberated' version of the magazine.\n'She was a bit of a wild woman, a genuine nonconformist,' Phyllis Chesler, author of 'Women and Madness' (1972) and a longtime friend of Ms. Joans's, said in a phone interview. 'Yes, she was an academic and a nice Jewish girl from Brooklyn. But she was a little bit of a street hombre.'\nMs. Joans, born in Brooklyn, moved to Northern California in the 1970s after a divorce. Her motorcycle club, based in San Francisco, was called the Fog Hogs. Credit... Kenneth Harmon Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

By tradition, this is a joyful gathering of family and friends who follow a ritual order of blessings over symbolic foods as they retell the biblical story of the bondage and suffering of the ancient Israelites in Egypt and their exodus and liberation.\nIsraelis are still jittery after an exchange of fire with Iran this month, the first time Tehran had directly attacked Israel from Iranian territory. And the country continues to mourn the roughly 1,200 people killed in the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, which prompted six months of deadly fighting in Gaza so far. More than 250 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the start of Israel's ground invasion in late October, the military says. More than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, according to Gaza health officials.\nDaily tit-for-tat attacks over the northern border with Lebanon have turned a portion of Israel into a no-go zone. Tens of thousands of residents of northern and southern Israel remain in temporary accommodations, having been evacuated from their homes.\n'We will mark the Seder night for the children,' said Irit Feingold, 35, a pedagogic instructor for preschoolers who was attending a rally for the hostages in Jerusalem on Saturday night, and was planning to spend Monday night with about 25 members of her extended family.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Gavin Newsom of California ordinarily have little in common. One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states.\nBut for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West.\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks.\nThe City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis \u2014 the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing.\nThe conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them.\nAdvocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

In nearby Cambridge, a banner at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology declared part of campus a 'LIBERATED ZONE.'

It had a gathering area under a white awning heaped with supplies donated by fellow students. A red spray-painted sign announced its name: 'Gaza Solidarity Encampment.'\nFor those hours, living and gathering in the encampment felt purposeful and important, the activists said. A film screening was held after midnight; there was a teach-in. Hundreds of students marched around the encampment to show support.\n'It really feels like we've taken over the university and made it into the vision that students want it to be, and not what these bigwigs who want to encroach on academic freedom want it to be,' said Maryam Alwan, one of the organizers.\nBut for Columbia University, the encampment was anything but an Eden. The university's president, Nemat Shafik, fresh from a congressional hearing in which she had pledged to enforce the university's rules on protests, tried to get the students to stand down. When they did not, she decided to break with a decades-long norm in the university's approach to quelling protests.\nShe gave the police a green light to come in.\n'The current encampment violates all of the new policies, severely disrupts campus life, and creates a harassing and intimidating environment for many of our students,' she wrote in a letter to the Columbia community sent around 1:15 p.m. on Thursday.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The attorney general's office said the practice illegally drew on charitable donations, which are not supposed to be used for political activity.\nThe N.R.A., in a statement, portrayed the settlement as a victory, saying it had 'proved that all funds' taken from its foundation 'were applied exclusively in furtherance of its charitable programs and that there was no misuse' of resources.\nCharles Cotton, the N.R.A.'s president, called the lawsuit a 'political attack' and said his group had been vindicated, while the group's lead outside lawyer, William A. Brewer III, called it a 'politically motivated action.'\nBut Brian L. Schwalb, the attorney general, characterized the settlement much differently.\n'Caving to pressure from the N.R.A., the foundation diverted millions of dollars to the N.R.A. in grants and risky loans,' he said in his own statement, adding that the N.R.A. had used its foundation 'as an unchecked piggy bank.'\nThe settlement is one more legal shoe to drop for the embattled gun rights group. In February, a Manhattan jury found Wayne LaPierre, the longtime leader of the N.R.A., liable for misspending $5.4 million of the organization's money. Mr. LaPierre announced his resignation on the eve of the six-week corruption trial, which detailed his lavish personal expenses, including chartered flights for his relatives, excursions on luxury yachts and nearly $275,000 in Zegna suits.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

In the six previous national elections, the party comfortably won an absolute majority in Parliament, allowing it to govern as it wished. Now, though, the party faces a real threat of losing that majority for the first time.\nThis has forced the A.N.C. to get serious about pushing new solutions to the many problems that afflict the country. The party has also had to work hard to heal its internal divisions and address corruption among its ranks.\nAs one of the most developed economies and stable democracies in Africa, South Africa has enthusiastically embraced its role as a gateway to the continent for nations around the globe. But the grim economic conditions have brought fears of social unrest that could undermine the stability so important to the country's reputation and influence on the continent.\nVoters choose a party on their ballots, and the percentage of votes that a party gets determines how many seats it receives in the 400-member National Assembly. Members of the assembly, the more powerful of the two chambers in Parliament, then elect the president. This means that the party, or coalition of parties, with more than 50 percent of the seats chooses the nation's leader.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

But that didn't stop the government there, at the time led by the populist Law and Justice Party, from choosing him to represent the country at the Venice Biennale.\n'Of course, I was happy,' Czwartos, 57, recalled recently.\nBut just weeks after he got the news, Czwartos's opportunity vanished.\nAfter liberal, centrist and moderately conservative political parties formed a new government in Poland, they quickly dropped Czwartos as the country's Venice representative. Instead, the new culture minister announced that he would send Open Group, a Ukrainian collective, to the Biennale instead.\nCzwartos was furious. The decision, made with little explanation, 'was an act of political censorship,' Czwartos said, adding that the Polish government had acted like a totalitarian state.\nSo Czwartos made his own decision: He would to go to Venice anyway, the government be damned.\nA detail view of 'Fish II' by Czwartos, which depicts three Polish anti-communist resistance fighters killed in 1951.

But her grilling of the presidents of Harvard, University of Pennsylvania and M.I.T. at a December hearing became a defining moment.\nMs. Stefanik pressed the leaders to say whether students would violate their universities' codes of conduct if they called for the genocide of Jews. Their dispassionate, lawyerly answers about context and free speech set off a firestorm that ultimately helped cost two of them, Claudine Gay of Harvard and Elizabeth Magill of the Penn, their jobs.\nThe exchange also helped win Ms. Stefanik widespread attention and rare plaudits from grudging liberals, who typically revile her for embracing former President Donald J. Trump and his lies about the 2020 election. On Wednesday, she was named one of Time's 100 most influential people of 2024.\nMs. Stefanik is a graduate of Harvard herself. When she first won her seat in 2014, she was the youngest woman ever elected to the House of Representatives. She beat a centrist Democrat, and in the early days of her career, she took on more moderate stances.\nThese days, she describes herself as 'ultra MAGA' and 'proud of it.'\nMs. Stefanik, 39, has said she was 'stunned' by the responses of the presidents during the last hearing. She plans to reprise that role on Wednesday, grilling the president of Columbia University, Nemat Shafik, and members of its board of trustees.\nIn an opinion piece in The New York Post before the hearing, Ms. Stefanik said antisemitism at Columbia had become 'egregious and commonplace.'

In presenting the warning, NPR said that Mr. Berliner had failed to clear his work for outside outlets, adding that he would be fired if he violated the policy again.\nMr. Berliner's essay was published last week in The Free Press, a popular Substack publication.\nHe declined to comment about the suspension. NPR said it did not comment on personnel matters.\nThe revelation of Mr. Berliner's punishment is the latest aftershock to rattle NPR since Mr. Berliner published his essay.

Mr. Berliner told The New York Times last week that he did not reach out to the network before publishing his essay.\nAfter Mr. Berliner's essay was published, NPR's new chief executive, Katherine Maher, came under renewed scrutiny as conservative activists resurfaced a series of years-old social media posts criticizing former President Donald J.

John Mellencamp had barely finished the second verse of his smash hit when an exchange with a heckler had clearly gotten on his nerves.\n'You know what?' he told concertgoers last month in Toledo, Ohio. 'Show's over.'\nVideos capturing the moment when the singer walked off the stage have ricocheted for weeks online. A cascade of right-wing chatter on social media has fueled the perception that Mr. Mellencamp brought it on himself by promoting President Biden during the show.\nBut that was not the case.\nAn audio recording provided to The New York Times by Mr. Mellencamp's representatives, and an interview with a reporter who covered the March 17 concert for The Blade in Toledo, show that the exchange started when a heckler grew frustrated with the singer's long-winded reminiscences about his late grandmother. Representatives for Mr. Mellencamp, who returned to the stage and resumed the concert that night several minutes after walking out, declined further comment.\nMr. Mellencamp is an unabashed liberal who has previously barred several Republican presidential candidates from using his songs at political events and has assailed Congress for its response to gun violence. But the exchange with the heckler in Toledo did not stem from any political commentary that happened onstage.\n'The word Biden or election never escaped John Mellencamp's mouth that night,' Jason Webber, who covers music for The Blade, said in an interview.\nMr. Mellencamp, 72, a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, had been sharing an anecdote about how his grandmother, who had lived until the age of 100, had once cautioned him that 'you're not going to get into heaven if you don't stop this cussing and smoking all the time.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

She was 94.\nConcerned Women for America, which Mrs. LaHaye founded in 1979, announced her death in a statement.\nIn the 1980s, Mrs. LaHaye ran an office in Washington of more than 25 employees, including lawyers and lobbyists. She urged Congress to send military aid to the right-wing contras of Nicaragua; rallied her members to barrage the television networks to protest condom commercials; and testified in the Senate for President Ronald Reagan's Supreme Court nominees Antonin Scalia and Robert Bork.\nPresident Reagan appeared at Concerned Women of America's 1987 convention, as Judge Bork's nomination was facing fierce liberal opposition. He was greeted by signs stating, 'All Ladies Want Bork.' (The Senate rejected him.)\n'In just a few short years,' the president told Mrs. LaHaye's crowd, 'you've become the largest politically active women's group in the nation.' He called Mrs. LaHaye 'one of the powerhouses on the political scene today.'\nShe had arrived just two years earlier, moving her headquarters to Washington from California 'to be closer to the center of action,' she told The Arizona Republic in 1984.\nAt a news conference announcing her arrival, Mrs. LaHaye said that conservative women who turned to the Bible for guidance on women's role in the family and society \u2014 and not to the writings of Betty Friedan and other feminists \u2014 now had a public voice. 'This is our message: The feminists do not speak for all women in America, and C.W.A. is here in Washington to end the monopoly of feminists who claim to speak for all women,' she said.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Both parties are racing to define him.","summary":"The prospect of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. threatening to upend the presidential race went from an idea to a reality in one of the country's most consequential battlegrounds on Thursday, when Mr. Kennedy qualified for the ballot in Michigan.\nThe decision by the Natural Law Party to grant Mr. Kennedy its ballot line in November ensures he will be a factor in a pivotal swing state where the presidential election is expected to be incredibly close and where President Biden has already shown vulnerability with key Democratic constituencies. During Michigan's primary in February, a protest movement over Mr. Biden's support for Israel's war in Gaza drew significant support.\nMr. Kennedy, a lifelong Democrat and the scion of perhaps the nation's most famous Democratic family, is running as an independent in 2024 and polling higher in early surveys than any third-party candidate since Ross Perot, the self-funding billionaire who ran in the 1990s.\nHis independent candidacy has earned him the estrangement of his own family \u2014 who campaigned this week with Mr. Biden in Pennsylvania \u2014 and many of his previous colleagues from the environmental movement, who denounced his candidacy publicly on Friday.\nMr. Kennedy has emerged as a leading voice of vaccine skepticism, both before and after Covid-19 vaccine, and dabbled in conspiratorial theories, including about the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, his father. He had initially declared his 2024 campaign as a Democratic challenger to Mr. Biden \u2014 and was heavily featured in conservative media \u2014 until he switched last fall to run as an independent.\nBoth parties are already rushing to define Mr. Kennedy as he races to get on the ballot nationwide.\nBrian Hughes, an adviser to Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, called Mr. Kennedy 'a leftist and liberal with a history of supporting an extreme environmental agenda that rivals Joe Biden for its ability to kill American jobs.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

They ended the year in a political bind after two House members left to become mayors of suburbs, leaving that chamber with an even partisan split and making it impossible for Democrats to pass bills without Republican support.\nOn Tuesday, five months after their House majority evaporated, Democrats won two special elections to reclaim those seats and full control at the Michigan Capitol. The Associated Press said the Democrats Mai Xiong, a Macomb County commissioner, and Peter Herzberg, a Westland City Council member, defeated their Republican opponents.\nThe results of the special elections had never been in great doubt. Both districts, situated in the Detroit area, are liberal strongholds that Democratic candidates had carried by large margins in 2022. But the details of scheduling and running special elections meant a long, slow winter for Democratic lawmakers in Lansing while the House was evenly divided between the two parties. Michigan's governor, Gretchen Whitmer, is a Democrat, and her party has a majority in the State Senate.\nRepublicans hope the Democrats' renewed House majority is short-lived. Michigan, long a swing state, is expected to be a pivotal presidential battleground again this year. President Biden is working to rebuild a coalition that helped him win the state in 2020, but early polling has been favorable to former President Donald J. Trump. Republicans see an opening to deliver Michigan for Mr. Trump in November and to win control of the Michigan House, a goal that could be helped by newly redrawn legislative maps in the Detroit area. All 110 Michigan House seats are up for election in November, including the two seats that were contested on Tuesday.\nBefore losing their House majority last year, Michigan Democrats raced through a list of longstanding policy goals that had been stymied during decades of divided government or Republican control of the state. In the span of several months in 2023, Ms. Whitmer and legislative Democrats enacted new gun laws, codified civil rights for L.G.B.T.Q. people, solidified abortion rights and undid Republican laws that they said weakened labor unions.\nThose efforts slowed in November after one House member, Kevin Coleman, was elected mayor of Westland and another, Lori M. Stone, was elected mayor of Warren. Under Michigan law, Mr. Coleman and Ms. Stone had to resign from the Legislature when they became mayor.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Virginia Sole-Smith, who has spent a decade writing about how women think and feel about their bodies \u2014 and how they pass along those feelings to their children through food \u2014 is about to serve dinner to her daughters, Violet, 10, and Beatrix, 6.\nSole-Smith tries not to be a short-order cook. 'Respect the labor,' is how she puts it, reminding her children that if they don't like what she has prepared, there's other stuff to eat in the house. A pullout shelf in the pantry holds Tate's chocolate chip cookies, Goldfish crackers, pea snaps, and chocolate kisses. There are raspberries and grape tomatoes in the fridge.\nWhat Sole-Smith hopes to model, she said in a five-hour interview at her home in Cold Spring, N.Y., is 'that you can be a mom who doesn't live solely in service of other people.' That 'you deserve time to yourself and that you're a person with needs, that those needs matter.'\nShe ferries the girls' plastic plates to the front-porch table, evading the miniature Bernedoodle, Penelope. A year ago, Sole-Smith published 'Fat Talk: Parenting in the Age of Diet Culture,' a guide to helping parents grapple with their discomfort and anxiety about weight and food. At the moment when Ozempic-like drugs are enabling people to become thin, Sole-Smith has become one of the country's most visible fat activists, calling out the bias and discrimination faced by people in bigger bodies, especially from doctors and research scientists.\nShe asserts her own right to be 'fat,' the preferred adjective in her corner of the internet. In Sole-Smith's house there are neither 'good' or 'bad' foods nor 'healthy' or 'unhealthy' ones; doughnuts and kale hold equivalent moral value and no one polices portion size. By relieving herself and her family of rules about eating, Sole-Smith believes she will have a better chance of raising children who are proud of their bodies, trust themselves to enjoy their food and leave the table when they're full. She serves dessert and snacks, like Cheez-Its, along with the dinner entree; her kids can eat their meal in any order.\n'Fat Talk' is, in a way, Sole-Smith's manifesto of liberation from what nutritionists call 'diet culture': the enormous pressure American women, in particular, feel to be thin and to raise thin children. For many years, she covered health (including for The New York Times), and her reporting on the pursuit of thinness prompted her rejection of it.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Kennedy Jr.'s independent bid, and its desire to discredit him.","summary":"The elaborate rollout of a Kennedy family endorsement of President Biden on Thursday \u2014 talk-show interviews, a campaign event with the president, door-knocking by Kennedys across Philadelphia \u2014 was the most powerful sign yet of rising concern in the Biden camp that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s independent White House bid presents a serious threat to the president's re-election prospects.\nMembers of this prominent Democratic family, including most of Mr. Kennedy's siblings, had already signaled their support for Mr. Biden's re-election. Mr. Kennedy's estrangement from much of his family had grown increasingly apparent over the years, as he became a leading spokesman against Covid vaccines and promoted conspiratorial theories about the 1968 assassination of his father, Robert F. Kennedy.\nBut this was the first time Mr. Biden's campaign had been so aggressively involved in promoting the Kennedys' strong support for the president, making an open push to discredit any enduring Democratic credentials Robert F. Kennedy Jr. carries because of his family name.\nAfter leaving the work to outside liberal groups, the Biden campaign has now joined the effort to define Mr. Kennedy beyond the gauzy memory of his father and two uncles, who for many members of Mr. Biden's fraying coalition, including Black voters, Latinos and blue-collar workers, continue to symbolize Democratic politics in America.\nDemocratic worries about Mr. Kennedy have grown as he has turned up his attacks on the preisdent and worked to win ballot lines in critical battleground states. Michigan election officials announced on Thursday that he had secured a spot as a member of a little-known third party.\n'I can only imagine how Donald Trump's outrageous lies and behavior would horrify my father, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who proudly served as attorney general of the United States, and honored his pledge to uphold the law and protect the country,' Kerry Kennedy, one of the independent presidential candidate's siblings, said as she stood next to Mr. Biden, addressing about 150 people at a recreation center gym in Philadelphia. 'Daddy stood for equal justice, for human rights and freedom from want and fear. Just as President Biden does today.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

'The building represents over 400 years of Danish history. It's one of the last structures in the world in Dutch Renaissance style, where trade has been conducted throughout the entire period.'\nThe police in Copenhagen said on social media that they had evacuated several surrounding buildings, and urged people to avoid the area.\nThe old stock exchange building, a 17th-century structure that was once the financial center of Denmark, also housed several historical paintings and other artifacts. City officials rushed the valued pieces out of the building after the fire broke out.\nOne of the larger works carried to safety was Peder Severin Kroyer's 'From Copenhagen Stock Exchange,' according to a local news outlet. The work, which was painted in 1895 and depicts several key Danish financial figures, is more than 13 feet long. It took six people to remove it to safety.\nMr. Engel-Schmidt said the old stock exchange's artworks 'tell us something about ourselves as a nation and as a people.' He added that the building had been the backdrop of countless historical events, and that it was ingrained in the Danish psyche.\n'That's why there are people standing in the streets, looking incredibly sad,' he said. 'It affects me, too.'\nSeveral works of art were carried from the burning building. Credit...

'Probably the most iconic building in Copenhagen,' he said on social media. 'All forces must be united to have this old, beautiful house rebuilt in all its power and splendor.'\nThe building was constructed at the direction of King Christian IV, who had recognized the importance of trade and commerce, according to the Visit Copenhagen tourism website. The original structure contained at least 40 market stalls and was surrounded by water on three sides to help ships easily unload their cargo.\nAs fire crews fought the flames on Tuesday, dozens of onlookers quietly stood on the street, watching in shock, including Celeste Bolvinkil Andersen, who said she had woken up when she heard her roommate shouting about the fire.\n'It feels a bit like becoming a firsthand witness to history,' she said.

Le Guin hymned the bag as the proper shape for stories: it 'is full of beginnings without ends, of initiations, of losses, of transformations and translations, and far more tricks than conflicts.'\nOne of the characters in Lia Romeo's 'Still,' a writer, carries just such a bag \u2014 a possible wink to her fellow novelist. The tote is large enough to house a ukulele, an avocado and a package of macadamia nuts \u2014 all of which are divulged in the play's single moment of spontaneity \u2014 but its owner can't seem to effect any Le Guinian 'transformations' or 'tricks.' There is a sense of stasis to the aptly named two-hander, which never ripens from a situation into a story.\n'Still,' a Colt Coeur production that opened recently at DR2 Theater in the East Village, begins with two characters, former flames, meeting in a bar. Mark (a suave Tim Daly) and Helen (Jayne Atkinson) are in their mid-60s and haven't seen each other in years. Sharing a bottle of wine, they shoot the breeze about their children and recent divorce (him) and new book and cancer diagnosis (her).\nAt first, they are content to pretend their past romance has subsided into a platonic relationship, but as the alcohol goes to their heads, they admit to carrying a torch for each other. A highlight of the show is their seduction scene: It's the first I've seen onstage that unabashedly invokes the corporeal indignities of aging. The director Adrienne Campbell-Holt has Mark and Helen walk slowly toward each other while making sotto voce confessions: 'I'm missing the nail on my right big toe,' 'I have three fake teeth,' 'I have arthritis in my knees.' Do I need to spell out what happens next?\nAlexander Woodward's softly lit set spins to reveal a hotel room. Resting against each other in bed, Mark and Helen proceed, post-coitally this time, with their confessions. Mark, who lives in Colorado, is considering relocating to Washington, D.C., to run for Congress, as a 'moderate' Republican. 'I wish you'd told me that before we \u2014\u2014' Helen says, gesturing limply to the bed with rumpled sheets. She considers herself a liberal, but political differences aren't the only thing on her mind.\nPart of the reason their relationship ended was because she had an abortion. Despite what Mark told her decades ago, he wanted Helen to have the baby. She, on the other hand, had felt \u2014 and still feels \u2014 that it would have been a mistake. 'When we walked out of that clinic, I was \u2014 scraped out, and I was sad. But I felt so light, knowing that \u2026 all my cells were my own again,' she tells him. The stage is thus set for a real conflict.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

I was in my 50s, with two jobs, two teenage daughters, one dog. I didn't consider dating. I had no time, no emotional energy. But then a year passed. One daughter was off at college, the other increasingly independent. After several more months went by, I started to feel a sliver of curiosity about what kind of men were out there and how it would feel to date again. The last time I dated was 25 years ago, and even then, I fell into relationships mostly with guys from high school, college, parties, work. Now every man I knew was either married, too young, too old or otherwise not a good fit.\nOpen this article in the New York Times Audio app on iOS.\nOpen this article in the New York Times Audio app on iOS. That meant online dating \u2014 the default mode not just for the young but also for people my age. My only exposure had been watching my oldest daughter, home from college one summer as she sat on her bed rapidly swiping through guy after guy \u2014 spending no more than a second or two on each. 'Wait,' I kept saying. 'Slow down. How do you know? What's wrong with him? Or him?'\nSoon enough, I signed onto Match, and then the dating apps Bumble and Hinge. And over the past 18 months, I've felt waves of excitement, hope, frustration, boredom, discouragement. I've gone on great and not-so-great dates, had relationships and ended them, paused and restarted apps, over and over again.\nOnline dating is a mixed bag for most people \u2014 queer, hetero, nonbinary. Plenty of them do find love, including on their very first match. But many of us have to swim through a dispiriting sea of hundreds of people, most of whom we are unlikely to ever want to date. That includes profiles that are fake, created by scammers to try to lure private information from users. And while most profiles are real, sometimes their photos are not so much: More than one person told me that photos can be so outdated or filtered that they barely recognized their date when they met. And the writing is often littered with clich\u00e9s. 'Looking for a partner in crime.' 'I will make you laugh.' 'I live life to the fullest.' Then there's the irritating experience of seeing the people you already declined pop up again and again and again.\nAs tough as the process can be, older women have it worse than most. They report more negative online-dating experiences compared with men of all ages and younger women, according to a Pew Center for Research study. That may in part be because of their dearth of choices.

The case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces. The issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years. The dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. A group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter. City officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond. Here's what else to know: The case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution. 'The city of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town,' the lawsuit said. 'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness \u2014 policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances \u2014 the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks. April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET The argument is scheduled for 65 minutes. But it will probably last more than twice that long. April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET The stakes are high. In San Francisco, which is embroiled in a lawsuit over encampments, city officials have complained for months that a sweeping injunction based on the Grants Pass decision and other Ninth Circuit rulings has complicated law enforcement around downtown tent camps. Over the weekend, I asked Senator Scott Wiener, a Democratic legislator who represents San Francisco, what he was hoping for from the Supreme Court. 'Certainty,' he told me, 'because things have been chaotic here.'  April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET In briefs on the case, California leaders have tried to take a nuanced position, arguing, in essence, that they don't want to criminalize homelessness but need more flexibility to clear the most dangerous encampments and compel people to take shelter when it is offered. This tricky balance was reflected in Gov. Gavin Newsom's brief 'in support of neither party.' April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET Outside the Supreme Court building this morning, activists hoping to protect the rights of homeless people have gathered with signs that call for 'Housing Not Handcuffs.'

Mark Abramson for The New York Times Tent encampments lining public parks and city sidewalks. Piles of garbage, human waste and used needles. According to leaders across the political spectrum who have asked the Supreme Court to address homelessness, those are the consequences of a sharp increase in homelessness that have forced many cities to 'a breaking point.' Although the case before the court on Monday centers on the narrow issue of whether the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment shields homeless people with no options for shelter from fines, fees and jail time, officials and advocates across the country are watching the case closely for its potential to reshape homelessness policy. The case underscores deep divisions over how best to address homelessness and how much leeway to give to local and state officials to help solve the problem. Theane Evangelis, a lawyer for the city of Grants Pass, Ore., who also represented the city of Boise, Idaho, in a similar case in 2018, warned that 'the stakes could not be higher for every city in the country.' If the Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling on behalf of the homeless plaintiffs, she added, cities everywhere 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.' Those who side with the homeless plaintiffs counter that the issue before the court is a focused one, on how to interpret the Constitution. The cities' willingness to embrace solutions like more affordable housing will determine whether the homelessness crisis will begin to abate, they say. 'The first thing for folks who aren't in this field \u2014 or understanding the nuances of this case \u2014 to understand is that nobody wants a country where people are forced to sleep outside,' said Ann Oliva, chief executive of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, an advocacy group founded in the 1980s with bipartisan roots. In briefs, supporters of Grants Pass have contended that local and state policymakers, not judges, are best placed to devise homelessness policies. The cases from Grants Pass and Boise had allowed 'federal judges to serve as the nation's \u2018homelessness policy czars,'' wrote the Cicero Institute, a Texas policy group critical of longstanding federal policy that channels funds to programs to provide the homeless with permanent housing without requiring people to undergo mental health or drug treatment. Lawyers for the National Alliance to End Homelessness say that imposing penalties, rather than providing housing and services, ignores the roots of the issue. In its brief to the court, the group said that the city of Grants Pass and its defenders, 'rather than working to end it,' sought 'to banish homeless people out of sight and out of mind.' 'The threat of criminal penalties does not reduce homelessness,' the brief argued. 'At most, it drives unsheltered homeless people into hiding, leading to greater health and safety concerns for localities. Criminal punishment for peaceably sleeping outside as an unsheltered homeless person is not only cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but unnecessary, expensive and counterproductive.'  April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET It is early in California, but today's arguments are being closely watched here. California has about 12 percent of the nation's population, but roughly a third of the nation's homeless people. A lot of factors play into that, including the sunny weather to a crippling housing shortage. But rulings by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit constraining tent camp enforcement have made California's homelessness crisis particularly wrenching and visible. April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET This is the start of a big week at the court, featuring the final arguments of the term. In addition to the homelessness case today, the justices will hear an abortion case on Wednesday and a case on Trump's claim that he is immune from prosecution on Thursday. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has said that he opposes criminalizing homelessness but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass have impeded the ability of the local authorities to move people into shelters and temporary housing. Credit... Jeff Chiu/Associated Press The Goldwater Institute and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ordinarily have little in common. One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states. But for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West. On Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis \u2014 the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing. The conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them. Advocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless. In the nine Western states in the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, however, officials have increasingly begged the court to explicitly define the point at which a community can reclaim its shared spaces without triggering lawsuits. Some echo conservative appointees on the Ninth Circuit like Judge Daniel Bress, who issued a scathing response last year after the liberal majority voted not to give the Grants Pass case a rehearing before the full appeals court. (The three-judge had panel found that penalties for bunking outdoors violated the Constitution if the local population of homeless people exceeded the city's shelter capacity.) The Ninth Circuit, he wrote, need only look to its doorstep to see the fruit of its decision \u2014 a dystopia of 'homelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics dealing, severe mental health impairment' and post-Covid 'hollowing out.' In Phoenix, where a massive encampment near the Arizona State Capitol consumed millions of state dollars and years of litigation, Timothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs of the Goldwater Institute, noted that both sides had asked the court for clarification. 'It just shows,' he said, 'that across the board, the Ninth Circuit ruling that you have a constitutional right to sleep in a public park is unworkable and has got to be reversed.' In California, where more than 180,000 people are homeless, Mr. Newsom wrote in his brief to the court that he opposes criminalizing homelessness, but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass 'have impeded not only the ability to enforce basic health and safety measures, but also the ability to move people into available shelter beds and temporary housing.' Since his election in 2018, California has pumped more than $20 billion into programs to address homelessness, including specialized housing, a new court-based approach for dealing with addiction and mental illness and a $6.38 billion bond. At a news conference last week, he recalled pitching in to dismantle one tent camp in Oakland that 'felt like a scene out of a \u2018Raiders of the Lost Ark' where, you know, thousands and thousands of rats appeared running all around us.' 'This is to me just about common sense, not about ideology,' the governor said.  'Suddenly, I found myself homeless,' Laura Gutowski said. 'I never expected it to come to this.' Credit... Mason Trinca for The New York Times Inside a warming shelter, Laura Gutowski detailed how her life had changed since she became homeless two and a half years ago in Grants Pass, a former timber hub in the foothills of southern Oregon. Her husband's death left her without steady income. She lived in a sedan, and then in a tent, in sight of the elementary school where her son was once a student. She constantly scrambled to move her belongings to avoid racking up more fines from the police. 'I never expected it to come to this,' said Ms. Gutowski, 55. She is one of several hundred homeless people in this city of about 40,000 that is at the center of a major case before the Supreme Court on Monday with broad ramifications for the nationwide struggle with homelessness. After Grants Pass stepped up enforcement of local ordinances that banned sleeping and camping in public spaces by ticketing, fining and jailing homeless people, lower courts ruled that it amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishment' by penalizing people who had nowhere else to go. Many states and cities that are increasingly overwhelmed by homelessness are hoping the Supreme Court overturns that decision \u2014 or severely limits it. They argue that it has crippled their efforts to address sprawling encampments, rampant public drug use and fearful constituents who say they cannot safely use public spaces. That prospect has alarmed homeless people and their advocates, who contend that a ruling against them would lead cities to fall back on jails, instead of solutions like affordable housing and social services. The case highlights the fierce divide over the thorny issue of how to regulate homelessness. Theane Evangelis, a lawyer representing Grants Pass, said the Supreme Court's decision would reverberate widely. If it does not overturn the lower-court decision, she said, cities around the United States 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.' Ed Johnson, a lawyer for the Oregon Law Center, a nonprofit legal aid group, who represents the homeless residents, said a ruling against them would strip them of their few protections. 'Can a city make it illegal on every inch of city land, every minute of the day, for people to live outside when they have nowhere else to go?' he said. Homelessness across the country climbed to the highest total on record last year, increasing by 12 percent to more than 650,000 people, according to a count by the federal government. Lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Credit... Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times At the core of the Supreme Court battle over a small Oregon town's treatment of its homeless people is a narrow question: Does the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual treatment apply to a city's efforts to crack down on public sleeping and camping? The Eighth Amendment is most commonly applied to punishments, not to laws themselves, and it is often the focus of litigation around the death penalty, solitary confinement and life without the possibility of parole. But in the case on Monday, lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Because the town, Grants Pass, has no homeless shelter, unaffiliated with any religious group, that is open to everyone, they argue, all homeless people there are involuntarily homeless and cannot be punished for having nowhere to go. To make that argument, the homeless plaintiffs have looked to rulings that apply the amendment beyond punishments themselves and to the concept that a person cannot be penalized for their state of being. In one landmark 1962 decision, Robinson v. California, the court found that a person could not be punished for being addicted to drugs, paving the way for subsequent applications. Because those rulings found that the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishing people for having 'an involuntary status,' the homeless plaintiffs say that it would also be relevant to their situation. They add that they are being disciplined for circumstances outside their control, in this instance 'universal biological necessities like sleeping and using a blanket to survive cold temperatures when they have no choice but to be outside.' The city argues that this is an inappropriate use of the Eighth Amendment and a fundamental misunderstanding of its purpose. Two legal experts, in filing a friend-of-the-court brief siding with Grants Pass, argued that the Constitution did bar criminalizing someone's state of being, rather than their specific conduct. But that prohibition, the law professors \u2014 Peter W. Low of the University of Virginia and Joel S. Johnson of Pepperdine \u2014 added, had a 'shaky Eighth Amendment footing.'  \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis.\nThe case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces.\nThe issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years.\nThe dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces.

The case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces. The issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years. The dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. A group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter. City officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond. Here's what else to know: The case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution. 'The city of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town,' the lawsuit said. 'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness \u2014 policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances \u2014 the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks.

The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\nA group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter.\nCity officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond.\nHere's what else to know:\nThe case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution. 'The city of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town,' the lawsuit said. 'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness \u2014 policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances \u2014 the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks.\nApril 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET The argument is scheduled for 65 minutes. But it will probably last more than twice that long.\nApril 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET The stakes are high. In San Francisco, which is embroiled in a lawsuit over encampments, city officials have complained for months that a sweeping injunction based on the Grants Pass decision and other Ninth Circuit rulings has complicated law enforcement around downtown tent camps. Over the weekend, I asked Senator Scott Wiener, a Democratic legislator who represents San Francisco, what he was hoping for from the Supreme Court. 'Certainty,' he told me, 'because things have been chaotic here.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET In briefs on the case, California leaders have tried to take a nuanced position, arguing, in essence, that they don't want to criminalize homelessness but need more flexibility to clear the most dangerous encampments and compel people to take shelter when it is offered. This tricky balance was reflected in Gov. Gavin Newsom's brief 'in support of neither party.'\nApril 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET Outside the Supreme Court building this morning, activists hoping to protect the rights of homeless people have gathered with signs that call for 'Housing Not Handcuffs.'

Mark Abramson for The New York Times Tent encampments lining public parks and city sidewalks. Piles of garbage, human waste and used needles. According to leaders across the political spectrum who have asked the Supreme Court to address homelessness, those are the consequences of a sharp increase in homelessness that have forced many cities to 'a breaking point.'\nAlthough the case before the court on Monday centers on the narrow issue of whether the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment shields homeless people with no options for shelter from fines, fees and jail time, officials and advocates across the country are watching the case closely for its potential to reshape homelessness policy.\nThe case underscores deep divisions over how best to address homelessness and how much leeway to give to local and state officials to help solve the problem.\nTheane Evangelis, a lawyer for the city of Grants Pass, Ore., who also represented the city of Boise, Idaho, in a similar case in 2018, warned that 'the stakes could not be higher for every city in the country.'\nIf the Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling on behalf of the homeless plaintiffs, she added, cities everywhere 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.'\nThose who side with the homeless plaintiffs counter that the issue before the court is a focused one, on how to interpret the Constitution. The cities' willingness to embrace solutions like more affordable housing will determine whether the homelessness crisis will begin to abate, they say.\n'The first thing for folks who aren't in this field \u2014 or understanding the nuances of this case \u2014 to understand is that nobody wants a country where people are forced to sleep outside,' said Ann Oliva, chief executive of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, an advocacy group founded in the 1980s with bipartisan roots.\nIn briefs, supporters of Grants Pass have contended that local and state policymakers, not judges, are best placed to devise homelessness policies.\nThe cases from Grants Pass and Boise had allowed 'federal judges to serve as the nation's \u2018homelessness policy czars,'' wrote the Cicero Institute, a Texas policy group critical of longstanding federal policy that channels funds to programs to provide the homeless with permanent housing without requiring people to undergo mental health or drug treatment.\nLawyers for the National Alliance to End Homelessness say that imposing penalties, rather than providing housing and services, ignores the roots of the issue.\nIn its brief to the court, the group said that the city of Grants Pass and its defenders, 'rather than working to end it,' sought 'to banish homeless people out of sight and out of mind.'\n'The threat of criminal penalties does not reduce homelessness,' the brief argued. 'At most, it drives unsheltered homeless people into hiding, leading to greater health and safety concerns for localities. Criminal punishment for peaceably sleeping outside as an unsheltered homeless person is not only cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but unnecessary, expensive and counterproductive.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET It is early in California, but today's arguments are being closely watched here. California has about 12 percent of the nation's population, but roughly a third of the nation's homeless people. A lot of factors play into that, including the sunny weather to a crippling housing shortage. But rulings by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit constraining tent camp enforcement have made California's homelessness crisis particularly wrenching and visible.\nApril 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET This is the start of a big week at the court, featuring the final arguments of the term. In addition to the homelessness case today, the justices will hear an abortion case on Wednesday and a case on Trump's claim that he is immune from prosecution on Thursday.\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California has said that he opposes criminalizing homelessness but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass have impeded the ability of the local authorities to move people into shelters and temporary housing. Credit... Jeff Chiu/Associated Press The Goldwater Institute and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ordinarily have little in common. One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states.\nBut for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West.\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks.\nThe City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis \u2014 the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing.\nThe conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them.\nAdvocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless.\nIn the nine Western states in the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, however, officials have increasingly begged the court to explicitly define the point at which a community can reclaim its shared spaces without triggering lawsuits. Some echo conservative appointees on the Ninth Circuit like Judge Daniel Bress, who issued a scathing response last year after the liberal majority voted not to give the Grants Pass case a rehearing before the full appeals court. (The three-judge had panel found that penalties for bunking outdoors violated the Constitution if the local population of homeless people exceeded the city's shelter capacity.)\nThe Ninth Circuit, he wrote, need only look to its doorstep to see the fruit of its decision \u2014 a dystopia of 'homelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics dealing, severe mental health impairment' and post-Covid 'hollowing out.'\nIn Phoenix, where a massive encampment near the Arizona State Capitol consumed millions of state dollars and years of litigation, Timothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs of the Goldwater Institute, noted that both sides had asked the court for clarification.\n'It just shows,' he said, 'that across the board, the Ninth Circuit ruling that you have a constitutional right to sleep in a public park is unworkable and has got to be reversed.'\nIn California, where more than 180,000 people are homeless, Mr. Newsom wrote in his brief to the court that he opposes criminalizing homelessness, but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass 'have impeded not only the ability to enforce basic health and safety measures, but also the ability to move people into available shelter beds and temporary housing.' Since his election in 2018, California has pumped more than $20 billion into programs to address homelessness, including specialized housing, a new court-based approach for dealing with addiction and mental illness and a $6.38 billion bond.\nAt a news conference last week, he recalled pitching in to dismantle one tent camp in Oakland that 'felt like a scene out of a \u2018Raiders of the Lost Ark' where, you know, thousands and thousands of rats appeared running all around us.'\n'This is to me just about common sense, not about ideology,' the governor said.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT 'Suddenly, I found myself homeless,' Laura Gutowski said. 'I never expected it to come to this.' Credit... Mason Trinca for The New York Times Inside a warming shelter, Laura Gutowski detailed how her life had changed since she became homeless two and a half years ago in Grants Pass, a former timber hub in the foothills of southern Oregon.\nHer husband's death left her without steady income. She lived in a sedan, and then in a tent, in sight of the elementary school where her son was once a student. She constantly scrambled to move her belongings to avoid racking up more fines from the police.\n'I never expected it to come to this,' said Ms. Gutowski, 55. She is one of several hundred homeless people in this city of about 40,000 that is at the center of a major case before the Supreme Court on Monday with broad ramifications for the nationwide struggle with homelessness.\nAfter Grants Pass stepped up enforcement of local ordinances that banned sleeping and camping in public spaces by ticketing, fining and jailing homeless people, lower courts ruled that it amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishment' by penalizing people who had nowhere else to go.\nMany states and cities that are increasingly overwhelmed by homelessness are hoping the Supreme Court overturns that decision \u2014 or severely limits it. They argue that it has crippled their efforts to address sprawling encampments, rampant public drug use and fearful constituents who say they cannot safely use public spaces.\nThat prospect has alarmed homeless people and their advocates, who contend that a ruling against them would lead cities to fall back on jails, instead of solutions like affordable housing and social services.\nThe case highlights the fierce divide over the thorny issue of how to regulate homelessness.\nTheane Evangelis, a lawyer representing Grants Pass, said the Supreme Court's decision would reverberate widely. If it does not overturn the lower-court decision, she said, cities around the United States 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.'\nEd Johnson, a lawyer for the Oregon Law Center, a nonprofit legal aid group, who represents the homeless residents, said a ruling against them would strip them of their few protections. 'Can a city make it illegal on every inch of city land, every minute of the day, for people to live outside when they have nowhere else to go?' he said.\nHomelessness across the country climbed to the highest total on record last year, increasing by 12 percent to more than 650,000 people, according to a count by the federal government.\nLawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Credit... Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times At the core of the Supreme Court battle over a small Oregon town's treatment of its homeless people is a narrow question: Does the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual treatment apply to a city's efforts to crack down on public sleeping and camping?\nThe Eighth Amendment is most commonly applied to punishments, not to laws themselves, and it is often the focus of litigation around the death penalty, solitary confinement and life without the possibility of parole.\nBut in the case on Monday, lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Because the town, Grants Pass, has no homeless shelter, unaffiliated with any religious group, that is open to everyone, they argue, all homeless people there are involuntarily homeless and cannot be punished for having nowhere to go.\nTo make that argument, the homeless plaintiffs have looked to rulings that apply the amendment beyond punishments themselves and to the concept that a person cannot be penalized for their state of being.\nIn one landmark 1962 decision, Robinson v. California, the court found that a person could not be punished for being addicted to drugs, paving the way for subsequent applications. Because those rulings found that the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishing people for having 'an involuntary status,' the homeless plaintiffs say that it would also be relevant to their situation. They add that they are being disciplined for circumstances outside their control, in this instance 'universal biological necessities like sleeping and using a blanket to survive cold temperatures when they have no choice but to be outside.'\nThe city argues that this is an inappropriate use of the Eighth Amendment and a fundamental misunderstanding of its purpose.\nTwo legal experts, in filing a friend-of-the-court brief siding with Grants Pass, argued that the Constitution did bar criminalizing someone's state of being, rather than their specific conduct. But that prohibition, the law professors \u2014 Peter W. Low of the University of Virginia and Joel S. Johnson of Pepperdine \u2014 added, had a 'shaky Eighth Amendment footing.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Abbie Van Sickle","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/22/multimedia/22scotus-homeless-eighth-amendment-zlvh/22scotus-homeless-eighth-amendment-zlvh-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":3.8805656,"_id":"d6d33c7bd29e6bc36dbee436f978f0b3"},{"title":"Live Updates: Trump's Criminal Trial to Resume With More Jury Selection","author":"Ben Protess","published_date":"2024-04-16 12:37:02","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/16/nyregion/trump-hush-money-trial","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"On the trial's first day, more than half the initial group of prospective jurors was dismissed after they indicated they could not be impartial in the first prosecution of an American president.","summary":"Not since Eugene V. Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning.\nFor now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, beyond having to be present in a courtroom, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But some of the cases are proceeding at a pace that could bring verdicts before the election \u2014 and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that will arise if he is convicted.\nOthers would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges.\nHere is what we know, and what we don't know.\nThis is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes.\nThe Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be 'natural born' citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years.\nThere are no limitations based on character or criminal record. While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices.\nThe Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground.\n'We let states set the time, place and manner' of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, 'but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don't let the state add new substantive requirements.'\nWhile that view is not universal among legal experts, it prevailed in court in 2019, after California passed a law requiring candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the law from taking effect, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' after taking an oath to support the Constitution.\nNumerous lawsuits had argued that Mr. Trump's actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, met this bar. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine's secretary of state did the same. But the Supreme Court \u2014 led by a conservative supermajority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself \u2014 concluded that only Congress had the power to enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. (Four of the justices, including the three liberals, wanted to allow a wider range of options for disqualification.)\nCongress is not going to do that with Republicans in control of the House. And the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal cases, meaning convictions would not disqualify Mr. Trump either.\nCongress can designate either groups of people to whom Section 3 applies (such as people who fought for the Confederacy) or specific crimes that, upon conviction, would trigger disqualification, said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University. But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty.\n'Whether or not Trump is tried, convicted, acquitted, that's a separate question from whether or not he's disqualified,' said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nOne of the charges in the federal case related to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election \u2014 conspiracy to violate civil rights \u2014 once carried a disqualification penalty, Mr. Kreis said, but Congress removed it decades ago.\nNow that Mr. Trump has secured a majority of delegates to the Republican convention, the party has no mechanism to nominate somebody else. Under the party's official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, 'such support shall not be recognized.'\nNor have top Republicans shown any interest in another nominee.\nIf he were forced to withdraw from the race after the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him.\nafter the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him. Probably not.\nMr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony.\nMost felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day.\nHe could also petition for clemency, which would require the approval of the governor \u2014 Ron DeSantis, who ran against Mr. Trump in the Republican primary \u2014 and two Florida cabinet members. Chris Taylor, the director of external affairs for the Florida Commission on Offender Review, confirmed that a Florida resident convicted of a felony could apply to have their voting rights restored through that process even if their conviction happened outside Florida.\nSince Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison.\nSo if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he could be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote.\nNo one knows.\n'We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 'It's just guessing.'\nLegally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. 'I don't think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,' Professor Levinson said.\nIn practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts.\nIn theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself.\nMore likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump's lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch.\nOn the federal charges only, he could also try to pardon himself \u2014 or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a 'self pardon' was constitutional.\nOr President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that 'the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,' Professor Chemerinsky said.\nBut that wouldn't apply to the New York or Georgia cases, because the president does not have pardon power for state charges.\nAgain, no one knows, particularly when it comes to the New York and Georgia cases.\nIn the two federal cases, a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges.\nThe Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents \u2014 that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties \u2014 applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario.\n'The reasons why we wouldn't want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn't want to prosecute a sitting president,' said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department's reasoning. 'My guess is, if the Trump prosecution were still ongoing in some way and Trump were elected, the Justice Department \u2014 which would be the Trump Justice Department \u2014 would say, \u2018We're following the 1973 memo.''\nLike so much else here, this would be legally untested, and it is impossible to say what the Supreme Court would do if the question reached it.\nIn its Clinton v. Jones ruling in 1997, the court allowed a lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed. But that case was civil, not criminal, and it was filed by a private citizen, not by the government itself.\nCharlie Savage contributed reporting.","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ben Protess,Jonah E.

Tens of thousands of people have been killed, and millions more are displaced.\nSource: Special Advisory Council for Myanmar (SAC-M)\nThe fighting, in forests and towns across Myanmar, gets little of the international attention claimed by the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. Yet a decade ago, this nation wedged between India and China was touted as a rare example of a country peacefully transitioning from military dictatorship toward democratic rule. The army putsch ended any illusion of political progress. Myanmar has returned to a military reign of terror and the fractured reality of civil war. The lawlessness that thrives in conflict areas has radiated outward, with transnational crime networks using Myanmar as a base and exporting the products of their illicit activity worldwide.\nSoldiers from 8th Battalion of the Karenni Nationalities Defense Force, an armed insurgent group, during their graduation ceremony in Karenni State in February.\nAdam Ferguson for The New York Times\nThe short answer: The military coup was met by widespread peaceful protests. Then the junta, led by Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, quickly reverted to its old playbook: jail, terrorize, kill.\nPro-democracy forces took up arms, joining with militias that for decades had been fighting for the rights of ethnic minorities.\nThe longer answer: Myanmar has been in turmoil practically since gaining independence from British rule in 1948. Some of the world's longest-running armed conflicts have simmered in the country's borderlands, where ethnic militias are seeking autonomy or simply freedom from the Myanmar military's repression.\nA brief period of political reform, with a civilian government led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate, did not make life much better for many ethnic minorities. After her political party trounced the military-linked party in Myanmar's 2020 elections, a junta grabbed full control of the country again.\nA common goal of overthrowing the junta has led to unity between pro-democracy militias and armed ethnic groups. Together, these resistance forces have claimed significant territory from the Myanmar military. On April 11, they captured a key border town from the junta's forces, their biggest victory yet.\nHundreds of pro-democracy militias, ethnic armies and local defense forces. The sheer diversity of resistance groups battling the junta makes Myanmar the most fractured country on Earth, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, which tracks 50 high-level conflicts worldwide.

Rebels now control much of Myanmar's border region, including a strategic trading town that was captured on April 11. A few days later, they fired rockets at the nation's top military academy. Some of the fighting is taking place within striking distance of Naypyidaw, the bunkered capital that the generals built early this century.\nThis year could be a turning point in Myanmar's war, military analysts say. With each week, the junta's forces abandon more outposts. Myanmar's military is overstretched and underprovisioned. Even at the best of times, its biggest asset has been numbers, not expertise.

Since the rebels' October offensive, there has been a fivefold increase in aerial bombardment, according to Tom Andrews, the United Nations Special Rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar.\nBy the end of last year, more than 2.6 million people had been driven from their homes in a country of about 55 million, according to the United Nations human rights office. Nearly 600,000 of those internally displaced people fled after the fighting intensified in October. More than 18 million people are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations, which says that a million had required such aid before the coup.\nSource: Myanmar Peace Monitor\nNote: Data as of April 2\nUnited Nations investigators say that the junta's forces should be investigated for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and they cite reports of organized sexual violence, village burnings and the indiscriminate use of landmines. Such abuses predate the coup. In 2017, the military conducted what the United States says was a genocidal campaign against the Rohingya Muslim minority.\nMyanmar is an extraordinarily diverse nation whose borders were shaped by British imperialism rather than ethnic boundaries. Officially, 135 ethnic groups live in the country, and practically the only thing they agree on is that this figure is wrong.\nNote: The Karenni are also known as the Kayah, the Karen as the Kayin, the Rakhine as the Arakan, and the Ta'ang as the Palaung.\nSource: General Administration Department, Myanmar\nSome ethnic minorities have more in common with people in China, India and Thailand than with the Bamar, Myanmar's largest ethnicity. Others come from princely states that were not under the full authority of a central administration until the middle of the last century. Still others, such as over a million Rohingya, have been rendered stateless because the military refuses to recognize them as rightful inhabitants of the country.\nWhat Myanmar's ethnic minorities, particularly non-Buddhist ones, share is a long record of persecution by the military.\nMyanmar's ethnic diversity is concentrated in the foothills of the Himalayas and the forested border regions that cradle the delta and lowlands through which the Irrawaddy River flows.\nIt's both.\nIn 1948, the Union of Burma declared independence from British rule. In the Burmese language, the root of the words Burma and Myanmar are the same. In 1989, a year after the violent crushing of a pro-democracy movement, a junta renamed the country internationally as Myanmar, the name by which it is known locally. The generals argued that Myanmar was a more inclusive name, because it was not so explicitly linked to the nation's Bamar ethnic majority.\nNevertheless, the pro-democracy front, led by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, tended to refer to the country as Burma to show opposition to the military regime. Ethnic minority groups often called the country Burma when speaking English. The United States still officially calls the country Burma, but most foreign governments use Myanmar. After the 2021 coup, some exiled politicians and other pro-democracy activists who once called it Myanmar switched to Burma with an international audience.\nMost people, however, still refer to Myanmar.\nThere is no commonly accepted word for the inhabitants of the country. Some refer to the Burmese of Myanmar, which seems a usage at cross-purposes. In Myanmar, the citizens are generally referred to as Myanmar, the word serving as both a nation and a nationality.\nThree years after the coup, the center of Myanmar remains mostly under junta control, but the rest of the country is a kaleidoscopic array of competing influences, fiefs, democratic havens and drug-lord hideouts. Ethnic armed groups govern some areas. Administrators aligned with the National Unity Government have set up schools and clinics in others. No one is in charge in still other parts of the country, leaving residents lacking basic services and vulnerable to life in the margins.\nA soldier from the Pa-O National Liberation Army was treated at a secret hospital in Karenni State in January.\nAdam Ferguson for The New York Times\nThe junta forces' widespread use of landmines has made parts of Myanmar off limits. Within areas under the regime's control, more than 100,000 civil servants refuse to turn up for work as part of a long-running civil disobedience campaign. Many of Myanmar's most educated people are in exile or living in the jungles. Others are in prison.\nThe military is still the country's largest and most influential institution, and a militarized culture pervades many areas that ethnic minorities control. The question is whether the Myanmar military will jettison Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, its supreme commander, if he is judged to be an impediment to the armed forces' survival \u2014 Myanmar's history is filled with military men being pushed aside for other military men. With more and more of its soldiers dying, the military is facing an existential threat.\nIt's possible that a junta, perhaps not even the current one but a new coterie, will try to negotiate cease-fires with the many armed groups arrayed against it. But given the Myanmar military's history of turning its guns against its own people, trust will be difficult to find.\nThe future of Myanmar will likely remain fractured, with no single authority in charge. Such a splintered state is likely to breed more chaos that will not be contained by national borders. Myanmar is again the world's top opium producer, displacing Afghanistan. Some ethnic armed groups survive by churning out methamphetamine and other synthetic drugs. And the country is at the center of a cyber-scam industry that steals billions of dollars from unsuspecting people and kidnaps others to forcibly work the cons.","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Hannah Beech,Weiyi Cai","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/16/multimedia/2024-03-14-myanmar-explained-index/2024-03-14-myanmar-explained-index-facebookJumbo-v4.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@nytimes","_score":3.4195542,"_id":"687de3312a1baac378c6c1cdf73752a4"},{"title":"Kristi Noem refuses to say whether she would have certified the election on Jan. 6.","author":"Maggie Astor","published_date":"2024-04-21 16:07:15","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/21/us/trump-trial-biden-election/kristi-noem-jan6-abortion","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"Skip to contentSkip to site indexUpdates From Our Reporters","summary":"Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index Updates From Our Reporters April 21, 2024, 12:16 p.m. ET April 21, 2024, 12:16 p.m. ET Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, told CBS that President Biden needed to ensure 'that young people feel included in the conversation, not just as a vote but as part of the governing coalition.' He added, 'I think part of the frustration by young people is that they oftentimes don't feel heard. They feel like their voices and their votes are taken advantage of come election time.' He said he thought Biden had taken steps toward including them.

'The way to take out the bully is to bloody their nose,' he said after saying that the days where rank-and-file members were 'kind of easygoing' and 'put their head down' were over. 'The fight is here,' he added. April 21, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET April 21, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a Republican vice-presidential contender who supported federal abortion bans when she was in Congress, told CNN that she didn't anymore because the overturning of Roe v. Wade 'returned the power back to the states.' She then sought to distance herself from her own state's law, which bans abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest, saying it was passed before she became governor. April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET Asked on CNN if Biden should debate Trump, Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Democrat of Illinois, said Biden was 'a terrific debater' but Trump 'lies and lies and lies, and it's so hard to respond to that in the middle of a debate.' He added, 'Do you talk about what you want to do for the future, or do you respond to the lies that have come out of Donald Trump's mouth every minute? So I'm concerned about that, just to be honest with you.' April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a potential vice-presidential pick for Donald Trump, refused to say on CNN whether she would have certified the 2020 election as Mike Pence did on Jan. 6. 'That was the day we hope we never see again,' she said. 'We did not do justice by our country by showing and fighting over that day. We should focus on our freedoms and continue to uphold our Constitution. So talking in hypotheticals is not something that I do.' President Trump's campaign committee ended March with $45 million on hand, up from $33.5 million at the end of February, an improvement as he seeks to close the formidable fund-raising gap with President Biden, whose campaign had $85.5 million.

Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a potential vice-presidential pick for former President Donald J. Trump, refused to say on Sunday whether she would have certified the 2020 election if she had been in Vice President Mike Pence's position. She also dodged questions about whether she supported exceptions to abortion bans for rape and incest. 'You can go back and keep talking about Jan. 6, but the fact of the matter is that was a day we hope we never see again here in this country,' Ms. Noem said on CNN. 'We did not do justice by our country by showing and fighting over that day. We should focus on our freedoms and continue to uphold our Constitution. So talking in hypotheticals is not something that I do.' When the interviewer, Dana Bash, pressed her on whether Mr. Pence had been wrong to certify the election results, Ms. Noem again avoided a direct answer, instead criticizing Mr. Pence for denouncing Mr. Trump after Jan. 6. 'I wasn't in Mike Pence's shoes, and the information that he had at that time \u2014 I don't know how he based his decisions,' she said. 'I think he's a nice man. I think that he's failed Donald Trump since that day, because he certainly does not recognize that we need someone in the White House who needs him out on the trail advocating for him, instead of constantly criticizing and going back and ripping him apart.' On abortion, Ms. Noem, who supported a federal ban when she was a member of Congress, said she now believed restrictions should be left to individual states. That is the position Mr. Trump took this month, though his allies have developed plans that could functionally ban abortion nationwide without formally doing so. Mr. Trump has also expressed support for rape and incest exceptions, which South Dakota's near-total abortion ban does not include. When asked about that, Ms. Noem tried to distance herself from her own state's law, noting that it was a 'trigger ban' enacted years ago to take effect if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 'The law in my state was passed decades before I ever became governor,' she said, adding: 'That may be a topic that will continue to be discussed in South Dakota. Our law today allows an exception to save the life of the mother, but the people in South Dakota will decide what their laws look like.' She did not give a clear answer when Ms. Bash asked what she believed South Dakota's laws should look like. 'I can have an opinion, and I can weigh forward and I can look at the science and what we've learned about babies in the womb and believe that we should protect life, but I think that our law today is what South Dakota wants,' she said. 'And they'll continue to have that debate, and I'll continue to follow through on my role, which is to make sure the will of the people is enforced.' Ms. Bash repeated her question, and Ms. Noem implied \u2014 but did not say outright \u2014 that she might oppose a rape and incest exception. 'We have a law that says that there is an exception for the life of the mother, and I just don't believe a tragedy should perpetuate another tragedy,' she said. Versions of that statement are common among people who believe abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape and incest. 'I believe in taking care of mothers that are in a crisis situation and that we should be locking alongside them, giving them all the information and the best information they can make before they have to be put in a situation where an abortion is the only option that they have,' she added. Ms. Noem also echoed Mr. Trump's claims that the criminal charges against him in New York \u2014 where his trial began last week \u2014 were political, and affirmed that she would support him even if he were convicted of felonies. 'When he was in the White House, every single day as governor, I got to be on offense, I got to solve problems,' she said. 'And since Joe Biden has been in the White House, I just have to defend the freedoms of my people in South Dakota. I'm every day trying to push back on what this federal government is trying to do by increasing costs for the everyday families that get up every day and go to work. So yes, Donald Trump should be back in that White House. I'm going to do all I can to help him win.' Credit... Chris Seward/Associated Press Former President Donald J. Trump's presidential campaign committee ended March with $45 million on hand, federal filings showed Saturday, as he tries to close the fund-raising gap with President Biden. But Mr. Trump's campaign is spending much less than it was at the start of the year, which has helped it inch closer. In March, it spent just $3.7 million, the new filings show, compared with $11.4 million in January \u2014 and much less than the $29.2 million spent by Mr. Biden's campaign in March. In other words, Mr. Trump's campaign is guarding resources as it seeks to build a campaign war chest for the general election. This cycle began with the announcement of former President Donald J. Trump's campaign in November 2022 and President Biden's in April 2023. Raised $43.8 $158.5 $15.3 $114.7 Spent $29.2 $74.3 $4 $70.1 Net cash $85.5 \u2014 $44.6 \u2014 Mr. Biden's campaign had $85.5 million on hand at the end of March, according to its monthly filing with the Federal Election Commission, a significant increase from the month before: He ended February with $71 million in his campaign account while Mr. Trump ended February with less than half that. As Mr. Trump and Republicans chase the Democrats' financial edge, Mr. Biden has also started to narrow the polling gap between himself and Mr. Trump. Since late February, the president has cut a deficit of five percentage points to a single point, a virtual tie, according to a recent survey by The New York Times and Siena College. The rivals each capitalized on splashy fund-raisers in the past month that brought in tens of millions of dollars for their respective campaigns. But Mr. Trump's haul from an April 6 event in Palm Beach, Fla., will be reflected on a future filing. His campaign reported that it and the Republican National Committee raked in more than $50.5 million from the dinner, which was held at the home of the billionaire John Paulson. The total nearly doubled the $26 million that Mr. Biden's campaign said it raised on March 28 at Radio City Music Hall in New York, a star-studded event headlined by the president and two former presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Those funds were included in Mr. Biden's March fund-raising numbers. Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump are primarily raising money though joint fund-raising agreements with their respective parties, arrangements that legally allow them to pull in hundreds of thousands of dollars from individual donors, some of which flows into their campaigns. Joint fund-raising committees for both candidates filed reports with the Federal Election Commission this week, providing the first details of 2024 of major donors to both candidates, and the total scale of their fund-raising haul. But the F.E.C. reports for presidential campaigns, which are filed monthly in election years, offer different insights about candidates' activities and how the committees backing them are spending money. By the end of the 2020 cycle Biden had raised and spent more than $1 billion and Trump more than $700 million dollars. For example, federal law guarantees political campaigns bottom-dollar rates for broadcast advertising, so campaign committees are often used to pay for television time. In the first three months of 2024, Mr. Biden's campaign has spent $45.2 million on media buys and production, filings show \u2014 more than half of its total of $74.1 million in spending. The Biden campaign has spent $6.9 million on payroll and related expenses, and an additional $6.9 million on 'text message outreach.' His campaign's spending shot up in March, after two relatively steady months. In contrast, Mr. Trump's campaign spending has slowed sharply since the beginning of the year, when he was still fending off Republican primary challengers. Since Jan. 1, Mr. Trump's campaign has spent $23 million \u2014 but just $3.7 million of that was in March. His campaign has paid $6 million for placed media this year, all of it before Super Tuesday. One of Mr. Trump's committees \u2014 a leadership PAC called Save America, which he has used to pay his legal bills \u2014 reported on Saturday that it had almost $4.1 million on hand at the end of March, roughly the same amount as it had at the end of February. The group spent $5 million in March, including $3.7 million in bills to the legal teams defending him. Mr. Trump's campaign itself also paid about $473,000 in legal expenses. A super PAC backing Mr. Trump, MAGA Inc., reported raising $14.4 million in March, including a $5 million contribution from the former Trump cabinet official Linda McMahon and $4.2 million from Robert T. Bigelow, an aerospace and real estate mogul. The group also transferred $5 million to Save America \u2014 part of a huge refund of money from the super PAC to the committee over the past year. With national polls consistently suggesting that the rematch between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden could hinge on a few states or a single one, that has magnified the candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running as an independent. It has also drawn attention to how the liberal scion is paying for his campaign and what he is spending money on, including for ballot access and security. His selection of Nicole Shanahan, a wealthy Silicon Valley lawyer and investor, as his running mate already appears to have become a boon for his campaign. Of the $5.4 million that Mr. Kennedy raised in March, $2 million came from Ms. Shanahan, who until last year was married to the Google co-founder Sergey Brin. A correction was made on : An earlier version of this story misstated the total amount MAGA Inc. raised in March. It was $14.4 million, not $9.4 million. The lower figure inaccurately took into account a $5 million transfer from the group to another Trump committee. How we handle corrections Credit... Travis Dove for The New York Times After former President Donald J. Trump sat in a courtroom in New York for much of the last week, Saturday night was supposed to herald a return to the campaign trail and the large rallies where he often gives long, freewheeling speeches. With thousands gathered on the tarmac at an airport in Wilmington, N.C., Mr. Trump's campaign was building anticipation. Two hours before he was set to speak, the campaign sent a fund-raising blast with a message from Mr. Trump: 'They can't keep me off stage! Did they think I would run and hide?' Ninety minutes later, the skies darkened to charcoal and lightning flashed. As thunderstorms swept toward the area and the National Weather Service issued watches and warnings concerning dangerous winds and hail, the rally was canceled over safety concerns. 'We'll make up for this very quickly at another time,' Mr. Trump said on a call he made into the rally that was broadcast over the speakers. 'We'll do it as quick as possible. I'm devastated that this could happen.' But the cancellation, which Mr. Trump indicated was out of his hands, highlights the challenges that he may face as he tries to balance his presidential campaign with a criminal trial that will keep him busy through May. For much of the last week, Mr. Trump's public comments had been limited to social media posts and remarks to reporters outside the courtroom. His only campaign stop was at a bodega in New York City, in a state he overwhelmingly lost in the last two elections and that is not expected to be in play in November. Saturday's rally was expected to serve as a preview of the upcoming weeks, with Mr. Trump traveling on weekends to campaign in battleground states that are more central to his efforts to return to the White House. He has repeatedly claimed that the trial is preventing him from campaigning in places like North Carolina, which he won in 2016 and 2020, but where Democrats are making a big push in November. Opening arguments are slated to start on Monday, and the trial is set to last six to eight weeks. As is often the case with Mr. Trump's rallies, the crowds began lining up hours ahead of his expected remarks. Among those gathered outside was a group wearing shirts with the logo of the Proud Boys, a prominent far-right extremist group. One person held a sign that read 'Free All of the J6 Prisoners,' a reference to those serving sentences in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Mr. Trump, who faces four criminal indictments that include charges tied to his efforts to overturn his election loss, has recently embraced dozens of Jan. 6 defendants. He has called them 'hostages' and has said he would consider pardoning them. In a statement, Ammar Moussa, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, criticized the group's presence, pointing to remarks Mr. Trump made in a debate in 2020, in which he told the Proud Boys to 'stand back and stand by.' 'This is Donald Trump's America: where white nationalists and violent far-right extremists are empowered and working families are left behind,' Mr. Moussa wrote. Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, responded in a statement, 'We don't comment on stupid.' Mr. Trump's remarks were expected to face particular scrutiny given that he is under a gag order in his criminal trial that bans him from attacking witnesses, prosecutors, jurors and court staff, as well as their relatives and relatives of the judge. Prosecutors have said Mr. Trump has violated the gag order seven times, and there is a hearing about the issue on Tuesday. Mr. Trump did travel to North Carolina earlier in the day, attending a fund-raiser in Charlotte in the afternoon. When he called into the rally, he told the attendees that he was minutes away from 'flying in' to Wilmington but that the authorities 'would prefer that we not come in' over safety concerns. 'I'm so sorry,' Mr. Trump said. 'But we'll do it again, and we'll do it bigger and better. You have my promise.' As the crowd left to seek shelter in their cars, vendors outside were still selling an array of merchandise, some of which had been created specifically for the occasion. One T-shirt promoted what it called the Wilmington stop on Mr. Trump's 'Save America' tour. 'I was there!' The shirt read. 'Where were you???'

Trump's campaign in November 2022 and President Biden's in April 2023.\nRaised $43.8 $158.5 $15.3 $114.7 Spent $29.2 $74.3 $4 $70.1 Net cash $85.5 \u2014 $44.6 \u2014 Mr. Biden's campaign had $85.5 million on hand at the end of March, according to its monthly filing with the Federal Election Commission, a significant increase from the month before: He ended February with $71 million in his campaign account while Mr. Trump ended February with less than half that.\nAs Mr. Trump and Republicans chase the Democrats' financial edge, Mr. Biden has also started to narrow the polling gap between himself and Mr. Trump. Since late February, the president has cut a deficit of five percentage points to a single point, a virtual tie, according to a recent survey by The New York Times and Siena College.\nThe rivals each capitalized on splashy fund-raisers in the past month that brought in tens of millions of dollars for their respective campaigns. But Mr. Trump's haul from an April 6 event in Palm Beach, Fla., will be reflected on a future filing. His campaign reported that it and the Republican National Committee raked in more than $50.5 million from the dinner, which was held at the home of the billionaire John Paulson.\nThe total nearly doubled the $26 million that Mr. Biden's campaign said it raised on March 28 at Radio City Music Hall in New York, a star-studded event headlined by the president and two former presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Those funds were included in Mr. Biden's March fund-raising numbers.\nMr. Biden and Mr. Trump are primarily raising money though joint fund-raising agreements with their respective parties, arrangements that legally allow them to pull in hundreds of thousands of dollars from individual donors, some of which flows into their campaigns.\nJoint fund-raising committees for both candidates filed reports with the Federal Election Commission this week, providing the first details of 2024 of major donors to both candidates, and the total scale of their fund-raising haul.\nBut the F.E.C. reports for presidential campaigns, which are filed monthly in election years, offer different insights about candidates' activities and how the committees backing them are spending money.\nBy the end of the 2020 cycle Biden had raised and spent more than $1 billion and Trump more than $700 million dollars.\nFor example, federal law guarantees political campaigns bottom-dollar rates for broadcast advertising, so campaign committees are often used to pay for television time. In the first three months of 2024, Mr. Biden's campaign has spent $45.2 million on media buys and production, filings show \u2014 more than half of its total of $74.1 million in spending.\nThe Biden campaign has spent $6.9 million on payroll and related expenses, and an additional $6.9 million on 'text message outreach.' His campaign's spending shot up in March, after two relatively steady months.\nIn contrast, Mr. Trump's campaign spending has slowed sharply since the beginning of the year, when he was still fending off Republican primary challengers.\nSince Jan. 1, Mr. Trump's campaign has spent $23 million \u2014 but just $3.7 million of that was in March. His campaign has paid $6 million for placed media this year, all of it before Super Tuesday.\nOne of Mr. Trump's committees \u2014 a leadership PAC called Save America, which he has used to pay his legal bills \u2014 reported on Saturday that it had almost $4.1 million on hand at the end of March, roughly the same amount as it had at the end of February.\nThe group spent $5 million in March, including $3.7 million in bills to the legal teams defending him. Mr. Trump's campaign itself also paid about $473,000 in legal expenses.\nA super PAC backing Mr. Trump, MAGA Inc., reported raising $14.4 million in March, including a $5 million contribution from the former Trump cabinet official Linda McMahon and $4.2 million from Robert T. Bigelow, an aerospace and real estate mogul. The group also transferred $5 million to Save America \u2014 part of a huge refund of money from the super PAC to the committee over the past year.\nWith national polls consistently suggesting that the rematch between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden could hinge on a few states or a single one, that has magnified the candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running as an independent.\nIt has also drawn attention to how the liberal scion is paying for his campaign and what he is spending money on, including for ballot access and security.\nHis selection of Nicole Shanahan, a wealthy Silicon Valley lawyer and investor, as his running mate already appears to have become a boon for his campaign. Of the $5.4 million that Mr. Kennedy raised in March, $2 million came from Ms. Shanahan, who until last year was married to the Google co-founder Sergey Brin.\nA correction was made on : An earlier version of this story misstated the total amount MAGA Inc. raised in March. It was $14.4 million, not $9.4 million. The lower figure inaccurately took into account a $5 million transfer from the group to another Trump committee.\nHow we handle corrections\nCredit... Travis Dove for The New York Times After former President Donald J. Trump sat in a courtroom in New York for much of the last week, Saturday night was supposed to herald a return to the campaign trail and the large rallies where he often gives long, freewheeling speeches.\nWith thousands gathered on the tarmac at an airport in Wilmington, N.C., Mr. Trump's campaign was building anticipation. Two hours before he was set to speak, the campaign sent a fund-raising blast with a message from Mr. Trump: 'They can't keep me off stage! Did they think I would run and hide?'\nNinety minutes later, the skies darkened to charcoal and lightning flashed. As thunderstorms swept toward the area and the National Weather Service issued watches and warnings concerning dangerous winds and hail, the rally was canceled over safety concerns.\n'We'll make up for this very quickly at another time,' Mr. Trump said on a call he made into the rally that was broadcast over the speakers. 'We'll do it as quick as possible. I'm devastated that this could happen.'\nBut the cancellation, which Mr. Trump indicated was out of his hands, highlights the challenges that he may face as he tries to balance his presidential campaign with a criminal trial that will keep him busy through May.\nFor much of the last week, Mr. Trump's public comments had been limited to social media posts and remarks to reporters outside the courtroom. His only campaign stop was at a bodega in New York City, in a state he overwhelmingly lost in the last two elections and that is not expected to be in play in November.\nSaturday's rally was expected to serve as a preview of the upcoming weeks, with Mr. Trump traveling on weekends to campaign in battleground states that are more central to his efforts to return to the White House.\nHe has repeatedly claimed that the trial is preventing him from campaigning in places like North Carolina, which he won in 2016 and 2020, but where Democrats are making a big push in November. Opening arguments are slated to start on Monday, and the trial is set to last six to eight weeks.\nAs is often the case with Mr. Trump's rallies, the crowds began lining up hours ahead of his expected remarks. Among those gathered outside was a group wearing shirts with the logo of the Proud Boys, a prominent far-right extremist group. One person held a sign that read 'Free All of the J6 Prisoners,' a reference to those serving sentences in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.\nMr. Trump, who faces four criminal indictments that include charges tied to his efforts to overturn his election loss, has recently embraced dozens of Jan. 6 defendants. He has called them 'hostages' and has said he would consider pardoning them.\nIn a statement, Ammar Moussa, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, criticized the group's presence, pointing to remarks Mr. Trump made in a debate in 2020, in which he told the Proud Boys to 'stand back and stand by.'\n'This is Donald Trump's America: where white nationalists and violent far-right extremists are empowered and working families are left behind,' Mr. Moussa wrote.\nChris LaCivita, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, responded in a statement, 'We don't comment on stupid.'\nMr. Trump's remarks were expected to face particular scrutiny given that he is under a gag order in his criminal trial that bans him from attacking witnesses, prosecutors, jurors and court staff, as well as their relatives and relatives of the judge. Prosecutors have said Mr. Trump has violated the gag order seven times, and there is a hearing about the issue on Tuesday.\nMr. Trump did travel to North Carolina earlier in the day, attending a fund-raiser in Charlotte in the afternoon. When he called into the rally, he told the attendees that he was minutes away from 'flying in' to Wilmington but that the authorities 'would prefer that we not come in' over safety concerns.\n'I'm so sorry,' Mr. Trump said. 'But we'll do it again, and we'll do it bigger and better. You have my promise.'\nAs the crowd left to seek shelter in their cars, vendors outside were still selling an array of merchandise, some of which had been created specifically for the occasion. One T-shirt promoted what it called the Wilmington stop on Mr. Trump's 'Save America' tour.\n'I was there!' The shirt read. 'Where were you???'\nRobert Draper contributed reporting.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Maggie Astor","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/21/multimedia/21pol-swiper-noem-fjwg/21pol-swiper-noem-fjwg-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":2.659484,"_id":"c279e4ee84ccfb4792e304ddd17e0d76"},{"title":"Live Updates: Iran State-Run Media Reports Explosions","author":"Farnaz Fassihi","published_date":"2024-04-19 02:44:44","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/18/world/israel-iran-gaza-war-news","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"It was unclear what caused the blasts, but they came less than a week after Iran carried out its first-ever direct attack on Israel, drawing vows of retaliation.","summary":"Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index Explosions were heard early on Friday near the Iranian city of Isfahan, according an Iranian news agency affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. The agency, Fars News, said the cause of the explosions was not immediately clear. The agency said the explosions were heard in Qahjavarestan, a small city in west-central Iran close to Isfahan airport. Flight tracking websites showed that civilian planes had diverted their routes away from the area. The explosions came five days after Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel, its first direct attack on the country, in response to an Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed seven Iranian officials on April 1. For days, Israeli leaders have threatened to respond to Iran's strikes, which turned the two countries' yearslong shadow war into a direct confrontation. The Israeli military declined to comment about the explosions on Friday in Iran. Iran's army chief, Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi, said on Wednesday that Iran would respond to any Israeli aggression, according to remarks carried by the IRNA state news agency. President Biden has advised Israel against responding, amid fears that an Israeli counterattack would escalate into an all-out war. For more than six months, Israel has been fighting on two other fronts \u2014 against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Both are allies of Iran.

Mohammed Salem/Reuters President Biden's team sought again on Thursday to put the brakes on Israeli plans for a major military assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, prompting the Israelis to agree to rethink their approach and come back for further consultations, the White House said in a statement. During a virtual meeting led by Jake Sullivan, the president's national security adviser, the American side evaluated options for the attack presented by Israel but was not convinced that those plans met Mr. Biden's insistence that any operation be calibrated to minimize civilian casualties, according to the White House statement. The two sides agreed to 'meet again soon,' the statement said. The meeting was convened just days after the United States came to Israel's defense against a barrage of more than 300 missiles and drones fired by Iran; Israeli, U.S. and other allied forces knocked down nearly all of the incoming Iranian weapons, resulting in little damage and no fatalities. Despite that close collaboration, though, the discussion on Thursday underscored that the two sides remained at odds over Israel's conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza more than six months after the Oct. 7 terrorist attack. 'U.S. participants expressed concerns with various courses of action in Rafah, and Israeli participants agreed to take these concerns into account and to have further follow up discussions between experts,' the White House statement said. The statement did not elaborate on the specific concerns. The Israeli side was led by Ron Dermer, a close adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and member of the Israeli war cabinet, and Tzachi Hanegbi, the prime minister's national security adviser. The group discussed the Iran attack and efforts to defend Israel against future threats. The White House statement emphasized that the United States shared Israel's goal 'to see Hamas defeated in Rafah,' but the president has resisted a ground operation out of fear of the consequences for more than 1 million Palestinians who have taken refuge there. A rally in Jerusalem this month calling for the release of hostages held by Hamas. Credit... Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times Negotiations for a cease-fire and the release of Israeli hostages have stalled because Hamas rejected the latest proposal put forth by Israel, Qatar and Egypt, the C.I.A. director said Thursday, putting the blame for a lack of progress in talks squarely on the group that led the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Earlier this month, William J. Burns, C.I.A. director and lead American negotiator, traveled to Cairo and pushed what he called 'a far-reaching proposal' that Egyptian and Qatari negotiators took to Hamas. The proposal contained an offer to allow some Gazans to return to the northern part of the enclave, a key Hamas demand. While Mr. Burns did not describe the details of that proposal, he said that so far Hamas has not accepted it. 'It was a deep disappointment to get a negative reaction from Hamas,' said Mr. Burns, speaking at the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas. 'Right now, it's that negative reaction that really is standing in the way of innocent civilians in Gaza getting humanitarian relief that they so desperately need.' Last Sunday, Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, expressed regret that Hamas had rejected the proposal and argued it proved that the group was not interested in reaching a deal. Other American officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations, have said Hamas has signaled that it does not have enough women and civilian hostages in its control to consummate the first part of the deal, which would release 40 hostages over six weeks in return for a large number of Palestinian prisoners. A senior Hamas official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were not enough living civilian hostages left who met Israel's criteria to reach their proposed figure of 40 hostages over six weeks. He accused Israel of seeking to free captive soldiers for a lower price than that demanded by the group. Hamas has said most soldiers would be released in a later phase of a cease-fire deal. In its latest proposal to negotiators, Hamas called for releasing fewer than 20 living hostages as part of an initial, six-week phase cease-fire deal, according to two Israeli officials familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Israel had hoped to see wounded and ill hostages freed, but Hamas was insisting on a far more narrow definition limited to the elderly and women, one of the officials said. Last year, Mr. Burns helped guide talks that led to the release of roughly 100 hostages in return for a temporary halt in fighting and the release of Palestinian prisoners. Mr. Burns said he could not guarantee that the current talks would succeed. 'And it breaks your heart because you can see in very human terms what's at stake here as well,' he said. Mr. Burns also reiterated the Biden administration's desire that Israel not escalate its conflict with Iran, after what he called a failed Iranian attack last weekend. Instead, he said President Biden and other policymakers hope that 'we'll all find a way to de-escalate the situation.' 'I know the Israeli government, as we sit here this afternoon, is considering a response to what happened last Saturday night,' Mr. Burns said. 'And you know, that's their choice to make that response.' But Mr. Burns said the Israelis had 'clearly demonstrated their superiority' with shooting down Iranian drones and missiles. He said of 330 drones and missiles launched by Iran, only four or five hit the ground in Israel. 'And none of them did any significant damage,' he said. 'It's a reminder of the quality of the Israeli military. It's a reminder of the fact that the Israelis have friends, starting with the United States.' Palestinians rallied in Hebron, West Bank, to support the bid for statehood in 2011. Credit... Rina Castelnuovo for The New York Times A draft resolution that the United States vetoed at the U.N. Security Council on Thursday afternoon was the latest frustrated effort in a long-running campaign to secure recognition for Palestinian statehood. Still, that the matter made it to a Security Council vote at all reflects how the debate over Palestinian statehood has been reinvigorated by the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The United Nations voted in 1947 to create an independent Arab state alongside a Jewish one, but the plan was rejected by neighboring Arab governments and Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel was founded amid a war the following year. In the years since, plans for a two-state solution have been repeatedly proposed and stymied. Here's a look at some of the Palestinian efforts to gain recognition. Palestine became a member of UNESCO in 2011 but a bid for full U.N. membership failed. The next year, Palestine was granted the lesser status of observer at the United Nations, a level shared by the Holy See. Observers can participate in U.N. General Assembly sessions but are not allowed to vote. They also can join the International Court of Justice, which is currently hearing a case on the legality of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. Palestine is also party to a number of treaties, and became a member of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2018.

Clary/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images With the war raging in Gaza, the Palestinian Authority asked the United Nations to take up its bid a second time. Last Monday, as the war entered its seventh month, the Security Council agreed to reopen the application. The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, called it 'a historic moment again' and said that it was high time for the world body to recognize Palestinian statehood. That, he said, would 'open the door slightly in the direction of peace.' About 140 countries have gone on record in support of the Palestinian bid that reached the Security Council on Thursday. To succeed, the application needed the votes of at least nine of the 15 member countries, and no veto by any of its five permanent members. It received 12 votes, but the United States \u2014 which has a longstanding policy that Palestinian statehood must come as part of a negotiated agreement with Israel \u2014 used its veto power as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. Already, 138 of the 193 sovereign states that belong to the United Nations recognize Palestinian statehood, according to the World Population Review, including Russia and China \u2014 both permanent members of the Security Council. While the European Union itself does not recognize the state of Palestine, nearly a third of the bloc's 28 members do. The Vatican has also recognized Palestinian statehood.

Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has doubled down on his opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state, rebuffing pressure from President Biden to agree to that path after the war in Gaza ends. But as the death toll has climbed in Gaza, the push for Palestinian statehood has intensified. Allies like Canada, France and Britain have long shared the Biden administration's stance about the need for a two-state solution negotiated with Israel. But some have in recent months suggested that they might recognize a Palestinian state sooner. David Cameron, Britain's foreign secretary, signaled in January that Britain was willing to move up conversations about formally recognizing a Palestinian state, saying that his country and other allies should show Palestinians 'irreversible progress' toward that long-sought goal. In February, President Emmanuel Macron of France said, 'Recognition of a Palestinian state is not a taboo for France.' It was unclear whether Mr. Macron was referring to France's longstanding support for a two-state solution in general or to the idea of giving recognition before any negotiated agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians. And last month, the leaders of Spain, Ireland, Malta and Slovenia issued a joint statement saying that they had 'discussed together our readiness to recognize Palestine and said that we would do so when it can make a positive contribution and the circumstances are right.' The Security Council has consistently called for a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Credit... Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images The United States blocked the U.N. Security Council on Thursday from moving forward on a Palestinian bid to be recognized as a full member state at the United Nations, quashing an effort by Palestinian allies to get the world body to back the effort. The Palestinian envoy to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, was visibly emotional after the vote, asking, 'What will you do \u2014 you, the international Security Council that is charged with the maintenance of international peace and security? What are you doing to do? What are you willing to do?' The Security Council has consistently called for a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, a result that has failed to materialize during negotiations between the two sides. In Washington, a spokesman for the State Department, Vedant Patel, said before the vote that the statehood resolution was dead on arrival. 'It remains the U.S. view that the most expeditious path toward statehood for the Palestinian people is through direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority with the support of the United States and other partners,' Mr. Patel told reporters at a news briefing on Thursday. The United States, along with the four other permanent members of the Council, can veto any action before it. Israel's foreign minister, Israel Katz, praised the U.S. decision to block the proposal on Thursday, saying, 'The shameful proposal was rejected. Terrorism will not be rewarded.' The resolution had asked the 15-member Security Council to recommend to the 193-member U.N. General Assembly that 'the State of Palestine be admitted to membership of the United Nations,' diplomats said. China was one of 12 countries that voted in favor of the proposal, and its ambassador to the United Nations, Fu Cong, said he found the U.S. veto 'most disappointing.' 'The decade-long dream of the Palestinian people ruthlessly dashed,' he said. Two countries, Britain and Switzerland, abstained from the vote, saying they supported a two-state solution but that the war in Gaza must be resolved first. 'We must keep our focus on securing an immediate pause in order to get aid in and hostages out, ' said Barbara Woodward, Britain's ambassador to the U.N. Israel was admitted as a full U.N. member in 1949. The Palestinian Authority has been seeking a state made up of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip for decades; those territories have all been captured or annexed by Israel. The Arab League founded the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1964 with a charter stressing self-determination for Palestinians and the rejection of the creation of the State of Israel. Little progress has been made on achieving statehood since Israel and the Palestinian Authority signed the Oslo Accords in the early 1990s, which established a peace process aimed at a two-state solution. In 2007, the militant group Hamas drove the Palestinian Authority \u2014 which President Mahmoud Abbas leads and which exercises limited self-rule in the occupied West Bank \u2014 from power in the Gaza Strip. Complicating the Palestinian application for statehood is the war that began when Hamas led terrorist attacks on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and prompted Israel's retaliatory attacks in Gaza. That war has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to the Gazan health ministry. The conflict has spilled into the occupied West Bank and neighboring countries like Lebanon and has drawn Iran into the fray. Anushka Patil contributed reporting. President Biden said in a statement that the sanctions aimed to 'further degrade Iran's military industries.' Credit... Al Drago for The New York Times The United States and Britain on Thursday imposed new sanctions on Iranian military leaders and weapon manufacturers to punish Tehran for its missile and drone attack on Israel last weekend, even as they implored Israeli officials not to retaliate too strongly and set off a wider war. White House officials said the sanctions were aimed at disrupting Iran's ability to produce the unmanned aerial vehicles that its military used to attack Israel by cutting off global financial transactions with companies and individuals involved in building them. The sanctions will also try to block exports by Iran's steel industry that bring Tehran billions of dollars in revenue, they said. President Biden said in a statement that the sanctions would 'further degrade Iran's military industries,' adding: 'Let it be clear to all those who enable or support Iran's attacks: The United States is committed to Israel's security.' In a coordinated move, Britain said it had imposed sanctions on seven people and six entities linked to Iran's regional military activity and its attack on Israel, which Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called a 'reckless act and a dangerous escalation.' 'These sanctions \u2014 announced with the U.S. \u2014 show we unequivocally condemn this behavior, and they will further limit Iran's ability to destabilize the region,' Mr. Sunak said in a statement. Earlier Thursday, the president of the European Council announced that new European Union sanctions would be imposed on Iran's drone and missile programs in an effort 'to isolate Iran.' The United States and European allies have been looking for ways to punish Iran while urging Israel not to retaliate in a way that could inflame a wider Middle East conflict. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Israel will not let outside pressure determine its response, saying on Wednesday, 'We will make our own decisions.' Israel welcomed the announcement of new sanctions, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz thanking Mr. Biden 'for his ironclad commitment to Israel's security.' 'This is our opportunity to form a global front and a regional coalition against Iran, together with the US, the EU, and moderate Arab states, to stop the serpent's head that threatens global stability,' Mr. Katz wrote on social media. 'We must stop Iran now before it's too late.' But it is unclear whether the new sanctions will prove more effective at degrading the Iranian military drone program than previous U.S. efforts. Last October, the Biden administration announced similar sanctions on the Iranian drone program, which officials said at the time were aimed at frustrating Iran's ability to produce just the kind of weapons that it used against Israel in the recent attacks. In a statement at the time, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said those penalties on several individuals and companies were meant to address 'one of the greatest challenges to international peace and security.' The attack on Israel over the weekend suggests that Iran's military has found ways around the previous sanctions. In his statement, Mr. Biden acknowledged the history of sanctions and vowed to continue increasing the pressure on Iran. 'During my administration, the United States has sanctioned over 600 individuals and entities \u2014 including Iran and its proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Kataib Hezbollah,' he said, listing armed groups that Iran supports in the Middle East. 'And we will keep at it. As Israel's war cabinet continues to weigh a possible response to Iran \u2014 whose attack was itself in retaliation for a deadly April 1 strike against an Iranian Embassy building in Syria \u2014 Tehran has warned it will act harshly against any aggression. Maj. Gen. Ahmad Haghtalab, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps commander in charge of protecting Iran's nuclear sites, said that if Israel were to hit one of those targets, 'the hands are on the trigger' to strike Israeli nuclear facilities in response, according to remarks carried by Iranian state news media.

He accused Israel of seeking to free captive soldiers for a lower price than that demanded by the group. Hamas has said most soldiers would be released in a later phase of a cease-fire deal.\nIn its latest proposal to negotiators, Hamas called for releasing fewer than 20 living hostages as part of an initial, six-week phase cease-fire deal, according to two Israeli officials familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Israel had hoped to see wounded and ill hostages freed, but Hamas was insisting on a far more narrow definition limited to the elderly and women, one of the officials said.\nLast year, Mr. Burns helped guide talks that led to the release of roughly 100 hostages in return for a temporary halt in fighting and the release of Palestinian prisoners. Mr. Burns said he could not guarantee that the current talks would succeed.\n'And it breaks your heart because you can see in very human terms what's at stake here as well,' he said.\nMr. Burns also reiterated the Biden administration's desire that Israel not escalate its conflict with Iran, after what he called a failed Iranian attack last weekend. Instead, he said President Biden and other policymakers hope that 'we'll all find a way to de-escalate the situation.'\n'I know the Israeli government, as we sit here this afternoon, is considering a response to what happened last Saturday night,' Mr. Burns said. 'And you know, that's their choice to make that response.'\nBut Mr. Burns said the Israelis had 'clearly demonstrated their superiority' with shooting down Iranian drones and missiles. He said of 330 drones and missiles launched by Iran, only four or five hit the ground in Israel.\n'And none of them did any significant damage,' he said. 'It's a reminder of the quality of the Israeli military. It's a reminder of the fact that the Israelis have friends, starting with the United States.'\nPalestinians rallied in Hebron, West Bank, to support the bid for statehood in 2011. Credit... Rina Castelnuovo for The New York Times A draft resolution that the United States vetoed at the U.N. Security Council on Thursday afternoon was the latest frustrated effort in a long-running campaign to secure recognition for Palestinian statehood.\nStill, that the matter made it to a Security Council vote at all reflects how the debate over Palestinian statehood has been reinvigorated by the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\nThe United Nations voted in 1947 to create an independent Arab state alongside a Jewish one, but the plan was rejected by neighboring Arab governments and Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel was founded amid a war the following year. In the years since, plans for a two-state solution have been repeatedly proposed and stymied.\nHere's a look at some of the Palestinian efforts to gain recognition.\nPalestine became a member of UNESCO in 2011 but a bid for full U.N. membership failed. The next year, Palestine was granted the lesser status of observer at the United Nations, a level shared by the Holy See.\nObservers can participate in U.N. General Assembly sessions but are not allowed to vote. They also can join the International Court of Justice, which is currently hearing a case on the legality of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories.\nPalestine is also party to a number of treaties, and became a member of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2018.\nMahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, with a copy of a letter requesting Palestine's full admission to the United Nations at the General Assembly in 2011. Credit... Timothy A. Clary/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images With the war raging in Gaza, the Palestinian Authority asked the United Nations to take up its bid a second time. Last Monday, as the war entered its seventh month, the Security Council agreed to reopen the application. The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, called it 'a historic moment again' and said that it was high time for the world body to recognize Palestinian statehood. That, he said, would 'open the door slightly in the direction of peace.'\nAbout 140 countries have gone on record in support of the Palestinian bid that reached the Security Council on Thursday.\nTo succeed, the application needed the votes of at least nine of the 15 member countries, and no veto by any of its five permanent members. It received 12 votes, but the United States \u2014 which has a longstanding policy that Palestinian statehood must come as part of a negotiated agreement with Israel \u2014 used its veto power as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council.\nAlready, 138 of the 193 sovereign states that belong to the United Nations recognize Palestinian statehood, according to the World Population Review, including Russia and China \u2014 both permanent members of the Security Council.\nWhile the European Union itself does not recognize the state of Palestine, nearly a third of the bloc's 28 members do.\nThe Vatican has also recognized Palestinian statehood.\nA giant chair symbolizing the statehood of Palestine in Ramallah, in the West Bank, in 2011. Credit... Lynsey Addario for The New York Times Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has doubled down on his opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state, rebuffing pressure from President Biden to agree to that path after the war in Gaza ends. But as the death toll has climbed in Gaza, the push for Palestinian statehood has intensified.\nAllies like Canada, France and Britain have long shared the Biden administration's stance about the need for a two-state solution negotiated with Israel. But some have in recent months suggested that they might recognize a Palestinian state sooner.\nDavid Cameron, Britain's foreign secretary, signaled in January that Britain was willing to move up conversations about formally recognizing a Palestinian state, saying that his country and other allies should show Palestinians 'irreversible progress' toward that long-sought goal.\nIn February, President Emmanuel Macron of France said, 'Recognition of a Palestinian state is not a taboo for France.' It was unclear whether Mr. Macron was referring to France's longstanding support for a two-state solution in general or to the idea of giving recognition before any negotiated agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians.\nAnd last month, the leaders of Spain, Ireland, Malta and Slovenia issued a joint statement saying that they had 'discussed together our readiness to recognize Palestine and said that we would do so when it can make a positive contribution and the circumstances are right.'\nThe Security Council has consistently called for a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Credit... Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images The United States blocked the U.N. Security Council on Thursday from moving forward on a Palestinian bid to be recognized as a full member state at the United Nations, quashing an effort by Palestinian allies to get the world body to back the effort.\nThe Palestinian envoy to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, was visibly emotional after the vote, asking, 'What will you do \u2014 you, the international Security Council that is charged with the maintenance of international peace and security? What are you doing to do? What are you willing to do?'\nThe Security Council has consistently called for a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, a result that has failed to materialize during negotiations between the two sides. In Washington, a spokesman for the State Department, Vedant Patel, said before the vote that the statehood resolution was dead on arrival.\n'It remains the U.S. view that the most expeditious path toward statehood for the Palestinian people is through direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority with the support of the United States and other partners,' Mr. Patel told reporters at a news briefing on Thursday.\nThe United States, along with the four other permanent members of the Council, can veto any action before it. Israel's foreign minister, Israel Katz, praised the U.S. decision to block the proposal on Thursday, saying, 'The shameful proposal was rejected. Terrorism will not be rewarded.'\nThe resolution had asked the 15-member Security Council to recommend to the 193-member U.N. General Assembly that 'the State of Palestine be admitted to membership of the United Nations,' diplomats said.\nChina was one of 12 countries that voted in favor of the proposal, and its ambassador to the United Nations, Fu Cong, said he found the U.S. veto 'most disappointing.'\n'The decade-long dream of the Palestinian people ruthlessly dashed,' he said.\nTwo countries, Britain and Switzerland, abstained from the vote, saying they supported a two-state solution but that the war in Gaza must be resolved first.\n'We must keep our focus on securing an immediate pause in order to get aid in and hostages out, ' said Barbara Woodward, Britain's ambassador to the U.N.\nIsrael was admitted as a full U.N. member in 1949. The Palestinian Authority has been seeking a state made up of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip for decades; those territories have all been captured or annexed by Israel. The Arab League founded the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1964 with a charter stressing self-determination for Palestinians and the rejection of the creation of the State of Israel.\nLittle progress has been made on achieving statehood since Israel and the Palestinian Authority signed the Oslo Accords in the early 1990s, which established a peace process aimed at a two-state solution. In 2007, the militant group Hamas drove the Palestinian Authority \u2014 which President Mahmoud Abbas leads and which exercises limited self-rule in the occupied West Bank \u2014 from power in the Gaza Strip.\nComplicating the Palestinian application for statehood is the war that began when Hamas led terrorist attacks on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and prompted Israel's retaliatory attacks in Gaza. That war has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to the Gazan health ministry. The conflict has spilled into the occupied West Bank and neighboring countries like Lebanon and has drawn Iran into the fray.\nAnushka Patil contributed reporting.\nPresident Biden said in a statement that the sanctions aimed to 'further degrade Iran's military industries.' Credit... Al Drago for The New York Times The United States and Britain on Thursday imposed new sanctions on Iranian military leaders and weapon manufacturers to punish Tehran for its missile and drone attack on Israel last weekend, even as they implored Israeli officials not to retaliate too strongly and set off a wider war.\nWhite House officials said the sanctions were aimed at disrupting Iran's ability to produce the unmanned aerial vehicles that its military used to attack Israel by cutting off global financial transactions with companies and individuals involved in building them. The sanctions will also try to block exports by Iran's steel industry that bring Tehran billions of dollars in revenue, they said.\nPresident Biden said in a statement that the sanctions would 'further degrade Iran's military industries,' adding: 'Let it be clear to all those who enable or support Iran's attacks: The United States is committed to Israel's security.'\nIn a coordinated move, Britain said it had imposed sanctions on seven people and six entities linked to Iran's regional military activity and its attack on Israel, which Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called a 'reckless act and a dangerous escalation.'\n'These sanctions \u2014 announced with the U.S. \u2014 show we unequivocally condemn this behavior, and they will further limit Iran's ability to destabilize the region,' Mr. Sunak said in a statement.\nEarlier Thursday, the president of the European Council announced that new European Union sanctions would be imposed on Iran's drone and missile programs in an effort 'to isolate Iran.'\nThe United States and European allies have been looking for ways to punish Iran while urging Israel not to retaliate in a way that could inflame a wider Middle East conflict. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Israel will not let outside pressure determine its response, saying on Wednesday, 'We will make our own decisions.'\nIsrael welcomed the announcement of new sanctions, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz thanking Mr. Biden 'for his ironclad commitment to Israel's security.'\n'This is our opportunity to form a global front and a regional coalition against Iran, together with the US, the EU, and moderate Arab states, to stop the serpent's head that threatens global stability,' Mr. Katz wrote on social media. 'We must stop Iran now before it's too late.'\nBut it is unclear whether the new sanctions will prove more effective at degrading the Iranian military drone program than previous U.S. efforts.\nLast October, the Biden administration announced similar sanctions on the Iranian drone program, which officials said at the time were aimed at frustrating Iran's ability to produce just the kind of weapons that it used against Israel in the recent attacks.\nIn a statement at the time, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said those penalties on several individuals and companies were meant to address 'one of the greatest challenges to international peace and security.'\nThe attack on Israel over the weekend suggests that Iran's military has found ways around the previous sanctions.\nIn his statement, Mr. Biden acknowledged the history of sanctions and vowed to continue increasing the pressure on Iran.\n'During my administration, the United States has sanctioned over 600 individuals and entities \u2014 including Iran and its proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Kataib Hezbollah,' he said, listing armed groups that Iran supports in the Middle East. 'And we will keep at it.\nAs Israel's war cabinet continues to weigh a possible response to Iran \u2014 whose attack was itself in retaliation for a deadly April 1 strike against an Iranian Embassy building in Syria \u2014 Tehran has warned it will act harshly against any aggression.\nMaj.

Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab courtroom in New York City while Mr. Trump looked on. Mr. Trump was charged in Manhattan, a deeply Democratic county and his former home, with falsifying nearly three dozen business records in an attempt to cover up a payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, who has said she had a brief sexual encounter with him in 2006. Mr. Trump denies that encounter happened, and has declared his innocence, calling the charges politically motivated. He has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a Democrat, who also attended the first day of trial on Monday. Mr. Trump faces 34 felony counts and could face probation or up to four years of prison time. The trial, which is expected to last weeks, has a fascinating list of potential witnesses: Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer turned apostate, who made the payment; Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who says she, too, had an affair with Mr. Trump; and Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels herself may testify. Before any of that happens, a jury must be selected, a winnowing that began Monday. Here are five takeaways from Mr. Trump's first day on trial: Justice Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, has been consistent about batting back defense motions on issues including the tardy disclosure of documents by prosecutors and efforts to delay or even dismiss the case. That pattern continued on Monday, as Justice Merchan rejected a defense effort to force his recusal. The defense had cited several issues, including the fact that his daughter is a Democratic political consultant. He also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost. But Mr. Trump's lawyers convinced Justice Merchan that sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the so-called Access Hollywood tape, in which Mr. Trump was caught bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial, calling them 'complete rumors, complete gossip, completely hearsay.' Justice Merchan's decisions on Monday made it clear that the trial will resurface unsavory events in the former president's life. Those include the Access Hollywood tape and other stories that Mr. Trump sought to suppress including an alleged affair with Ms. McDougal. Justice Merchan said on Monday that both could be discussed. In a minor victory for the defense, the judge reaffirmed that the 'Access Hollywood' tape itself could not be played, but that Trump's exact words could be entered into the record. Still, most of Mr. Merchan's rulings indicated that salacious details of Mr. Trump's biography will be heard in court. Entering the courtroom, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here.' Once he was in front of Mr. Merchan, Mr. Trump looked a lot less enthusiastic. He slouched. He scowled. He scoffed. And he was quiet, not the norm for a man who built a political career with his gift for slashing attacks and vicious put-downs. In court, the former president spoke only briefly, when asked a few questions by Justice Merchan about procedural matters, and whether he understood the consequences \u2014 ejection or jail \u2014 if he interrupted proceedings. He did whisper with his lawyers. And when the prosecution played a recording of him claiming to have great respect for women, he mouthed the word 'true.' But all in all, it seems it could be an exhausting experience for Mr. Trump; at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep. It's easy to forget how long it takes to do a little in legal settings. On Monday, the morning session was dominated by maneuvering by prosecutors and the defense, even as prospective jurors waited. By lunch, they were still waiting. Jury selection could take days or weeks, and the trial itself may take two months. The Passover holiday could cause delays, Justice Merchan said, though he might make some of that up by holding hearings on court matters on Wednesdays, which was previously going to be an off day. By afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into Justice Merchan's courtroom. He warmly welcomed them, introduced the lawyers and Mr. Trump and read them a summary of the case. Justice Merchan asked if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president. Of the 96 prospective jurors in the room at that time, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused. The remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial. April 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET Trump spoke briefly to TV cameras after court adjourned for the day, repeating his longstanding claims that the trial is a 'political witch hunt' before heading to his motorcade and departing the courthouse. Video Reporter: [inaudible] the trial \u2014 [inaudible] So thank you very much. We had some amazing things happen today. As you know, my son is graduating from high school and it looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation of my son, who's worked very, very hard. He's a great student and he's very proud of the fact that he did so well. And was looking forward for years to have his graduation with his mother and father there. And it looks like the judges isn't going to allow me to escape this scam. It's a scam trial. If you read all of the legal pundits, all of the legal scholars today, there's not one that I see that said, this is a case that should be brought or tried. It's a scam. It's a political witch hunt.

'You don't think you should be here at all right now?' he asks. Blanche says that yes, they don't believe this trial should happen during campaign season. Merchan reminds him that his client is a criminal defendant and required to be in court \u2014 his request is denied. April 15, 2024, 4:39 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 4:39 p.m. ET There is still some business to attend to.

DavidAs former President Donald J. Trump's first criminal trial began inside a Manhattan courthouse on Monday, the scene outside had elements of a feisty political skirmish and a surreal circus rolled into one. The streets below the courtroom drew a mix of gawkers, activists and publicity hounds, along with a large contingent of journalists. Laura Loomer, a right-wing activist known for her aggressive tactics and closeness with Mr. Trump, led a chant of 'Donald Trump Did Nothing Wrong!' alongside Andrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and Trump lawyer. 'We're going to be here every single day talking to all you fake-news media freaks,' Ms. Loomer said through a Harvey Milk-style bullhorn in a video she posted on social media. 'And letting you know that Donald Trump did nothing wrong until you start reporting the truth.' Ms. Loomer described the case as a 'witch hunt' \u2014 a frequent assertion of Mr. Trump's \u2014 and criticized a key witness for the prosecution, Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, and the wife of the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan. Mr. Trump promptly reposted the video on Truth Social \u2014 despite a gag order that bars him from attacking witnesses in the case or Justice Merchan's family. His post, made during the lunch break, came shortly before Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month on prosecutors' request that Mr. Trump be held in contempt of court over statements they say violate the order. Performance artists also vied for attention. One, known as Crackhead Barney, stood screaming outside the gates surrounding Collect Pond Park that she had been kicked out, and demanded police officers' badge numbers. Another played the flute atop a park bench, notes drifting through the wind and his instrument glinting in the sunlight. Some anti-Trump demonstrators held handmade signs emblazoned with 'Loser' and 'Convict Trump Already,' while others tried to confront Ms. Loomer. One, Sue Scarlett Montgomery, asked reporters why they were paying attention to Ms. Loomer, a former Republican candidate for Congress who previously visited a treacherous migrant crossing in Panama as part of her anti-Muslim activism. 'They're covering me because I broke the story about this corrupt judge here,' Ms. Loomer shot back, attacking Judge Merchan's daughter, a Democratic political consultant who has also been a target of Mr. Trump.

Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Everyone expected that picking a jury to try a polarizing figure like former President Donald J. Trump was going to be a challenge. But the experience of the first round of about 100 potential panelists gave a flavor of just how difficult the process could be: More than half told the judge that they could not hear the case against Mr. Trump fairly and were immediately excused. Justice Juan M. Merchan, who is presiding over the case, read aloud to the prospective jurors a list of people who might serve as witnesses or be mentioned during the trial, asking them whether they recognized the names. Many of those names were indeed very recognizable. Among those who could come up during the trial were Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump's former adviser, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and one of Mr. Trump's lawyers. Several of Mr. Trump's relatives were also on the list, including his wife, Melania, his older daughter, Ivanka, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner.

April 15, 2024, 3:12 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:12 p.m. ET It's remarkable that more than half of the potential jurors brought in for a first round of questioning immediately said they could not hear Trump's case fairly. We knew that it would be hard to pick a jury, but a fail rate of 50 percent or higher right out of the gate is surpassingly rare.  April 15, 2024, 3:05 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:05 p.m. ET Among the notable names that the judge just read out as potential witnesses or people who could come up were Stephen K. Bannon, Rudy Giuliani, Melania Trump and Jared Kushner. Not all will appear as witnesses or even potentially be mentioned. But it certainly gives jurors a sense of the cast of characters.  The jury selection process in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan could take two weeks or more. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Lawyers representing the State of New York and Donald J. Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate. The potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair. The process could take two weeks or more \u2014 and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court. 'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.' The stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County \u2014 Manhattan, as most people know it \u2014 which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020. Mr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated. Prosecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28. Unlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.' Some may not be completely forthcoming. 'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said. Mr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors. 'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'     Former President Donald J. Trump smirked and scoffed during pretrial proceedings on Monday in Manhattan. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Former President Donald J. Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted Monday morning, as his lawyers and prosecutors hashed out pretrial motions before jury selection in his criminal case. Even as a judge was hearing arguments on last-minute issues in a criminal case that centers on salacious allegations and threatens to upend his bid for the presidency, Mr. Trump appeared to nod off a few times, his mouth going slack and his head drooping onto his chest. The former president's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, passed him notes for several minutes before Mr. Trump appeared to jolt awake and notice them. At other times, Mr. Trump whispered and exchanged notes with Mr. Blanche. He sat motionless while his own words from the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape \u2014 on which bragged about grabbing women's genitals \u2014 were read from a transcript by a prosecutor. At times, Mr. Trump's emotions were characteristically on display. He smirked and scoffed, and appeared frustrated when the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, did not immediately agree that he could miss court to attend the graduation of his youngest son, Barron. But when Justice Merchan warned that Mr. Trump could be ejected or thrown in jail if he disrupts the proceedings, the former president indicated that he understood. The only time Mr. Trump showed a flash of humor was when he laughed at one of his own social media posts, which attacked his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be the prosecution's central witness.  Former President Donald J. Trump's comments on the 'Access Hollywood' tape will allowed to be introduced as evidence. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times The judge in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial on Monday again refused to allow the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape to be played for jurors, but said that the comments Mr. Trump made on the tape could be introduced as evidence. On the tape, revealed in The Washington Post about a month before Mr. Trump was elected president in 2016, he is heard bragging about grabbing women's genitals, saying he could do so with abandon because 'when you're a star, they let you do it.' 'You can do anything,' Mr. Trump said on the recording. The tape rocked Mr. Trump's campaign. And prosecutors in Manhattan say it led him to agree to pay off Stormy Daniels, a porn star, who was shopping a story of a 2006 sexual encounter with the candidate. Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, paid Ms. Daniels $130,000. The payment is at the heart of the 34 felony charges against Mr. Trump, who is accused of falsifying business records to cover it up. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, had previously ruled that prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office could question witnesses about the tape, but found that it would be prejudicial to allow the actual video to the played. He reaffirmed that ruling on Monday. 'You can bring out what was said in the tape,' Justice Merchan said, adding that he didn't want jurors 'to hear Mr. Trump's voice and his gestures' in the tape. In a victory for the defense, the judge also ruled that the prosecution could not introduce evidence about sexual assault allegations against Mr. Trump that surfaced in the aftermath of the tape becoming public, calling them 'complete hearsay.' However, Justice Merchan said that prosecutors could introduce emails that followed the tape's disclosure, showing frantic efforts by Trump advisers to contain the fallout. The correspondence, he said, 'bolsters the people's claim that this was a crucial event.' Todd Blanche, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, had called on Justice Merchan to reconsider admitting 'this extremely salacious evidence,' which he described as 'very prejudicial.' Mr. Trump, who is again the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has denied any wrongdoing and has cast the case against him as politically motivated. Justice Juan M. Merchan has already reprimanded Donald J. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Inside a dreary Lower Manhattan courtroom on a recent Wednesday, Justice Juan M. Merchan convened a special session for people with mental health troubles who had landed in legal jeopardy. He calmly counseled them, praised any signs of progress and shook the hand of one man who, thanks to medication, had turned his life around. But a different type of criminal defendant is now testing the judge's equanimity: Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump's trial on charges that he covered up a sex scandal before and after the 2016 presidential election will bring a maelstrom that no other judge in New York's vast judiciary has ever experienced. Known as a no-nonsense, drama-averse jurist, Justice Merchan, 61, has already reprimanded Mr. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous and issued a gag order intended to protect prosecutors, witnesses and his own family from Mr. Trump's vitriol \u2014 and yet the former president has continued to post articles with pictures of the judge's daughter, a political consultant who has worked with Democratic candidates. Although Justice Merchan is a registered Democrat, records show he was previously a Republican, and people who know him described the judge as a moderate, law-and-order former prosecutor. Two people close to Justice Merchan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the judge had privately expressed pain over the attacks on his daughter, but the people said that those attacks won't compromise his ability to oversee the case. Other people who know the judge said that he will cast aside Mr. Trump's drama \u2014 and exert control over the trial. 'It is Judge Merchan's show,' said Jill Konviser, a retired judge who has known Justice Merchan for more than 15 years. She added: 'He will do everything he can to, one, control his courtroom and two, ensure a fair trial for the defendant.' In Justice Merchan's 17 years on the bench, 13 as presiding judge in the Mental Health Court he created, he has had his share of unusual cases. There was a murder trial involving a supposed curse on the defendant; the daredevils who jumped off the World Trade Center with parachutes; and a so-called soccer-mom madam accused of running a high-end brothel on the Upper East Side. In that case, an appeals court reduced the steep bail Justice Merchan had set, calling it 'unreasonable.' None of those defendants challenged the judge quite like Mr. Trump, who claims that the case is a witch hunt and declared that Justice Merchan's gag order had infringed on his First Amendment rights. The former president has tested the order's limits by posting articles that named and attacked Justice Merchan's daughter, Loren, and his wife, Lara. The articles, by the conservative activist Laura Loomer, included photos of Loren Merchan and copies of a 2007 mortgage statement for a house owned by Justice Merchan and his wife. Previously, Mr. Trump falsely accused Loren Merchan of posting an image of him behind bars on social media. The trial, which could last two months as a parade of former aides and allies takes the stand against him, will dominate Justice Merchan's calendar this spring. On off-days, he will continue to preside over Mental Health Court. The program is for defendants charged with felonies and diagnosed with a serious mental illness. People who are accepted enter a guilty plea and then begin a period of treatment and judicial supervision. Those who complete the program successfully can have their charges reduced or dismissed. During one recent session, Justice Merchan showed particular interest in the relationship between a defendant and his child, and praised him for his dedication. 'You want to do better by your daughter,' Justice Merchan said. 'I'm sure she's going to appreciate that.'  Donald J. Trump has repeatedly tried to have Juan M. Merchan removed as the judge in his case. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Juan M. Merchan, the judge overseeing Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan, has declined to step aside from the case, rejecting the former president's effort to delay the trial and attack his integrity. The judge announced the decision in the opening minutes of Mr. Trump's trial on Monday morning. After Justice Merchan rules on a variety of legal issues, the trial will begin in earnest with jury selection. 'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said Monday before rejecting the request. 'We want to follow the law,' he added. 'We want justice to be done.' Mr. Trump's lawyers had called on Justice Merchan to recuse himself in a recent court filing, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. The Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case that accuses Mr. Trump of falsifying records to conceal a sex scandal from voters, had argued that no conflict of interest existed. And judicial ethics experts cast doubt on Mr. Trump's request, noting that the judge was not responsible for his daughter's career. It was just the latest attempt by Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to both delay the trial and oust Justice Merchan. Nor will it be the last: In a separate civil action filed last week, Mr. Trump asked an appeals court to pause the case while it considers whether to remove Justice Merchan. It is a long-shot bid that a single appeals court judge rejected and will be likely to fail before a full five-judge panel. When Mr. Trump tried last year to have Justice Merchan kicked off the case, Justice Merchan rejected it then as well, citing a state advisory committee on judicial ethics that determined that his impartiality could not reasonably be questioned based on his daughter's interests. The repeated attempts reflect the former president's long-running effort to delay all four of his criminal cases past Election Day. Stalling is one of Mr. Trump's favored legal tactics, and he uses it liberally in Manhattan, as well as in the three other cities where he faces criminal charges. If Mr. Trump reclaims the White House, the criminal cases against him would most likely grind to a halt. In the attempt in appeals court to compel the judge's recusal, Emil Bove, a lawyer for the former president, argued that certain facts had changed since Justice Merchan first declined to step aside last year, including that Mr. Trump was now the presumptive Republican nominee for president. But a lawyer for the court system, Lisa Evans, said that there was no reason that the judge should step aside. 'There is absolutely no evidence to show that Judge Merchan will stand to benefit from the outcome of this trial,' Ms. Evans said.

Adam Gray/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images The streets outside the Manhattan courtroom where former President Donald J. Trump was set to go on trial were buzzing with anticipation on Monday morning as a crush of reporters \u2014 and a trickle of protesters \u2014 gathered to bear witness. Right-wing activists were planning rallies in the park directly opposite the court, which was subject to a heavy police presence. Some journalists and line-sitters had arrived late Sunday night, staking out places in the line to secure limited spaces inside the court's overflow room, where most reporters were gathered. Cameras lined the sidewalks outside the courthouse, a glowering edifice at 100 Centre Street, just blocks from New York's City Hall. TV crews were going live in intervals since before dawn, even as the police manned metal barricades. As the sun rose, some anti-Trump demonstrators had arrived, including one toting a sign reading 'Loser,' a favorite insult of the former president. Nadine Seiler, 58, took a midnight bus from Waldorf, Md., to get to the courthouse by dawn. 'This is the first and possibly only trial he's going to be on,' she said, holding up a spray-painted sheet reading 'Convict Trump Already.' Mr. Trump also had fans outside the courthouse, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist who argued with an anti-Trump protester as a gaggle of journalists surrounded them. Andrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City and lawyer for Mr. Trump, also came by to show support, arguing that the trial was a political persecution. 'He's somebody who I consider to be a mentor, almost like an uncle to me,' said Mr. Giuliani. Noting Mr. Trump's status as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Mr. Giuliani claimed: 'They want to tie him up for months at a time.' Others were simply there to witness the moment. 'I think it's a really difficult moment in American history,' said Sue Scarlett Montgomery, a filmmaker. 'It's a sad day, but here we are.'  The first criminal trial of an American president officially began on Monday as prosecutors and defense lawyers convened in a Manhattan courtroom to start selecting the jury that will decide Donald J. Trump's fate. The initial pool of prospective jurors dwindled rapidly. More than half of the first group of 96 were dismissed in short order after indicating that they did not believe they could be impartial. Court adjourned for the day roughly two hours after jury selection began, with zero jurors chosen. Before beginning the arduous process of choosing a jury for the landmark trial \u2014 on allegations that Mr. Trump falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star \u2014 the judge overseeing the case once again declined to step aside, rejecting Mr. Trump's latest effort to oust him. But there was also a ruling that favored the former president: The judge, Juan M. Merchan, rejected a request by prosecutors to introduce accusations of sexual assault that women lodged against Mr. Trump years ago, calling them 'rumors' and 'complete gossip.' The Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case against Mr. Trump, also asked the judge to hold Mr. Trump in contempt and penalize him $3,000 for violating a gag order barring him from attacking witnesses in the case. On social media over the weekend, Mr. Trump assailed one of the prosecution's key witnesses: Michael D. Cohen, his former fixer. Mr. Cohen paid $130,000 to the porn star, Stormy Daniels, during the 2016 presidential campaign to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she said she had with Mr. Trump. After the lunch break \u2014 during which Mr. Trump posted a video of an ally yelling about the judge's wife \u2014 Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month to discuss potential violations of the gag order, which also bars Mr. Trump from attacking the judge's family. The jury selection process could take two weeks or more, and the trial may spill into June. Mr. Trump is expected to be in the courtroom for much of it. Mr. Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted during pretrial arguments on Monday, sometimes smirking and scoffing, but also appearing to nod off, his mouth slack and his head drooping to his chest. After the trial got underway in the afternoon, he chuckled when Justice Merchan told the first group of 96 prospective jurors that he would ensure a fair trial. Mr. Trump, who might take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied the sexual encounter with Ms. Daniels. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records to hide the reimbursements to Mr. Cohen. They argue the payment to Ms. Daniels was part of a pattern: Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election. Here's what else to know about Mr. Trump's trial: This is the Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump, and it was brought by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a year ago. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. The case, one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America. Mr. Trump's team will be looking for red needles in a blue haystack.\nMr. Trump has twice sought Justice Merchan's recusal, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. Justice Merchan has declined to step aside, noting a ruling by a judicial ethics commission that found his daughter's work posed no conflict for him. 'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said in court on Monday, adding, 'we want to follow the law, we want justice to be done.' Mr. Trump has also attacked the judge's daughter on social media.\nHundreds of potential jurors have been summoned. Those who say they cannot be fair or otherwise serve are being excused, and the remaining prospective jurors will answer 42 questions compiled before the trial. Lawyers on both sides will be able to remove a limited number of them without explanation. The lawyers can also ask to remove a potential juror 'for cause' by providing specific reasons they believe that person cannot be fair. In addition to the payment to Ms. Daniels, Mr. Bragg's office is expected to highlight two other deals involving The National Enquirer, a tabloid that has longstanding ties to Mr. Trump. In one deal, the tabloid bought the silence of a man who had heard that Mr. Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock, a rumor that turned out to be false, and in the other, it paid Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, who wanted to sell her story of an affair with Mr. Trump.\nThe prosecution's witness list is expected to include David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, as well as Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal could also testify. Prospective jurors will answer a uniform set of questions aimed at discerning bias for or against the former president. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Follow our live coverage of Trump's hush money trial . The hundreds of New Yorkers who report for jury duty Monday morning in Manhattan will embark on an experience not found in history books: They will be vetted as jurors for the trial of a former U.S. president. The task won't be easy. Lawyers for Donald J. Trump and prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney's office will narrow the pool to 12 jurors and several alternates. Both sides will try to discern biases that could alter the outcome of the trial, posing dozens of questions that have been discussed and debated for weeks. The jurors, for their part, will be expected to answer each question honestly in an intimidating environment, just steps away from the former president, who is expected to attend much of the trial. Here's what we know about the process: The jury pool is composed of Manhattanites. Beyond that, little about the group is known, even by prosecutors and defense lawyers. Both sides will use the next several days, or weeks, to find out all they can. Because New York State does not allow juries to operate in full anonymity, the parties, including the former president, will know the jurors' names. The lawyers will also have access to their addresses. (Mr. Trump will not.) The public may never know the jurors' names. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, granted the prosecutors' request to withhold them. After reading a summary of the allegations, Justice Merchan will ask the prospective jurors whether they believe they can be fair and impartial. They will also be asked if they have any scheduling conflicts that would prevent them from attending every day of the trial, which could last more than six weeks. Those who raise concerns will most likely be removed from the pool. The jurors who remain will all be asked the same set of questions. One by one, they will talk \u2014 briefly and vaguely \u2014 about what they do for a living, their education and their families. They will be asked where they get their news, what radio and podcasts they listen to and whether they've read books written by Mr. Trump or his former fixer Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be a central witness. Other questions will be more pointed. Jurors will be asked if they've ever volunteered or attended a campaign event for Mr. Trump or one of his opponents. They will also be asked to divulge feelings or opinions they have about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case. But the jurors will not be asked how they voted in past elections, whom they plan to vote for, whether they have made political contributions or their party registration. Mr. Trump's legal team and prosecutors for the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, can challenge the inclusion of prospective jurors by providing specific reasons they believe a juror cannot be fair and impartial. The judge has the final say. Both sides will also receive a certain number of chances to remove jurors without explanation. After all of the challenged jurors are removed from the jury pool, Justice Merchan will seat the jury with those who remain. If Mr. Trump's behavior at previous trials is any guide, he is likely to be very involved in jury selection. In a previous defamation case, Mr. Trump was fixated on the jurors from the moment they walked into the courtroom. He pivoted in his chair to study them as they answered biographical questions. He frequently talked to his attorneys. But Mr. Trump's comments about the jurors in this case should start and stop in the courtroom. In addition to being ordered not to reveal their names, Mr. Trump is also subject to a gag order issued by Justice Merchan preventing him from making public statements about them.  \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nDonald J. Trump's lawyers faced an uphill battle Monday with Justice Juan M. Merchan, a no-nonsense jurist. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab courtroom in New York City while Mr. Trump looked on.\nMr. Trump was charged in Manhattan, a deeply Democratic county and his former home, with falsifying nearly three dozen business records in an attempt to cover up a payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, who has said she had a brief sexual encounter with him in 2006.\nMr. Trump denies that encounter happened, and has declared his innocence, calling the charges politically motivated. He has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a Democrat, who also attended the first day of trial on Monday.\nMr. Trump faces 34 felony counts and could face probation or up to four years of prison time.\nThe trial, which is expected to last weeks, has a fascinating list of potential witnesses: Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer turned apostate, who made the payment; Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who says she, too, had an affair with Mr. Trump; and Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels herself may testify.\nBefore any of that happens, a jury must be selected, a winnowing that began Monday.\nHere are five takeaways from Mr. Trump's first day on trial:\nJustice Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, has been consistent about batting back defense motions on issues including the tardy disclosure of documents by prosecutors and efforts to delay or even dismiss the case.\nThat pattern continued on Monday, as Justice Merchan rejected a defense effort to force his recusal. The defense had cited several issues, including the fact that his daughter is a Democratic political consultant.\nHe also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost.\nBut Mr. Trump's lawyers convinced Justice Merchan that sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the so-called Access Hollywood tape, in which Mr. Trump was caught bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial, calling them 'complete rumors, complete gossip, completely hearsay.'\nJustice Merchan's decisions on Monday made it clear that the trial will resurface unsavory events in the former president's life.\nThose include the Access Hollywood tape and other stories that Mr. Trump sought to suppress including an alleged affair with Ms. McDougal. Justice Merchan said on Monday that both could be discussed.\nIn a minor victory for the defense, the judge reaffirmed that the 'Access Hollywood' tape itself could not be played, but that Trump's exact words could be entered into the record.\nStill, most of Mr. Merchan's rulings indicated that salacious details of Mr. Trump's biography will be heard in court.\nEntering the courtroom, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here.'\nOnce he was in front of Mr. Merchan, Mr. Trump looked a lot less enthusiastic. He slouched. He scowled. He scoffed. And he was quiet, not the norm for a man who built a political career with his gift for slashing attacks and vicious put-downs.\nIn court, the former president spoke only briefly, when asked a few questions by Justice Merchan about procedural matters, and whether he understood the consequences \u2014 ejection or jail \u2014 if he interrupted proceedings. He did whisper with his lawyers. And when the prosecution played a recording of him claiming to have great respect for women, he mouthed the word 'true.'\nBut all in all, it seems it could be an exhausting experience for Mr. Trump; at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep.\nIt's easy to forget how long it takes to do a little in legal settings. On Monday, the morning session was dominated by maneuvering by prosecutors and the defense, even as prospective jurors waited. By lunch, they were still waiting.\nJury selection could take days or weeks, and the trial itself may take two months. The Passover holiday could cause delays, Justice Merchan said, though he might make some of that up by holding hearings on court matters on Wednesdays, which was previously going to be an off day.\nBy afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into Justice Merchan's courtroom. He warmly welcomed them, introduced the lawyers and Mr. Trump and read them a summary of the case.\nJustice Merchan asked if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president. Of the 96 prospective jurors in the room at that time, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused.\nThe remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.\nApril 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET Trump spoke briefly to TV cameras after court adjourned for the day, repeating his longstanding claims that the trial is a 'political witch hunt' before heading to his motorcade and departing the courthouse.\nVideo Reporter: [inaudible] the trial \u2014 [inaudible] So thank you very much. We had some amazing things happen today. As you know, my son is graduating from high school and it looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation of my son, who's worked very, very hard. He's a great student and he's very proud of the fact that he did so well. And was looking forward for years to have his graduation with his mother and father there. And it looks like the judges isn't going to allow me to escape this scam. It's a scam trial. If you read all of the legal pundits, all of the legal scholars today, there's not one that I see that said, this is a case that should be brought or tried. It's a scam.

Another prospective juror, a nurse, said that she received Trump's emails several years ago but that she 'unsubscribed.'\nLaura Loomer appeared outside the Manhattan courthouse on Monday. Credit... DavidAs former President Donald J. Trump's first criminal trial began inside a Manhattan courthouse on Monday, the scene outside had elements of a feisty political skirmish and a surreal circus rolled into one.\nThe streets below the courtroom drew a mix of gawkers, activists and publicity hounds, along with a large contingent of journalists.\nLaura Loomer, a right-wing activist known for her aggressive tactics and closeness with Mr. Trump, led a chant of 'Donald Trump Did Nothing Wrong!' alongside Andrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and Trump lawyer.\n'We're going to be here every single day talking to all you fake-news media freaks,' Ms. Loomer said through a Harvey Milk-style bullhorn in a video she posted on social media. 'And letting you know that Donald Trump did nothing wrong until you start reporting the truth.'\nMs. Loomer described the case as a 'witch hunt' \u2014 a frequent assertion of Mr. Trump's \u2014 and criticized a key witness for the prosecution, Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, and the wife of the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan.\nMr. Trump promptly reposted the video on Truth Social \u2014 despite a gag order that bars him from attacking witnesses in the case or Justice Merchan's family. His post, made during the lunch break, came shortly before Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month on prosecutors' request that Mr. Trump be held in contempt of court over statements they say violate the order.\nPerformance artists also vied for attention. One, known as Crackhead Barney, stood screaming outside the gates surrounding Collect Pond Park that she had been kicked out, and demanded police officers' badge numbers. Another played the flute atop a park bench, notes drifting through the wind and his instrument glinting in the sunlight.\nSome anti-Trump demonstrators held handmade signs emblazoned with 'Loser' and 'Convict Trump Already,' while others tried to confront Ms. Loomer. One, Sue Scarlett Montgomery, asked reporters why they were paying attention to Ms. Loomer, a former Republican candidate for Congress who previously visited a treacherous migrant crossing in Panama as part of her anti-Muslim activism.\n'They're covering me because I broke the story about this corrupt judge here,' Ms. Loomer shot back, attacking Judge Merchan's daughter, a Democratic political consultant who has also been a target of Mr. Trump.\nApril 15, 2024, 4:15 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 4:15 p.m. ET The latest potential juror to be questioned reads The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, but is also the first person to say they are a New York Post reader.

Merchan, who is presiding over the case, read aloud to the prospective jurors a list of people who might serve as witnesses or be mentioned during the trial, asking them whether they recognized the names. Many of those names were indeed very recognizable.\nAmong those who could come up during the trial were Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump's former adviser, and Rudolph W.

Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate.\nThe potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair.\nThe process could take two weeks or more \u2014 and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court.\n'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.'\nThe stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County \u2014 Manhattan, as most people know it \u2014 which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020.\nMr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions.\nMr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated.\nProsecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28.\nUnlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.'\nSome may not be completely forthcoming.\n'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said.\nMr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors.\n'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J.

Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted Monday morning, as his lawyers and prosecutors hashed out pretrial motions before jury selection in his criminal case.\nEven as a judge was hearing arguments on last-minute issues in a criminal case that centers on salacious allegations and threatens to upend his bid for the presidency, Mr. Trump appeared to nod off a few times, his mouth going slack and his head drooping onto his chest.\nThe former president's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, passed him notes for several minutes before Mr. Trump appeared to jolt awake and notice them.\nAt other times, Mr. Trump whispered and exchanged notes with Mr. Blanche. He sat motionless while his own words from the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape \u2014 on which bragged about grabbing women's genitals \u2014 were read from a transcript by a prosecutor.\nAt times, Mr. Trump's emotions were characteristically on display. He smirked and scoffed, and appeared frustrated when the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, did not immediately agree that he could miss court to attend the graduation of his youngest son, Barron.\nBut when Justice Merchan warned that Mr. Trump could be ejected or thrown in jail if he disrupts the proceedings, the former president indicated that he understood.\nThe only time Mr. Trump showed a flash of humor was when he laughed at one of his own social media posts, which attacked his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be the prosecution's central witness.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J. Trump's comments on the 'Access Hollywood' tape will allowed to be introduced as evidence. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times The judge in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial on Monday again refused to allow the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape to be played for jurors, but said that the comments Mr. Trump made on the tape could be introduced as evidence.\nOn the tape, revealed in The Washington Post about a month before Mr. Trump was elected president in 2016, he is heard bragging about grabbing women's genitals, saying he could do so with abandon because 'when you're a star, they let you do it.'\n'You can do anything,' Mr. Trump said on the recording.\nThe tape rocked Mr. Trump's campaign. And prosecutors in Manhattan say it led him to agree to pay off Stormy Daniels, a porn star, who was shopping a story of a 2006 sexual encounter with the candidate.\nMichael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, paid Ms. Daniels $130,000. The payment is at the heart of the 34 felony charges against Mr. Trump, who is accused of falsifying business records to cover it up.\nThe judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, had previously ruled that prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office could question witnesses about the tape, but found that it would be prejudicial to allow the actual video to the played. He reaffirmed that ruling on Monday.\n'You can bring out what was said in the tape,' Justice Merchan said, adding that he didn't want jurors 'to hear Mr. Trump's voice and his gestures' in the tape.\nIn a victory for the defense, the judge also ruled that the prosecution could not introduce evidence about sexual assault allegations against Mr. Trump that surfaced in the aftermath of the tape becoming public, calling them 'complete hearsay.'\nHowever, Justice Merchan said that prosecutors could introduce emails that followed the tape's disclosure, showing frantic efforts by Trump advisers to contain the fallout. The correspondence, he said, 'bolsters the people's claim that this was a crucial event.'\nTodd Blanche, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, had called on Justice Merchan to reconsider admitting 'this extremely salacious evidence,' which he described as 'very prejudicial.'\nMr. Trump, who is again the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has denied any wrongdoing and has cast the case against him as politically motivated.\nJustice Juan M. Merchan has already reprimanded Donald J. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Inside a dreary Lower Manhattan courtroom on a recent Wednesday, Justice Juan M. Merchan convened a special session for people with mental health troubles who had landed in legal jeopardy. He calmly counseled them, praised any signs of progress and shook the hand of one man who, thanks to medication, had turned his life around.\nBut a different type of criminal defendant is now testing the judge's equanimity: Donald J. Trump.\nMr. Trump's trial on charges that he covered up a sex scandal before and after the 2016 presidential election will bring a maelstrom that no other judge in New York's vast judiciary has ever experienced.\nKnown as a no-nonsense, drama-averse jurist, Justice Merchan, 61, has already reprimanded Mr. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous and issued a gag order intended to protect prosecutors, witnesses and his own family from Mr. Trump's vitriol \u2014 and yet the former president has continued to post articles with pictures of the judge's daughter, a political consultant who has worked with Democratic candidates.\nAlthough Justice Merchan is a registered Democrat, records show he was previously a Republican, and people who know him described the judge as a moderate, law-and-order former prosecutor.\nTwo people close to Justice Merchan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the judge had privately expressed pain over the attacks on his daughter, but the people said that those attacks won't compromise his ability to oversee the case. Other people who know the judge said that he will cast aside Mr. Trump's drama \u2014 and exert control over the trial.\n'It is Judge Merchan's show,' said Jill Konviser, a retired judge who has known Justice Merchan for more than 15 years. She added: 'He will do everything he can to, one, control his courtroom and two, ensure a fair trial for the defendant.'\nIn Justice Merchan's 17 years on the bench, 13 as presiding judge in the Mental Health Court he created, he has had his share of unusual cases. There was a murder trial involving a supposed curse on the defendant; the daredevils who jumped off the World Trade Center with parachutes; and a so-called soccer-mom madam accused of running a high-end brothel on the Upper East Side. In that case, an appeals court reduced the steep bail Justice Merchan had set, calling it 'unreasonable.'\nNone of those defendants challenged the judge quite like Mr. Trump, who claims that the case is a witch hunt and declared that Justice Merchan's gag order had infringed on his First Amendment rights.\nThe former president has tested the order's limits by posting articles that named and attacked Justice Merchan's daughter, Loren, and his wife, Lara. The articles, by the conservative activist Laura Loomer, included photos of Loren Merchan and copies of a 2007 mortgage statement for a house owned by Justice Merchan and his wife. Previously, Mr. Trump falsely accused Loren Merchan of posting an image of him behind bars on social media.\nThe trial, which could last two months as a parade of former aides and allies takes the stand against him, will dominate Justice Merchan's calendar this spring.\nOn off-days, he will continue to preside over Mental Health Court. The program is for defendants charged with felonies and diagnosed with a serious mental illness. People who are accepted enter a guilty plea and then begin a period of treatment and judicial supervision. Those who complete the program successfully can have their charges reduced or dismissed.\nDuring one recent session, Justice Merchan showed particular interest in the relationship between a defendant and his child, and praised him for his dedication.\n'You want to do better by your daughter,' Justice Merchan said. 'I'm sure she's going to appreciate that.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Donald J. Trump has repeatedly tried to have Juan M. Merchan removed as the judge in his case. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Juan M. Merchan, the judge overseeing Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan, has declined to step aside from the case, rejecting the former president's effort to delay the trial and attack his integrity.\nThe judge announced the decision in the opening minutes of Mr. Trump's trial on Monday morning. After Justice Merchan rules on a variety of legal issues, the trial will begin in earnest with jury selection.\n'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said Monday before rejecting the request. 'We want to follow the law,' he added. 'We want justice to be done.'\nMr. Trump's lawyers had called on Justice Merchan to recuse himself in a recent court filing, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant.\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case that accuses Mr. Trump of falsifying records to conceal a sex scandal from voters, had argued that no conflict of interest existed. And judicial ethics experts cast doubt on Mr. Trump's request, noting that the judge was not responsible for his daughter's career.\nIt was just the latest attempt by Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to both delay the trial and oust Justice Merchan. Nor will it be the last: In a separate civil action filed last week, Mr. Trump asked an appeals court to pause the case while it considers whether to remove Justice Merchan. It is a long-shot bid that a single appeals court judge rejected and will be likely to fail before a full five-judge panel.\nWhen Mr. Trump tried last year to have Justice Merchan kicked off the case, Justice Merchan rejected it then as well, citing a state advisory committee on judicial ethics that determined that his impartiality could not reasonably be questioned based on his daughter's interests.\nThe repeated attempts reflect the former president's long-running effort to delay all four of his criminal cases past Election Day. Stalling is one of Mr. Trump's favored legal tactics, and he uses it liberally in Manhattan, as well as in the three other cities where he faces criminal charges. If Mr. Trump reclaims the White House, the criminal cases against him would most likely grind to a halt.\nIn the attempt in appeals court to compel the judge's recusal, Emil Bove, a lawyer for the former president, argued that certain facts had changed since Justice Merchan first declined to step aside last year, including that Mr. Trump was now the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\nBut a lawyer for the court system, Lisa Evans, said that there was no reason that the judge should step aside.\n'There is absolutely no evidence to show that Judge Merchan will stand to benefit from the outcome of this trial,' Ms. Evans said.\nVideo transcript\nTrump Supporters Rally Outside New York Courthouse Pro-Trump protesters gathered near the Manhattan courthouse where the former president's criminal trial is taking place.

Trump was set to go on trial were buzzing with anticipation on Monday morning as a crush of reporters \u2014 and a trickle of protesters \u2014 gathered to bear witness.\nRight-wing activists were planning rallies in the park directly opposite the court, which was subject to a heavy police presence. Some journalists and line-sitters had arrived late Sunday night, staking out places in the line to secure limited spaces inside the court's overflow room, where most reporters were gathered.\nCameras lined the sidewalks outside the courthouse, a glowering edifice at 100 Centre Street, just blocks from New York's City Hall. TV crews were going live in intervals since before dawn, even as the police manned metal barricades. As the sun rose, some anti-Trump demonstrators had arrived, including one toting a sign reading 'Loser,' a favorite insult of the former president.\nNadine Seiler, 58, took a midnight bus from Waldorf, Md., to get to the courthouse by dawn. 'This is the first and possibly only trial he's going to be on,' she said, holding up a spray-painted sheet reading 'Convict Trump Already.'\nMr. Trump also had fans outside the courthouse, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist who argued with an anti-Trump protester as a gaggle of journalists surrounded them.\nAndrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City and lawyer for Mr. Trump, also came by to show support, arguing that the trial was a political persecution.\n'He's somebody who I consider to be a mentor, almost like an uncle to me,' said Mr. Giuliani.\nNoting Mr. Trump's status as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Mr. Giuliani claimed: 'They want to tie him up for months at a time.'\nOthers were simply there to witness the moment. 'I think it's a really difficult moment in American history,' said Sue Scarlett Montgomery, a filmmaker. 'It's a sad day, but here we are.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT The first criminal trial of an American president officially began on Monday as prosecutors and defense lawyers convened in a Manhattan courtroom to start selecting the jury that will decide Donald J. Trump's fate.\nThe initial pool of prospective jurors dwindled rapidly. More than half of the first group of 96 were dismissed in short order after indicating that they did not believe they could be impartial. Court adjourned for the day roughly two hours after jury selection began, with zero jurors chosen.\nBefore beginning the arduous process of choosing a jury for the landmark trial \u2014 on allegations that Mr. Trump falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star \u2014 the judge overseeing the case once again declined to step aside, rejecting Mr. Trump's latest effort to oust him.\nBut there was also a ruling that favored the former president: The judge, Juan M. Merchan, rejected a request by prosecutors to introduce accusations of sexual assault that women lodged against Mr. Trump years ago, calling them 'rumors' and 'complete gossip.'\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case against Mr. Trump, also asked the judge to hold Mr. Trump in contempt and penalize him $3,000 for violating a gag order barring him from attacking witnesses in the case.\nOn social media over the weekend, Mr. Trump assailed one of the prosecution's key witnesses: Michael D. Cohen, his former fixer. Mr. Cohen paid $130,000 to the porn star, Stormy Daniels, during the 2016 presidential campaign to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she said she had with Mr. Trump.\nAfter the lunch break \u2014 during which Mr. Trump posted a video of an ally yelling about the judge's wife \u2014 Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month to discuss potential violations of the gag order, which also bars Mr. Trump from attacking the judge's family.\nThe jury selection process could take two weeks or more, and the trial may spill into June. Mr. Trump is expected to be in the courtroom for much of it.\nMr. Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted during pretrial arguments on Monday, sometimes smirking and scoffing, but also appearing to nod off, his mouth slack and his head drooping to his chest. After the trial got underway in the afternoon, he chuckled when Justice Merchan told the first group of 96 prospective jurors that he would ensure a fair trial.\nMr. Trump, who might take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied the sexual encounter with Ms. Daniels. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records to hide the reimbursements to Mr. Cohen. They argue the payment to Ms. Daniels was part of a pattern: Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election.\nHere's what else to know about Mr. Trump's trial:\nThis is the Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump, and it was brought by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a year ago. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. The case, one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America. Mr. Trump's team will be looking for red needles in a blue haystack.\nMr. Trump has twice sought Justice Merchan's recusal, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. Justice Merchan has declined to step aside, noting a ruling by a judicial ethics commission that found his daughter's work posed no conflict for him. 'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said in court on Monday, adding, 'we want to follow the law, we want justice to be done.' Mr. Trump has also attacked the judge's daughter on social media.\nHundreds of potential jurors have been summoned. Those who say they cannot be fair or otherwise serve are being excused, and the remaining prospective jurors will answer 42 questions compiled before the trial. Lawyers on both sides will be able to remove a limited number of them without explanation. The lawyers can also ask to remove a potential juror 'for cause' by providing specific reasons they believe that person cannot be fair.\nIn addition to the payment to Ms. Daniels, Mr. Bragg's office is expected to highlight two other deals involving The National Enquirer, a tabloid that has longstanding ties to Mr. Trump. In one deal, the tabloid bought the silence of a man who had heard that Mr. Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock, a rumor that turned out to be false, and in the other, it paid Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, who wanted to sell her story of an affair with Mr. Trump.\nThe prosecution's witness list is expected to include David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, as well as Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal could also testify.\nProspective jurors will answer a uniform set of questions aimed at discerning bias for or against the former president. Credit...

The hundreds of New Yorkers who report for jury duty Monday morning in Manhattan will embark on an experience not found in history books: They will be vetted as jurors for the trial of a former U.S. president.\nThe task won't be easy. Lawyers for Donald J. Trump and prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney's office will narrow the pool to 12 jurors and several alternates. Both sides will try to discern biases that could alter the outcome of the trial, posing dozens of questions that have been discussed and debated for weeks.\nThe jurors, for their part, will be expected to answer each question honestly in an intimidating environment, just steps away from the former president, who is expected to attend much of the trial.\nHere's what we know about the process:\nThe jury pool is composed of Manhattanites. Beyond that, little about the group is known, even by prosecutors and defense lawyers. Both sides will use the next several days, or weeks, to find out all they can.\nBecause New York State does not allow juries to operate in full anonymity, the parties, including the former president, will know the jurors' names. The lawyers will also have access to their addresses. (Mr. Trump will not.)\nThe public may never know the jurors' names. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, granted the prosecutors' request to withhold them.\nAfter reading a summary of the allegations, Justice Merchan will ask the prospective jurors whether they believe they can be fair and impartial. They will also be asked if they have any scheduling conflicts that would prevent them from attending every day of the trial, which could last more than six weeks. Those who raise concerns will most likely be removed from the pool.\nThe jurors who remain will all be asked the same set of questions. One by one, they will talk \u2014 briefly and vaguely \u2014 about what they do for a living, their education and their families. They will be asked where they get their news, what radio and podcasts they listen to and whether they've read books written by Mr. Trump or his former fixer Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be a central witness.\nOther questions will be more pointed. Jurors will be asked if they've ever volunteered or attended a campaign event for Mr. Trump or one of his opponents. They will also be asked to divulge feelings or opinions they have about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case.\nBut the jurors will not be asked how they voted in past elections, whom they plan to vote for, whether they have made political contributions or their party registration.\nMr. Trump's legal team and prosecutors for the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, can challenge the inclusion of prospective jurors by providing specific reasons they believe a juror cannot be fair and impartial. The judge has the final say.\nBoth sides will also receive a certain number of chances to remove jurors without explanation. After all of the challenged jurors are removed from the jury pool, Justice Merchan will seat the jury with those who remain.\nIf Mr. Trump's behavior at previous trials is any guide, he is likely to be very involved in jury selection. In a previous defamation case, Mr. Trump was fixated on the jurors from the moment they walked into the courtroom. He pivoted in his chair to study them as they answered biographical questions. He frequently talked to his attorneys.\nBut Mr. Trump's comments about the jurors in this case should start and stop in the courtroom. In addition to being ordered not to reveal their names, Mr. Trump is also subject to a gag order issued by Justice Merchan preventing him from making public statements about them.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ben Protess,Jonah E.

Trump. Shortly before noon, lawyers began directly questioning the first group of prospective jurors to make it through initial queries. Questions involved their opinions on campaign finance law and on the trial's potential witnesses, including a porn star and a tabloid publisher. Earlier, some prospective jurors who had previously indicated that they would be able to be impartial had changed their minds after taking a night to think about it. 'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I hoped I could be,' one admitted. He was excused. It could take two weeks or more to pick the 12 jurors who will decide the case, which centers on allegations that the former president falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star, Stormy Daniels. The pool of possible jurors being scrutinized on Tuesday came from an initial group of 96, dozens of whom were dismissed immediately on Monday after indicating that they felt they could not fairly reach a decision. The dismissals underscored the difficulty of picking a jury in a city where the defendant is widely reviled. Mr. Trump, who may take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied all wrongdoing. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records that hid reimbursements to his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who had paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to buy her silence. Prosecutors say that Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election. Here's what to know about the case: The case was brought a year ago by Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. It is one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, but may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nA day after Mr. Trump appeared to nod off during pretrial motions, he was back at the defense table. He appeared somewhat bored as the jury selection process continued, with prospective jurors responding to a series of mostly yes or no questions.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America.\nMr. Trump has repeatedly complained that the case is a politically motivated witch hunt and has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and his family, as well as key witnesses, including Mr. Cohen. Justice Merchan has imposed a gag order on Mr. Trump that bars him from attacking witnesses, jurors, prosecutors or the judge's family. Even before the trial began on Monday, prosecutors asked Justice Merchan to hold the former president in contempt of court over social media posts about Mr. Cohen; the judge said he would hold a hearing later this month.

Asked about the fairness of Trump being on trial in Manhattan, where he's an unpopular figure, Adams replied, 'That is beyond my pay grade.' But, he added, 'This city is a fair city.'

Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, accused Donald J. Trump of falsifying business records connected to a hush money payment to a porn star. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony counts. Credit Credit... Andrew Seng for The New York Times All 34 felony counts at the center of the Manhattan criminal case against former President Donald J. Trump stem from a $130,000 hush-money payment handed over to a porn star in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign. The specific charges are far less titillating: falsifying business records in the first degree. But a conviction could still result in jail time. The payment was made by Mr. Trump's fixer, Michael D. Cohen, to Stormy Daniels in order to buy her silence about a sexual liaison she said she had with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump directed him to make the payment. Paying hush money is not illegal. But while serving as the commander in chief, prosecutors say, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen in a manner that constituted fraud: In internal records, Mr. Trump's company classified the reimbursement as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet there were no such expenses, according to prosecutors, who say the agreement was also fictional. Those records underpin the 34 counts of falsifying business records: 11 involve the checks, 11 center on monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted to the company and 12 involve entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust. Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing. In announcing the charges a year ago, Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, said that his office must keep a close eye on how companies conduct business in New York. 'This is the business capital of the world,' Mr. Bragg said. 'We regularly do cases involving false business statements. The bedrock \u2014 in fact, the basis for business integrity and a well-functioning business marketplace \u2014 is true and accurate record-keeping.' The charges against Mr. Trump are all Class E felonies, the lowest category in New York. Each count carries a maximum prison sentence of four years. Nothing in the law requires the judge, Juan E. Merchan, to imprison Mr. Trump if the jury convicts him. The judge could instead sentence him to probation. But Justice Merchan has made it clear that he takes white-collar crime seriously and could put Mr. Trump behind bars. It's possible, however, if Mr. Trump is convicted of more than one count, Justice Merchan would impose a concurrent sentence, under which Mr. Trump would serve all time simultaneously. Key Players in the Trump Criminal Trial \u203a  April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET Olivia Bensimon Reporting from outside the courthouse Journalists still vastly outnumber the Trump supporters who have gathered near the courthouse today. One man's Stars and Stripes flag flaps in the breeze, two other people are sitting on benches. Neighborhood workers on their lunch breaks bask in the spring sun. Jury selection is often a lengthy process, but in the first criminal trial of a former American president, currently taking place in a Manhattan criminal courthouse, it's going more slowly than normal. In part, that is because of the nature of the case: Jurors, once seated, will be asked to decide whether Donald J. Trump committed a crime. Prosecutors have charged him with 34 felonies, accusing him of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal that could have hurt his first presidential run. But the process has been particularly drawn-out because, once would-be jurors say they can be fair and impartial, they are being asked a series of 42 questions. After that, they face additional scrutiny from lawyers for the prosecution and the defense. Here are the 42 questions: 1. Without telling us your address, in what neighborhood do you live? For example, Upper East Side, Lower East Side, Inwood, etc. How long have you lived there? Are you a native New Yorker? If not, where did you live previously? 2. What do you do for a living?

Is there any reason, whether it be a bias or something else, that would prevent you from being fair and impartial if you are selected as a juror for this case? New York State makes no provision for anonymous juries, even in a case as sensitive as this one. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Last month, Justice Juan M. Merchan ordered that prospective jurors' names would be shielded from the public, underscoring the need for privacy for those who may decide Donald J. Trump's criminal fate \u2014 and tempt the anger of his followers. Yet on the first two days of jury selection, several prospective jurors revealed potentially identifying information, reflecting the difficulty of having an anonymous jury in a case with an intense media spotlight. On the first day, a woman said she worked for a city agency of approximately 500 people and revealed its name. Later, a man who identified himself as a bookseller revealed the name of the small store where he works. This continued on Tuesday when others revealed the names of employers. While some worked for companies that were large, where the potential jurors could likely remain unidentifiable, others were less cautious. One woman revealed the name of the three-person company she owns with her husband. Justice Merchan did not interject as the prospective jurors divulged the information, nor did he caution them against doing so. Juries are not completely anonymous in New York State. Mr. Trump, his lawyers and the prosecutors have access to the names of the prospective jurors. But after a request by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, Justice Merchan decided to withhold the names from the public. Mr. Trump did not oppose the request. The accidental self-identifications are a notable departure from how federal Judge Lewis A. Kaplan conducted jury selection in Mr. Trump's defamation trial in January, brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. In the federal system, jurors are allowed to remain anonymous, even to parties in the case. Before potential jurors answered basic questions about their backgrounds, Judge Kaplan instructed them not to reveal personal information. 'Don't give us anything that could enable anybody to pin you down geographically,' he said. He also cautioned them not to reveal their names to each other, and when the trial concluded, he left them with these ominous words: 'My advice to you is that you never disclose that you were on this jury,' Judge Kaplan said. 'And I won't say anything more about it.'

Justice Merchan knows the importance of getting this little piece of the process right: an appeals court two years ago overturned a conviction in a case he presided over when a defendant did not appear at an important sidebar, and the defendant hadn't waived the right to do so.

We are running 5 to 7 minutes per person. The very premise of the trial is that prosecutors believe Donald J. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times Donald J. Trump first ran for president nearly a decade ago. Now, as he runs again in a political climate that he helped create, his Manhattan criminal trial is partly a referendum on his tactics during that first campaign. The trial's very premise is that prosecutors believe Mr. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign \u2014 sex scandals involving a porn star and a Playboy model, for example \u2014 he concealed them, the prosecutors say. But in a development that will bolster their case, prosecutors on Monday secured permission from the judge to admit evidence connected to Mr. Trump's overall political strategy in 2016. Much of it bears the former president's imprint: aggressive tweets, false denials, coordination with a tabloid publisher and more. The judge's ruling showed how the weapons that worked so well for Mr. Trump then are being turned against him in the courtroom now. The techniques prosecutors highlighted Monday were not invented by Mr. Trump for use in his campaign; they are behaviors he exhibited throughout his life as a businessman and a reality-television star. But in modern American political history, such raw tactics had rarely been seen at such a high level. One example is Mr. Trump's relationship with The National Enquirer tabloid and its publisher, David Pecker, who is expected to appear as a witness. The Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case, obtained permission from the judge on Monday to introduce evidence related to a 2015 meeting among Mr. Trump, Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump's former fixer, Michael D. Cohen. A prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, said on Monday that the three men had 'conspired to influence the 2016 election.' That meeting laid the groundwork for hush-money deals with a porn star, Stormy Daniels, and a Playboy model, Karen McDougal. But another result of that meeting, Mr. Steinglass said, were explosive headlines about Mr. Trump's opponents in the Republican primary, including those claiming that Ben Carson had committed 'medical malpractice' and that Senator Ted Cruz had a 'family connection to J.F.K.'s assassin.' A lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, protested the admission of evidence related to that meeting, saying that newspaper publishers met with candidates 'all the time,' and that there was nothing improper about it, let alone illegal. That admission worked against him. The judge, Juan M. Merchan, said that he was glad that Mr. Blanche believed that there was nothing wrong with the meeting \u2014 because it meant that he should not mind that the evidence would be introduced. 'There is no reason not to allow it in,' Justice Merchan said. Mr. Steinglass won again when he persuaded Justice Merchan to admit evidence of the Trump campaign in crisis after the publication in 2016 of the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump boasted about grabbing women by their genitals. 'The video sent the campaign into a tailspin,' Mr. Steinglass said. He offered up an email sent by a Washington Post reporter to Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump's campaign spokeswoman. Mr. Steinglass said that Ms. Hicks had forwarded the exchange to Stephen K. Bannon, Kellyanne Conway and other members of the campaign team, 'suggesting that their response should be to deny, deny, deny.' Eventually, he said, Mr. Bannon sent it to Mr. Cohen. Mr. Blanche again protested, but was again rebuffed. The judge said he would allow jurors to see the email, saying that the ensuing thread was relevant. The exchanges that prosecutors and defense lawyers debated on Monday underscored Mr. Trump's penchant for delegating dirty work to others, giving himself some distance in the process. The hush-money deals worked that way: Mr. Cohen paid off Ms. Daniels, while The National Enquirer bought Ms. McDougal's silence. (Mr. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to his reimbursement of Mr. Cohen.) That habit is still on display this year, and can be helpful given that Justice Merchan has barred Mr. Trump from attacking witnesses, prosecutors and the judge's own family. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump posted on social media a video of Laura Loomer, a political ally, in the park outside the courthouse. Ms. Loomer, speaking into a bullhorn, insinuated that the judge's family was politically compromised. Had Mr. Trump said that himself, he would have risked violating the judge's gag order.

But a few of those who have made it to this stage have realized while answering questions that they may have a tougher time than they thought. One prospective juror just admitted: 'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I hoped I could be.' He was excused.

Occasionally he fidgets, appears to write notes, whispers to his lawyer and at one point examined his tie. He largely stares ahead, not looking in the direction of the prospective jurors. But his glare fixates on the jury box when prospective jurors bring up conflicts, including a woman who said she realized overnight that she could not be impartial and unbiased.

On Tuesday, the spectacle of the first trial of a president was fading into New York's usual urban bustle. Credit... Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The scene outside Manhattan's Criminal Court on Tuesday morning was placid \u2014 by New York standards \u2014 after the tense crush on the first day of Donald J. Trump's trial. On Monday, cable news stations had staked out every concrete surface bordering Centre Street. On Tuesday, there were swaths of open ground in the space reserved for media organizations. As the sun rose and workers in Collect Pond Park removed overflowing trash cans around 5:30 a.m., only five people were in the line for those holding official passes for entry. In the line for the general public were some familiar faces among court-watchers, including Ron Sinibaldi, whose hobbies include following high-profile cases. He's previously attended proceedings involving Senator Robert Menendez, who is accused of taking bribes, and New Jersey officials involved in closing the George Washington Bridge as political retribution. Everyday street scenes played out nearby. Around 7 a.m., a lone man fed pigeons in the park, which was sparsely populated by the time Mr. Trump's motorcade arrived nearly two hours later. An exception: one older man holding up a red Trump 2024 flag and shouting at television reporters: 'Fight! Fight! Fight for Donald Trump!' Shortly after, a line of young children toddled through, flanked by teacher's aides and clutching a rope, their neon orange vests a pop of color. Anusha Bayya contributed reporting.

One of the prospective jurors who was next to answer questions was experiencing flu-like symptoms and was sent home. Two other jurors, who answered questions yesterday, are running late. Justice Merchan has decided to proceed without them for now but will keep them in the larger jury pool.

Justice Merchan kindly reminded them to be on time going forward.  In court Monday, former President Donald J. Trump scowled and scoffed, and apparently slept. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab New York City courtroom as Mr. Trump looked on. Before jury selection began, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, rejected another effort to force his recusal by the defense, which cited several issues, including his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. He also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost. But Mr. Trump's lawyers did persuade Justice Merchan that mentioning sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump was recorded bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial. Entering the courtroom Monday, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here,' but he looked less enthusiastic in front of Justice Merchan. He quietly slouched and scowled \u2014 and at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep. By afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into the courtroom. Some quickly left: When the judge asked the first group of 96 if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused. The remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.   The jury selection process in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan could take two weeks or more. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Lawyers representing the State of New York and Donald J. Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate. The potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair. The process could take two weeks or more \u2014 and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court. 'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.' The stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County \u2014 Manhattan, as most people know it \u2014 which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020. Mr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated. Prosecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28. Unlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.' Some may not be completely forthcoming. 'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said. Mr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors. 'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'  Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Not since Eugene V. Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning. Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases: two federal, one in New York and another in Georgia. The first of those to go to trial is the sex scandal cover-up in New York, where jury selection began on Monday. For now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, beyond having to be present in a courtroom, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But some of the cases are proceeding at a pace that could bring verdicts before the election \u2014 and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that will arise if he is convicted. Others would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges. Here is what we know, and what we don't know. This is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes. The Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be 'natural born' citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years. There are no limitations based on character or criminal record. While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices. The Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground. 'We let states set the time, place and manner' of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, 'but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don't let the state add new substantive requirements.' While that view is not universal among legal experts, it prevailed in court in 2019, after California passed a law requiring candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the law from taking effect, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' after taking an oath to support the Constitution. Numerous lawsuits had argued that Mr. Trump's actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, met this bar. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine's secretary of state did the same. But the Supreme Court \u2014 led by a conservative supermajority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself \u2014 concluded that only Congress had the power to enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. (Four of the justices, including the three liberals, wanted to allow a wider range of options for disqualification.) Congress is not going to do that with Republicans in control of the House. And the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal cases, meaning convictions would not disqualify Mr. Trump either. Congress can designate either groups of people to whom Section 3 applies (such as people who fought for the Confederacy) or specific crimes that, upon conviction, would trigger disqualification, said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University. But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty. 'Whether or not Trump is tried, convicted, acquitted, that's a separate question from whether or not he's disqualified,' said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. One of the charges in the federal case related to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election \u2014 conspiracy to violate civil rights \u2014 once carried a disqualification penalty, Mr. Kreis said, but Congress removed it decades ago. Now that Mr. Trump has secured a majority of delegates to the Republican convention, the party has no mechanism to nominate somebody else. Under the party's official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, 'such support shall not be recognized.' Nor have top Republicans shown any interest in another nominee. If he were forced to withdraw from the race after the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him. Probably not. Mr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony. Most felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day. He could also petition for clemency, which would require the approval of the governor \u2014 Ron DeSantis, who ran against Mr. Trump in the Republican primary \u2014 and two Florida cabinet members. Chris Taylor, the director of external affairs for the Florida Commission on Offender Review, confirmed that a Florida resident convicted of a felony could apply to have their voting rights restored through that process even if their conviction happened outside Florida. Since Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison. So if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he could be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote. No one knows. 'We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 'It's just guessing.' Legally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. 'I don't think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,' Professor Levinson said. In practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts. In theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself. More likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump's lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch. On the federal charges only, he could also try to pardon himself \u2014 or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a 'self pardon' was constitutional. Or President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that 'the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,' Professor Chemerinsky said. But that wouldn't apply to the New York or Georgia cases, because the president does not have pardon power for state charges. Again, no one knows, particularly when it comes to the New York and Georgia cases. In the two federal cases, a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges. The Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents \u2014 that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties \u2014 applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario. 'The reasons why we wouldn't want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn't want to prosecute a sitting president,' said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department's reasoning. 'My guess is, if the Trump prosecution were still ongoing in some way and Trump were elected, the Justice Department \u2014 which would be the Trump Justice Department \u2014 would say, \u2018We're following the 1973 memo.'' Like so much else here, this would be legally untested, and it is impossible to say what the Supreme Court would do if the question reached it. In its Clinton v. Jones ruling in 1997, the court allowed a lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed. But that case was civil, not criminal, and it was filed by a private citizen, not by the government itself. Charlie Savage contributed reporting.  \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe challenging process of choosing a jury in the first criminal trial of a former American president proceeded slowly on Tuesday, as prospective jurors were questioned individually about their ability to fairly consider the charges against Donald J. Trump.\nShortly before noon, lawyers began directly questioning the first group of prospective jurors to make it through initial queries. Questions involved their opinions on campaign finance law and on the trial's potential witnesses, including a porn star and a tabloid publisher.\nEarlier, some prospective jurors who had previously indicated that they would be able to be impartial had changed their minds after taking a night to think about it. 'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I hoped I could be,' one admitted. He was excused.\nIt could take two weeks or more to pick the 12 jurors who will decide the case, which centers on allegations that the former president falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star, Stormy Daniels.\nThe pool of possible jurors being scrutinized on Tuesday came from an initial group of 96, dozens of whom were dismissed immediately on Monday after indicating that they felt they could not fairly reach a decision. The dismissals underscored the difficulty of picking a jury in a city where the defendant is widely reviled.\nMr. Trump, who may take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied all wrongdoing. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records that hid reimbursements to his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who had paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to buy her silence. Prosecutors say that Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election.\nHere's what to know about the case:\nThe case was brought a year ago by Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. It is one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, but may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nA day after Mr. Trump appeared to nod off during pretrial motions, he was back at the defense table. He appeared somewhat bored as the jury selection process continued, with prospective jurors responding to a series of mostly yes or no questions.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America.\nMr. Trump has repeatedly complained that the case is a politically motivated witch hunt and has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and his family, as well as key witnesses, including Mr. Cohen. Justice Merchan has imposed a gag order on Mr. Trump that bars him from attacking witnesses, jurors, prosecutors or the judge's family. Even before the trial began on Monday, prosecutors asked Justice Merchan to hold the former president in contempt of court over social media posts about Mr. Cohen; the judge said he would hold a hearing later this month.\nApril 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET Anusha Bayya\nAnusha Bayya Reporting from outside the courthouse A midday addition to the crowd here, albeit briefly: Mayor Eric Adams has come by, flanked by his security detail, and was soon peppered with questions by reporters.

Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, accused Donald J. Trump of falsifying business records connected to a hush money payment to a porn star. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony counts. Credit Credit... Andrew Seng for The New York Times All 34 felony counts at the center of the Manhattan criminal case against former President Donald J. Trump stem from a $130,000 hush-money payment handed over to a porn star in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe specific charges are far less titillating: falsifying business records in the first degree. But a conviction could still result in jail time.\nThe payment was made by Mr. Trump's fixer, Michael D. Cohen, to Stormy Daniels in order to buy her silence about a sexual liaison she said she had with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump directed him to make the payment.\nPaying hush money is not illegal. But while serving as the commander in chief, prosecutors say, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen in a manner that constituted fraud: In internal records, Mr. Trump's company classified the reimbursement as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet there were no such expenses, according to prosecutors, who say the agreement was also fictional.\nThose records underpin the 34 counts of falsifying business records: 11 involve the checks, 11 center on monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted to the company and 12 involve entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust. Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing.\nIn announcing the charges a year ago, Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, said that his office must keep a close eye on how companies conduct business in New York.\n'This is the business capital of the world,' Mr. Bragg said. 'We regularly do cases involving false business statements. The bedrock \u2014 in fact, the basis for business integrity and a well-functioning business marketplace \u2014 is true and accurate record-keeping.'\nThe charges against Mr. Trump are all Class E felonies, the lowest category in New York. Each count carries a maximum prison sentence of four years.\nNothing in the law requires the judge, Juan E. Merchan, to imprison Mr. Trump if the jury convicts him. The judge could instead sentence him to probation.\nBut Justice Merchan has made it clear that he takes white-collar crime seriously and could put Mr. Trump behind bars. It's possible, however, if Mr. Trump is convicted of more than one count, Justice Merchan would impose a concurrent sentence, under which Mr. Trump would serve all time simultaneously.\nKey Players in the Trump Criminal Trial \u203a Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET Olivia Bensimon\nOlivia Bensimon Reporting from outside the courthouse Journalists still vastly outnumber the Trump supporters who have gathered near the courthouse today.

Neighborhood workers on their lunch breaks bask in the spring sun.\nJury selection is often a lengthy process, but in the first criminal trial of a former American president, currently taking place in a Manhattan criminal courthouse, it's going more slowly than normal.\nIn part, that is because of the nature of the case: Jurors, once seated, will be asked to decide whether Donald J. Trump committed a crime. Prosecutors have charged him with 34 felonies, accusing him of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal that could have hurt his first presidential run.\nBut the process has been particularly drawn-out because, once would-be jurors say they can be fair and impartial, they are being asked a series of 42 questions.

Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Last month, Justice Juan M. Merchan ordered that prospective jurors' names would be shielded from the public, underscoring the need for privacy for those who may decide Donald J. Trump's criminal fate \u2014 and tempt the anger of his followers.\nYet on the first two days of jury selection, several prospective jurors revealed potentially identifying information, reflecting the difficulty of having an anonymous jury in a case with an intense media spotlight.\nOn the first day, a woman said she worked for a city agency of approximately 500 people and revealed its name. Later, a man who identified himself as a bookseller revealed the name of the small store where he works.\nThis continued on Tuesday when others revealed the names of employers. While some worked for companies that were large, where the potential jurors could likely remain unidentifiable, others were less cautious. One woman revealed the name of the three-person company she owns with her husband.\nJustice Merchan did not interject as the prospective jurors divulged the information, nor did he caution them against doing so.\nJuries are not completely anonymous in New York State. Mr. Trump, his lawyers and the prosecutors have access to the names of the prospective jurors. But after a request by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, Justice Merchan decided to withhold the names from the public. Mr. Trump did not oppose the request.\nThe accidental self-identifications are a notable departure from how federal Judge Lewis A. Kaplan conducted jury selection in Mr. Trump's defamation trial in January, brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll.\nIn the federal system, jurors are allowed to remain anonymous, even to parties in the case. Before potential jurors answered basic questions about their backgrounds, Judge Kaplan instructed them not to reveal personal information.\n'Don't give us anything that could enable anybody to pin you down geographically,' he said.\nHe also cautioned them not to reveal their names to each other, and when the trial concluded, he left them with these ominous words: 'My advice to you is that you never disclose that you were on this jury,' Judge Kaplan said. 'And I won't say anything more about it.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 16, 2024, 1:11 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:11 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich\nJonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse The prospective jurors have just been excused for lunch.

We are running 5 to 7 minutes per person.\nThe very premise of the trial is that prosecutors believe Donald J. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times Donald J. Trump first ran for president nearly a decade ago.\nNow, as he runs again in a political climate that he helped create, his Manhattan criminal trial is partly a referendum on his tactics during that first campaign.\nThe trial's very premise is that prosecutors believe Mr. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign \u2014 sex scandals involving a porn star and a Playboy model, for example \u2014 he concealed them, the prosecutors say.\nBut in a development that will bolster their case, prosecutors on Monday secured permission from the judge to admit evidence connected to Mr. Trump's overall political strategy in 2016. Much of it bears the former president's imprint: aggressive tweets, false denials, coordination with a tabloid publisher and more.\nThe judge's ruling showed how the weapons that worked so well for Mr. Trump then are being turned against him in the courtroom now.\nThe techniques prosecutors highlighted Monday were not invented by Mr. Trump for use in his campaign; they are behaviors he exhibited throughout his life as a businessman and a reality-television star. But in modern American political history, such raw tactics had rarely been seen at such a high level.\nOne example is Mr. Trump's relationship with The National Enquirer tabloid and its publisher, David Pecker, who is expected to appear as a witness.\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case, obtained permission from the judge on Monday to introduce evidence related to a 2015 meeting among Mr. Trump, Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump's former fixer, Michael D. Cohen. A prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, said on Monday that the three men had 'conspired to influence the 2016 election.'\nThat meeting laid the groundwork for hush-money deals with a porn star, Stormy Daniels, and a Playboy model, Karen McDougal. But another result of that meeting, Mr. Steinglass said, were explosive headlines about Mr. Trump's opponents in the Republican primary, including those claiming that Ben Carson had committed 'medical malpractice' and that Senator Ted Cruz had a 'family connection to J.F.K.'s assassin.'\nA lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, protested the admission of evidence related to that meeting, saying that newspaper publishers met with candidates 'all the time,' and that there was nothing improper about it, let alone illegal.\nThat admission worked against him. The judge, Juan M. Merchan, said that he was glad that Mr. Blanche believed that there was nothing wrong with the meeting \u2014 because it meant that he should not mind that the evidence would be introduced.\n'There is no reason not to allow it in,' Justice Merchan said.\nMr. Steinglass won again when he persuaded Justice Merchan to admit evidence of the Trump campaign in crisis after the publication in 2016 of the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump boasted about grabbing women by their genitals.\n'The video sent the campaign into a tailspin,' Mr. Steinglass said.\nHe offered up an email sent by a Washington Post reporter to Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump's campaign spokeswoman. Mr. Steinglass said that Ms. Hicks had forwarded the exchange to Stephen K. Bannon, Kellyanne Conway and other members of the campaign team, 'suggesting that their response should be to deny, deny, deny.' Eventually, he said, Mr. Bannon sent it to Mr. Cohen.\nMr. Blanche again protested, but was again rebuffed. The judge said he would allow jurors to see the email, saying that the ensuing thread was relevant.\nThe exchanges that prosecutors and defense lawyers debated on Monday underscored Mr. Trump's penchant for delegating dirty work to others, giving himself some distance in the process.\nThe hush-money deals worked that way: Mr. Cohen paid off Ms. Daniels, while The National Enquirer bought Ms. McDougal's silence. (Mr. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to his reimbursement of Mr. Cohen.)\nThat habit is still on display this year, and can be helpful given that Justice Merchan has barred Mr. Trump from attacking witnesses, prosecutors and the judge's own family.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump posted on social media a video of Laura Loomer, a political ally, in the park outside the courthouse. Ms. Loomer, speaking into a bullhorn, insinuated that the judge's family was politically compromised.\nHad Mr. Trump said that himself, he would have risked violating the judge's gag order.\nApril 16, 2024, 10:51 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 10:51 a.m. ET Kate Christobek\nKate Christobek Reporting from the courthouse Jury selection has been a slow and slogging exercise but there are occasional moments of levity.

Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab New York City courtroom as Mr. Trump looked on.\nBefore jury selection began, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, rejected another effort to force his recusal by the defense, which cited several issues, including his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant.\nHe also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost.\nBut Mr. Trump's lawyers did persuade Justice Merchan that mentioning sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump was recorded bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial.\nEntering the courtroom Monday, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here,' but he looked less enthusiastic in front of Justice Merchan. He quietly slouched and scowled \u2014 and at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep.\nBy afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into the courtroom. Some quickly left: When the judge asked the first group of 96 if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused.\nThe remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT The jury selection process in Donald J.

Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate.\nThe potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair.\nThe process could take two weeks or more \u2014 and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court.\n'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.'\nThe stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County \u2014 Manhattan, as most people know it \u2014 which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020.\nMr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions.\nMr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated.\nProsecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28.\nUnlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.'\nSome may not be completely forthcoming.\n'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said.\nMr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors.\n'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Not since Eugene V. Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning.\nFormer President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases: two federal, one in New York and another in Georgia. The first of those to go to trial is the sex scandal cover-up in New York, where jury selection began on Monday.\nFor now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, beyond having to be present in a courtroom, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But some of the cases are proceeding at a pace that could bring verdicts before the election \u2014 and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that will arise if he is convicted.\nOthers would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges.\nHere is what we know, and what we don't know.\nThis is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes.\nThe Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be 'natural born' citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years.\nThere are no limitations based on character or criminal record. While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices.\nThe Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground.\n'We let states set the time, place and manner' of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, 'but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don't let the state add new substantive requirements.'\nWhile that view is not universal among legal experts, it prevailed in court in 2019, after California passed a law requiring candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the law from taking effect, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' after taking an oath to support the Constitution.\nNumerous lawsuits had argued that Mr. Trump's actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, met this bar. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine's secretary of state did the same. But the Supreme Court \u2014 led by a conservative supermajority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself \u2014 concluded that only Congress had the power to enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. (Four of the justices, including the three liberals, wanted to allow a wider range of options for disqualification.)\nCongress is not going to do that with Republicans in control of the House. And the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal cases, meaning convictions would not disqualify Mr. Trump either.\nCongress can designate either groups of people to whom Section 3 applies (such as people who fought for the Confederacy) or specific crimes that, upon conviction, would trigger disqualification, said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University. But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty.\n'Whether or not Trump is tried, convicted, acquitted, that's a separate question from whether or not he's disqualified,' said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nOne of the charges in the federal case related to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election \u2014 conspiracy to violate civil rights \u2014 once carried a disqualification penalty, Mr. Kreis said, but Congress removed it decades ago.\nNow that Mr. Trump has secured a majority of delegates to the Republican convention, the party has no mechanism to nominate somebody else. Under the party's official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, 'such support shall not be recognized.'\nNor have top Republicans shown any interest in another nominee.\nIf he were forced to withdraw from the race after the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him.\nafter the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him. Probably not.\nMr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony.\nMost felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day.\nHe could also petition for clemency, which would require the approval of the governor \u2014 Ron DeSantis, who ran against Mr. Trump in the Republican primary \u2014 and two Florida cabinet members. Chris Taylor, the director of external affairs for the Florida Commission on Offender Review, confirmed that a Florida resident convicted of a felony could apply to have their voting rights restored through that process even if their conviction happened outside Florida.\nSince Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison.\nSo if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he could be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote.\nNo one knows.\n'We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 'It's just guessing.'\nLegally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. 'I don't think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,' Professor Levinson said.\nIn practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts.\nIn theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself.\nMore likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump's lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch.\nOn the federal charges only, he could also try to pardon himself \u2014 or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a 'self pardon' was constitutional.\nOr President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that 'the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,' Professor Chemerinsky said.\nBut that wouldn't apply to the New York or Georgia cases, because the president does not have pardon power for state charges.\nAgain, no one knows, particularly when it comes to the New York and Georgia cases.\nIn the two federal cases, a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges.\nThe Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents \u2014 that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties \u2014 applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario.\n'The reasons why we wouldn't want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn't want to prosecute a sitting president,' said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department's reasoning.

Lawmakers say it's a national security threat, and that the Chinese government could lean on its owner, ByteDance, to obtain sensitive U.S. user data or influence content on the app to serve its interests.\nRoughly 170 million Americans use TikTok. That's half the population of the United States.\nRoughly 170 million Americans use TikTok. That's half the population of the United States. There's a long road of legislation, deal making and legal challenges ahead before TikTok could be forced to change ownership or even be banned. The Senate would need to pass the legislation \u2014which it may do as soon as next week, now that the House has bundled it into a foreign aid package that it is likely to vote on over the weekend. It would have to survive lawsuits from TikTok and creators. Buyers would have to clear regulatory approval. And after all that, Beijing could simply block a deal. But imagining what a United States without TikTok would look like throws into sharp relief just how much the app has worked its way into American culture.\nTikTok, which officially landed in the United States in 2018, was the most downloaded app in the country, and the world, in 2020, 2021 and 2022. It wasn't that the elements of it were so new \u2014 compelling videos from randos had long been a staple of American pop culture \u2014 but TikTok put the pieces together in a new way.\nUnlike Instagram, Facebook or Snapchat, TikTok didn't build itself around social connections. Its goal is pure, uncut entertainment. The algorithm ingested every data point it could from what users skipped, liked or shared \u2014 and spat it directly into the maddeningly habit-forming For You Page. Fans whispered reverently that it knew them better than they knew themselves.\nHere are 19 ways of understanding how TikTok became part of American life. The music America listens to, the movies it sees, what conspiracies it believes, how it can make or break a product's success, who it defines as a celebrity \u2014 all of it has been influenced by TikTok, for good and bad. Even if you've never opened the app, you've lived in a culture that exists downstream of what happens there.\nof what happens there. Insular, slow-changing Hollywood responded to TikTok's arrival in 2018 in typical fashion: complete dismissal.

We're way too busy making pictures to worry about some new short-form video app. Then came denial. (This thing is just another fad.) Next, fear. (Teenagers and young adults are never going to the movies again!)\nBut there's a plot twist: Hollywood has come to see TikTok as indispensable.\n'Anyone But You,' a Sony romantic comedy starring Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, arrived to a piddly $8 million in ticket sales over Christmas weekend. The movie turned into a full-fledged hit ($219 million) after TikTok users (at the urging of Sony) began making videos of themselves re-enacting the credit sequence.\nTikTok also served as a ticket-selling machine for 'M3gan,' a Universal-Blumhouse horror movie about a sassy robot that has spawned a new franchise; 'Wonka,' which debuted in December and collected $632 million; and the Barbenheimer box office phenomenon, otherwise known as 'Barbie,' with $1.4 billion, and 'Oppenheimer,' with about $1 billion. Rote glamour shots and insipid interviews \u2014 ye olde studio publicity tools \u2014 don't work on TikTok; users want behind-the-scenes 'realness.' Hence 'Oppenheimer' stars goofing in a hotel hallway before a premiere, and pink-clad 'Barbie' stars cavorting on the floor with puppies.\n'Now that studios have figured out how to harness TikTok, the last thing they want is for it to go dark,' said Sue Fleishman, a former Universal and Warner Bros. executive who is now a consultant. 'That would actually be a big problem.'\nRecently, V Spehar has posted TikTok videos telling viewers what they might have missed from President Biden's State of the Union address, the first 15 actions that former President Donald J.

Trump said he would take if he's re-elected in November and Caitlin Clark's WNBA starting salary. Mx. Spehar posts to more than three million followers from the handle @UnderTheDeskNews and films many clips lying on the floor, a gimmick that began as an effort to differentiate from the authoritative tone of traditional television news anchors. The style of communication has resonated enough to make Mx. Spehar a regular at White House briefings with social media influencers.\nNews aggregation and analysis accounts like Mx. Spehar's are shaping the discourse about current events in the United States, especially among young people. They're a modern version of old-school bloggers \u2014 users respond to the personal tone, and the editorializing. (Some creators have even built followings simply by reading print news articles to their followers.)\nPew Research Center has found that about one-third of 18- to 29-year-olds say they get news regularly on the platform, far outpacing people in other age groups.\nIn 2023, about 14% of American adults said they regularly got news on TikTok, compared with just 3% percent in 2020.\nIn 2023, about 14% of American adults said they regularly got news on TikTok, compared with just 3% percent in 2020. Other sites have similar draws. Roughly 16 percent of all American adults get their news from Instagram, and a similar amount from X. Far more people consume news on Facebook and YouTube.\nThe appeal of TikTok and other social sites has made mainstream outlets nervous, and has raised some concerns around accuracy and context as original reporting is funneled through other accounts. The Wall Street Journal has more than 340,000 followers on TikTok, while The New York Times has nearly 630,000 \u2014 numbers that pale in comparison with the followings of individual commentators like Mx. Spehar.\nBy Tiffany Hsu\nSeveral dentists recently took to TikTok to debunk a conspiracy theory: that toothpaste tubes were printed with secret codes signaling their true ingredients to powerful people in the know.\nSeveral dentists recently took to TikTok to debunk a conspiracy theory: that toothpaste tubes were printed with secret codes signaling their true ingredients to powerful people in the know. Their efforts garnered far fewer views than the video that offered up the theory in early January. Not counting all the times the post was referenced in videos by other TikTok users, it has been seen more than seven million times in less than three months.\nTall tales are common on TikTok, where a flimsy patchwork of assumptions and coincidences \u2014 often concerning the schemes of a nefarious echelon of elites \u2014 is illustrated by dramatic images generated by artificial intelligence and spooky musical tracks. (Other such hits include false theories that President Joe Biden rigged the Super Bowl in favor of the Kansas City Chiefs or that Justin Bieber had signaled he was a victim of PizzaGate. False allegations of voter fraud also abound.)\nAbbie Richards, a misinformation researcher who studies the TikTok ecosystem, said that such posts thrive because of the platform's potent recommendation algorithms and its low barrier to entry.\nTikTok allows users to earn money from their videos through tools such as its creator rewards program and livestream subscriptions. Conspiracy theories, which draw high engagement, are one of the most profitable categories, said Ms. Richards, a senior video producer at the liberal watchdog group Media Matters.\n'It's like candy for your brain \u2014 it tells a story that simplifies the world in a way that feels good to you,' she said.\nA quarter of American adults who use the app create 98 percent of its videos.\nA quarter of American adults who use the app create 98 percent of its videos. The toothpaste theory was promoted by two young men known for conspiratorial content, including popular posts about satanic hit men and Britney Spears. They claimed that the colored dots on toothpaste tubes correspond to all-natural, medicinal or chemical ingredients.\nThe post was quickly reposted, copied and stitched into reaction videos. Some came from dentists, who explained that the dots were actually used during the toothpaste packaging process to help guide manufacturing equipment to properly cut and seal the tubes.\nThat conspiracy theory is not new \u2014 they rarely are on TikTok. Colgate, a major toothpaste manufacturer, addressed the color patch rumor last year and said that 'as much as we love cracking secret codes, this one actually has nothing to crack because it's entirely untrue.'\nEven silly rumors, however, can spin out from TikTok into real-world harms. The baseless concerns that store-bought toothpaste tubes might hide toxic ingredients reignited recommendations to opt instead for unproven and potentially damaging homemade options.\nBy Madison Malone Kircher\nIncluding but certainly not limited to: Butter boards, sexy water, blueberry milk nails, unexpected red, lucky girl syndrome, first-time-cool syndrome, bed rotting, 75 soft, 75 cozy, bookshelf wealth, loud budgeting, broccoli freckles, strawberry makeup, glazed donut skin, latte makeup, cowboy copper hair, old money blonde, expensive brunette, orange peel theory, quiet luxury, stealth wealth, tomato girl summer, indie sleaze, coquette, looksmaxxing, male perms, vanilla girl, clean girl, soft girl, coastal grandma, coastal cowgirl, low-high visual weight makeup, sleepy-girl mocktails, fluffy coffee, shrimp tree, girl math, girl dinner, mob wife, clowncore, balletcore, Barbiecore, royalcore, corecore.\nFor the music industry , TikTok has become a potent but unpredictable promotional outlet, and a vital one in the race to mint a new hit.

Young artists like Olivia Rodrigo and Lil Nas X saw their popularity explode on the platform, and acts like Fleetwood Mac have seen decades-old songs get a boost from memes on the app. But TikTok is also the latest tech platform to draw the anger of the music industry for low royalty rates. In February, Universal Music Group, which represents artists like Ms. Rodrigo, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and Drake, withdrew the rights to its music on the app, saying that TikTok was trying to 'bully' the company to accept low terms.\nWithin days, millions of TikTok videos using music from Universal artists went mute, and since then guessing which side would blink first has become a media-business parlor game.\nLast week, however, Ms. Swift \u2014 who releases her music through Universal, but has owned the copyrights to her work since 2018 \u2014 broke ranks and put her songs back on TikTok, just ahead of the release of her next album on Friday. Now the question is, will other artists will follow.\nFor years I thought TikTok was mostly a parenting problem , and had only tangential bearing on what I cover: threats to national security. It took a while \u2014 and a lot of conversations with both tech firms and government officials \u2014 for me to become concerned about the potential that it could also pose a major problem on that front.\nFor years I thought TikTok was mostly a parenting problem, and had only tangential bearing on what I cover: threats to national security. It took a while \u2014 and a lot of conversations with both tech firms and government officials \u2014 for me to become concerned about the potential that it could also pose a major problem on that front. Not because the company's Chinese owners could figure out your dance-move preferences, but because the algorithm at the core of the app is wrapped in such mystery.\nSo what's the issue? The algorithm doesn't belong to TikTok; it is provided by engineers working for ByteDance, the Chinese company that controls the platform and develops the code in enormous secrecy in laboratories around the world, in Beijing, Singapore and Mountain View, Calif.\nThe Chinese government is intent on keeping it that way. It has issued regulations that require Beijing's regulators to grant permission before any ByteDance algorithms can be licensed to outsiders. They are unlikely to do so.\nAnd so, as long as it is written by ByteDance, and can't be picked apart on the outside, there will always be the risk that it will become a pipeline for influencing citizens, and thus voters, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways.\nSenator Mark Warner, the chairman of Senate Intelligence Committee, has noted that because TikTok has emerged as a major source of news \u2014 and because it collects data on users that the Chinese government could find useful, even crucial \u2014 it poses a serious threat, and could become 'the most powerful propaganda tool ever.'\nAt least based on what the United States has made public. The intelligence agencies have been giving closed-door briefings, but presumably there hasn't been a classified blockbuster, since there would likely be great pressure to declassify it.\nStill, we have seen waves of new influence campaigns flowing out of China \u2014 much of it aimed at nations other than the United States. While TikTok has not been at the center of those campaigns, clearly, the Chinese have learned a lot in the past few years, including from the Russians. (Researchers have also found that topics commonly suppressed in China, including about the Tibetan and Uyghur populations, appear to be unusually underrepresented on TikTok compared with Instagram.)\nThis is not a problem that would be solved by simply selling TikTok's operations to an American buyer. Sure, the bill that went through the House bans a new, Western-owned TikTok from having any 'operational relationship' with ByteDance, 'including any cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm.' Good luck with that \u2014 TikTok would no longer be TikTok.\nThe real question is whether anyone gets to look under the hood. Because to make Americans trust TikTok, the country will need an early warning system, something that will assure everyone that a technology that became popular because it generated memes and celebrates self-expression does not become a conduit for a foreign government interested in subtly influencing how we vote.\nSouthern Alamance Middle School, a public school in Graham, N.C., recently came up with a novel way to combat student distractions from social media. Or at least to curb the phenomenon that some teachers have dubbed 'Toilet TikToks.'\nSouthern Alamance Middle School, a public school in Graham, N.C., recently came up with a novel way to combat student distractions from social media. Or at least to curb the phenomenon that some teachers have dubbed 'Toilet TikToks.' The problem: Educators there noticed a spike in the number of students asking to leave class \u2014 sometimes as frequently as nine times per day \u2014 to go to the bathroom, where they made TikTok videos.\nThe solution: Administrators decided to remove the bathroom mirrors that students used to film TikToks and primp for their close-ups. They also introduced an online system that issues students digital hall passes when they want to be excused from class and that allows administrators to track students' locations. 'Since removing the mirrors,' administrators wrote in a message to parents in January, 'we have seen a drastic decrease in bathroom visits from students asking to be excused just to make videos.'\nToilettoks \u2014 a TikTok genre, dating back at least five years, in which students use school bathrooms as film sets for dance routines, lip-syncing clips or critiques of unclean lavatories \u2014 are one of the milder social media annoyances for schools.\nAcross the United States, students have also used school bathrooms as arenas to stage, film and post videos of bullying, physical assaults on schoolmates and acts of vandalism.\nIn March, Alamance-Burlington schools announced that it was joining dozens of other U.S. districts that have filed lawsuits accusing social media platforms, including TikTok, of unfairly ensnaring young people.\n'We're seeing the negative impacts of social media on our students every day,' Kristy Davis, the acting superintendent of Alamance-Burlington schools, said. 'Their well-being has to be the top priority.'\nMy favorite Instagram account is a collection of TikToks.

By the time TikTok debuted, in 2017, I was already in my 30s and too old and lazy to work another app into my rotation. Instagram and Twitter were distracting enough. But now those platforms lie downstream of TikTok's creative wellspring, waiting for bits of its most popular content to drift into the open internet. TikToks float into my friends' Instagram stories, percolate into our group chats, swirl into my Twitter feed. My phone is always bleating with its outro sound effect. I rarely open TikTok, but I watch TikToks all the time.\nTikToks let loose a chaotic element into Instagram's internet mall, and they break the monotony of Twitter's boosted tech-bro threads. They stock YouTube compilations and spark Facebook debates and fuel trend pieces.\nIf TikTok were to disappear, it would feel, at least for a while, like the internet's big content spigot had been turned to a trickle. Rival platforms have tried to remake themselves in TikTok's image \u2014 building in short-form videos, algorithmic timelines and searchable sound clips \u2014 but have failed to reproduce the hypnotic energy of its perpetual discovery machine. We'd be left with a diluted version of its secret sauce.\nBut any network that hopes to capitalize on its own popularity will disrupt its product. Even as other social media platforms try to become TikTok, TikTok is trying to become them, lengthening its videos to compete with YouTube and introducing an e-commerce platform to 'drive meaningful shopping experiences' and rival Instagram. Eventually some new, inexplicably addictive platform will rise in its place. And I will rely on the kindness of some slightly younger strangers to show me what's on it.\nMuch has been said about the 'addictive design' of TikTok. But what is the social media site actually doing to our brains?\nThere is very little research looking at what goes on inside people's heads while they're using TikTok. But one small study conducted on Chinese university students used magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activity while they watched personalized TikTok videos (ones the algorithm had selected based on their past use) versus generalized ones (videos the app recommended to new users).\nThe students had greater activity in several areas of the brain, including ones associated with reward, attention and processing social information, while viewing personalized videos. In other words, the algorithm did its job.\nOther social media platforms have been shown to turn on similar brain regions. So what makes TikTok different? Some experts have proposed that it can send users into a 'flow state': the experience of being so absorbed in a task that the person loses track of time. Backing this up, one study found that TikTok users reported experiencing higher levels of flow than Instagram users.\n'Flow' is often associated with work or hobbies \u2014 activities that are challenging enough to be engaging but not frustrating. Watching videos doesn't require skill the way that many flow-inducing activities do, yet the app is able to induce the feelings of enjoyment, concentration and time distortion that are characteristic of flow \u2014 possibly because of the algorithm's immersive quality.\nIs there any more official signal that a business titan has arrived at the heart of the American social-financial-artistic-political power nexus than being invited to be an honorary host of the annual Met Gala, a.k.a. 'the party of the year'?

'the party of the year'? Any more glamorous recognition than being asked to join its convener, the Vogue editor, Anna Wintour, in the Metropolitan Museum's soaring atrium as the great and the good of Hollywood, fashion, sports, Wall Street and Washington swan past? On May 6, TikTok will be lead sponsor of both the party and the museum fashion exhibition it celebrates. The company's chief executive, Shou Chew, has been named an honorary chair of this year's gala, along with the Loewe designer Jonathan Anderson, while Ms. Wintour, Zendaya, Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez and Chris Hemsworth are the event's co-chairs.\nThat placement would put TikTok firmly in the tradition of previous gala sponsors like Amazon, Instagram and Apple \u2014 tech companies bedazzled by the Old Establishment, which in turn is bedazzled by their blush of upstart cool.\nIt is an acknowledgment, if any were needed, of the prominent role the app has come to play in fashion in a mere few years.\nIt was only in 2021, after all, that Ms. Wintour was criticized for inviting TikTok stars such as Addison Rae and Dixie D'Amelio to the party \u2014 for somehow cheapening it by catering to the buzzfeed machine of the smartphone, rather than the elite. After all, not just anyone can get an invite, even if they can afford the $50,000 price tag for a seat; Ms. Wintour vets every guest, and the price of admission has to do with cultural currency even more than actual currency.\nWhich is why, of course, TikTok belongs. Despite the fact that all social media is forbidden inside the party.\nFast-forward three years, and there are more than 75 billion views associated with the #TikTokfashion hashtag; almost 500 million with #2023Gala alone. Luxury brands routinely sign up TikTok stars as brand ambassadors along with every other kind of star, hoping to access their audience (received relevance is something Vogue might be getting out of the association, too). And thus is created a virtuous \u2014 or vicious? \u2014 cycle in which TikTok feeds the gala machine, which feeds TikTok, which is the vicarious experience that has come to feed us all.\nTikTok is a motherlode of mental health content , filled with compelling first-person accounts of everything from major depression to selective mutism.

Depending on your perspective, that's either a very good thing \u2014 or concerning. Corey Basch, who analyzed 100 popular TikTok videos with the hashtag mentalhealth for a 2022 study, emerged concerned about the looping effect of the algorithm.\n'What's so important and disturbing to recognize is the downward spiral that users can get swept into,' said Dr. Basch, a professor of public health at William Paterson University. 'If one is drawn to posts related to despair and anxiety, they can easily spend hours exposed to repetitive content known as an echo chamber.'\nThe surge of content about mental health has meant that young people are more likely to self-diagnose before seeing a clinician, psychiatrists report. Diagnoses for ADHD and anxiety disorders shot up during the pandemic years, especially among young people.\nSome researchers have expressed concern about how profit motives may feed into these trends, since platforms often feature advertising from app-based mental health services, and influencers have sponsorship deals with such companies.\n'They say we can diagnose you really quick, just take this five-question quiz and we can send you a prescription in a nice little box,' said Holly Avella, a Ph.D. candidate at Rutgers University who has researched mental health and social media.\nResearchers also warn that TikTok videos can deliver misinformation. A review of literature published last year found that around one-fifth of videos mentioning cognitive behavioral therapy were inaccurate, describing it as ineffective or harmful.\nBut some users credit the app with breaking open the national conversation around mental illness.\n'You can sit there on your pedestal and pooh-pooh it all you want,' said Kate Speer, who has used her social media feeds to describe her experience of serious mental illness. TikTok is helpful for 'the very people who are struggling the most, those who don't have access to services in the real world and who might even be so disabled by mental illness that they are locked in their houses.'\nBy Michael M.

'Two great quarterbacks; hard to decide,' replied the president, casually dressed in a half-zip sweater and khakis. The caption was 'lol hey guys.'\nTeam Biden, like most other major politicians, had previously resisted joining the app because of security concerns related to its Chinese ownership. (The Donald Trump campaign is not on TikTok, and Mr. Trump has expressed divergent views about the app, proposing a ban during his presidency but recently criticizing an attempt by Congress to curtail its use in the United States.)\nGiving in was a nod to the irrefutable importance of TikTok, where about 14 percent of American adults regularly get news, in an election year. There's now a small studio in the Biden campaign office in Wilmington, Del., where staff members can film 'candid' videos with the candidate.\n62% of Americans between 18- and 29-years-old use the platform, greater than the share of that age group that voted in the last presidential election.\n62% of Americans between 18- and 29-years-old use the platform, greater than the share of that age group that voted in the last presidential election. Campaigns have a rich tradition of adapting to the latest technological fads, from wireless radio to television sets and, more recently, to social platforms like Facebook and Snapchat. Many of these efforts share a how-do-you-do-fellow-kids quality to them, and in an attempt to avoid appearing out of touch, the Biden campaign relies on young, digitally fluent aides to host its TikToks.\nIt works, sometimes. One video claims to have Trump 'caught on camera' making offensive remarks, an attempt to replicate the amateur spontaneity of many TikToks. (In reality, it's someone's iPhone aimed at a TV broadcast of a Trump speech.) Other times it comes across try-hard-y, like the video that dismisses a post by Representative Jim Jordan using a popular 'I Ain't Reading All That' online meme.\nThe @bidenhq account, though, is hovering around 299,000 followers \u2014 still small beans in the TikTok world.

The internet might have killed malls, but now it is one big mall.\nBecause the bite-size videos are addictive, and partly because advertising on the platform is relatively inexpensive for smaller brands, the app has become a core part of many companies' marketing plans. Brands say that their videos populated with everyday people can more easily go viral than on, say, Instagram, where they often need to pay expensive influencers. And people who notice shopping-related content spend more time on TikTok, according to eMarketer.\nThe average user spends nearly an hour \u2014 58 minutes \u2014 per day on the platform.\nThe average user spends nearly an hour \u2014 58 minutes \u2014 per day on the platform.

One crucial distinction between the hit recipes of today (like Emily Mariko's salmon and rice bowl) and those of yesteryear (The Silver Palate's chicken marbella) is the medium. Before, a static image was all you had to get the point across in a recipe, with step-by-step instructions printed in a cookbook.\nNow recipes unfold over time. In a 30-second video, there are obvious visual cues that viewers can absorb, techniques they can sink their teeth into. The videos depict process, not just stages, and allow you to jump-cut your way through a recipe in a few blinks.\nBut for all the access to techniques and cuisines that TikTok has provided home cooks, the platform favors concepts, over actual recipes \u2014 eggs fried in a puddle of pesto, sandwich fillings chopped into a homogenous mixture, mini pancakes served like cereal. The most shareable recipes are the ones that you can watch once, then turn around and make \u2014 no measurements, bake times or reading needed. Just dump, stir, like, follow, repeat.\nEvery social media app is, essentially, a spy in your pocket. When it comes to data collection, TikTok is no worse than the others.

When it comes to data collection, TikTok is no worse than the others. The main difference, and the one that's driving the current conversation in Washington, is that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company. TikTok, like other apps, seeks a huge amount of information from you, and some pieces of it that can seem innocuous are quite revealing, including:\nAn I.P. address is a unique identifier associated with your device or the network you use to get on the internet. TikTok can use your I.P. address and location to determine the advertising you see, but it can also reveal other real-life associations. When people access a social network from the same I.P. address, it reveals that they may know one another offline. ByteDance, which owns TikTok, used I.P. address data collected from journalists using the app to try to identify company employees who were speaking to them.\nGiving TikTok access to the hundreds (or thousands) of numbers and email addresses on your phone \u2014 an opt-in feature \u2014 lets them draw unexpected insights into your life, such as who your doctors are, your present and former colleagues, your one-night stands, and on and on. TikTok may then recommend you follow them as 'people you may know' \u2014 and your account, in turn, will be suggested to them, so beware of sharing contacts if you're trying to stay anonymous. Even if you don't share your contacts, TikTok can look for the phone or email address you gave the company in other users' address books unless you go into the privacy settings and turn off 'Suggest Your Account to Others.'\nUnless your messages are end-to-end encrypted, which they are not on TikTok, they can be reviewed by the company storing them for you.\nAre you obsessed with steamy Twilight highlight reels or home repair videos? TikTok knows.\nShelley Polanco is 22, and a senior at Brandeis. As she faces life after college, she is not looking for practical advice about, say, jobs and careers. She yearns instead for a guidebook to what it feels like to be an adult, something to tell her about her future emotional life and satisfaction.\nShelley Polanco is 22, and a senior at Brandeis. As she faces life after college, she is not looking for practical advice about, say, jobs and careers. She yearns instead for a guidebook to what it feels like to be an adult, something to tell her about her future emotional life and satisfaction. And so, she likes following TikTok accounts that feature 'an older woman of culture, kind of like this auntie figure who gets on TikTok and records \u2018things I wish I would have known in my 20s.''\nShe's a fan of @itsrealllylola. 'She's turning 25, and she starts to speak about all the things she's learned, the ways you maybe want to ignore people's judgments on you,' Ms. Polanco says. 'She's big on \u2018live your life and have fun.''\nShe peers decades into her future with the help of Dr. Amanda Hanson, '#midlifemuse,' who invites comments about life after 50 from her TikTok followers. Or Shera Seven. 'She is this 40-year-old woman, I want to say, giving really brutal dating advice,' Ms. Polanco said.\nMs. Polanco was having trouble seeing more than three months out, and found support from a TikTok transformation coach named Shannon. 'I searched, \u2018how to write goals,'' she said. 'There was this lady walking you through this meditation to visualize your future self, and it was one of the only times I could see an older version of myself. It was so inspirational, I closed the app, got out a piece of paper and started writing.'\nIn a video by the account @salarytransparentstreet that's been viewed more than 23 million times, a lawyer candidly shares she makes $134,000 a year, a teacher says she earns $53,000 and a man who does chemical risk assessments for the federal government divulges he makes $60,000 a year. The point, according to Hannah Williams, the 27-year-old content creator behind the account, is to help people better understand what they could be earning. (Ms. Williams says she made more than $1 million in 2023 before expenses through her videos and earns revenue from brand sponsorships and ads).\nFinTok, as the money and personal finance community on the app is called, has fundamentally changed the way we accept advice from strangers \u2014 and altered how much ordinary people are willing to share about that most taboo subject: how much money they have.\nSure, the app has allowed established finance gurus like Dave Ramsey and Suze Orman to expand their empires. But is has also given rise to people like Vivian Tu, a 30-year-old former Wall Street trader who runs the account @yourrichbff. Ms. Tu, who has 2.5 million followers, offers practical advice on high-yield savings accounts and retirement savings, but can also take widely discussed TikTok drama and show people what financial lessons they can learn from it.\n57% of Gen Z users like or leave a comment after watching a video on the platform.\n57% of Gen Z users like or leave a comment after watching a video on the platform. As with anything on TikTok, scrolling through FinTok videos requires a certain amount of skepticism. There are plenty of cryptocurrency creators on TikTok who like to focus on the potential gains rather than warning people of the risks. There are also crypto scams, including a rampant one using deepfake videos of Elon Musk. (Ads for crypto or financial services are banned from the platform, in part to help protect people from getting involved with high-risk investments. )\nBut often, when scams or bad advice crop up, commenters have no problem offering corrections. When one creator posted a video about how to get a high credit limit using dubious methods, her comment section quickly filled up with users accusing her of committing fraud. The video was soon deleted.\nTikTok didn't invent vertically oriented videos. But it has arguably been the most influential in getting people to watch their screens upright instead of sideways. It's a phenomenon that is sticking elsewhere, with Apple, a professional Spanish soccer league and major news publishers all producing vertical videos. Even The New York Times is on board.","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Amanda Hess,Tiffany Hsu,The New York Times,Madison Malone Kircher,Brooks Barnes,Ben Sisario,Natasha Singer,David E.
