Kornacki noted that back in 2020, the numbers were flipped, and voters viewed Biden as being more competent and effective.\nThe poll found 47% of voters view Trump as competent and effective, compared to just 36% who view the president the same way.\n\"Who has the strong record as president? And again, Trump outpacing Biden on that front. And again, you've got to mention this one, too. Necessary mental and physical health. We asked this four years ago. It was a wash. It's now a clear liability for Joe Biden. So these are all troubling numbers for Biden,\" Kornacki said.\nBiden leads Trump in just two categories; his ability to bring the country together and in dealing with abortion. However, Kornacki noted a lot of voters believed neither candidate was better than the other in their ability to bring the country together.\nWelker and Kornacki noted the poll's findings on RFK Jr.'s standing in the election, as many believe Kennedy would spoil the election for Biden and lead to a Trump victory.\nHowever, the poll found with RFK Jr.'s name on the ballot, the hypothetical match-up would fall to Biden.\n\"We show a 46-44 race for Donald Trump,\" Kornacki said, noting the results of the head-to-head match-up with just Biden and Trump. \"But, look what happens when we add RFK's name to the mix. Suddenly, we have a new leader. Joe Biden, 39%, Donald Trump 37%, there's Kennedy getting 13%. We see by a better than two to one margin, it's Trump voters are flipping to Kennedy in this scenario, not Biden voters.\"\nWelker said the results \"defied conventional wisdom.\"\nKornacki compared Biden's job approval, which currently sits at 42%, to past presidents at the same point in their presidency. Biden's 42% approval rating was the lowest among recent presidencies, including Trump's.\nKornacki also noted that voter interest in the 2024 election was the lowest it has been since NBC News started polling the question in 2008.\nPolling in key battleground states shows the race will prove to be very close, as Biden and Trump are currently tied at 48% in Pennsylvania, a Fox News Poll released on Thursday found.\nIn North Carolina, Trump leads Biden by just two percentage points, according to a poll released in early April.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Hanna Panreck","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1258563469-e1687799098776.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.542426,"_id":"e4947370b7527fce86ca6e20810cb7b9"},{"title":"White House deems House impeachment inquiry 'over,' President Biden formally declines to testify","author":"Danielle Wallace","published_date":"2024-04-16 15:36:31","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-deems-house-impeachment-inquiry-over-president-biden-formally-declines-testify","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"President Biden formally declined to testify at the request of House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky. regarding his family's business dealings.","summary":"The White House formally declined an invitation by House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., for President Biden to testify in connection to his son Hunter's business dealings.\n\"As our Office has demonstrated, and you acknowledged in a recent fundraising email, your impeachment investigation is over,\" Richard Sauber, special counsel to the president, wrote in a letter to Comer on Monday. \"It is past time for the House to focus on the issues that matter to the American people rather than continuing to waste time and taxpayer resources on this partisan charade.\"\nSauber said the House Oversight Committee's impeachment inquiry \"has succeeded only in turning up abundant evidence that, in fact, the President has done nothing wrong.\"\n\"Yet rather than acknowledge this reality, your March 28, 2024, letter contains the same litany of false allegations that have been repeatedly debunked and refuted by the very witnesses you have called before your Committee and the many documents you have obtained,\" the special counsel told Comer. \"Your insistence on peddling these false and unsupported allegations despite ample evidence to the contrary makes one thing about your investigation abundantly clear: The facts do not matter to you.\"\nThe National Review published a full copy of the letter also obtained by The Associated Press and other outlets.\nReacting to President Biden's refusal to testify, Comer issued a blistering statement on his X account, declaring, \"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree in the Biden family.\"\n\"Like his son, Hunter Biden, President Biden is refusing to testify in public about the Bidens' corrupt influence peddling,\" Comer wrote. \"This comes as no surprise since President Biden continues to lie about his relationships with his son's business partners, even denying they exists when his son said under oath during a deposition that they did. It is unfortunate President Biden is unwilling to answer questions before the American people and refuses to answer the very simple, straightforward questions we included in the invitation. Why is it so difficult for the White House to answer those questions? The American people deserve transparency from President Biden, not more lies.\"\nDespite providing testimony behind closed doors, Hunter Biden declined to testify in a public committee alongside former business associates, Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis, regarding alleged \"pay-for- influence\" schemes to provide access to certain offices in exchange for payments to the Biden family.\nNotably, Bobulinski at the committee hearing accused Hunter Biden and his uncle, James Biden, of lying under oath regarding the nature of their dealings with the Chinese conglomerate CEFC.\nIn a March 28 letter, Comer invited President Biden to \"explain, under oath,\" what involvement he had in the Biden family businesses, claiming the committee \"has accounted for over $24 million that has flowed from foreign sources to you, your family and their business associates.\"\nThe letter included questions about Biden's interactions with specific foreign business officials.\nComer told President Biden that \"you have asserted your pressuring Ukraine in 2015 to fire a government official investigating a company in which your son has a financial interest was wholly in line with U.S. policy.\"\nThe committee received bank records showing Hunter Biden was paid $1 million per year for his position on the board of the Ukrainian company Burisma until Joe Biden left office, when Hunter's salary \"was inexplicably cut in half,\" Comer wrote. The letter specifically asks if President Biden has interacted with executives at Burisma Holdings, which was at the center of the indictment of a former FBI informant in February who the Justice Department accused of providing false information to the FBI.\nThe indictment says the former informant, Alexander Smirnov, claimed that during meetings with Burisma executives, they admitted to hiring Hunter to \"protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems,\" and later that they had specifically paid $5 million for such protection. But the DOJ goes on the claim that those events that Smirnov first reported to the FBI Agent in June 2020 were \"fabrications.\"\nSauber, who was brought on in 2022 to oversee the president's response to congressional investigations into the Biden family, is leaving the White House early next month to return to the private sector.\nTo replace him, the White House is elevating his deputy, Rachel Cotton.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Danielle Wallace","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2130585647.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.532838,"_id":"af4de93376c079da83c5b0bebec45003"},{"title":"WATCH: New Biden campaign ad makes subtle claim about president's mental fitness","author":"Brandon Gillespie","published_date":"2024-04-18 22:35:34","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-biden-campaign-ad-claim-presidents-mental-fitness","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The Biden campaign has released a new ad that includes a subtle claim about the president's mental acuity, including calling him \"sharp as a knife.\"","summary":"A new Biden campaign ad focused on the economy and infrastructure included a subtle claim about the president's mental fitness, calling him \"sharp as a knife.\"\nThe Thursday ad, titled \"Sharp,\" centered on Pennsylvania steelworker Jojo Burgess, who spent most of the 30-second video praising Biden over his handling of the economy and infrastructure, but briefly appeared to reference the president's mental acuity by using the same descriptor repeated by the administration and Democrats to defend his cognitive ability earlier this year.\n\"I've been a proud steelworker for 23 years, and I know hard work when I see it. I love to tell the story about meeting President Biden because when you meet him, this guy is as sharp as a knife,\" Burgess said in the video.\n\"They have nothing else to attack because they can't attack the things that he is doing that are so good for this country.

Kennedy, Jr. getting 9%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 2% each. In January, it was Trump who was up by 3 points over Biden, with Kennedy at 7%.\nKennedy receives a bit more of his backing from those who favor Trump (9%) in the 2-way ballot than from Biden (5%).\nBiden won Wisconsin in 2020 by 20,682 votes, less than one percentage point. Trump's 2016 victory was also by less than a point (22,748 votes).\nMore voters trust Trump to do a better job handling immigration (by 13 points) and the economy (+9). Biden is preferred over Trump on abortion (+9), health care (+7), and election integrity (+7). They are rated more evenly on foreign policy (Trump +2) and energy policy (even).\nOn the Middle East, equal numbers think the Biden administration is too supportive of the Israelis (25%) and the Palestinians (24%). Yet the largest share says Biden's support of each is about right (38%) \u2014 and they favor him over Trump by 38 points.\nOverall, Wisconsinites feel somewhat positive about their personal finances, as 6 in 10 say their situation is either holding steady (45%) or improving (14%). Both of those groups largely favor Biden, while the 4 in 10 who are falling behind financially go for Trump by a wide margin.\nIn the Congressional ballot test, 46% go for the Democratic candidate in their district and 45% for the Republican. Neither Biden nor Trump is a drain on his party, as 94% of those backing the Congressional Democrat favor Biden and 93% of those supporting the Republican go for Trump.\n\"Data from the 2022 election suggests MAGA candidates ran three to four points worse than non-MAGA Republicans,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts Fox News polls with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"But we're not seeing that \u2018Trump tax' so far in the 2024 numbers. Neither are we seeing Biden underperforming other Democrats. It looks like partisans are behaving like partisans.\"\nBy a 5-point margin, more voters think Trump (48%) has the mental soundness to serve effectively as president than Biden (43%). Most Republicans (89%) say Trump has it and most Democrats say Biden does (85%), but independents are 17 points more likely to say Trump is mentally fit.\nThe survey finds 44% approve of Biden's job performance and 55% disapprove \u2014 unchanged since January (44-56%). His 48% support in the 2-way race is higher than his approval because 10% of those disapproving of the job he's doing still pick him over Trump.\nNearly two-thirds think Biden was legitimately elected in 2020, and they back him over Trump by 53 points and are twice as likely to approve of the job he's doing (67% approve, 32% disapprove). Among the one-third who say Biden was not legitimately elected, 98% favor Trump in the 2-way race and 98% disapprove of Biden's job performance.\nWisconsin voters are unified when it comes to having a negative opinion of both Biden and Trump. Views of each are net negative by a 10-point margin, as they both receive the same rating: 44% favorable vs 54% unfavorable.\nKennedy's ratings are negative by 13 points, 35% favorable vs. 48% unfavorable. He's viewed much more positively by Republicans (49%) and independents (44%) than Democrats (19%).\nAmong the small segment of so-called double haters (those viewing both Biden and Trump unfavorably), the vote preference splits: Biden 38% vs. Trump 39% % in the two-way ballot test. When third-party candidates are included, they back Kennedy (34%), followed by Biden (21%), Trump (13%), West (10%), and Stein (9%).\nConducted April 11-16, 2024 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,198 Wisconsin registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (174) and cellphones (669) or completed the survey online after receiving a text message (355). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of \u00b13 percentage points. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics are representative of the registered voter population.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Dana Blanton","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/01/biden-trump-split.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.5060353,"_id":"a0b6ae7fb4e0b2473478bf9fd2ccbebd"},{"title":"Biden aides allegedly call Trump 'Hitler Pig' behind the scenes: report","author":"Lindsay Kornick","published_date":"2024-04-18 14:36:28","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-aides-allegedly-call-trump-hitler-pig-behind-scenes","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"A Politico report on Wednesday claimed that younger aides in the Biden administration privately refer to former President Donald Trump as 'Hitler Pig.\"","summary":"The Biden White House reportedly uses nicknames of its own to refer to former President Trump.\nPolitico's West Wing Playbook reported on Wednesday that four people \"in Biden's orbit\" confirmed that the \"generally younger, more digitally native\" aides and allies of President Biden frequently use the term \"Hitler Pig\" to describe Trump, with one source clarifying this did not include senior staffers.\n\"According to the four people who were granted anonymity to speak to West Wing Playbook about the term's usage in Biden world, it started in late 2022 after Trump invited Nick Fuentes, an avowed white nationalist and Holocaust denier, to dinner at Mar-a-Lago along with the rapper Kanye West,\" the report read.\nIt continued, \"Calling Trump \u2018Hitler Pig' is not so much an attempt to inject some levity into private conversations as it is a way to characterize what Biden aides see as one of Trump's most outrageous behavior patterns, the four people all said.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment.\nThough Biden has not publicly used names like this to refer to Trump, the president reportedly has harsher words for him in private.

I guess we can call it the Biden doctrine, the \"don't\" doctrine, is disregarded by our enemies, it is disregarded by our allies, and a few weeks ago, well the Houthi rebels, you might recall, they ignored Biden's \"don't\" and continued to attack cargo ships.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Fox News Staff","media":"https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/0fd45149-d357-4848-9ec2-e51bc1a47627/de20b14b-3142-4d10-97f7-cbc88f493c4e/1280x720/match/image.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.458386,"_id":"732b5506627ce7e69bf07b56bdd84825"},{"title":"Biden dismisses reporter seeing 'a lot of Trump signs' in PA: 'You're driving in the wrong places, pal'","author":"Hanna Panreck","published_date":"2024-04-18 15:33:13","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-asked-bluntly-thinks-trouble-pa-reporter-cites-trump-signs-area","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"A reporter bluntly asked President Biden if he felt he was in \"trouble\" in the state of Pennsylvania, citing a lot of Donald Trump signs throughout the area.","summary":"President Biden was asked bluntly this week if he was in \"trouble\" in Pennsylvania, as the reporter noted he saw a lot of Donald Trump signs throughout the state.\nThe president spoke to Nexstar's Reshad Hudson for an interview that aired on Wednesday. Hudson said while driving around the area, \"you see a lot of Trump signs, not very many Biden signs.\"\n\"Do you feel like you're in trouble here?\" Hudson asked.\nBiden responded, \"Well, you haven't been driving in the right places, pal.\"\nBiden touted his volunteers, his campaign headquarters and said \"tens of thousands\" of Pennsylvanians had contributed to his campaign.\n\"Guess what the average contribution is? Less than $200, because almost 97% of all our contributions are from small donors,\" the president continued.\n\"He hasn't opened a single headquarters here, we've opened multiple headquarters here. He has no presence here,\" Biden said, referring to Trump.\nHudson also asked Biden to respond to Trump's claim that Biden was \"responsible\" for the former president spending all his time in court.\n\"His lack of ethics has nothing to do with me,\" Biden said. \"I have not once talked to anyone in my administration about Trump's legal problems.\"\n\"I have nothing to do with that,\" Biden continued.\nJury selection for the hush money case against Donald Trump in Manhattan is set to continue on Thursday.\nDistrict Attorney Alvin Bragg charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The charges are related to alleged hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Fox News Digital previously reported.\nTrump won the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania in 2016 against Hillary Clinton, but Biden came out on top in the 2020 election.\nThe former president has a narrow lead over Biden among registered voters in the key swing state, according to a Fox News poll published in March.\nIn a hypothetical 2020 rematch, 49% of all voters said they would vote for Trump, while 47% said they would vote for Biden.

Today, they prefer Trump by 3 points.\nA new Fox News survey of Michigan registered voters finds President Biden receives 46% support to former President Trump's 49%. That's within the margin of sampling error. In February, it was 45% Biden \u2014 47% Trump. In April 2020, Biden was at 49% to Trump's 41%.\nTrump's advantage is mainly due to a 19-point lead among men. He is also the favorite among White men without a college degree (by 33 points), rural voters (+23), voters under age 35 (+16), and White voters (+13). Plus, he is helped by a 4-point edge among independents as well as garnering a bit more support among Republicans (94%) than Biden gets among Democrats (92%).\nBiden's best groups include Black voters (+56), urban voters (+27), suburban women (+21), and voters ages 65 and over (+14).\nSince February, Trump is up 5 points among men, and while Biden has made similar gains among Black voters (+7), his 75% support among Blacks is about 20 points below where it was when he won Michigan in 2020.\nVoters living in union households go for Biden by 12 points, while the much larger non-union segment backs Trump by 7.\nTrump retains more of his 2020 voters, with 95% still supporting him compared to 90% of Biden's 2020 voters backing him.\nIn a potential 5-way race, Trump is ahead of Biden by 42%-40%, with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. receiving 9%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 2% each. It was announced Thursday that Kennedy will appear on the ballot in Michigan in November.\nBiden won Michigan by less than three percentage points in 2020. Ninety-six percent of Democrats voted for him, but fewer of them today, 83%, approve of the job he is doing.\nThe president's overall job rating stands at 43% approve and 56% disapprove. Some 11% of those disapproving of Biden's job performance still prefer him over Trump in the matchup.\nMichiganders have mixed views of Biden's approach to the Israel and Hamas war in Gaza, with 24% saying he is too supportive of the Israelis, 21% too supportive of the Palestinians, and 40% about right. Democrats (33%) and independents (22%) are more likely than Republicans (15%) to think Biden is too supportive of the Israelis -- and that shows up in the presidential vote preference. More than one-third of those saying Biden is too close to Israel back Trump (35%), the highest of the four battleground states where Fox News conducted surveys this week (Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin).\nJust over half of Michigan voters are either getting ahead financially or holding steady and those voters choose Biden, while just under half are falling behind and they go big for Trump.\nMore voters trust Trump by wide margins on some of the major issues of the campaign \u2014 immigration (+15 points), the economy (+11 points), and foreign policy (+8), while Biden is more narrowly preferred on election integrity (+6), health care (+6), and abortion (+5). The two are trusted about evenly on energy policy (Trump +2).\nBy a 9-point margin, more think Trump (49%) has the mental fitness to serve effectively as president than Biden (40%). Some 22% of Democrats think Biden lacks the metal soundness to serve. That's more than twice the number of Republicans who say the same about Trump (10%).\nMajorities of voters under age 35 disapprove of Biden (63%), think he lacks the mental fitness to serve (68%), trust Trump to handle the economy (61%), and favor Trump in the head-to-head ballot (+16 points).\nOverall, more voters view Biden negatively than positively by 16 points (41% favorable, 57% unfavorable). Trump's personal rating is also in negative territory but by a narrower 8 points (45-53%). Kennedy is underwater by 3 (39-42%), with one in five unable to rate him (19%).\nForty-six percent of voters say they would back the Republican candidate for Congress in their district, while 43% prefer the Democrat. Almost all of those backing the Democratic candidate go for Biden (92%) and most of those favoring the Republican candidate back Trump (93%).\nConducted April 11-16, 2024 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,126 Michigan registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (186) and cellphones (653) or completed the survey online after receiving a text message (287). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sample error of \u00b13 percentage points. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics of respondents are representative of the registered voter population.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Dana Blanton","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Donald-Trump-NYC-Criminal-Case_04.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.4417863,"_id":"4ab75dd7e27d8720bdce0b533af1b3bb"},{"title":"New poll reveals voters prefer Trump on these key issues","author":"Aubrie Spady","published_date":"2024-04-22 23:03:48","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-leads-biden-important-issues-voters-2024-election-polls-show","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"NBC News polling reveals most voters prefer Trump over Biden to handle the issue at the border and rising costs, the top two issues going into the 2024 election.","summary":"Most voters prefer former President Donald Trump to handle their top issues over President Joe Biden ahead of the 2024 election, recent polling shows.\nA new NBC News poll found that inflation is the number one issue for voters going into November \u2014 an issue that most respondents believe would be better handled by Trump than the current president.\nWhen asked who they preferred to handle the issue of rising costs, the majority of respondents, 52%, said they prefer Trump to Biden.\nOnly 30% of likely voters said that they believe Biden is better at leading on the issue.\nThe survey also found that the crisis at the southern border is the second most important issue to voters, another area where Biden was found to trail Trump.\nWhen asked about their opinion of the president's handling of immigration and the crisis at the border, a whopping 69% of respondents said they disapprove of Biden's handling of the crisis.\nThe NBC poll from April did not ask respondents their current view of Trump's handling of the immigration crisis, but an NBC survey from January revealed that 57% of respondents preferred the former president's handling of the issue at the border over only 22% who favored Biden.\nThe poll also found that if the election were held today, Trump bests Biden by 2-points, 46% to 44%.\nThe results are the most recent in a string of polling that shows voters are not only most worried about the border and rising costs, but that they trust Trump to be the best presidential candidate to handle the issues.\nRecent Fox News statewide surveys in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin mirrored the results that Trump is the preferred candidate to handle the issues of immigration and the economy over Biden.\nAdditionally, a recent Axios/Ipsos survey found that 42% of Latino voters believe Trump is good for the economy, while only 20% could say the same about Biden. On the issue of immigration, 29% of Latino respondents gave Trump a positive rating, over 22% who preferred Biden.\nThe NBC poll was conducted from April 12 to 16, 2024 with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Aubrie Spady Andrew Murray,Andrew Murray,Aubrie Spady","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/Trump-Biden-Split-Photo-1.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.43624,"_id":"d13fe601fc94579965545a190c83f0e8"},{"title":"SOUNDING OFF: Morgan Ortagus and Gen.

Pritzker, D-Ill., suggested Sunday that there were only two real choices for president in the upcoming election, and argued Democratic voters were throwing away their votes by supporting anyone other than President Biden.\nCNN's Dana Bash pressed Pritzker, who was recently campaigning for the president in Michigan, on RFK Jr.'s standing in the presidential race, as he will be on the ballot in both Michigan and Hawaii.\n\"Does Kennedy being on the ballot there pose a real threat to Joe Biden's re-election?\" Bash asked.\nPritzker touted \"very high\" enthusiasm among Democrats in the state. RFK Jr. gained ballot access in the battleground state of Michigan on Thursday.\n\"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. being on the ballot in Michigan, I think, is going to have little effect on the ultimate result. People understand that there are really only two candidates that have a path to victory in this country and in Michigan. And of course, that's Joe Biden and Donald Trump,\" Pritzker said, noting that the two had \"very different sets of values.\"\nBash pushed back and said the governor was talking about the election as if it was a \"binary choice.\"\n\"It's not a binary choice, and RFK Jr. does provide a third-way for people who just don't like what Joe Biden, or even Donald Trump for that matter, but in this particular case, it's Joe Biden I'm asking about, don't like what he's selling,\" Bash said.\nPritzker said he wasn't denying there were other names on the ballot, but argued Biden was the only real choice.\n\"I'm suggesting simply that when people go to the ballot box in November, they're going to see that there are really only two choices, because it's throwing away your vote if you're a Democrat and you vote for someone else on that ballot other than Joe Biden,\" he said.\n\"And I believe that people will see that contrast of values that I'm talking about and understand that they've got to vote for Joe Biden if they want to make sure that the United States does not fall into the hands of someone who is frankly a sociopath, has been indicted 91 times, and is someone who would take this country backward,\" he continued.\nMichigan, a crucial battleground state, also saw a group of progressive voters protest the Democratic primary in the state, as many voted \"uncommitted\" instead of supporting the president. Biden is facing mounting backlash from the left over his handling of Israel.\nCNN reporter Harry Enten warned in March that Kennedy was \"polling north of 15% nationally.\"\nProviding historical context, Enten compared the strength of Kennedy's support to famed independent candidate Ross Perot, who earned nearly 20% of the vote in the 1992 presidential election and nearly 10% in the 1996 election.\nPolls have shown Kennedy and other third-party candidates hurting both Trump and Biden, but a poll published in March showed Trump ahead of Biden among registered voters in Michigan at 41%.

President Biden is appeasing Iran because polls are looking bad and his base is angry at him for backing our ally Israel.","summary":"Did President Joe Biden receive advance warning of Iran's strike against Israel? Reuters is reporting that \"Iraqi, Turkish and Jordanian officials each said Iran had provided early warning of the attack last week, including some details.\" They further reported that Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said on Sunday that \"Iran gave neighbouring countries and Israel's ally the United States 72 hours' notice it would launch the strikes,\" according to Reuters.\nU.S. News and World Report also reports that Iran alerted Turkey to its planned operation against Israel and adds that \"Washington had conveyed to Tehran via Ankara that any action it took had to be 'within certain limits.'\"\nThe White House denies the story, which implies that Biden might have greenlighted the drone and missile onslaught, but it fits. Biden has been playing both sides of the field, declaring his support of Israel \"rock solid and unwavering\" until, that is, it began to cost the president political support.\nYoung people, key to Biden's reelection, are angry about Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, and have turned negative on the president's support of our ally. With pro-Palestinian demonstrations erupting across the nation and polls showing young voters gravitating to former President Donald Trump, Biden's support of the Jewish state has started \u2026 wavering.\nBiden told Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu over the weekend he will not back Israel in countering Iran's attack. Certainly no one wants a broad war in the region, and it is possible that a retaliatory move by Israel could provoke another round of attacks, and then another.\nBut Biden's caution could also be interpreted as yet another sign that the president, desperate to win in November, will do almost anything to prevent higher oil prices, another political tripwire.\nOn Maria Bartiromo's Fox Business show recently, Florida Republican Congressman Michael Waltz urged the Biden White House to \"cut off Iran's cash.\" Waltz forgets one thing: doing so would require curtailing Tehran's oil exports and would send energy prices through the roof. That is unacceptable to Biden.\nHence, Biden's appeasement of Tehran. When Trump left office, Iran was broke and isolated. Their Arab enemies in the region were increasingly united under the Abraham Accords, establishing diplomatic relations with Israel and forming a powerful bloc to counter Iran's malicious terror activities.\nWhat a difference three-and-a-half years makes.\nThe Biden White House enriched Iran by failing to enforce the tough sanctions imposed by the Trump administration, and by permitting $10 billion in relief funds to flow to Tehran, purportedly to buy electricity from Iraq. Biden's crack foreign policy team claims that this money will be used exclusively for humanitarian purposes, but all funds are fungible. Money for electricity also buys drones, and military aggression.\nBiden has turned a blind eye to the country's surging oil exports. Over the past year, Iran's production jumped by 50%, to a five-year high. This, despite ongoing Trump-era sanctions which supposedly limited Tehran's exports. The International Energy Agency reports that Iran exported 1.29 million barrels per day of crude oil last year and predicts overall production will increase another 160,000 barrels per day this year. Most incremental output has gone to China.\nWhy would Biden allow Iran to export more oil and stockpile money? Because he took office promising to end fossil fuel production on federal lands in the U.S. and committing to an improbable and hopelessly expensive switch to green energy.\nIt is nearly impossible that his team did not anticipate the cost to Americans, in the form of higher energy and electricity prices, of his \"green revolution\"; actually, given the extreme ideologues driving the White House bus, it is entirely possible.\nOn numerous fronts, including canceling the Keystone Pipeline, halting drilling permits and leases and raising the costs of exploration, Biden showily stalled the upward march of U.S. oil production that occurred under Trump. As a consequence, as the economy rebounded from the COVID-19 downturn, and when Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, oil prices rose and gasoline prices surged to an all-time high. Americans blamed Biden.\nWhen gasoline prices set records of $5 per gallon in June 2022, the Biden White House sensed electoral danger, and set out to buttress U.S. oil production by seeking incremental supplies wherever they could find them, including our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. They even sought help from Saudi Arabia, a country spurned by Biden, only to be turned down flat.\nWhen oil prices surged again last year, the White House even lifted sanctions on Venezuela, another unfriendly major oil exporter, under a flimsy agreement that required the country's hated leader Nicolas Maduro to allow free elections. When oil prices receded and the White House no longer needed to court the dictator, who of course did not allow a fair vote in his country's election, they resurrected most of the sanctions.\nBut Biden's caution could also be interpreted as yet another sign that the president, desperate to win in November, will do almost anything to prevent higher oil prices, another political tripwire.\nMeanwhile, they also allowed Iran's exports to rise. The excuse? Biden's team insisted they wanted to revive the Iran nuclear deal. Obama failed to produce an agreement that would prevent Iran from creating a nuclear weapon, as did Biden. The collapse of negotiations was almost guaranteed by repeated indications that Iran lied about ongoing uranium enrichment activity and its hidden efforts to build a nuclear device.\nToday, you can be sure Biden will continue his appeasement of the Islamic state, hoping that their oil exports will continue uninterrupted as he campaigns for reelection \u2013 even as Iran continues its malevolent activities in the region which now include, for the first time, directly attacking Israel.\nAs he ran for president, Joe Biden claimed to have extraordinary diplomatic capabilities and experience. During his presidency, he has directed the most humiliating military withdrawal in our history as we hastily abandoned Afghanistan, permitted Putin's deadly invasion of Ukraine, despite having ample warning, and has now reportedly signed off on Iran attacking our long-time ally, Israel.\nBiden reportedly wanted to be a historic president. Sadly, he is just that.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Company.

Finnegan Jr., was eaten in Papua New Guinea, came during a speech to a steelworkers union in Pittsburgh last week.\n\"President Biden's remarks may have been a slip of the tongue; however, my country does not deserve to be labeled as such,\" Marape said in a statement. \"World War II was not the doing of my people; however, they were needlessly dragged into a conflict that was not their doing.\"\n\"The remains of WWII lie scattered all over PNG, including the plane that carried President Biden's uncle,\" he continued. \"Perhaps, given President Biden's comments and the strong reaction from PNG and other parts of the world, it is time for the USA to find as many remains of World War II in PNG as possible, including those of servicemen who lost their lives like Ambrose Finnegan.\"\nMarape added that Papua New Guinea citizens continue to live in fear of active bombs dating back to the 20th century conflict. He said the country is littered with human remains, plane wrecks, ship wrecks, tunnels and bombs from World War II.\nOn Wednesday, during his speech at the United Steelworkers headquarters, Biden recalled his uncle's military service and how he flew a single-engine plane for the U.S. Army to collect reconnaissance. The president said Finnegan was gunned down in Papua New Guinea and his body was never recovered, pointing to the existence of cannibals in the nation.\n\"And he got shot down in New Guinea, and they never found the body because there used to be \u2013 there were a lot of cannibals, for real, in that part of New Guinea,\" Biden said.\nAfter the comments were criticized, though, the White House defended the president. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Thursday that Biden made the comments while having an \"emotional moment.\"\n\"So, his uncle, who lost his life when the military aircraft he was on crashed in the Pacific after taking off near New Guinea. The president highlighted his uncle's story as he made the case for honoring our sacred commitment to equip those we send to war and take care of them and their families when they come home,\" Jean-Pierre said.\nMeanwhile, Biden's remarks came days after his latest call with Chinese President Xi Jinping on April 2. Papua New Guinea has emerged as a potential strategic ally amid tensions between the U.S. and China.\nThe White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Thomas Catenacci","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/PNG-PM_Biden-split.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.3685713,"_id":"da1c8182c3e8e58e749615a900f0145c"},{"title":"Muslim voters outraged with Biden after House passes $26 billion Israel aid with his blessing","author":"Anders Hagstrom","published_date":"2024-04-21 15:09:43","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/muslim-voters-outraged-biden-house-passes-26-billion-israel-aid-his-blessing","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Muslim voters and organizations had heavy criticism for President Biden after the House passed legislation providing $26 billion in military funding for Israel.","summary":"President Biden is facing heavy pushback from Muslim voters and organizations after the House passed $26 billion in funding for Israel with his blessing Saturday.\nThe bill also includes funding for Ukraine and Taiwan, and Biden said he would sign it as soon as it reaches his desk. U.S. Islamic organizers have been attacking Biden's administration for months over its continued support for Israel, and some say Biden signing this latest legislation would be the last straw.\n\"That heartless decision could mark the point of no return for what remains of the White House's relationship with the American Muslim community and other Americans opposed to the genocide in Gaza,\" Council on American-Islamic Relations' government affairs director Robert McCaw told NBC News.\n\"The administration is already at its lowest point in its relationship with the American Muslim community,\" he added.\nCAIR National described the aid as a \"blank check\" allowing the Israeli government to purchase the \"offensive weapons it has used to slaughter at least 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza.\"\n\"Giving Netanyahu this blank check after all of the war crimes his government has committed would make our nation fully complicit in the Gaza genocide and likely mark a breaking point for what remains of Biden's relationship with not only American Muslims, but many other Americans of all backgrounds opposed to the genocide,\" CAIR wrote in a statement.\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., also criticized the bill during an appearance on MSNBC, comparing continued support for Israel to the Iraq war. Like CAIR, she noted that the Israel bill made no distinction between funding for defensive and offensive weapons.\n\"We cannot continue to watch the carnage that is happening in Gaza and have the U.S. military assistance be a part of that carnage,\" she said. \"This is sort of an Iraq war moment. This is a moment where I think the public is not with us.\"\nThe anger comes as Muslim voters in key swing states like Michigan were already threatening to abandon Biden's re-election effort.\nMuslim and Arab American community leaders refused to meet with Biden's campaign director in late January. Arab Americans living in Michigan have traditionally been reliable Democrats, with Biden carrying over 75% of the vote in the Arab-majority city of Dearborn in 2020.\nMichigan is essentially a must-win state for Biden come Election Day. He carried the state by just over 150,000 votes against former President Trump in 2020. The Arab and Muslim communities in the state number roughly 300,000, meaning a significant drop in support could swing the pendulum toward Republicans.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Anders Hagstrom","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/Untitled-design-11.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.3276677,"_id":"37a8660f7cc8a7454ce964ec6d2c37b0"},{"title":"Black voters reportedly souring on Biden, consider 3rd-party candidates: 'The economy sucks'","author":"Alexander Hall","published_date":"2024-04-16 12:40:02","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/black-voters-reportedly-souring-biden-consider-3rd-party-candidates-economy-sucks","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"A reporter working for a local news outlet in Georgia spoke with multiple Black voters, noting that Donald Trump may benefit from decreased enthusiasm for Biden.","summary":"A Georgia news reporter observed that while voting for former President Trump may be out of the question for some Black voters, the Republican nominee may nonetheless benefit from them losing enthusiasm for President Biden and his ailing economy.\nCasey Quinlan, the economy reporter for States Newsroom, wrote a piece for the Georgia Recorder, \"Black voters key to electing Biden in 2020. Money woes make some question their support in 2024.\" She shared multiple examples of Black voters reflecting a larger trend of dissatisfaction with Biden's economic track record.\nCiting Cleveland resident Jennifer Garner, Quinlan said, \"Black voters overwhelmingly supported President Joe Biden in 2020 and were key to his win, but as many like Garner struggle to make ends meet now, there is some evidence that Black voter enthusiasm for Biden may be slipping. And Trump is hoping to capitalize on that.\"\n\"I have to work two jobs overtime just to even try to cover my rent, which means I have no time to be able to enjoy life, period,\" Garner said. \"The only way things are going to get better is if people start talking and just let them know the economy sucks. We need better jobs and more money.\"\n\"She voted for Biden in 2020, but says now that she's researching other candidates \u2014 although she has ruled out former President Donald Trump,\" Quinlan wrote.\nHowever, Garner later added that she wasn't \"leaning towards anybody just yet.\"\nThe reporter also spoke to Audrianna Lewis, who, like Garner, ruled out voting for Trump, but nonetheless laments that in this current economy, \"People are not able to pay for doctor visits and prescriptions.\"\nIn addition, the report summarized the strife of a Philadelphian named Sarah Wallace as she contends with \"$200,000 in student debt and said she struggles to get Ozempic to treat her diabetes\" and in response, \"wants to see political leaders do more on student debt relief and make healthcare more affordable and accessible.\" Quinlan added further that Wallace, \"doesn't believe the economy has improved under Biden and that she doesn't see inflation easing enough to make a difference for her at the grocery store.\"\n\"I think Biden sold all of us on his dream to get into the office\u2026 And that was that,\" Wallace said, later adding, \"Buying food, you're never buying the most healthy [food] because they're more expensive. So you kind of have to improvise what you can do, you know?\" she said.\nThe Biden campaign has been wary of Trump capitalizing on decreased Black voter enthusiasm, Quinlan noted, writing that \"To counter Trump, the Biden campaign is spending millions on radio ads in swing states at Black-owned and Latino-owned radio stations to point out the administration's accomplishments, including investments in historically Black colleges and universities through grant funding and the American Rescue Plan Act, the cancellation of student loan debt for 3.9 million borrowers, and reducing Black child poverty in 2021, which it has connected to the then expansion of the child tax credit.\"\nThe reporter also appeared to be referring to a recent statement from Cornell Belcher, a pollster who worked for Barack Obama.\n\"I think the greatest threat to Biden's ability to rebuild his 2020 coalition, that looked like the 2012 coalition, isn't Donald Trump with Black voters, it's frustration and cynicism that'll lead to an off-ramp of third-party candidates,\" Belcher said.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Alexander Hall","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/11/Voting-booth.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.322858,"_id":"a9e34ba9c83ab3603195fdaac8623967"},{"title":"SEAN HANNITY: Biden is 'willing and able' to throw Israel under the bus","author":"Fox News Staff","published_date":"2024-04-16 02:22:16","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/sean-hannity-biden-willing-able-throw-israel-under-bus","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Fox News host Sean Hannity criticized President Biden for appeasing his 'radical base\" and his weak 'don't\" message that did not deter Iran from attacking Israel.","summary":"Fox News' Sean Hannity argues President Biden has helped Iran and appeased the radical wing of the U.S. that \"hate our country\" Monday on \"Hannity.\"\nSEAN HANNITY: We will show you how the peace-loving, cease-fire crowd [was] literally celebrating Iran's attack against Israel. There are now a growing number of people living inside of the United States that not only hate Israel, but seem to hate our country as well and our way of life. And they are now openly aiding both Hamas and the terrorist state of Iran. How is that? Not being, morally repugnant, but in an effort to appease his radical base and win back voters that he's been bleeding, you know, and a few thousand votes in Michigan and elsewhere around the country, Joe is ready, willing, and he's clearly willing and able to throw Israel under the bus as they now fight back against radical terrorists, out of Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran, all supported by Iran, the Islamic Republic of Iran that is now wealthier and more emboldened.\nWhy? Because of Joe Neville Chamberlain Biden, beginning during his time with Obama \u2013 remember, Biden worked hard on that Iranian deal to appease Iran for nearly two decades, first with the insane nuclear deal that remember, the one that freed up a $150 billion for the mullahs of Iran in exchange for a mere promise that they won't build a nuclear weapon. And a short time later, in 2016, the Obama administration paid out yet another $1.7 billion to the mullahs in Iran to free five American hostages. And then, as President Biden once again unfreezing billions of dollars for Iran, this time he had authorized 6 billion to free five American hostages. Boy, the price went up quite a bit.\nBiden also eliminated critical sanctions against the sale of Iranian oil and flat-out stopped enforcing any and all other sanctions. What's the result of that? The Islamic Republic, led by the mullahs of Iran, were headed towards bankruptcy under Donald Trump. They have profited to the tune of 80 to $100 billion, under Joe Biden. And you could throw in another 10 billion for the sale of, energy and electricity and oil and gas to Iraq that Biden also authorized. Biden will also waive sanctions targeting Iran's nuclear program.\nAnd in response to Biden's \"generosity,\" the mullahs of Iran have now upended peace in the Middle East. They're funding violent proxies all over the region, like Hezbollah, the hoodie rebels, Islamic Jihad and Hamas. The barbaric attack on October 7th. Remember, almost 1200 Israelis died that day \u2013 [it] might not have been possible without Joe Biden's policy of appeasement and the enrichment of Iran.\nIran has also rapidly accelerated their nuclear program, and now they have attacked Israel directly for the first time in history, only two days after Biden issued this very tepid warning, before shuffling off to the beach for what was supposed to be a relaxing weekend.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Fox News Staff","media":"https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/a9c7c4eb-a5b1-493e-a347-31d13fe77f58/4c483236-539a-468a-a032-cb370cc1f926/1280x720/match/image.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.3187084,"_id":"4938262b3de870ce1042b2edbe74d600"},{"title":"Dearborn activists' push to bail on Biden spreads to other key battleground states","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-18 15:49:09","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dearborn-activists-push-bail-biden-spreads-other-key-battleground-states","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The Dearborn, Michigan-based 'Abandon Biden\" and 'Listen to Michigan\" movements to disrupt President Biden's re-election bid are spreading to other key swing states.","summary":"DEARBORN, Mich. \u2014 The movement to deny President Biden a second term that gained traction in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn has plans to continue a national campaign to target swing states in the general election.\n\"We've mobilized our infrastructure that we've been able to build as a grassroots movement in Michigan to support other key states,\" Lexis Zeidan, one of the lead organizers and the spokesperson for Listen to Michigan, told Fox News Digital.\nSome of those states, according to Zeidan, are key battlegrounds such as Wisconsin and Minnesota, which, along with Michigan figure to play a critical role in this year's election.\nThe anti-Biden movement stems from the president's support of Israel during its war in Gaza, a monthslong campaign in response to the Oct. 7 attack on the Jewish State by Iran-backed Hamas.\nBut critics in Dearborn, which has the highest per capita Muslim population in the U.S., have accused Biden of supporting what they call a \"genocide\" in Gaza, leading to a campaign to punish the president at the polls in 2024.\nThat campaign gained traction and national attention in Michigan, where during the state's Democratic primary, groups such as Listen to Michigan led over 100,000 voters to mark \"uncommitted\" on their ballots as a protest against Biden's re-election bid.\n\"We went into the primaries expecting or aiming to get 10,000 uncommitted votes, which was Trump's margin of victory in 2016,\" Zeidan said. \"And we ended up with over 101,000 uncommitted votes, where we also landed two delegates in District 12, in District 6, who will be headed to the national convention.\"\nThat success carried over into Wisconsin, Zeidan argued, where more than 48,000 voters marked \"Uninstructed\" in the Democratic primary instead of supporting the incumbent presumptive nominee.\nSamraa Luqman, who worked as the Abandon Biden co-chair in Michigan, told Fox News Digital that their organization has always had designs on a national campaign targeting \"all swing states.\"\n\"Those people below 30 are abandoning Biden, they're so heavily against this war. It's a generational thing, and I am talking nationally now, that's a national pattern.\"\nWhile the Abandon Biden movement garnered the most attention in Dearborn ahead of Michigan's primary, Luqman explained that the organization was actually formed in Minnesota. From there, organizers set their sights on targeting a \"swing state strategy for the general election to ensure Biden's loss.\"\nRonald Stockton, a professor emeritus at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, told Fox News Digital that the movement gaining traction out of Michigan has the potential to be a major problem for Biden's re-election bid, arguing that the president has a \"real chance\" to lose states such as Michigan.\nStockton noted that while much attention has been given to the concerns of Muslim voters in Dearborn, the movement has the potential to spread \"nationally,\" thanks to the support campaigns such as Abandon Biden and Listen to Michigan enjoy among younger voters across the demographic spectrum.\n\"Those people below 30 are abandoning Biden, they're so heavily against this war,\" Stockton said. \"It's a generational thing, and I am talking nationally now, that's a national pattern.\"\nThat trend could even extend to states outside of what are traditionally thought of as swing states, Zeidman said, pointing out that the Listen to Michigan campaign has also spread to blue havens such as Washington. Meanwhile, a Listen to Maryland spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the campaign there is now mobilizing voters to select \"uncommitted\" in that state's Democratic primary.\nBoth Luqman and Zeidan argued that their respective movements should also be seen as a message to Democrats across the country, warning them to change their stance on support of Israel's war or face the consequences at the ballot box.\n\"The grassroots movement we've built in the way that people have felt inspired and re-engaged in being politically active, we felt it was incumbent upon us as an organization to keep that growing,\" Zeidan said. \"And so now you've seen is we have exceeded goals across the state \u2026 and our next stage of the game is to get all our delegates together to continue to take our anti-war, pro peace, pro-Palestinian narrative to the convention in August.\"\n\"The President is working tirelessly to end the violence and bring about a just, lasting peace in the Middle East,\" a Biden campaign spokesperson responded to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the Abandon Biden and Vote Uncommitted campaigns.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2021280858.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.3143,"_id":"8dfce1280cad61421a1cae0d0d4c65a9"},{"title":"Fox News Poll: Biden, Trump in dead heat in 2024 Pennsylvania rematch","author":"Victoria Balara","published_date":"2024-04-18 22:00:08","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-biden-trump-2024-pennsylvania-rematch","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"President Biden and former President Trump in a dead heat in the latest Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters","summary":"The Keystone State looks headed for another tight race as President Biden and former President Trump are in a dead heat in the latest Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters, a state Trump won by less than a point in 2016 and Biden reclaimed by just over a point in 2020.\nThe survey of registered voters, released Thursday, finds the former and current presidents tied at 48% each, a slight improvement for Biden who was down by 2 percentage points in March.\nBiden saw modest gains among nonwhite voters (+5), suburban voters (+5) and voters under age 35 (+9), while Trump's coalition, such as conservatives, White evangelicals, White men without a degree, and rural voters, held relatively steady. What's more, Trump kept the advantage he had among independents: He was ahead among them by 7 points in March and maintains an 8-point edge now.\nBiden won union households by 5 points in 2020. Today, he holds the small subgroup by 2 points (49% Biden, 47% Trump). Non-union households split 48% each.\nIn a potential five-way race that includes third-party candidates, Trump comes out on top by 2 points: Trump 44%, Biden 42%, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. 8%, Jill Stein 2%, and Cornel West 1%. In this scenario, 8% of two-way Trump supporters break for Kennedy (none for Stein or West), while 10% of Biden supporters go for Kennedy (6%), Stein (3%), and West (1%).\nBiden is in the Keystone State this week, focusing on the economy and advocating for higher taxes on the wealthy as he visits several cities, including his hometown of Scranton.\nOver 4 in 10 voters feel they are falling behind financially (44%). Almost as many (41%) say they are holding steady, while just 14% say they are getting ahead. Trump leads among those who feel they are falling behind by 53 points, while Biden is ahead by 42 points among those saying getting ahead/holding steady.\nThe March Fox News Poll identified the economy as the top issue for Pennsylvanians, when voters surveyed felt Trump would better handle the issue. Trump's advantage on the issue (+12 points) held steady in the April poll.\nTrump also has a 16-point lead on another top issue: immigration and border security, while voters favor him on foreign policy by 4 points.\nBiden is seen as better at handling abortion (+10), election integrity (+6), and health care (+6).\nThe two major candidates are nearly tied on energy policy (Biden +1), despite concerns among some Democrats that Biden's opposition to fracking might be unpopular, especially after the administration paused new exports of U.S. natural gas earlier this year. A House Oversight Committee hearing on Thursday saw Republicans question the impact the pause would have on the U.S., especially internationally.\nVoters split over the Biden administration's handling of the conflict in the Middle East: 24% think he's too supportive of the Israelis vs. 23% say he's too supportive of the Palestinians. The largest number, 40%, says Biden's approach is about right.\nDemocrats are more likely to think the White House is too supportive of the Israelis, while Republicans are more likely to think it is too supportive of the Palestinians.\nBiden's job approval rating is nearly identical to his personal favorability rating: 45% approve of the job he's doing and 44% have a favorable opinion of him, while 55% disapprove of his job performance and have an unfavorable view of him.\nTrump is perceived slightly better than Biden on his favorable rating, but still underwater by 5 points (47% favorable vs. 52% unfavorable), while Kennedy is underwater by 6 points (40% favorable, 46% unfavorable, 15% can't rate).\nThe candidates' mental soundness has been a topic of debate and Pennsylvania voters are more likely to think Trump has the mental fitness to serve effectively as president (49%) than say the same of Biden (43%). At least half think they both don't have the mental soundness to perform the duties of president (50% Trump does not, 55% Biden does not).\nThe Pennsylvania congressional race is tight as well: 47% say they would vote for the Democratic candidate in their district while 46% support the GOP candidate. That's a reversal from March when Republicans were up by 3 points.\n\"The liabilities Biden has nationally are present in Pennsylvania, but they're muted,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"His standing with core Democratic constituencies is a little stronger, and he does a little better on issues like abortion, health care, and election integrity. It's the difference between being down a few points versus being tied.\"\nConducted April 11-16 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,141 Pennsylvania registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (211) and cellphones (628) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (302). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of \u00b13 percentage points.

With the liberal media and the so-called fact-checkers out there, a certain degree of innocence is assigned to Democrats when they say things that are untrue,\" said Houck.\nOther outlets continued the distancing.\nThe Associated Press featured a headline the same day reading, \"Biden is off on details of his uncle's WWII death as he calls Trump unfit to lead the military.\" In the article itself, AP wrote that Biden only \"misstated key details\" about his uncle's death.\nMSNBC's online coverage of Biden's comment on Thursday called the cannibalism suggestion \"odd\" and noted that Biden had never brought up the story before Wednesday. However, the piece described Biden's claims as simply an \"embellishment\" or \"unsubstantiated family lore,\" despite also acknowledging the military records.\nCNN reported simply, \"Biden's accounting of his uncle's death \u2014 and possible cannibalization \u2014 differs from the account published by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting agency.\"\nHouck told Fox News Digital, \"The profession in which accuracy, facts, and truth are supposedly paramount, they turn into armchair psychologists whenever one of their own lies and all but insist so and so didn't really mean it.\n\"Of course, Trump -- like any politician -- plays fast and loose with the facts, but the reality is there isn't just less scrutiny for the other side. In many cases, there's no scrutiny at all,\" he added.\nWhen asked about Biden's claim during a gaggle on Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre avoided directly referencing the cannibal story and instead focused on the event.\n\"You saw the president, he was incredibly proud of his uncle's service in uniform. You saw him at the War Memorial. It was incredibly emotional and important to him,\" Jean-Pierre answered.\nShe continued, \"You saw him respond to all of you when asked about the moment yesterday and his uncle who lost his life when the military aircraft he was on crashed in the Pacific after taking off near New Guinea. The president highlighted his uncle's story as he made the case for honoring our sacred commitment to equip those we send to war and to take care of them and their families when they come home, and, as he reiterated, that the last thing American veterans are suckers or losers, and he wanted to make that clear.\"\nWhen questioned further, she insisted that she didn't \"have anything beyond what [she] just laid out.\"\n\"But it was a really proud moment for him. It was incredibly emotional. I think some of your colleagues \u2026 were there, and they got to witness the president pray at the war memorial, look for his uncle's name, honor him, and I think we can't forget that moment. We cannot also forget what it means to be a commander in chief, what it means to lift up our service members, what it means to make sure that we respect their service, and he made that contract very clear as to what we saw from the former president,\" Jean-Pierre said.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lindsay Kornick","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/BIDEN-MAINSTREAM-MEDIA.gif","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.3050013,"_id":"6e9a17c9b3d21e5043e4bd6578aab30f"},{"title":"Sen.

I think the response will be smart. I think it'll be strategic. I don't think Israel's going to take its eye off of the prize here. Israel's got to destroy Hamas, and it's clear they're not going to get much help from President Biden. We've got to do to Hamas, what we did to Al-Qaeda and ISIS. \u2026 I'm sure it's apparent to the people of Israel that the people in the Biden administration, these folks are not wartime consiglieres... They're a lot more comfortable going on NPR and debating whether a man can breastfeed than they are... standing up to our enemies and Israel's enemies. It is what it is. We've seen that in the war in the Middle East, and we've seen that in Ukraine.\nPresident Biden left a question about Iran's recent attacks against Israel unanswered at a press conference on Monday.\nFox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy asked the question shortly before Biden departed from his presser with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani.\nSeveral reporters began shouting questions at the two world leaders, but Doocy's query rang loud and clear.\n\"President Biden, you told Iran, \u2018Don't,' and they did it anyway, so what now?\" the journalist asked.\nDoocy's question was a reference to Biden's previous warning against the Iranian regime on Friday.

Smirnov's trial is now scheduled to begin Dec. 3 at 9:30 a.m.\nWeiss charged Smirnov, 43, in February after he alleged Joe Biden and Hunter Biden were paid millions in exchange for their help in firing a Ukrainian prosecutor who was at the time investigating the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma Holdings. Hunter Biden sat on the board of that company when Shokin was removed from his post.\nProsecutors have accused Smirnov of peddling lies \"that could impact U.S. elections,\" highlighting his alleged lies about a supposed multimillion-dollar bribery scheme involving the Bidens and Burisma Holdings.\nProsecutors say Smirnov falsely told his handler that Burisma executives paid Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter $5 million each around 2015.\nSmirnov pleaded not guilty to making a false statement. He is being held without bail after a judge denied his request for release.\nWright ordered that Smirnov remain in detention ahead of his trial in April, concurring with prosecutors who argued he presented a high flight risk. It is unclear whether Smirnov will remain in detention until December.\nAccording to the indictment, Smirnov gave \"false derogatory information\" to the FBI despite \"repeated admonishments that he must provide truthful information and that he must not fabricate evidence.\"\nThe indictment says Smirnov told an FBI agent in March 2017 that he had a phone call with Burisma's owner concerning the firm potentially acquiring a U.S. company and making an initial public offering (IPO) on a U.S-based stock exchange.\nIn reporting this conversation to the FBI agent, Smirnov said Hunter Biden was a board member of Burisma, though this was publicly known.\nSmirnov is accused of having told the FBI for the first time In June 2020 about two meetings he had four to five years earlier, where executives associated with Burisma supposedly admitted they hired Hunter Biden to \"protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems.\"\nDuring this meeting, the indictment alleges, Smirnov said the executives paid $5 million to each of the Bidens while Joe Biden was still in office. The indictment alleges Smirnov falsely claimed the Bidens were paid so that Hunter Biden, with his dad's help, could take care of a criminal investigation being conducted by then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin into Burisma.\nThe indictment alleges this information given by Smirnov in June 2020 was a fabrication. Prosecutors say Smirnov did have contact with Burisma executives in 2017, but when Joe Biden was out of public office and had no ability to influence U.S. policy and after the Ukrainian Prosecutor General had been fired in February 2016.\nThe indictment alleges Smirnov transformed his \"routine and unextraordinary\" business contacts with Burisma in 2017 and later bribery allegations against Joe Biden after expressing bias against him and his presidential candidacy.\nSmirnov is accused of repeating some of his false claims during an interview with FBI agents in September 2023, while changing other bits of information and promoting a new false narrative after claiming to have met with Russian officials.\nIf convicted, Smirnov faces a maximum of 25 years in prison.\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer and GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley were approached by a whistleblower last summer who alleged the FBI was in possession of a document \u2014 an FD-1023 form, dated June 30, 2020 \u2014 which explicitly detailed information provided by a confidential source alleging Biden, while serving as vice president, was involved in a multimillion-dollar scheme with a foreign national in exchange for influence over policy decisions.\nThe source told Fox News Digital the confidential source was used by the FBI for \"at least several years,\" dating back to the Obama administration, before the FD-1023 form, and was \"found to be highly credible\" by the FBI.\nHouse Republicans demanded the FBI turn over the document, but FBI Director Christopher Wray refused a request from Comer and Grassley last summer for the public release of the form because the bureau \"claimed it would jeopardize the safety of a confidential human source who they claimed was invaluable to the FBI.\"\nWray was at risk of being held in contempt of Congress and eventually brought the FD-1023 form to Capitol Hill for House lawmakers to review in a secure location.\nFox News Digital first reported on the contents of the document.\nAn FD-1023 form is used by FBI agents to record unverified reporting from confidential human sources. The form is used to document information as told to an FBI agent, but recording that information does not validate or weigh it against other information known by the FBI.\nComer said the FBI's FD-1023 form is not being used in the impeachment inquiry against the president.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brooke Singman","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/Biden-Hunter.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.2972593,"_id":"71e8e4a0dc845add7558c1c1ed1c2781"},{"title":"Trump campaign won't say if it wants votes of \u2018death to America' chanters in Michigan, calls them 'extremists'","author":"Kyle Morris","published_date":"2024-04-17 16:15:57","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-campaign-wont-say-wants-votes-death-america-chanters-michigan-calls-them-extremists","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Former President Trump's campaign will not say whether it welcomes support from those who were caught on video chanting \"Death to America\" during a rally in Michigan.","summary":"Former President Trump's campaign will not say whether it would welcome support from individuals who were caught on video chanting \"death to America\" during a recent anti-Israel rally in the 2024 battleground state of Michigan.\nA Dearborn crowd was led in chants of \"death to America\" and \"death to Israel\" by Michigan-based activist Tarek Bazzi during the International Al-Quds Day rally earlier this month.\nWhen asked by Fox News Digital whether the former president would be open to receiving support from those who engaged in the chants, Trump 2024 spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt called the chanters \"radical extremists.\"\n\"Crooked Joe Biden's weakness and his appeasement policies have strengthened our enemies abroad and emboldened radical extremists here at home. When President Trump is back in the White House, he will bring peace and unity through strength and make America Great Again,\" Leavitt said.\nLeavitt did not respond when asked if Trump would take support from those who took part in the anti-American and anti-Israel chants.\nThough many Muslim Americans tend to support Democrats, one activist in the area, Mike Hachem, has reportedly supported Trump in the past and has been working to lead the Abandon Biden movement in Dearborn.\nHachem is one of a handful of individuals behind the effort to not only convince the Arab community in Dearborn to ditch support for President Biden, but to switch their support to Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\nBiden's re-election campaign denounced the \"death to America\" chants in a statement to Fox News Digital last week.\nWhen asked if the president would court those agitators, Biden campaign spokesperson Charles Lutvak replied, \"No.\"\nBazzi's remarks were also denounced by the White House.\n\"The White House condemns these abhorrent and antisemitic remarks in the strongest terms,\" deputy press secretary Andrew Bates told Fox News Digital. \"As President Biden has said, America is the greatest nation on Earth and a beacon to the world.\"\nThe campaign initially limited its comments to the chants themselves, largely reciting the White House statement.\nBiden's campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt told Fox News Digital that the chants had been \"condemned\" by the campaign. Lutvak reiterated that the \"Biden-Harris campaign denounces these disgusting and antisemitic remarks.\"\n\"President Biden knows America is the greatest nation in the world. Full stop,\" Lutvak said.\nThe controversy surrounding the Dearborn rally comes amid the city's emergence as one of the key centers of resistance to Biden's re-election bid. During last month's Democratic primary in Michigan, more than 100,000 voters marked \"uncommitted\" on their ballots instead of supporting Biden as the party's nominee.\nThe voter hostility toward Biden is chiefly a result of the administration's stance on Israel, which is at war with Hamas after the terror group's Oct. 7 attack on the Jewish State. Though the White House has shown increasingly tepid support for the U.S. ally, many of those opposed to the Israeli offensive remain unsatisfied.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kyle Morris Michael Lee,Michael Lee,Kyle Morris","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/donald-trump.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.289264,"_id":"6afa49a3484f4691caac65370bf6bde2"},{"title":"Fox News Politics: Trial and Error","author":"Fox News Staff","published_date":"2024-04-18 22:36:22","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-politics-trial-error","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content","summary":"Welcome to Fox News' Politics newsletter with the latest political news from Washington D.C. and updates from the 2024 campaign trail.\nWhat's happening?\n-Critics mock Biden for cannibalism story\n-GOP rebels threaten more chaos over Ukraine spending\n-Polish president meets Trump amid criminal trial\nTwelve New Yorkers have been selected to decide Trump's guilt or innocence in hush money charges from Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg's prosecution.\nThe third day of jury selection (the court is not in session on Wednesdays) started with seven seated jurors.

During the political rally, half a dozen Kennedy family members appeared alongside President Biden to publicly back him over Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who is running as an independent candidate for president in 2024.\nKennedy Jr.'s own sister Kerry Kennedy spoke at the event, stating, \"President Biden has been a champion for all the rights and freedoms that my father and uncles stood for.\"\nAfter being introduced by the Kennedys, Biden addressed the crowd. Towards the end of his speech, he asked \"Are you ready to choose unity over division? Dignity over demolition? Truth over lies? Are you ready to choose freedom over democracy? Because that's America.\"\nThe last stanza turned heads with its seemingly contradictory message.\nAuthor and Canary CEO Dan K. Eberhart commented, \"He's fine. Everything's fine.

Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.\"\nCommentator Ian Miles Cheong appeared confused by Biden's statement, posting, \"What did he mean by this?\"\nConservative journalist Nick Sortor also asked, \"What the hell is this guy saying?\"\nJournalist Marlo Nawfal posted, \"Dems really need to upgrade his [operating system] or something...\"\nConservative political influencer \"Bad Hombre\" remarked, \"Biden says he wants you to \u2018choose freedom OVER democracy.'

The president said Americans can now apply to become the first members of the American Climate Corps and get paid to fight climate change by learning how to install solar panels, fight wildfires, rebuild wetlands and winterize homes, among other things.\nBiden said he has seen the \"devastating toll\" of climate change firsthand, saying since becoming president, he has flown over all the major fires and \"thousands upon thousands of acres\" that were burned flat by wildfires.\nHe also said he met with families whose homes were \"wiped off the map\" by hurricanes, floods and storms last year, adding that last year Earth faced the hottest day on record. In just two years, he said, natural disasters and extreme weather in America caused $270 billion in damages.\n\"But folks, despite the overwhelming devastation in red and blue states, there's still those who deny climate is in crisis,\" Biden told the crowd. \"My MAGA Republican friends don't seem to think it's a crisis\u2026 they actually want to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, which actually provides the funding for a vast majority of these projects and roll back\u2026 protections for clean air and clean water.\n\"I'm not going to go into it now, but I'm not making it up. It's real. Just listen to what they say,\" the president said. \"Anyone in or out of government who willfully denies the impacts of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future, and the world, I might add. They want to take us backwards, sideline our workers, let China and others lead the race for clean energy. I'm determined, absolutely determined we move forward.\"\nBefore the president walked up to the podium, several lawmakers spoke about Earth Day, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who thanked Biden for launching the American Climate Corps.\nOcasio-Cortez also spoke about Franklin D. Roosevelt inspiring the idea through a bill he put forward in 1933, to create the original Civilian Conservation Corps. Ocasio-Cortez called Roosevelt's bill revolutionary in the wake of the Great Depression, as it put over 3 million young people to work, created 711 new state parks and improved the nation's public lands.\nAt the beginning of Biden's speech, he acknowledged comments made by Bernie Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez.\n\"Bernie, you're the best. And Representative Ocasio-Cortez of New York. You know, I learned a long time ago, listen to that lady. Listen to that lady. We're going to talk more about another part of the world, too, really quickly,\" Biden said in a cryptic way.\nDespite what looked to be foreshadowing before his speech, the president never spoke of other parts of the world, except for when he mentioned the U.S. rejoining the Paris Agreement.\nIn his closing statement, Biden spoke about Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps, which Biden said, \"was referenced by the Congress lady,\" failing to refer to Ocasio-Cortez by name.\nBiden quoted Roosevelt, saying, \"more important than the material gains, will be the moral and spiritual value of such work.\"\n\"He always put it in context and went beyond just what the immediate need was,\" Biden said. \"I'd say the same holds true for what we're doing here today as a moral imperative, and I've never been more optimistic about America's future.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Greg Wehner","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/Biden-1.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.253104,"_id":"eb28f47707f286435f2fb53e5fb6c600"},{"title":"Biden hosts Czech leader at White House to promote Ukraine aid amid holdup in Congress","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-16 00:38:05","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-hosts-czech-leader-white-house-promote-ukraine-aid-amid-holdup-congress","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"As President Joe Biden hosted Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala in the Oval Office on Monday, Biden urged the U.S. House to take up supplemental funding for Ukraine and Israel.","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden urged the U.S. House to immediately take up Senate-passed supplemental funding for Ukraine and Israel on Monday as he hosted Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala in the Oval Office.\nThe visit came as Biden aimed to highlight the efforts other nations are making to support Ukraine.

Kennedy Jr. \u2014 was overshadowed by a male protester yelling unintelligibly immediately behind her.\nThe protester appeared only briefly in CNN's shot of the interview, but video posted on X by a reporter from another outlet captured the man standing behind Kennedy screaming that he has rights and was allowed to be at the event before being physically removed. It was not immediately clear what the man was protesting about.\nFollowing the outburst, the Kennedy family, led by Kerry Kennedy, officially endorsed Biden's re-election bid. The endorsement came as a snub to RFK Jr., who they say is acting as a \"spoiler\" to Biden's re-election chances and could lead to a victory for former President Donald Trump in November.\nRFK Jr. reacted to the endorsement in a post on X, praising his family, but also noting that other family members were supportive of and working for his campaign.\n\"I hear some of my family will be endorsing President Biden today. I am pleased they are politically active \u2014 it's a family tradition. We are divided in our opinions but united in our love for each other,\" he wrote. \"I hold this as a possibility for America, too. Can we disagree without hating our opponents? Can we restore civility and respect to public discourse? I think we can.\"\n\"My campaign, which many of my family members are working on and supportive of, is about healing America \u2014 healing our economy, our chronic disease crisis, our middle class, our environment, and our standing in the world as a peaceful nation. But this will only happen if we heal our national conversation, and move from rage and fear into love and respect,\" he added.\nLast month, the Democratic National Committee launched an effort to silence the threat to Biden's re-election from third-party candidates, namely Kennedy, in the form of a team that is expected to actively combat them with legal challenges and opposition research.\nSince its inception, members of the team have posted near-constant criticism of RFK Jr. on social media and have frequently referred to him as a \"spoiler\" candidate. They have also claimed that Kennedy is in cahoots with Trump in order to help him win.\nEarlier this month, the DNC accused RFK Jr.'s campaign of acknowledging its role as a \"spoiler\" after a woman associated with the campaign was captured on video discussing campaign strategy and how Trump could win the state of New York with the independent candidate on the ballot in November.\nAccording to video reviewed by Fox News Digital, a self-identified Kennedy campaign staffer told a room of Republicans in New York that the only way Trump could win the traditionally Democrat state in November was with Kennedy on the ballot.\n\"If it's Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week.

Still, with the help of the liberal media, they're trying.","summary":"Last week brought bad news for the American people and President Joe Biden. Inflation persists and jobs are decaying.\nOn inflation, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported prices rose 3.5 percent between March 2023 and March 2024. This bad number is far higher than the U.S. Federal Reserve's goal of 2 percent inflation \u2013 and it follows three years of price increases.\nInflation continues to build even after the Federal Reserve pushed interest rates to their highest point in 23 years.\nMuch to the Fed's dismay, its restrictive private sector policies are being more than offset by the Biden administration's massive deficits. While the Fed is trying to take liquidity out of the system and force a slowdown to lower inflation, the Biden administration keeps pumping borrowed money into the economy.\nThe contradiction between the Fed and the Biden White House increases the scale of government and shrinks the private sector. Furthermore, since the federal government is the world's largest debtor, high interest rates translate into an even bigger federal deficit.\nSo, the long run consequences of Bidenomics on inflation is staggering. Measured from the time President Joe Biden took office, the prices Americans are paying have skyrocketed. In just three-and-a-half years, the price of eggs is up 49.3 percent, gasoline is up 47.5 percent, peanut butter is up 40 percent, butter and margarine are up 32 percent, electricity is up 28.3 percent, airfares are up 32.7 percent, used cars are up 20.9 percent \u2013 and the list continues.\nThe American people feel these price increases, and they are unhappy. Most Americans rate the economy as poor, while only 38 percent consider the economy is in good shape. (Under President Donald Trump, 65 percent rated the economy as good.)\nAs the Wall Street Journal editorialized:\n\"[I]f voters are downbeat about the economy, persistent inflation is a good reason. Price increases across the Biden Presidency are unlike anything Americans have seen in recent decades. They have been a particular shock for low-income and younger workers who haven't accumulated a wealth cushion in the stock market or housing values.\n\"Mr. Biden is the main architect of his inflation problem\u2014and ours.\"\nMark Halperin with his usual insight asserted: \"The story of who will win this election might just be that voters demand a change from the mind-boggling high cost of almost everything. The prices are just too damn high.\"\nAs if inflation was not a big enough problem there is a an even bigger problem growing with the employment news.\nAs Matt Weidinger outlined in AEI Ideas:\n\"[I]n the past 12 months, employment among US natives is down by 651,000. Those declines were focused on men, a group President Biden already has increasing difficulties winning over.\n\"In contrast, employment among foreign-born individuals grew by 1,266,000 in the past year, driven by the rapidly growing population of foreign-born individuals ages 16 and over in the US, which rose by almost 2.6 million during the past year.\n\"The gap between US native and foreign-born employment is even starker since last summer. Since its peak in July 2023, employment of US natives has fallen by over 2.0 million, while employment of the foreign-born has risen by almost 1.4 million. \"\nFrom President Biden's standpoint, Weidinger highlights a deadly detail:\n\"Friday's jobs report reveals that unemployment among Black or African American individuals rose in March for the third consecutive month, to over 1.4 million, the highest level since January 2022. That group's unemployment rate has risen from 5.1 percent to 6.4 percent in the past year.\"\nThe jobs numbers contain even more problems for President Biden because part-time jobs are increasing much faster than full-time jobs. More and more Americans are finding themselves working two or three jobs \u2013 often with little or no benefits \u2013 just to make ends meet in an economy of constantly rising prices.\nSo, Bidenomics means rising prices, fewer jobs, more part-time employment, and a desperate sense that things are just not working.\nStill, the propaganda media is trying hard to paint a pretty picture. CNN, for example, called the latest monthly jobs report a \"blowout.\"\nBut everyday Americans know when they go to the grocery store, pay monthly bills, or fill up their cars that life has gotten harder under Biden.\nThe trademark of Bidenomics may be the steady shrinking of products. Take a Trump-era candy bar or box of cereal and place it next to the same product today. In most cases, the price increased, and the unit size has shrunk.\nSimply put: Bidenomics means you get less for more.\nIf this economic failure persists for another seven months \u2013 and it almost certainly will \u2013 then Bidenomics may be Biden's downfall.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Newt Gingrich","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/BIDEN-NOTES.jpg","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.2450833,"_id":"23d0d43ec0059a0e7140224a37ca1061"},{"title":"Bidens report adjusted gross income of $619,976 in 2023","author":"Brooke Singman","published_date":"2024-04-15 21:29:59","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bidens-report-adjusted-gross-income-of-619976","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"President Biden and first lady Jill Biden reported a federal adjusted gross income of $619,976, according to their 2023 federal income tax returns, which were released by the White House on Monday.","summary":"President Biden and first lady Jill Biden reported a federal adjusted gross income of $619,976, according to their 2023 federal income tax returns, which were released by the White House on Monday.\nThe president and first lady filed their income tax return jointly and paid $146,629 in federal income tax, according to the records reviewed by Fox News Digital.\nTheir 2023 effective federal income tax rate was 23.7%.\nThe president and first lady also released their Delaware income tax return and reported paying $30,908 in Delaware income tax.\nFirst Lady Jill Biden also released her Virginia income tax return and reported paying $3,549 in Virginia income tax \u2013 from her teaching at Northern Virginia Community College.\nAn annual presidential salary is $400,000.\nIn 2022, the president and first lady reported a federal adjusted gross income of $579,514.

Joe Biden's policies have funded Iran's attack on Israel.\"\nBream pressed Kirby again on whether the White House was soft on Iran, and he again blamed Trump's foreign policy.\n\"Is it not fair to say, though, that there have been moves by this administration that have opened up cash and other opportunities for them, which we know are fungible in ways that are not helping the Iranian people, but are benefiting the elites and people there who chant \u2018Death to America?,'\" Bream asked.\nKirby responded saying, \"The additional funds that have been made available to Iran due to the sanctions relief program that the Trump administration put in place, can only be used for humanitarian goods. It doesn't go to the regime. And the idea that the regime was somehow felt like they were freed up to support these proxies because of that. It just doesn't comport with the fact that they have been supporting these proxies for years.\"\nHe also claimed the money wasn't \"fungible.\"\n\"They can't, they physically can't do that,\" Kirby said.\nBefore Saturday's attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country's forces had for weeks \"been preparing for the possibility of a direct attack from Iran.\"\nBiden said after the attack, \"Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attack, sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Hannah Grossman","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Jonathan-Kirby-Donald-Trump.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.231324,"_id":"b3e8a46b624e88e0eb7cf406aea262d5"},{"title":"Sen.

There's no spinning those realities and that isn't good for Biden. Only he doesn't care about your pain.","summary":"Inflation and crime, more than any others, are the political issues that voters feel in their gut rather than consider in their mind. For President Joe Biden, this is a massive problem because not only are Americans deeply worried about both, they blame the sitting president.\nAccording to the Real Clear Politics average of polls, 56% of Americans disapprove of Biden's handling of crime, compared to a mere 38% who approve. On inflation, it's even worse, with the president 26 points underwater.\nTaxes, foreign policy, even something as emotionally fraught as abortion are ideas that most people grapple with intellectually, weighing concepts and compromises, deciding whose approach they prefer.\nBut when you look at the grocery bill being tallied and worry you don't have enough left over to get your kid that thing he wants for his birthday, when you're waiting for your ride-share hoping it arrives soon, so you don't get mugged, these are visceral sensations that can't be spun.\nNot that Biden hasn't tried, of course.\nThree years ago, inflation was \"transitory,\" two years ago it was all just \"Putin's Price Hike,\" last year we were told that \"Bidenomics,\" is working, and we simply aren't sophisticated enough to see it.\nBut as the playwright David Mamet once wrote, \"your excuses are your own,\" and all three of these failed whoppers are deep in the rearview mirror today.\nNow, Biden tells us that inflation is down over the past year, but even if that is true, it is down from astronomical heights that he created when he made all the money machines go whirrrr and, more importantly, high prices are still pinching the average American.\nOn crime, it is much the same, but with a new wrinkle that former President Donald Trump has been quick to seize upon. Just in time for the general election, the crime issue has taken on a new dimension, as Trump bluntly puts it, \"the migrant crime crisis.\"\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and his husband might feel safe walking the dog around Capitol Hill, but for denizens of Washington D.C., who don't have a security detail, it is a gauntlet of carjackings, shootings and vagrancy.\nPolice officers are being attacked, nursing students are being murdered, women are being sexually assaulted, and criminal gangs are growing in our prisons all because Biden absolutely refused to secure the border for three years.\nThe inescapable conclusion is that none of this would have happened had our commander in chief been doing his job, that this parade of horribles is entirely owing to his policies.\nSuddenly, Biden says he may shut the border down in a style much like Trump's, is it any wonder why? It is because he is rightfully being politically thrashed for his utter incompetence.\nFinally, securing the border is a good idea that will help Americans, and it may be that Biden can patch together some last-minute policy Hail Marys to help him get across the electoral finish line.\nHowever, none of them will address the real problem, which is that when the American people tell their president that they are fearful and concerned, he just, honest to God, doesn't seem to care.\nWhen President Bill Clinton heard from the American people about their worries and plight, he'd bite his lip and make it clear that he understood and felt our pain.\nBiden's version of this is to lash out at the American people by basically saying, \"you don't know how good you've got it, Jack!.\"\nI'm sorry, that is not a winning message.\nJoe Biden doesn't feel our pain. Joe Biden mocks our pain.\nAnd it is always about Joe. He tells Americans struggling paycheck to paycheck about his dad in the 1950s, who was apparently under constant and brutal economic pressure, wanting to say, \"Joey, it'll be alright.\"\nHe tells the families of murder victims about the losses he has suffered in his own family.\nBiden's empathy is always directed inward.\nCrime and inflation are inescapable realities for Biden in the 2024 election. Even if they improve, they aren't going away.\nHowever, none of them will address the real problem, which is that when the American people tell their president that they are fearful and concerned, he just, honest to God, doesn't seem to care.\nThis pair of issues are emotional gut punches to the electorate and the real problem for Biden, no matter what he does between now and November, is that for three years not only did he do nothing to make them better, he told us they weren't a problem at all.\nEven the longest general election in American history may not be long enough for Joe Biden to escape these cold, honest facts.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David Marcus","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/Philadelphia-Shooting.gif","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.2200756,"_id":"00c9644b90c2d3b42cf38d684b848810"},{"title":"Bill Maher predicts Biden will debate Trump but it's 'gonna be bad' for him","author":"Joseph Wulfsohn","published_date":"2024-04-16 17:00:30","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-predicts-biden-debate-trump-gonna-bad-him","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"HBO's Bill Maher predicted President Biden will agree to debate former President Trump but insisted it's \"gonna be bad\" for Biden, suggesting he'll look \"old and feeble\" on stage.","summary":"\"Real Time\" host Bill Maher predicted that President Biden will debate former President Trump, but it's \"gonna be bad\" for him.\nOn Friday's \"Overtime\" segment on YouTube, Maher posed a viewer question to his guests whether Biden will agree to face off against his 2020 rival and \"should he.\"\n\"Well, I think he will.

Yes, he can,\" Maher said. \"No one gives a s--- about that. The chattering classes will talk about it. And the public will be like, what do I care?! I don't want to watch this all the time anyway!

Sixteen percent of those questioned were undecided.\nHowever, Biden's 8-point advantage over the former president is much smaller than his 23-point lead over Trump at the same point four years ago in the 2020 election cycle.\nThe president's lead over Trump widens to 50%-37% among registered voters under age 30, and to 56%-37% among those likely to cast a ballot in the November election.\nHowever, even Biden's 19-point margin among likely voters under age 30 is much smaller than his 30-point lead over Trump four years ago.\nAdditionally, the poll indicates that the president's 19-point lead over Trump among likely voters shrinks to 13-points when third party and independent candidates are added to the mix.\nAccording to the survey, Biden stands at 43%, Trump 30%, Democrat turned independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at 8%, Green Party candidate Jill Stein at 4% and independent Cornel West at 2%.\nThe poll suggests Trump's made major gains among young male voters.\n\"Democrats have lost significant ground with young men,\" the poll's release highlighted.\nThe president leads among women by 33 points in the poll, but his advantage among men is just six points. While Biden's lead among women is nearly identical to four years ago, his advantage among men has plummeted 20 points from this point in the 2020 election cycle.\n\"The gap between young men's and young women's political preferences is pronounced,\" polling director for the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics John Della Volpe emphasized.\nHe also cautioned to \"make no mistake, this is a different youth electorate than we saw in 2020 and 2022.\"\nThe poll also indicated that younger voters supporting Trump are much more enthusiastic about the former president than Biden voters are about the current president. More than three-quarters of those backing Trump said they were enthusiastic about their support, compared to just 44% of Biden backers who said the same thing.\nThe poll is the latest to indicate an erosion in support for Biden among younger voters. Also alarming for the president is his approval rating among those under 30, standing at just 31% in the new survey.\nThe Harvard Youth poll of 2,010 Americans ages 18-29 was conducted March 14-21, with an overall sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Paul Steinhauser","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/Biden.-Trump.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.218798,"_id":"b04d270b672f4a7e392922a3aa3e57d3"},{"title":"Biden mocks Trump for legal woes: 'A little busy right now'","author":"Timothy Nerozzi","published_date":"2024-04-18 17:17:48","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-mocks-trump-legal-woes-little-busy-right-now","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"President Biden mocked former President Donald Trump on Wednesday during a speech in Pennsylvania, joking that the Republican candidate's ongoing criminal trial has kept him \"a little busy.\"","summary":"President Biden took a jab at his presumptive Republican rival for the presidency while campaigning in Pennsylvania.\nBiden made the remark while speaking at the United Steelworkers headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday.\n\"Under my predecessor, who's a little busy right now, Pennsylvania lost 275,000 jobs,\" Biden said while boasting of his economic policies' benefit to blue collar workers.\nUnited Steelworkers endorsed the Biden-Harris ticket last month, applauding the president's investments in \"worker-centered trade policy.\"\n\"President Biden proved time and again during his first term that he stands with working families,\" USW International President David McCall said in the March announcement.\nHe added, \"His vision and leadership allowed our nation to strengthen workers' access to collective bargaining, grow the middle class, and embark on a path to widespread prosperity.\"\nWhile Biden is on the road campaigning, Trump is currently stuck in New York City for his criminal trial surrounding alleged hush money payments to Stormy Daniels during his successful 2016 presidential campaign.\nTrump has been charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.

Kennedy, Jr., who is driving Democrats to panic that his independent White House bid could lead to a victory for former President Donald Trump.\n\"President Biden has been a champion for all the rights and freedoms that my father and uncles stood for,\" RFK Jr's sister, Kerry Kennedy, is expected to say in prepared remarks shared with Axios that reference the late former President John F. Kennedy, the late former U.S. Attorney General and New York Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, and the late former Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy.\n\"I can only imagine how Donald Trump's outrageous lies and behavior would have horrified my father,\" she is expected to say.\nAccording to the report, Biden will be introduced by former Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass., who ran a failed campaign for U.S. Senate in 2018, and currently serves as Biden's special envoy to Northern Ireland.\nThe family members will then put in some work on behalf of the Biden campaign in Pennsylvania, a major swing state, including making calls and knocking on doors.\nFox News Digital has reached out to Kennedy's campaign for comment.\nThe announcement marks the latest and most forceful rebuke of RFK, Jr. by members of his family after they described his candidacy as \"perilous for our country\" last October following his decision to run as an independent instead of a Democrat.\nThey've also been critics of his past comments concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, which he once suggested was engineered to target certain ethical groups.\nLast month, the Democratic National Committee launched an effort to silence the threat to Biden's re-election from third-party candidates, namely Kennedy, in the form of a team that is expected to actively combat them with legal challenges and opposition research.\nSince its inception, members of the team post near constant criticism of RFK, Jr. on social media, and have frequently referred to him as a \"spoiler\" candidate. They have also claimed Kennedy is in cahoots with Trump in order to help him win.\nEarlier this month, the DNC accused RFK, Jr's campaign of acknowledging its role as a \"spoiler\" after a woman associated with the campaign was captured on video discussing campaign strategy and how Trump could win the state of New York with the independent candidate on the ballot in November.\n\"The only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot,\" a self identified Kennedy campaign staffer, told a room of Republicans in New York in a video reviewed by Fox News Digital.\n\"If it's Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins.

One of those uncles, he said, was Ambrose Finnegan, who went by the nickname Bozey.\n\"He was a hell of an athlete, they tell me, when he was a kid,\" Biden said, adding that he was in the Army air corps, which was in place before the Air Force came along. \"He flew those single-engine planes as reconnaissance over war zones, and he got shot down in New Guinea. They never found the body because there used to be, there were a lot of cannibals, for real, in that part of New Guinea.\"\nThe president spoke with reporters earlier in the day before boarding Air Force One and heading out to Pittsburgh.\nHe told reporters he wanted to see how his uncle was memorialized in a World War II memorial for those who lost their lives in the war.\n\"When D-Day occurred, the next day, on Monday, all four of my mother's brothers went down and volunteered to join the military,\" Biden said. \"Ambrose Finnegan, we called him Uncle Bozey, he was shot down.

Finnegan has not been associated with any of the remains recovered from the area after the war and is still not accounted for, according to the report.\nBiden is no stranger to making questionable claims. Earlier this week, he claimed he was the \"first\" person in his family to \"go to college,\" while speaking in Wisconsin.\n\"I, like an awful lot of people in this audience, was the first in my family to go to college,\" Biden told the crowd. However, less than two years ago, during a speech in Pennsylvania, Biden told an audience his grandfather played college football. In the statement, he said his \"Grandfather Finnegan\" was an \"all-American football player\" in Santa Clara.\nYears before, when he ran for president in 1987, Biden exaggerated his academic record by bragging he graduated \"in the top half\" of his class while berating a reporter on the campaign trail.\n\"I think I have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect,\" Biden told the reporter in New Hampshire at the time. \"I went to law school on a full academic scholarship, the only one in my class to have a full academic scholarship.\n\"In the first year of law school, I decided I didn't want to be in law school and ended up in the bottom two-thirds of my class,\" he said. \"And then I decided to stay, went back to law school and, in fact, ended up in the top half of my class.\"\nHe later admitted that he graduated 76th in a class of 85.\n\"I did not graduate in the top half of my class at law school, and my recollection of this was inaccurate,\" he told The New York Times.\n\"I graduated from the University of Delaware with a double major in history and political science,\" he said. \"My reference to degrees at the Claremont event was intended to refer to these majors. I said 'three' and should have said 'two.'\"\nThe outlet pointed out Biden received a single bachelor's degree in history and political science.\nSince then, Biden has told numerous stories that have also been deemed exaggerations. Mainstream outlets, including The Washington Post, have even called him out on them, including the publication's top fact-checker, Glenn Kessler.\nSome stories Kessler addressed include Biden's claim he and his father saw two men in suits kissing each other in public when he was a teenager, that he was arrested for trying to see Nelson Mandela in South Africa and how, as vice president, he arranged for his uncle to be presented a Purple Heart that he was owed and never received. The uncle died in 1999, long before Biden was vice president.\nBiden also repeated a false claim last year about his house burning down in his attempt to relate to those who lost their homes to wildfires ravaging Maui.\n\"I don't want to compare difficulties, but we have a little sense, Jill and I, of what it was like to lose a home,\" Biden said. \"Years ago, now, 15 years, I was in Washington doing \u2018Meet the Press'\u2026 Lightning struck at home on a little lake outside the home, not a lake, a big pond. It hit the wire and came up underneath our home, into the \u2026 air condition ducts.\n\"To make a long story short, I almost lost my wife, my '67 Corvette and my cat,\" the president added.\nA 2004 report from The Associated Press, archived by LexisNexis, said lightning struck the Bidens' home and started a \"small fire that was contained to the kitchen.\" The report said firefighters got the blaze under control in 20 minutes and that they were able to keep the flames from spreading beyond the kitchen.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Greg Wehner","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/Biden-1.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.162379,"_id":"213af16d574acf8172a4a3da4e0ed6d5"},{"title":"Jill Biden praises agreement to make it easier for military spouse federal employees to work overseas","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-18 12:42:24","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jill-biden-praises-agreement-make-easier-military-spouse-federal-employees-work-overseas","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The state and defense departments signed an agreement to make it easier for government employees who are military spouses to get approval to work overseas to be with their families.","summary":"Jill Biden said Wednesday that allowing federal employees who are military spouses to work from overseas is a \"national security imperative\" that is long overdue.\nThe first lady spoke at a White House ceremony she hosted with Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks and Deputy Secretary of State Richard Verma, who signed a permanent memorandum of agreement between their departments to ease approvals of remote work under the Domestic Employees Teleworking Overseas program for these employees.\nThe agreement was among steps to help military families that President Joe Biden outlined in an executive order he signed in June at Fort Liberty in North Carolina.

Times, voter focus groups in Arizona did not have favorable views of Vice President Harris, even among Democratic voters.","summary":"Multiple voter focus groups in Arizona have weighed in on Vice President Harris ahead of the November election, and their responses reinforced the notion that she's an unpopular candidate, according to a report in The Los Angeles Times.\nDays after Harris spoke in Arizona on April 12, the political group \"Republican Voters Against Trump\" invited the outlet to view videos of interviews with three different voter focus groups: one of former Trump 2016 voters who voted for Biden in 2020, one of Black voters who are disappointed with Biden, and another of \"California Democrats.\"\nThe Times reported the crossover voters' views, stating, \"Their assessments were brutal. If she is helping Biden, you don't see it. She rubs me the wrong way. She was picked because she is a demographic. The big things she had, she failed.\"\nGunner Ramer, the political director of Republican Voters Against Trump, summed up the views to the Times, saying, \"Swing voters don't like her.\"\nThe other two groups, while less antagonistic towards Harris, were not complimentary of her. \"In a focus group of Black voters who were disappointed with Biden, none raised their hand in support of Harris, with one participant calling her \u2018the bad news bear,'\" the report noted.\nIt added, \"A focus group of California Democrats, while they liked Harris, had to be prompted to discuss her and said she needed more influence and exposure.\"\nThese views of Harris are not surprising considering she is even less popular than even President Biden and former President Trump, two historically unpopular presidents.\nUSA Today and Suffolk University polling from last month recorded that around 52% of registered voters disapprove of her performance as vice president. Additionally, only 36% of those surveyed say she is handling the job well, with 10% undecided.\nSuffolk University Political Research Center Director David Paleologos claimed in USA Today's report that Harris' unpopularity will be a big talking point during this election.\n\"Usually, it's a secondary and muted discussion about vice presidents. This time, it's going to be almost a parallel and loud discussion in comparison,\" he said.\nThe L.A. Times described how \"Harris has heard the criticism since she entered the White House\" and \"stepped up her appearances with core Democratic groups\" in response.\nThis campaign cycle, the vice president has leaned into championing abortion rights. Late last year, she kicked off her Fight for Our Reproductive Freedoms Tour, touring the nation to galvanize Biden voters over the issue of reproductive freedom.\nThe L.A. Times noted that Harris' allies \"believe her role as the administration's leading voice on abortion rights will boost her and the Democratic ticket on an issue that helped carry the party to unexpected success in the 2022 midterm elections.\"\nHowever, the outlet noted that even though she spoke out in Tucson earlier this month in response to the state Supreme Court upholding an 1864 abortion ban, focus group voters didn't notice.\n\"Several voters said in interviews in Phoenix on Monday that they were not aware Harris was in their state just a few days ago, underscoring the challenge of getting attention as a vice president in an era of information overload.\"\nDuring one of the focus group interviews, Black Democratic voter Tracey Sayles said, \"If she is coming for us, she doesn't show it.\"\nOther voters ripped Harris as well. Retired military member Jeff Garland, who voted Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020, declared, \"But from what I have seen of her, she doesn't look like someone I want running my country.\"\nThe Biden/Harris campaign views it differently. Campaign communications director Brian Fallon told the outlet that the vice president \"has proven to be a highly effective messenger on issues from reproductive freedom to gun violence prevention,\" and that she is \"uniquely positioned to mobilize critical groups across the Biden-Harris coalition, including both progressives and independents.\"\nThe Biden campaign did not immediately reply to Fox News Digital's request for comment.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Gabriel Hays","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1765580230.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.132085,"_id":"443baf82a59de6decf7bd1de9129065e"},{"title":"House GOP chairman accuses key government agency of acting as Biden 'campaign arm'","author":"Elizabeth Elkind","published_date":"2024-04-22 08:00:40","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-gop-chairman-accuses-key-government-agency-acting-biden-campaign-arm","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The chairman of the House Small Business Committee is demanding more information after a GOP investigation alleged links between SBA voter registration efforts and the Biden campaign's target\u2026","summary":"FIRST ON FOX: The top Republican on the House Small Business Committee is accusing the Biden administration of using a key government agency as its \"campaign arm\" in a critical swing state ahead of the 2024 election.\n\"Earlier this month, my colleagues and I sent a letter to the SBA inquiring into their Memorandum of Understanding with the Michigan Department of State.

Biden beat former President Trump by less than 3% there in 2020.\nWilliams' committee is investigating the Small Business Administration's collaboration with the Michigan Department of State on a program \"to promote civic engagement and voter registration in Michigan,\" according to a press release announcing the partnership.\nThe press release said the Michigan Department of State would \"create a unique URL for the SBA to use to drive online visitors to register to vote,\" and that the SBA's Michigan field office would allow state government officials to facilitate in-person voter registration at the federal agency's business outreach events. It is part of an overall effort by the Biden administration to expand access to voter registration, launched by a 2021 executive order.\nAn investigation by the House Small Business Committee found that 22 out of 25 of such outreach events have taken place in counties with the highest population of Democratic National Committee (DNC) target demographics.\nMeanwhile, 11 of 15 Michigan counties that showed the largest voter registration increase over the last year have ranked highest in population of young voters and Black voters, according to the committee \u2013 two of the left's most-sought voting blocs.\nWilliams sent a letter last week to SBA Administrator Isabel Guzman demanding more information on whether her federal office is helping expand Biden's voter base.\n\"The Committee wrote to you on April 4, 2024, requesting further information about your involvement in voter registration in Michigan.

The dramatic events in the heart of the Middle East have triggered calls for the Biden administration to reverse its reportedly dovish outreach to the ayatollahs who run the theocratic state. Biden is now urging Israel to recoil from a counterstrike.\n\"This was a massive, unprecedented and unacceptable strategic attack on Israel,\" Richard Goldberg, who was a member of former President Trump's National Security Council, told Fox News Digital. \"It would be a huge mistake to pull Israel back from a military retaliation, but it's downright insanity to keep $10 billion accessible to Tehran in the aftermath. The president needs to lock down all the money he made available to Tehran these past months.\"\nLast month, Fox News Digital reported that Biden defied opponents of Iran's regime and waived sanctions on Iran's cash-starved economy. Biden faced criticism after releasing as much as $10 billion into the coffers of the Islamic Republic. In January, an Iranian regime-sponsored proxy terrorist attack killed three U.S. soldiers in Jordan.\nThe Biden administration insisted that Iran's regime can't use the funds for its growing military offensive arsenal. Critics argue that the $10 billion is fungible money and the financial allocation allows Iran to revise its budget to expand its military apparatus.\nGoldberg, who is a senior adviser for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, added, \"If the president is looking for economic and diplomatic responses to the Iranian attack, there are three obvious ones available: lock down the $10 billion, enforce U.S. oil sanctions and snap back U.N. sanctions. If Biden avoids these steps, this isn't escalation avoidance. It's continued appeasement.\"\nSpeaking on \"Fox News Sunday\" with Shannon Bream, White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby rejected criticism that the administration has not been tough enough on Tehran, noting the sanctions and other measures used against Tehran: \"It's hard to take a look at what President Biden has done and say that we've somehow gone soft on Iran.\"\nHe continued, \"It was the previous administration that decided to get us out of the Iran deal. And now Iran is so much dramatically closer to potential nuclear weapon capability than they were before \u2026 Mr. Trump was elected.\"\nQuizzed on the financial relief given to Iran and how the regime used it, he said, \"It's not even sanctions relief but the additional funds that have been made available to Iran due to [the] sanctions relief program that the Trump administration put in place can only be used for humanitarian goods. It doesn't go to the regime.\"\nFormer Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, who appeared on \"Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo,\" said he believed the Biden administration's reaction to the death of the IRGC generals in Syria following the reported Israeli attack showed how \"fractured\" the relationship with Israel had become, and that it had \"emboldened Iran.\"\nFox News Digital reported in October, shortly after Iran's proxy, Hamas, slaughtered 1,200 people, including over 30 Americans, in southern Israel that the Biden administration and its European allies allowed U.N. sanctions to be lifted on Iran's capability to purchase and supply missiles to enemies of the U.S. and Israel.\nA State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital at the time that \"the snapback mechanism is not expiring and remains in place. We do not rely solely on UNSCR 2231 to restrict Iran's dangerous development and proliferation of missile-related technologies and UAVs, but rather a comprehensive set of multilateral and unilateral tools.\"\nThe spokesperson went on to say, \"We continue to use all our tools to counter Iran's missile and UAV development and proliferation, including sanctions, unilateral and multilateral export controls, interdiction activities, diplomatic engagement, cooperation with private industry.\"\nLisa Daftari, a leading Iranian-American expert on the Islamic Republic and editor-in-chief of the Foreign Desk, told Fox News Digital that \"The Biden administration's posture in the first hours of coming into the White House was that they were going to go soft on the regime. Their policies reflected this. Their rhetoric reflected this. They sent a clear message to the mullahs that there would be no consequences for their rogue actions. What we are seeing is a manifestation of weak policies and the ayatollah's correct read on American foreign policy.\"\nThe U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital press query. A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital last week that \"Iran's political, financial and material support to terror groups, Hamas prominently among them, is well documented, and in fact trumpeted by the regime. Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. The regime prioritizes financing Hamas and proxy groups at the expense of its own people and stability in the region.\"\nYaakov Katz, a leading Israeli expert on security and defense of the Jewish state, told Fox News Digital that \"Iran has been given immunity since Oct. 7 despite the continued attacks by its proxies: Hamas, Houthis and Hezbollah.\"\nKatz added, \"What happened on Saturday night was a direct and unprecedented Iranian attack against Israel.

During last month's Michigan primary, more than 100,000 voters marked \"uncommitted\" on their ballots instead of supporting Biden as the Democratic nominee, a number Zeidan said far exceeded her organization's expectations.\n\"We went into the primaries expecting or aiming to get 10,000 uncommitted votes, which was Trump's margin of victory in 2016,\" Zeidan said. \"And we ended up with over 101,000 uncommitted votes, where we also landed two delegates in district 12, in district six who will be headed to the national convention.\"\nThe Biden campaign did not reply to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.\nThe resistance to Biden's re-election stems mainly from the president's handling of Israel's war in Gaza, a response to the Oct. 7 attack on the Jewish State by Hamas, a terrorist group that enjoys financial and material support from Iran.\nHowever, many activists in Dearborn, a city with the highest per capita Muslim population in the country, have been vocal opponents of Israeli tactics since the beginning of the war.\nZeidan, who is now serving as the spokesperson for the national \"Uncommitted Movement,\" also pins a lot of the blame for those tactics on Biden, arguing that the president has been allowed to \"take our tax dollars to fund a genocide.\"\n\"For too long you've had people being presented with the option of the lesser of two evils.

And you're seeing it globally, the costs of cleaning up after all these extreme weather events, taxpayers are having to pay for that,\" Granholm continued.\nThe co-hosts of the ABC show got into a heated back and forth over high gas prices earlier in April.\nDuring the exchange, Behar told Griffin that she had to vote for Biden, Fox News Digital previously reported.\n\"People who are like you, who say that you hate, can't stand Trump, you have to vote for Biden,\" Behar said.\nGriffin shot back and argued that Biden is not \"immune\" from criticism and said she was raising this issue because she didn't want Trump to win in 2024. While Behar said criticism of the president was fine, she complained that there were \"hideous\" things on the Republican side of the aisle that were much worse.\n\"Joy, I would argue Trump won the first time because people weren't always listening and watching the problem for what it was,\" co-host Sara Haines told Behar, before the show broke for commercial.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Hanna Panreck","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/JENNIFER-GRANHOLM-THE-VIEW.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.0976715,"_id":"65e2aad454455c271ac479bbce5ede72"},{"title":"Top Biden official's wife could face scrutiny over residency if she jumps into House race","author":"Aubrie Spady","published_date":"2024-04-19 18:42:53","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-biden-officials-wife-could-face-scrutiny-residency-jumps-house-race","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Public documents reveal Maggie Goodlander has not voted in New Hampshire's 2nd Congressional District since 2008, despite mulling a bid for the district's open House seat in 2024.","summary":"The wife of a top official in President Biden's White House is considering a run for Congress in New Hampshire, but she has not voted in the district for 16 years.\nMaggie Goodlander, the wife of Biden's National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, is mulling a House bid in New Hampshire's 2nd Congressional District, Democratic sources recently confirmed to Fox News Digital.

Lower. But so has President Biden, who wants to wallop Americans with a $5 trillion tax increase.","summary":"Donald Trump has outlined his plans for federal taxation should he be elected.\n\"I will make the Trump tax cuts permanent. You know they expire in a year. And we will cut your taxes even more than that,\" he said in a speech in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Feb. 14, 2024.\nTrump made the direction clear. Lower.\nBut President Biden has also made his plan clear: He wants to wallop Americans with a $5 trillion tax increase.\nBiden's written plan calls for a small business tax hike, a corporate tax hike, a capital gains and dividends tax hike, income tax hikes, energy tax hikes and even a second Death Tax on top of the first one.\nBiden would increase the corporate income tax from today's 21% to 28%. That's a higher tax rate than communist China and France and the U.K., each at 25%.\nNow add the average state corporate income tax at 4% and the average combined Biden rate would be 32%. That would be the second-highest corporate income tax in the developed world. Just below Colombia.\nHouseholds bear the burden of the corporate income tax in the form of higher prices and slower wage growth. Companies do not simply absorb the tax, it is passed on to all of us.\nBiden also promises to increase the tax on Subchapter S corporations, partnerships and all \"pass through\" businesses, most of them small businesses, to 39.6%. These employers pay their taxes through the personal income tax rate, not the corporate rate.\nBiden's budget promises to increase the federal capital gains tax to 44.6%, the highest rate in 100 years.\nCalifornia businesses would pay the 44.6% federal capital gains tax plus a 14.4% state capital gains tax for a combined rate of 59%. New York state businesses would pay a combined 53.4% on capital gains.\nMeanwhile, the developed world average is 18.78%. China's is 20%.\nUnder Biden you could work for 40 years, sell your business and the government could take half or more.\nBiden vows to add a second death tax by eliminating stepped-up basis when parents die and pass on homes, land and stock to children.\nBiden promises to impose a tax on \"unrealized gains.\" If your land or stock account has increased in value in the last year you would pay taxes on the unrealized gain. You have not sold the property; you do not have the income. It isn't \"real.\" Yet you will be taxed as if you had made the sale and received the income.\nBig government politicians have a habit of imposing \"trickle down taxation,\" where a tax is advertised as only hitting \"the rich.\" They lie in order to get the tax into law. Once in place, the tax gradually expands to hit the middle class.\nTake the federal income tax. When it began in 1913, the top rate was 7%, and it only hit households making more than $15.8 million in today's dollars. Now the income tax hits nearly half the country and the bottom rate is 10%.\nAnother example is the \"Alternative Minimum Tax\" imposed in 1969. It was only supposed to hit 155 high-income households nationwide. But that's not what happened. The tax gradually expanded to threaten 30 million households by the early 2000s.\nBiden is already using \"trickle down taxation\" to hit more and more Americans with his stock tax. Biden signed into law a 1% tax on companies that buy their own stock. This tax burden hits all Americans with a 401(k), IRA or union pension. Not even China has such a tax.\nBut now Biden wants to increase it to 4%: a 400% tax hike in three years. How long until it rises to 5% or 7% or 10%?\nBiden is also giving away America's tax sovereignty. He has accepted the demand of our European competitors that we set a floor under our corporate income tax rate. Europe knows that Trump has long pushed for a 15% corporate income tax.\nBut Trump has made it clear he wants to compete with other nations by offering lower taxes on American workers, not by paying American workers lower wages. Biden has endorsed the idea of a government tax cartel, an OPEC for tax rates no lower than 15% and Biden now demands we move that minimum tax to 21%.\nBiden's budget calls for a tax on energy used for things Biden does not like. Starting with bitcoin mining. Once in place, the list of future targets writes itself: gun manufacturing, gas stove manufacturing, and more.\nSpeaking of energy taxes, beware a carbon tax in a second Biden term.\nBiden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have all endorsed an energy tax/carbon tax. All but 10 Democrats in the House voted against a resolution opposing a carbon tax this spring.\nAnd all these new Biden taxes will be collected by a supersized and unreformed IRS.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Grover Norquist","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/05/Biden-Tax-Hikes-3.jpg","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.065464,"_id":"91c7bde59a44c872f0a7926c55b59523"},{"title":"Ohio AG shuts down Democrat proposal that would skirt election deadline to get Biden on ballots","author":"Anders Hagstrom","published_date":"2024-04-17 16:10:43","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ohio-ag-shuts-down-democrat-proposal-skirt-election-deadline-get-biden-ballots","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The Ohio Attorney General shot down a plan to allow President Biden to appear on state ballots despite being scheduled to miss a key deadline.","summary":"Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost's office rejected an effort by state Democrats to circumvent a key election deadline to allow President Biden on state ballots this week, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital.\nThe documents show correspondence from Yost's office and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, as well as attorney Donald McTigue, who is representing Democrats on the matter.\nLaRose, a Republican, had notified state Democrats earlier this month that the Democratic National Convention would not occur until more than a week after Ohio's Aug. 7 deadline for certifying presidential candidates. LaRose warned that either the Ohio assembly would have to vote to change the law, or Democrats would have to move up their plans for certifying Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\nMcTigue responded in an April 9 letter, arguing the Secretary of State had the authority to accept a provisional certification of Biden and Harris' nominations prior to the official certification at the party's convention.\nHe claimed Ohio law allows for a provisional move because Biden and Harris \"have secured the pledged delegates necessary to become the party's nominees.\"\nLaRose then consulted with Yost's office about the proposed solution, but the attorney general shot down the plan in a statement on Monday.\n\"The Democratic Party's notion of providing a \u2018provisional certification' by the statutory deadline simply is not provided for by law,\" Yost's office said. \"Instead, the law mandates the Democratic Party to actually certify its president and vice-president candidates on or before August 7, 2024.

He had volunteered because someone couldn't make it. He got shot down in an area where there were a lot of cannibals in New Guinea at the time,\" President Biden said. \"They never recovered his body.\"\nOn Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre acknowledged that President Biden's maternal uncle, Ambrose Finnegan, who he refers to as \"Uncle Bosie,\" did die in WWII when his plane crashed into the Pacific Ocean, but confirmed he was not eaten by cannibals, as Biden seemed to suggest on two separate occasions during his visit on Wednesday.\nWhen asked about his comments on Friday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre claimed the President was having an \"emotional moment\" when he made his remarks.\n\"The president had an emotional and I think a symbolic moment. He had an opportunity as president to honor his uncle's service in uniform. He had an opportunity to be there as president, you know, to speak to people that put their lives on the line on behalf of this country,\" Jean-Pierre said.\nShe went on to explain what Biden's comment meant.\n\"So his uncle, who lost his life when the military aircraft he was on crashed in the Pacific after taking off near New Guinea. The president highlighted his uncle's story as he made the case for honoring our sacred commitment to equip those we send to war and take care of them and their families when they come home,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"And as he reiterated, the last thing American veterans are or the last thing Americans should be called are suckers and losers. And those types of words should not come from a commander in chief, as we have in the past.\"\nJean-Pierre's last statement was in reference to former President Trump, who President Biden claimed called soldiers \"suckers and losers.\"\nTrump was alleged to have made the comments as he was set to visit the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery during a trip to France in Nov. 2018 while he was president.\nThe allegations, sourced anonymously in The Atlantic, described multiple offensive comments allegedly made by Trump toward fallen and captured U.S. service-members, including allegedly calling the World War I dead at an American military cemetery in France as \"losers\" and \"suckers\" in 2018.\n\"This is more made up Fake News given by disgusting & jealous failures in a disgraceful attempt to influence the 2020 Election!\" Trump wrote in a post on Twitter about the comments made against him.\nFormer Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told \"Fox & Friends\" that he was with the president for a good part of the trip to France. \"I never heard him use the words that are described in that article,\" Pompeo said.\nFormer White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted that she was part of the discussion about visiting the cemetery. \"This never happened. I have sat in the room when our President called family members after their sons were killed in action and it was heart-wrenching. ... I am disgusted by this false attack.\"\nFox News' Peter Doocy continued to question Jean-Pierre about President Biden's comments about his uncle, acknowledging that Second Lieutenant Ambrose Jay Finnegan was a war hero, but stating that the Pentagon said, for unknown reasons, the plane was forced to ditch in the ocean.\n\"Both engines failed at low altitude. Why is President Biden saying he was shot down? There's no evidence of that. And why is he saying that his uncle was eaten by cannibals? That is a bad way to go,\" Doocy questioned.\n\"He lost his life. It's not. Look, I'm not, we should not make jokes about this,\" Jean-Pierre said.\nDoocy reiterated that it wasn't a joke, but said again, that is what Biden said.\n\"I mean, your last line is, it's for a laugh, it's for a funny statement. And he takes this very seriously. His uncle, who served and protected this country, lost his life serving. And that should matter. You have a president that lifts our U.S. troops, our American veterans every day. Who thinks about them? Who actually thinks they're all heroes? And they are,\" Jean-Pierre sparred back.\nDoocy asked one more time why he used the term \"cannibalism\" as Jean-Pierre gave her last comment.\n\"I think you're missing the point. The point is you have a president that lifts up American veterans, who lifts up our U.S. service members. And that's what matters.

That 6-point difference is just inside the poll's margin of error.\nBiden's movement can be attributed to modest gains among Black voters (76% now vs. 71% in January) and voters under age 35 (49% vs. 43%), as well as a notable shift among the small subgroup of independents. In January, Trump had the advantage by 20 points (51% to 31% Biden), while the two presumptive candidates are tied today (42% each).\nTrump's coalition has held relatively steady, with some of his best groups being White evangelical Christians (83%), White men without a degree (75%), rural voters (67%), and voters ages 65 and over (58%).\n\"Trump stalled at 49% in 2020 and GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker was at 48-49% in 2022,\" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Daron Shaw. \"If Georgia voters have soured on Democrats even a little bit, the state is a major pickup opportunity for Trump.\"\nIn a hypothetical five-way race, Trump has a 7-point lead over Biden (46% to 39%), with third-party candidates Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (7%), Cornel West (2%), and Jill Stein (1%) in single digits. This is about where the race stood in January.\n\"Georgia may be the weakest state from Biden's 2020 coalition,\" says Shaw. \"On the plus side, if he can rally African Americans and younger voters, he might be able to recreate his 2020 victory. On the minus side, he might have maxed out that vote in 2020 and it's unclear how compelling his message is to these voters in 2024. I'm in the minority on this point, but it seems North Carolina might be a more promising target this time around.\"\nOn specific issues, Georgia continues to favor Trump, as he is seen as better able to handle \u2014 mostly by double-digits \u2014 five out of seven issues.\nNotably, Trump has the advantage on the two issues that have been dominating the campaign: immigration (Trump preferred by 23 points) and the economy (+22). He is also favored on foreign policy (+15) and energy policy (+8).\nOn other issues, neither candidate has a significant advantage: Trump has the edge on abortion (+2), whereas Biden is narrowly ahead on health care (+2) and election integrity (+3).\nForty-four percent of voters feel they are falling behind financially vs. 41% who are holding steady and 15% who are getting ahead. Voters saying they are falling behind go for Trump by 54 points, while those getting ahead/holding steady go for Biden by 31 points.\nVoters view Trump more favorably than Biden and see the former president as more mentally fit for the job than the incumbent.\nBy a 2-point margin, Georgians view Trump favorably (50% favorable vs. 48% unfavorable), a reversal from July 2022 when he was viewed negatively by 11 points (43% vs. 54%). They also see Trump as having the mental soundness to serve effectively as president (54% has mental soundness vs. 44% does not).\nBiden's favorable rating is underwater by 15 points (42% favorable vs. 57% unfavorable), and more say he lacks the mental soundness to serve by 22 points (38% mentally sound vs. 60% not).\nBiden's job approval rating is also upside down: 42% approve vs. 58% disapprove, which is about where it was in January.\nA few more things\u2026\n\u2014 Views on Kennedy are split, with 39% rating him favorably, 39% unfavorably, and 22% unable to rate him. Democrats are more likely to view him negatively (31% favorable, 46% unfavorable), while Republicans are the opposite (45% favorable, 36% unfavorable). Independents are somewhat split (38% favorable, 33% unfavorable).\n\u2014 By a 6-point margin, Georgia voters think the Biden administration is too supportive of the Palestinians (27%) rather than too supportive of the Israelis (21%) in the war in the Middle East. Still, 4 in 10 think Biden's support of each is about right (39%). Democrats are almost 7 times more likely than Republicans to think there's too much support for the Israelis, while Republicans are 4 times more likely to think there's too much support for the Palestinians.\n\u2014 In a hypothetical U.S. House race, Georgians prefer the Republican candidate by 8 points (50% to 42% for the Democrat).\nConducted April 11-16 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,128 Georgia registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file.

But [Iran] did anyway. John Kirby is with us now,\" Hemmer, co-anchor of Fox News Channel's \"America's Newsroom,\" said while introducing the White House national security communications advisor onto the show.\n\"You got your hands full,\" Hemmer said.\n\"I was looking back at the track record for President Biden. Here's what sticks out: The Afghanistan withdrawal was a mess. We failed to stop Putin from going into Ukraine. The war with Israel and Hamas has been absolutely dreadful and destructive. Again, it's the first time Iran has aimed at Israel. China's military buildup is substantial. And that was just this morning what I came up with. Can you argue that American strength and persuasion is better today than it was four years ago globally?\" he continued.\nKirby responded, \"Oh yeah. Yeah, 100% I can do that very comfortably.\"\n\"Where?\" Hemmer followed-up.\n\"This is a president who understands American leadership on the world stage. He has devoted additional resources, not just militarily, but diplomatically, economically, around the world to advance our national security interests\u2026 I mean, American leadership was absolutely vital to helping Israel defend itself,\" Kirby responded.\nHemmer also asked Kirby about whether the administration plans to reconsider allowing Iran to access billions amid the sanctions waiver on the country.\n\"Iran has been a pain to your administration. It has been a pain to Israel when you consider its support for Hamas in light of Saturday's events where Iran hit Israel for the first time\u2026 Is it time to rethink allowing Iran access to billions of dollars in electricity sales between Iraq and Iran? Will that policy be stopped, sir?\" Hemmer asked.\nKirby responded by pointing to the Trump administration.\n\"That's an item that comes up for extension every few months, Bill, and the previous administration also extended it as have we because the Iraqi people are just so reliant right now on energy, resources from Iran,\" he said.\nThe interview followed Kirby pointing the finger at former President Trump for supposedly emboldening Iran on Fox News Channel Sunday.\n\"It's hard to take a look at what President Biden has done and say that we have somehow gone soft on Iran,\" Kirby said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"It was the previous administration that decided to get us out of the Iran deal.

Both Biden and Harris did pen tributes to honor other figures on the list.\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment from Fox News Digital on Biden not being included in the magazine's most influential list this year.\nWhile the two leading presidential candidates were absent, two prominent governors, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, and California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, were named.\nBoth governors have risen to national prominence in the past few years. Trump has praised Abbott for his leadership in enforcing the southern border, telling Fox News' Sean Hannity in February that he was \"absolutely\" considering him for his vice president pick.\nIn the TIME profile, Senior Correspondent Philip Elliott praised Abbott as a \"talented room reader\" who, \"[d]espite some glaring missteps \u2026 remains one of his party's most persuasive pitchmen.\"\nRumors of ambitions for higher office have also swirled around Newsom, who similarly made TIME's top leaders list for 2024.\nMedia commentators on the right and left have suggested Newsom could be the Democratic Party's choice to replace Biden if he were to step down at this summer's Democratic National Convention amid concerns about his age, mental acuity and unpopularity. However, Newsom has swatted down rumors he's considering a 2024 run.\n\"Amid pressure for Democrats to trade in Joe Biden, Newsom has instead adopted the role of full-throated attack dog for the 81-year-old President.

That was really something else, Uncle Joe. What a way to exit the Treasury,\" Owens said, according to an email from Hunter Biden's abandoned laptop. \"I'm simply happy to be close to you, and I just wanted to say thank you for including me.\"\nIn addition to the email from Owens to the elder Biden, a transcript from Biden's speech was included in the email chain, highlighting what Biden thought about a \"rising China.\"\n\"We cannot claim the same number of Americans in China, but our 100,000 Strong Initiative will dramatically increase the number of young Americans living and studying in China,\" Biden said. \"As a matter of fact, my niece who -- excuse me, as we say in the Senate, a point a personal privilege -- who graduated from Harvard not too long ago, works for Secretary Geithner, she did exactly what we hope another 100,000 will do: She studied Chinese and went and lived in China and is now devoted to making sure the relationship gets better and better and better.\"\n\"As a young member of a Foreign Relations Committee, I wrote and I said and I believed then what I believe now: That a rising China is a positive, positive development, not only for China but for America and the world writ large,\" he added.\nThe \"100,000 Strong Initiative\" that Biden mentioned refers to the goal then-President Obama set near the beginning of his administration in hopes of \"sending 100,000 American students to China in the next 4 years to learn Mandarin, to experience Chinese culture, and to learn about the hospitality of the Chinese people, while they serve as ambassadors for the United States in China.\"\nThen-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in May 2010 she was \"pleased to sign\" an agreement with State Councilor Liu Yandong, who has held some of the highest positions in the CCP.\nFox News Digital previously reported on how Yandong would meet with representatives from the Congressional Black Caucus and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) a few years later and announced student scholarships.\n\"Our U.S.-China relationship must extend beyond the halls of government to our homes, our businesses, and our schools,\" Clinton continued. \"And these exchanges really offer the opportunity for people to connect and collaborate, and they remind us of how much we have in common.\"\nDuring Owens' tenure at Treasury, she repeatedly emailed Hunter Biden and his now-former business partner Eric Schwerin about China Investment Corporation (CIC), China's largest sovereign wealth fund, Fox News Digital previously reported. A former business associate confirmed to Fox News Digital on Monday that Owens was \"definitely a resource\" Hunter used and that a CIC meeting did occur.\nOn April 12, 2010, Owens emailed Hunter and Schwerin a schedule from her Treasury email address, highlighting a CIC investment conference that took place a couple of weeks earlier.\n\"FYI on recent CIC investment conference at a resort in Sanya, on Hainan Island, over the weekend of March 27-28,\" Owens wrote.\nA Thornton Group press release dated that same day \u2013 April 12, 2010 \u2013 said the company's chairman, James Bulger, and Hunter visited Beijing just three days earlier and met with CIC Chief Investment Officer Gao Xiqing, among others, according to the Republican Senate report released in September 2020.\nA feature article about Owens published months later by the Tower Hill Bulletin said she and her team had traveled to Beijing in May 2010 with a U.S. delegation led by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.\nA photo of Owens in the article showed her receiving a \"small jade vase as a birthday gift\" from China's then-vice minister of finance, Zhu Guangyao. According to the Ministry of Finance website, its primary function is to implement the decisions and policies of the Chinese Communist Party in the area of public finance.\nThe Bulletin article said Owens' team and Zhu \"worked very closely during the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue.\"\nWeeks after returning from Beijing, Owens emailed Schwerin a Bloomberg News article about CIC, titled, \"China's CIC May Post Record Year for 2009 as Markets Recover,\" which Schwerin then forwarded to Hunter on July 23, 2010.\nOwens, who now goes by Castello, left the Treasury in July 2011 and is currently an executive at Starbucks, according to her LinkedIn profile.\nOwens isn't the only member of her immediate family with ties to China. Fox News Digital previously reported on how her dad, John \"Jack\" Owens, pleaded for Hunter to help him secure a business license to expand his telemedicine company in China, saying it needed to be \"secured very quickly.\"\nThe elder Owens emailed Hunter on May 9, 2014, informing him that his companies, MediGuide America and MediGuide Insurance Services International (MISI), reached a \"serious stage\" in negotiations with a China-based insurance company, but said he won't be able to \"seal this deal\" without a \"Chinese Business License.\"\n\"Time pressures are very tight, plus the fact that we do not yet have one has caused a slight credibility bump in the company's mind. This all translates into a need for a Business License, and one secured very quickly,\" Owens wrote. \"While this might seem to be a mundane task, I have come to understand that matters such as a Business License can end up taking an inordinate amount of time.....time we just do not have.\"\nOwens continued by saying he would be \"most appreciative of any help.\" Hunter Biden replied less than a hour later and said, \"Working on it-back to you ASAP.\" The younger Biden then forwarded Owens' email to Thornton Group Chairman James Bulger, the nephew of mobster Whitey Bulger and co-founder of the Thornton Group.\nHe also sent it to Michael Lin, a Taiwanese-American businessman who has worked with the State Legislative Leaders Foundation (SLLF), a nonprofit that has been partnered since 2015 with the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, a propaganda group that pushes Chinese Communist Party (CCP) messaging. Lin and Bulger both arranged Hunter Biden's first business trip to China in April 2010, the Washington Free Beacon reported.\n\"See email below. It's from my Uncle Jack. Is there a way we can help him expedite this? Time is of the essence here,\" Hunter Biden wrote.\nBulger responded the next morning and said he would discuss with Lin how they can \"help.\" Three days later, Bulger sent an email to Hunter saying, \"Me and Michael had a call with Jack this morning I think we have a solution for hi[s] China problem.\"\n\"Michael and Ran are researching the regs and laws right now but our Thornton WOFE will likely be ok for Jacks company to use,\" Bulger continued, likely referring to the wholly foreign-owned enterprise of the Thornton Group, the company Bulger and Lin co-founded.\nA few days later, Bulger sent an email to Owens and Lin, and copied Hunter Biden, asking Owens to \"give us until Monday to review a few more laws and regulations in Beijing.\"\n\"I may have you answer a few question[s] on Monday so we can get specific with the appropriate authority's in China,\" Bulger wrote.\nIt is unclear whether Bulger and Lin were able to successfully secure a business license for Owens or whether Thornton's \"WOFE\" sufficed for China's laws. However, MediGuide's website says it has come to \"an agreement with AnyHealth Shanghai.\"\n\"MediGuide and Any Health intend to expand MediGuide's business in China under the name of \u2018MediGuide China,'\" the website reads. \"AnyHealth Shanghai will be legally representing MediGuide International LLC in China. \" It is unclear if AnyHealth Shanghai is the same company referenced in the emails.\nFox News Digital reached out to the White House and Owens for comment but did not receive a response.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Cameron Cawthorne","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/biden.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.0313377,"_id":"a9e7f20659bc2badf6eed5fc94dde65a"},{"title":"Biden 'doesn't understand the Catholic faith,' bishop says: 'I'm not angry at him, he's just stupid'","author":"Timothy Nerozzi","published_date":"2024-04-20 13:42:31","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/faith-values/biden-doesnt-understand-catholic-faith-bishop-not-angry-him-hes-just-stupid","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Bishop Robert Gruss of the Diocese of Saginaw urged Catholic faithful to let go of anger at President Biden, who he says is \"just stupid\" and \"doesn't understand the Catholic faith.\"","summary":"A Catholic bishop in Michigan weighed in on the discrepancy between President Biden's policies and his professed Catholic faith earlier this month, suggesting \"forgiveness\" for the president's \"stupidity.\"\nBishop Robert Gruss of the Diocese of Saginaw mentioned Biden during \"Forgiveness as the Heart of Christianity,\" a lecture given on Apr. 5 at the Cathedral of Mary of the Assumption.\nIn the discussion, Gruss urged congregants to let go of unproductive anger and resentment towards others \u2014 citing his own experience growing up with an alcoholic father and a letter he wrote in adulthood forgiving him for the trauma of his youth.\nAsking the faithful to interrogate their own hatreds and resentments, the bishop pointed out that destructive lack of forgiveness does not apply only to individuals they know, but also public figures and institutions.\n\"If you're harboring bad, negative, resentful feelings towards our president, you're not free,\" Gruss said. \"Otherwise, you're letting him control you and your thoughts and your words and your actions.

Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, sent a letter to the president Friday, calling on him to cancel the so-called General License 44, which is set to come up for renewal later this week. They argued that Venezuela's government has failed to meet key requirements related to ensuring fair elections that it agreed to when the Biden administration issued the six-month license last year.\n\"History has proven time and time again that appeasing dictators does not work. We strongly urge you to reinstate and fully enforce all U.S. sanctions on the [Nicol\u00e1s] Maduro regime,\" they wrote. \"We must not cede American leverage by lifting U.S. sanctions while the Maduro government deliberately disregards its obligations.\"\n\"If the U.S. fails to take a credible stance on ensuring free and fair elections are held in Venezuela, the prospects of a democratic Venezuela will continue to diminish, which will further embolden authoritarian aggressors such as the People's Republic of China, Iran, and Russia,\" the lawmakers continued.\nIn October, Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro signed an agreement with the nation's opposition leaders, agreeing to freer elections as part of a deal in which the U.S. Treasury Department eased sanctions on the South American country's key oil sector.\nHowever, the Maduro regime almost immediately began taking actions in apparent violation of the deal, cracking down on the opposition and imprisoning political opponents ahead of Venezuela's upcoming presidential election slated for July 2024. The State Department said in October it would not renew the General License 44 absent progress by the Venezuelan government.\nThe October agreement broadly authorized oil and gas transactions with Venezuela and came a year after the Biden administration granted a separate license for California-based energy firm Chevron to continue drilling in Venezuela. According to federal data, U.S. oil imports from Venezuela have spiked from zero barrels in December 2022 to nearly 5 million barrels in January.\nIn 2019, the Trump administration imposed heavy sanctions on the nation's oil industry after a dispute arose between Maduro and opposition leader Juan Guaido over the 2018 presidential election. Those sanctions led to a precipitous fall off in U.S. imports of Venezuelan oil.\nIn a statement on Tuesday to Fox News Digital, Sullivan, who serves as the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Readiness and Management Support Subcommittee, expressed deep concern with Biden \u2013 both potentially for maintaining sanctions relief for Venezuela and recent actions his administration has taken to curb domestic production.\n\"Joe Biden needs to wake the hell up and stop appeasing dictators and the eco-colonialists \u2013 fast,\" he said. \"The world is on fire and Biden is still focused on appeasing his most far-left radical supporters at the expense of America's national security.\"\nSullivan noted that the Department of the Interior is expected to soon finalize regulations blocking off 13 million acres of land across the National Petroleum Reserve, an area in North Slope Borough, Alaska, set aside by Congress for resource development. Bloomberg reported last week the agency is expected to finalize those rules this week.\n\"The NPR-A is one of the world's most prolific oil basins and Biden wants to lock up more than half of it. Literally, during the same week, his administration is expected to renew their lifted oil sanctions for the Maduro dictatorship in Venezuela,\" Sullivan said.\n\"Alaska, more than any other state, has taken the brunt of this administration's failed energy policy,\" he continued. \"This rule, once finalized, is on track to be the 61st action by his administration targeting Alaska. Like many others, it ignores the laws on the books and has been done without real consultation of impacted Alaska Native communities.\"\nCalls placed to The White House were not returned at press time.\nJoining Sullivan in penning the letter to Biden were Republican Sens.

Now, those systems defend Israel and Biden doesn't want our ally to strike back at Iran.","summary":"Iran fired more than 320 warheads at Israel on Saturday. The explosives were carried by about 170 propeller-driven drones of the kind Iran has sold Russia for use against Ukraine, more than 30 cruise missiles, and more than 120 ballistic missiles \u2014 mostly fired from Iranian territory at least 1,100 miles away to the east with a few launched from more distant Houthi-controlled Yemen to the south.\nThe attack failed to deliver any meaningful damage, though a 10-year-old girl was injured, as 99% of the drones and missiles were intercepted by Israel, the U.S., and likely Jordan and Saudi Arabia as well.\nWhat Iran's large-scale attack on Israel \u2014 more than twice as large as any Russian attack on Ukraine \u2014 did was show the value of a layered anti-missile defense championed by former Presidents Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump \u2014 and opposed by President Joe Biden, when he served in the U.S. Senate.\nIran's triple threat attack was defeated by fighter jets, Israel's short-range Iron Dome system, David's Sling, a kinetic hit-to-kill interceptor system with a range out to 186 miles away, and Israel's Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems, developed with the United States beginning in the late 1980s. The U.S. Navy also fired anti-ballistic missile rockets from warships nearby.\nBut, had Biden had his way in 1987, Israel wouldn't have had the sophisticated and highly effective missile defense system.\nAt the time, I was a young special assistant for foreign affairs in the Pentagon. Shortly after the Republicans lost their U.S. Senate majority in the 1986 election, Democrats redoubled their efforts to terminate Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.\nIt was a destabilizing waste of money, they claimed. They argued on one hand that it cost too much, and it wouldn't work anyway, and on the other hand, if it did work, it would increase the likelihood of a life-ending nuclear war.\nBut with Israel's advances in defense technology, combined with its location in a dangerous neighborhood, a bipartisan argument could be made that Israel would benefit from the development of anti-missile technology while America would benefit from Israel's testing data and lessons learned. Thus was born Israel's Arrow anti-ballistic missile system.\nIt's important to note at the time that Arrow had its critics in both America and Israel. Aside from Biden and the largely anti-defense left, the Israeli Air Force was skeptical, fearing a diversion of resources from its ability to deter attacks on Israel through what was euphemistically called \"preemptive diplomacy\" \u2014 the threat of first strikes to destroy emerging dangers.\nBut Israel's Ministry of Defense believed that an effective anti-missile defense would blunt the destruction of an enemy surprise attack, allowing Israel the luxury of not having to conduct diplomatically costly preemptive strikes. That has now been borne out.\nIn the wake Iran's foiled attack on Israel, Biden told Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to \"take the win\" and not strike back. Further driving the point home \u2014 likely to appeal to the Democrats' growing problem with their antisemitic, left-wing base \u2014 Biden said he wouldn't support an Israeli counterattack.\nBut just because a would-be murderer failed doesn't mean that a criminal should escape justice.\nRepublican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio called out Biden, accusing him of leaking his call transcript with Netanyahu to appease the \"pro-terrorist\" mob. Rubio further condemned the Biden administration for playing a \"public game\" that \"encourages Iran and Hezbollah \u2026 and the Houthis\" and other anti-Israel elements that make the Middle East an even more dangerous region.\nIn the meantime, domestic pressure is mounting to force Israel to relent in its efforts to defend itself by eliminating the threat from adjacent terrorist groups. Terrorist sympathizers in Chicago shut down the road to the city's airport and increasing chants of \"Death to America\" and \"Death to Israel,\" aiming to change U.S. policy towards Israel.\nThis brings to mind the Cold War-era revelations from high level Soviet defector Col. Stanislav Lunev, a military intelligence officer, that the Soviet Union's clandestine agencies provided more resources for \"antiwar propaganda in the United States than it did for economic and military support of the Vietnamese.\"\nBut, had Biden had his way in 1987, Israel wouldn't have had the sophisticated and highly effective missile defense system.\nThe People's Republic of China has a simple doctrine with regards American interests: Whatever the U.S. supports, it opposes; whatever the U.S. opposes, it supports. With China openly opposing Israel's efforts to defend itself and in possession of an economy several times larger than the Soviet Union's at its peak, as well as having powerful propaganda tools such as TikTok, one can only guess at the extent to which China is involved in whipping up anti-Israel, pro-terror hysteria in America.\nBiden's policy of appeasing Iran and its terror proxies has failed spectacularly.\nIsrael may soon do what it must, using its strength to make up for Biden's fecklessness.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Chuck Devore,Chuck De Vore","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/2024-04-14T011856Z_2_LYNXNPEK3C0B3_RTROPTP_4_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-IRAN.jpg","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.9865136,"_id":"eec1f669eeae4ce9737f193a7a93e6ef"},{"title":"GOP lawmakers slam Biden administration's new Title IX protections for 'gender identity'","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-19 21:07:01","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-bidens-title-ix-protections-gender-identity","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Republican lawmakers blasted new regulations for Title IX being ushered in by President Biden's Department of Education that would protect gender identity from discrimination.","summary":"Republicans blasted new regulations for Title IX being ushered in by President Biden's Department of Education that would protect gender identity from discrimination, while rolling back Trump-era rules that bolstered the rights of those accused of sexual misconduct.\n\"The Biden administration has completely lost its way on Title IX,\" Sen.

Cassidy serves as ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee.\nHe prefaced that his office is still examining the new regulations, \"but it appears to be an attempt by the Biden administration to pursue an ideological agenda on gender identity and inject federal bureaucrats into the parent-child relationship.\"\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the chairman of the HELP committee, did not provide comment to Fox News Digital.\nBiden announced new regulations for Title IX Friday morning, which included expanding the definition of sex discrimination to include both sexual orientation and gender identity, which the president's administration touts as protection for LGBT students.\nThe unveiled rule changes also rolled back regulations put in place by former Trump Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that ensured due process for the accused.\nSecretary of Education Miguel Cardona cheered the announcement of the rules.\n\"These final regulations build on the legacy of Title IX by clarifying that all our nation's students can access schools that are safe, welcoming and respect their rights,\" Cardona said.\n\"Title IX was meant to protect female students from sex discrimination,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Sadly, the Biden administration's new Title IX rule does the exact opposite and makes it harder for schools to protect women.\n\"As we saw in the tragic Loudon County case, these kinds of woke policies are putting our daughters at risk,\" Cruz warned, mentioning an event in northern Virginia where a female student was sexually assaulted in a bathroom by a male student wearing a skirt.\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said in a statement the regulations are \"not about protecting students.\" Instead, he claimed Biden's rules are \"about appeasing the radical members of their base by imposing woke policies that rob women and girls of equal opportunities and jeopardize their safety.\"\nReacting to the rules, Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., claimed, the \"left wants to use it as a tool to further its woke gender ideology.\"\n\"We identify as pissed off,\" Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., told Fox News Digital in a statement.\nThe congresswoman claimed Biden's administration is \"effectively saying that women's safety is expendable\" with the new rules.\n\"Recent incidents, like the appalling rape of a woman in Rikers by a biological male, are a stark reminder of the very real dangers posed by these reckless policies. This isn't progress; this is regression at its worst, and women are paying the price,\" she continued.\nSen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., who has made protecting women's sports a legislative priority, said in a statement, \"Today, the Biden administration redefined the definition of a \u2018woman.'\n\"This means that biological women now have zero safe spaces and no real identity.\"\nTuberville recently offered an amendment to a federal government spending package, adding his Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act to it last month. However, the Senate voted along party lines to reject it, including the amendment in the massive government spending bill.\nSen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., also warned of the rule changes' effect on women's sports, telling Fox News Digital in a statement, \"Regardless of the propaganda being pushed by the left, men and women are biologically different. We've seen how Joe Biden's vision for female sports will result in two teams \u2013 one team of men and another team of folks that used to be men.\"\nTwo congressional aides informed Fox News Digital that lawmakers were briefed on the changes Friday by Catherine Lhamon, the assistant secretary in the Office for Civil Rights at the DOE. According to the sources, Lhamon reiterated that the regulations would not affect school athletics because the rulemaking process related to this is still ongoing. They added that no clarity was provided as to how sports would be unaffected when gender identity will be protected from discrimination.\nThe aides additionally raised concerns over the department's lack of a plan for assisting schools with implementation, which is required by Aug. 1. The sources said rules are traditionally rolled out with a plan to coordinate implementation with schools. This often includes webinars, they said.\nWhen asked if there was a plan to assist schools with implementation, a spokesperson for the department did not answer directly but shared that it would be available to provide technical assistance and other resources when deemed appropriate.\nDemocratic House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., disagreed with her Republican counterparts, telling Fox News Digital in a statement, \"I'm grateful to the Biden-Harris administration for defending gender equality and protecting the safety and well-being of students across the country.\n\"We must stand up for the basic dignity of every person amid so much hateful rhetoric and violence against [transgender] youth and women.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/republicans-biden-title-ix.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.9854283,"_id":"445a078de6949602afb6633f43ecf74a"},{"title":"LAURA INGRAHAM: America under Biden is 'ashamed and shaky'","author":"Fox News Staff","published_date":"2024-04-16 02:00:38","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/laura-ingraham-america-under-biden-ashamed-shaky","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Fox News host Laura Ingraham gives her take on how American has changed under the Biden administration on 'The Ingraham Angle.'","summary":"Fox News' Laura Ingraham explains why President Biden isn't \"credible\" as a global leader in her monologue on \"The Ingraham Angle.\"\nLAURA INGRAHAM: \"Death to Israel.

And these same people think that if we just agreed to borrow more money, if we agreed to take on more commitments to other countries, if we agreed to trust Biden and his team even more, then things would be better. Well, they are completely wrong.\nThe American people are still loyal, they're still patriotic. They're still committed to building a richer and safer world for everyone. Most still support Israel. They still mistrust Vladimir Putin. They still want America to be number one. The problem isn't the American people. The problem is what our leaders have done to the American people and America. Measured on the basis of purchasing power parity, China's economy is now larger than ours.\nThe United States is over $34 trillion in debt and counting. The United States' intel community lacks credibility. And young people? They're not interested in joining the military anymore. Government geniuses gave in to globalization and gutted our jobs.

Nancy Mace, R-S.C., would aim to re-establish the asylum agreements entered into by the Trump administration with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The bill would withhold aid to those countries until the agreements were resurrected.\nThe agreements allowed the U.S. to send migrants to those countries to claim asylum if they passed through them on the way to the U.S. They also required migrants who cross through those countries to seek protection there instead of at the U.S. border.\nTransfers under the Guatemala agreement had been paused since mid-March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the agreements with El Salvador and Honduras were never implemented. The Biden administration terminated the agreements in 2021.\n\"The Biden administration believes there are more suitable ways to work with our partner governments to manage migration across the region,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the time. \"The United States will build on our strong relationships and support these governments' efforts to address forced displacement without placing undue burden on them, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\nBut Republicans have blamed the rollback of Trump-era policies by the Biden administration for the ongoing crisis at the southern border, which is now into its fourth year and has seen record numbers of migrant encounters.\nMace's bill, co-sponsored by Reps.

But the government went back, when I went down there, and they checked and found some parts of the plane and the like.\"\nSources like the Associated Press said the details were incorrect, noting, \"The U.S. government's record of missing service members does not attribute Finnegan's death to hostile action or indicate cannibals were any factor.\"\nThe AP noted further that the Pentagon's Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said Biden's uncle had died on May 14, 1944, as a passenger on an Army Air Forces plane that was forced to ditch in the Pacific Ocean off New Guinea's northern coast. \"Both engines failed at low altitude, and the aircraft's nose hit the water hard,\" the agency stated. \"Three men failed to emerge from the sinking wreck and were lost in the crash.\"\nWhen reached for comment, White House spokesman Andrew Bates told Fox News Digital, \"President Biden is proud of his uncle's service in uniform, who lost his life when the military aircraft he was on crashed in the Pacific after taking off near New Guinea. The President highlighted his uncle's story as he made the case for honoring our \u2018sacred commitment\u2026to equip those we send to war and take care of them and their families when they come home,' and as he reiterated that the last thing American veterans are is \u2018suckers' or \u2018losers.'\"\nSocial media erupted over this latest tall tale from the president.\n\"Unsurprisingly, Biden has made up most of this war story. Lt. Ambrose Finnegan was a ground crew member and ordinance officer, not a reconnaissance pilot,\" GOP communications expert Zach Parkinson wrote, alongside a purported military record and newspaper clipping. \"In 1944, Finnegan was the passenger of an A-20 (a twin-engine, not single-engine plane) that ditched, it wasn't shot down. The flight went down over the Bismarck Sea, not \u2018in an area where there were a lot of cannibals.'\"\n\"You know when you're talking to an old person and he's telling you a story about his life and you realize it's the plot of a movie he once saw,\" Substack writer Jim Treacher joked.\n\"Mush brain strikes again,\" conservative humor account Catturd wrote.\nComedian Tim Young argued that \"Biden has added a new greatest hit to his completely phony stories,\" and later asked, \"What the actual f*ck?!?!\"\n\"One false claim by @JoeBiden after another,\" Crime Prevention Research Center president John R Lott Jr. wrote.\n\"'Corn Pop' has been replaced by \u2018Uncle Bosey!'\" radio host Mike Opelka wrote, referring to the subject of a previous Biden story.\n\"This is like something out of a bad script that a 12 year old would write,\" radio host Mike Gallagher wrote. \"As Rush would say, you just cannot make this stuff up.\"\n\"Go home Joe,\" author Jim Hanson wrote.\n\"I don't

protests against the Israel-Hamas war could escalate as the election nears to put pressure on President Biden, a new report warns.","summary":"Anti-Israel protests could ramp up as activists adopt more \"extreme tactics\" to put increased pressure on President Biden as the election nears, a new report warns.\nOn Monday, anti-Israel agitators blocked traffic in San Francisco, Oakland, New York City, Philadelphia and several other locations as part of a campaign against the United States' continued support for Israel in its war with Hamas terrorists.\nThese disruptions could \"foreshadow a potentially volatile summer of protests, creating a challenge for President Biden and sparking debate over whether some activists' tactics threaten to undermine public support for their movement,\" The Washington Post reported Wednesday.\n\"If this continues for another six months, I would expect that the types of tactics deployed do escalate and we do see more extreme protests,\" Omar Wasow, an assistant professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley, told the Post. \"There will become a more militant faction that advocates for more extreme tactics.\"\nOne organizer who helped shut down a freeway in Oakland during Monday's protest said the coordinated disruptions were evidence that the movement was picking up steam.\n\"Today is proof that people are going to fight and keep escalating until there is a permanent cease-fire,\" Sha Wiya Falcon told The Post.\nWasow, who has studied protest movements for decades, argued that these disruptive methods could change policy even if they backfire with the public.\n\"When protesters use extreme tactics, they might lose the public, but nevertheless they get to signal to leaders who then want to manage the issue,\" Wasow said. \"So, in that way, more extreme tactics might hurt you at the ballot box \u2026 but they also could help you get policy responses from leaders.\"\nVincent Pons, another expert on protest movements and an associate professor at Harvard Business School, believes the anti-Israel protests will likely gain Biden's attention.\n\"Whether or not the protests continue will depend on whether they feel heard by the administration,\" Pons said in the report. \"The fact the protests will take place so close to a presidential election could imply that the administration will be more likely to pay attention.\"\nSince the Oct. 7 terror attacks in Israel, Biden has faced increased demands from younger progressive voters to withdraw support from Israel in its war with Hamas.\nThe president has met with Muslim American leaders over the past several months in attempts to relieve these tensions.\nWhite House officials previously traveled to Detroit earlier this year and faced an icy reception from Muslim American community leaders in the swing state, where more than 100,000 Democratic primary voters cast protest votes for \"uncommitted\" as part of an organized showing of disapproval for Biden's posture toward the conflict.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kristine

Sometimes they ask it on the first day. Sometimes they ask it six months later,\" the official reportedly told Politico's foreign affairs correspondent Nahal Toosi after her question was met with laughter.\nToosi included the exchange in a column published Tuesday and asserted that Biden doesn't have a strategy for handling Iran. The Middle Eastern nation on Saturday launched hundreds of missiles and drones against Israel, which was largely protected by its air defense system, along with help from allies including the U.S.\nShe also said Biden's aides have tried to keep the Iran issue off the president's desk.\n\"The strategy is to keep it on low boil on all fronts \u2014 nuclear, regional, whatever. That's been the approach for some time now,\" another U.S. official told Toosi.\n\"He believes Iran is a problem, but doesn't appear to have a coherent plan for how to solve it,\" the columnist wrote.\nToosi wrote that the Biden administration was managing the issues around Iran, but \"not trying to solve it.\" She noted Biden has mostly kept former President Trump's sanctions on Iran, but that the sanctions had not \"hurt Iran enough\" to change its behavior.\nThe attack on Israel has put a spotlight on Iran's nuclear capabilities, as it is dangerously close to securing a nuclear bomb. It is also responsible for unrest in the region, as Tehran backs multiple terrorist groups, including Iraq's Kata'ib Hezbollah, Yemen's Houthi rebels, Lebanon's Hezbollah and the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas.\nToosi acknowledged that it was an \"undeniably hard problem,\" and said Biden had been pursuing a \"regional integration\" plan in the Middle East, which seeks to connect Israel with other Arab states, as well as India, economically and diplomatically.\nToosi suggested this was not likely to succeed.\n\"The U.S. hopes to see Saudi Arabia and Israel establish diplomatic relations, Washington and Riyadh enter a security pact, and Israel agree to a pathway for a Palestinian state,\" she wrote. \"These pieces all depend on the others, and the people pushing them might as well buy a lottery ticket.\"\n\"The Middle East is too fractured and complicated for the United States to hope that a regional integration strategy might some day, maybe, lead to a fundamental change in Iran,\" Toosi concluded.\nNational Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson pointed Fox News Digitial to the statement provided to Politico.\n\"We focus on actually degrading Iran's capabilities, while strengthening those of our partners and allies. Iran's economy is in the tank, with the Rial at an all time low,\" she said. \"Its vaunted missile program did more damage in Iran through failure than in Israel.\"\n\"Containing and degrading Iran while strengthening the capacity and integration of American partners takes hard work and persistence,\" Watson continued. \"Saturday was a test, and it worked.\"\nOn Tuesday, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan announced the U.S. would impose new sanctions on Iran, \"including its missile and drone program as well as new sanctions against entities supporting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Iran's Defense Ministry.\"\nSullivan added that the actions the U.S. is taking will \"continue a steady drumbeat of pressure to contain and degrade Iran's military capacity and effectiveness and confront the full range of its problematic behaviors.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Hanna Panreck","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/joe-biden-solo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.939454,"_id":"c4dfcd5dda543a4db83f475b7b997c71"},{"title":"Biden admin to reject access road to northern Alaska mining district","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-17 10:43:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/biden-admin-reject-access-road-northern-alaska-mining-district","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The Biden administration plans to reject the construction of an access road to the Ambler mining district in northern Alaska.

So allow me to express a nonpartisan word to all of our friends in elected office from the Democratic Party, from someone who is finely attuned to American Jewish sentiment,\" he said.\n\"Do not take American Jews for granted,\" Hirsch warned. \"I have spoken with so many American Jews in the past few months who have surprised me with their anxiety about developments in the Democratic Party and their perception that it is becoming increasingly hostile to Israel and increasingly tolerant of anti-Zionism and antisemitism in its own ranks. Be careful. The results of the upcoming election do not only depend on Michigan.\"\nMichigan has been a flashpoint for anti-Israel activism.\nA group of Democrats called \"Listen to Michigan\" started a movement in opposition to President Biden amid his support for Israel's response to the Oct. 7 attacks in dismantling Hamas in Gaza. The movement poses a potential headache for the Biden campaign in a battleground state that has seen close margins in the last two presidential elections.\nFormer President Trump leads President Biden in Michigan in the Real Clear Politics average of polls by 2 points. Pollsters found among registered voters, Trump maintains 50% support compared to Biden's 42% in Michigan.\nThe Biden campaign has worked to ease the tension with voters in Dearborn, a city with the highest per capita Muslim population in the country. Campaign officials met with Arab American and Muslim leaders in the area in January, though that outreach was derided as \"dehumanizing\" by Democratic Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud.\nHowever, following \"Death to America\" chants in Dearborn, the administration and campaign drew a proverbial line in the sand.\n\"The White House condemns these abhorrent and antisemitic remarks in the strongest terms,\" deputy press secretary Andrew Bates told Fox News Digital.\n\"If we do not prevail, the assault on liberty and decency will not end in the Middle East. It will come to the Midwest. It will not stop at Kibbutz Beiri. It will invade Brussels, Barcelona, Berlin, Baltimore. And even if I am the last liberal in America, I will stand alone and warn of the pending disaster,\" the rabbi said at the pulpit. \"We must all share the responsibility for restoring our country's moral sanity.\"\n\"Dear friends, we have some difficult days ahead. Days of anxiety, concern, uncertainty and loss. But do not despair. Jews are not a despairing people. Better days are ahead.

But Iran escalated way beyond what it has ever hitherto dared to do. Biden urged Israel to stand down. Astonishing.\nYesterday's column laid out the origins of the Biden appeasement policy. At this writing Israel has not responded. I hope by the time this column posts that Israel will have done so. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Israel is very close to unleashing a response.\nWe have also learned that nine missiles from Iran did manage to evade interception and strike the IAF's Nevatim Air Base in southern Israel along with another nearby IAF base, and that 120 ballistic missiles were launched during the Iran attack, as well as 200 plus cruise missiles and drones. That's not a symbolic attack. It is a \"mostly failed\" massive attack. It wasn't intended to be a show. It was a strategic attack on the Jewish State. Iran wanted to kill and destroy.\nSo Biden's \"Don't!\" didn't work again. One poster on X quipped that every time he says \"Don't,\" they do. Commentary's Seth Mandel pointed out in a memorable Commentary podcast that Biden's has met the \"foreign policy fiasco\" measure of former President Obama's \"red line\" erasure. John Podhoretz noted in same podcast that Biden \"hasn't said anything\" at all after Saturday night's bombardment. \"His policy toward Iran is shredded. There is no policy towards Iran anymore.\"\nBoth are right, as are Abe Greenwald, Christine Rosen and Matthew Continetti who are also on this memorable pod. There is a bet amongst them now on whether Israel both responds to Iran and enters Rafah to finish off Hamas.\nThe United Kingdom's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Foreign Minister David Cameron have joined the Neville Chamberlain club anchored at the White House. If Israel acts it will do so despite their allies in the defense of the Jewish State asking them not to go on offense. But as former Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren bluntly stated on Monday's radio show: \"Defense is not deterrence.\" He's right too. The willingness to take a punch, or many punches, doesn't deter the enemy. It encourages the enemy to try another assault.\nThis isn't the sort of thing one has to learn from the Melian Dialogue in Thucydides (though it is indeed found there.) You get the same lesson from Ralphie in a Christmas Story when he finally snaps: Bullies have to be stopped. They don't evolve into your friends. Not on a playground. Not in the realm of national security.\nWhat does Hamas's Sinwar think at that point? Is he going to continue to reject Israel's cease-fire offers because he's a religious fanatic or because he expects to emerge from the tunnels as the terrorist equivalent of Churchill at the close of the worst part of the Battle of Britain because the United States forces Israel to stay out of Rafah and thus not to destroy those tunnels?\nWhat does Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah see happening here? And how about \"MBS\" and \"MBZ\" \u2014the rulers of our allies, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates?\nAnd what do the triumvirs \"Supreme Leader\" of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei, Russia's dictator Vladimir Putin and the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping conclude if the United States succeeds in obliging Israel to accept this unprecedented attack on the Jewish State? Nothing good. Many things bad. For Israel, for Ukraine, for Taiwan. And for the United States.\nIran has funded and controlled its proxies to the north and south of Israel for decades. Iran never dared such an attack until now. Khamenei has taken the measure of Team Biden. Israel's War Cabinet must persuade him that it is not the measure of the Jewish State.\nWe know Israel killed many Iranians with its strike on the Damascus headquarters of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps. We know that apologists for Tehran's mullahs are suggesting, and sometimes asserting, that Israel's strikes provoked this off-the-charts escalation from Tehran, as if there was some unspoken deal between Iran and Israel that Israel would not tag out Iran's commanders in the field if they could get back to a base.\nIt's up to Israel now to reset the understandings Iran has developed as well as the mullahs' reliance on President Biden to always take and advise the wrong course on national security. Hopefully by the time you read this, Prime Minister Netanyahu and the War Cabinet have done just that.\nHugh Hewitt is one of the country's leading journalists of the center-right.

This is in stark contrast to President Biden, ostensibly a cradle Catholic but whose views on abortion prompted some of his fellow Catholics to call for Biden's disqualification from communion. Indeed, the policies of the 46th president and his fellow Democrats appear to contribute to, if not drive, the transformation of our country into a Godless nation.\nA massive change is underway in the spiritual landscape of the nation that has in its very Constitution guaranteed complete religious freedom. Modern America is steadily moving away from its religious heritage. Not only is religiosity steadily disappearing from American culture and society, people of faith increasingly have their rights undermined by the state.\nAs an immigrant from Soviet Russia, where religion was outlawed and believers were persecuted, I'm gravely concerned about our society's drift toward secularism and the government's efforts to suppress our constitutionally guaranteed freedom to pursue an authentic devout way of life.\nThe latest and the most direct and egregious affront to people of faith was President Biden's proclamation of March 31, 2024, which fell on Easter Sunday, as Transgender Day of Visibility.\nEaster is the most sacred holiday of the year for Christians, who comprise approximately 63% (or 210 million) of the U.S. population. It's been celebrated here since the Civil War. Transgender Day of Visibility, on the other hand, was created in 2009 to raise awareness about and draw attention to transgender people.\nTransgender persons comprise 1.64 million Americans, according to a 2022 study conducted by a UCLA Law School think tank, which used data from surveys done by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Adding insult to injury, the White House prohibited religious-themed designs from the art contest held for children of the National Guard during the Easter Egg Roll on the White House lawn.\nThis is not the first time the state wields its power to promote secularization of our society. Last December, some government apparatchiks across the country sought to take Christ out of Christmas. Some jurisdictions introduced guidelines for \"inclusive decorating practices\" and \"neutral language\" to mark the holiday season.\nLocal government officials instructed their staff to replace the red and green colors with neutral tones, avoid religious ornaments, and use gender-neutral nouns such as \"snow people\" instead of \"snowmen\" in order not to offend some members of the community. Are religious Americans no longer part of the so-called community? Evidently, it's OK to offend those Americans, trample on their constitutional right to properly celebrate Christmas, a religious holiday, using religious symbols.\nSome in the Democratic Party have been promoting anti-God sentiment, offending devout Americans, for several election cycles as it is courting religiously unaffiliated voters. In 2019, the Democratic National Committee passed a resolution praising the party's religious \"nones.\" The document called on Democratic leaders to listen to the concerns of \"religiously unaffiliated Americans,\" characterizing them as a group that \"advocates for rational public policy based on sound science and universal humanistic values.\"\nIn contrast, the narratives coming out of the Democratic Party messaging machine portray churchgoing Americans as stupid, old-fashioned, nationalistic and radical in their views. Christian nationalism is a new term that's frequently attached by the Democrats and leftist media to the Christian faith. Such commonsense concepts as two genders, marriage between a man and a woman, pro-life, mother and father, parental rights are portrayed as radical ideas.\nUnder Biden's presidency, attacks on religious liberty and Americans of faith have reached unprecedented levels. Biden's 2021 Build Back Better legislation reportedly blocked religious facilities, such as churches, synagogues and schools, from using infrastructure funds for improvements. In November 2021, Biden reversed a Trump-era rule that protects the religious liberty of faith-based organizations that contract with the federal government, allowing them to hire people who specifically hold their faith beliefs.\nIn March 2021, Biden's then-press secretary, Jen Psaki, refused to say if Biden would force doctors with religious objections to perform abortions. In his 2022 budget, Biden called for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which protects American taxpayers from being forced to fund abortion.\nIt is little wonder that America appears to be on the trajectory of becoming more and more secular. Church membership has been on the decline for the past two decades, but in 2020, it fell below the majority for the first time. According to a March 2021 Gallup poll, 47% of Americans said they belonged to a church, synagogue or mosque, down from 50% in 2018 and 70% in 1999.\nIndeed, last month's Gallup research showed attendance at religious services had declined in most U.S. religious groups. Only three in 10 Americans say they attend religious services every week (21%).

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Fox News Digital.\n\"To appease his base, Joe Biden allowed over $100 billion to flow to Iran. Iran then used that money to make drones and cruise missiles to attack Israel,\" Cruz said. \"In a very real sense, Joe Biden funded Iran's attack on Israel. The Democrat position on Israel and Iran is as illogical as it is indefensible.\"\nIran attacked Israel directly over the weekend, launching hundreds of drone strikes as well as a barrage of ballistic and cruise missiles. With the help of the U.S. military, Israel managed to intercept almost all the incoming drone and missile attacks.\nIran's previous involvement in attacks against Israel has been through proxies in countries such as Syria and Yemen. Launching an assault from within its own country marks a major escalation from a proxy fight to a direct attack.\n\"Since October 7, Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer have tried to undermine Israel at every turn,\" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Whether it's on the battlefield, at the UN, or in Congress, they are more interested in pleasing the pro-Hamas wing of their party than they are in helping our greatest ally in the Middle East.\"\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., pointed to the Democratic Party's shift on Israel, saying in a statement Saturday, \"Tehran and its proxies are emboldened when they see divisions between the US and Israel.\"\nPrior to the attack, Biden hardened his posture toward Israel as it fights Hamas in Gaza. Biden warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a call this month \"that U.S. policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by our assessment of Israel's immediate action on these steps\" to address civilian casualties and ensure safety for humanitarian aid workers, according to the White House. The call followed an Israeli strike that led to the deaths of seven aid workers from World Central Kitchen.\nLast month, Schumer sparked outrage from Republicans after calling on Israel in a floor speech to hold elections to replace Netanyahu, who he said \"has put himself in coalition with far-right extremists\" and \"has been too willing to tolerate the civilian toll in Gaza.\"\n\"If Prime Minister Netanyahu's current coalition remains in power after the war begins to wind down and continues to pursue dangerous and inflammatory policies that test existing U.S. standards for assistance, then the United States will have no choice but to play a more active role in shaping Israeli policy by using our leverage to change the present course,\" Schumer said.\nPrior to his floor speech, Schumer requested a classified intelligence briefing, which he routinely receives, on the status of hostage negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The briefing revealed that there would be no disruptions to ongoing hostage negotiations if Schumer gave his speech, according to a source familiar.\nHowever, the source was unable to say whether any implications regarding Iran were relayed during the briefing.\nSchumer's office also hit back at the claims, with spokesperson Allison Biasotti saying in a statement, \"Leader Schumer has been clear that the United States' commitment to Israel's security is ironclad, and that the best way to deter enemies of Israel, like Iran, is for the House to promptly pass the bipartisan supplemental bill, with over $17 billion urgently needed for Israel's defense and U.S. operations against Iranian-backed aggression in the Red Sea, which Schumer already passed in the Senate.\"\nThe majority leader's office said the attack on Israel was a response to the recent Israeli strike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, Syria, adding that Iran and Israel have been engaged in a lengthy conflict for years.\nBut according to one Democrat aide, there are senators in the party who are concerned about a growing number of Democrats' posture on Israel potentially giving Iran the sense that American support is wavering for its ally.\nSen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., accused Biden of trying to \"walk a tightrope of appeasing an increasingly radical base of his party while upholding the mainstream American position of support for Israel.\"\n\"The problem is the president isn't walking a tightrope. He's trying to straddle the Grand Canyon,\" he said in a statement.\nWhite House spokesperson Andrew Bates pushed back on criticism of Biden's posture toward Israel, and he rejected claims he emboldened Iran to attack, in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\"Former Trump Administration officials and Fox News' own reporting have debunked those lies,\" he said.\n\"President Biden is the only American President to have directly defended Israel, as he ordered the American military to do last weekend,\" Bates said. \"He is also the only American President to have set foot in Israel during wartime, in support of our ironclad commitment to their security. Unlike others, he did not rail against Israel in the days after October 7th, nor has he ever praised Hezbollah.\"\nMeanwhile, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., pointed to a recent effort to force votes on a stand-alone Israel aid bill in the Senate as she criticized her Democrat counterparts.\n\"This week, Senate Democrats again blocked immediate aid to Israel after Senator [Roger] Marshall and I demanded a vote to support our ally. The Left would rather play politics to appease their socialist base,\" she told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\"It's clear that the Biden administration and Leader Chuck Schumer refuse to back our most important ally in the Middle East,\" Blackburn continued.\nTwo Democrat congressional aides told Fox News Digital that the attack by Iran was expected. They said intelligence suggested it was in response to the consulate strike on April 1 that killed Iranian commanders.\nNevertheless, the scale of the Iranian attack and its direct targeting of Israel shocked many observers.\nDemocrats in the upper chamber objected to two requests for unanimous consent to vote on different versions of stand-alone Israel aid. However, most Democrats maintained support for a foreign aid package that ties Israel aid to Ukraine aid.\nMcConnell said last month that Schumer's call for new Israeli elections was both hypocritical and grotesque as well as \"unprecedented.\"\n\"Make no mistake, the Democratic Party doesn't have an anti-[Netanyahu] problem. It has an anti-Israel problem,\" the Republican leader said in floor remarks at the time.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Julia Johnson","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/schumer-biden-israel-iran.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.860633,"_id":"64e2de4e16feb98f647697b2811c970b"},{"title":"Biden dismantles Trump-era Title IX rules, sidesteps issue of trans athletes in girls' sports","author":"Michael Dorgan","published_date":"2024-04-19 12:25:14","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-dismantles-trump-era-title-ix-rules-sidesteps-issue-trans-athletes-girls-sports","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The new provisions are part of a revised Title IX regulation issued by the Education Department, fulfilling a campaign pledge by President Biden","summary":"The Biden administration has unveiled new rules to safeguard LGBTQ+ students and change the ways in which sexual harassment and assault claims are adjudicated on campus.\nThe new provisions are part of a revised Title IX regulation issued by the Education Department, fulfilling a campaign pledge by President Biden to revamp those issued during the Trump administration.\nMissing from the new rule, however, is a policy forbidding schools from enacting outright bans on transgender athletes competing against biological females.\nThe Biden administration was widely expected to bring in such a policy but has instead put the provision on hold.

The silence comes as hundreds of anti-Israel agitators have mounted disruptive protests at the university's campus in New York City, with some calling for violence against Jews and Jewish students.\n\"Eisenhower sent the 101st to Little Rock,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said in a social media post Monday. \"It's time for Biden to call out the National Guard at our universities to protect Jewish Americans.\"\n\"The nascent pogroms at Columbia have to stop TODAY, before our Jewish brethren sit for Passover Seder tonight,\" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., added. \"If Eric Adams won't send the NYPD and Kathy Hochul won't send the National Guard, Joe Biden has a duty to take charge and break up these mobs.\"\nLast week, anti-Israel agitators initiated protests, staging what they labeled a \"Gaza solidarity encampment\" on the Columbia University campus and shutting down a central lawn at the university. The protesters, who erected tents as part of the action, called for hostilities in the Middle East to end and for the university to divest of companies that have ties to Israel.\nOn Friday, police broke up the demonstration and arrested more than 100 students, charging them with trespassing.\nHowever, more protesters have arrived on the scene since those arrests and have clashed repeatedly with police officers. Some protesters have loudly chanted antisemitic slogans, pledged allegiance to Hamas and even endorsed violence against Jewish people.\nIn response to the conflict, Columbia University Rabbi Elie Buechler recommended Jewish students leave campus because of safety concerns, and Columbia University President Dr. Nemat Shafik said Monday that classes would be virtual to avoid further violence.\n\"I am deeply saddened by what is happening on our campus,\" Shafik wrote on Monday. \"Our bonds as a community have been severely tested in ways that will take a great deal of time and effort to reaffirm. Students across an array of communities have conveyed fears for their safety and we have announced additional actions we are taking to address security concerns.\"\n\"The decibel of our disagreements has only increased in recent days,\" she continued. \"These tensions have been exploited and amplified by individuals who are not affiliated with Columbia who have come to campus to pursue their own agendas.\"\nMeanwhile, President Biden issued a statement Sunday ahead of Passover, commemorating the Jewish holiday while also condemning rising antisemitic attitudes across the country.\nProtests, such as those staged at Columbia University, have raged in the U.S. in the aftermath of Hamas' attacks on innocent Israeli citizens on Oct. 7, which sparked Israel to bombard Palestinian territories in Gaza.\n\"The ancient story of persecution against Jews in the Haggadah also reminds us that we must speak out against the alarming surge of antisemitism \u2013 in our schools, communities, and online,\" Biden said.\n\"Silence is complicity.

Marco Rubio accused President Biden of sharing the details of his private phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with the press in order to appease anti-Israel \"pro-terrorist\" activists within the Democratic Party.\nOn Saturday, Iran launched an unprecedented aerial attack on Israel, firing 170 drones, more than 30 cruise missiles and more than 120 ballistic missiles towards Israel. Out of the hundreds of launches, only a \"few\" crossed into Israel and caused \"minor damages\" at the Navatim Airbase, the IDF said.\nPresident Biden reportedly called Netanyahu to congratulate him for fending off the attacks while also urging him not to retaliate against Iran and escalate tensions in the region.\nRubio claimed that Biden shared the private details of this call \"to appease\" cease-fire activists whom he argued were really \"pro-terrorist.\"\nRubio argued the U.S. already knew Israel would retaliate, so this was part of a political \"game\" the Biden administration was playing.\n\"There's only one reason they leaked that. And that is that so when Israel does respond, the White House can say, \u2018We told them not to do it,' and at least somehow, in some way, appease these so-called peace activists,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper.\n\"By the way, these \u2018cease-fire now' people who were out yesterday cheering the launch of hundreds of rockets and drones and missiles against Israel.

You don't \u2014 peace activists do not cheer massive attacks against other countries, which is what they were doing yesterday. So, I guess this is part of the White House's effort to appease them by putting this out proactively,\" he continued.\nRubio also said the call would embolden Israel's enemies in the Middle East.\n\"It is the continuing part of this public game that they are playing, which frankly, encourages Iran and Hezbollah, which we haven't even talked about, and the Houthis and all these other elements that are targeting Israel,\" he added.\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment.\nSelf-described anti-war activists in Chicago cheered after learning that Iran had launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel on Saturday.\nEarlier in the day at that same event, before the Iran attacks, one agitator led chants in Farsi translating to \"Death to America\" and \"Death to Israel,\" according to a Free Press reporter there.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kristine Parks","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/rubiobiden.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.8090744,"_id":"f3e573814217cd1dddc5accf7361c3d0"},{"title":"Trump threatened with jail if he misses hush money trial as Biden campaigns in Pennsylvania","author":"Lawrence Richard","published_date":"2024-04-16 13:46:01","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-threatened-with-jail-he-misses-hush-money-trial-biden-campaigns-pennsylvania","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"While Trump has been ordered to attend the court proceedings Tuesday and every day of the trial, President Biden returns to the campaign trail on Tuesday.","summary":"President Biden returns to the campaign trail on Tuesday with a visit to his childhood hometown of Scranton to begin three consecutive days of campaigning in Pennsylvania. While the Democratic incumbent is holding events in the battleground state, his 2024 opponent, Donald Trump, is forced to spend the day in a New York City courtroom for the first ever criminal trial of a former president.\nBiden plans to use Scranton, a working class city of roughly 75,000 people, as the backdrop to pitch his new tax plan. His travels through Pennsylvania overlap with the start of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's criminal hush money case against Trump.\nDay two of the New York City trial continues with the jury selection at approximately 9:30 a.m. Tuesday. Trump has been charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree relating to alleged hush money payments to Stormy Daniels during his successful 2016 presidential campaign.\nTrump has been ordered to attend the court proceedings Tuesday and every day of the trial. Judge Juan Merchan told Trump that if he fails to be present, a warrant will be issued for his arrest.\nBiden plans to spend Tuesday night in Scranton before continuing to Pittsburgh on Wednesday morning. He is expected to then briefly visit the White House, but intends to return to Pennsylvania on Thursday, with an event in Philadelphia.\nScranton, Biden's first destination, blends the personal and political for Biden as he grew up in a three-story colonial home in the Green Ridge neighborhood. His family later moved to Delaware, the state Biden ultimately represented in the U.S. Senate.\n\"It's hard to draw paths to Biden winning the White House that don't involve Pennsylvania,\" said Daniel Hopkins, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\nHarry Truman, in 1948, was the last Democrat to become president who did not win the state.\nHis opportunity to campaign comes as Trump is sequestered in a courtroom, defending himself against criminal charges. If convicted, Trump could be sentenced to time behind bars.\nTrump pleaded not guilty to all counts last year.\nAs Monday showed, however, the criminal case against the former president continues to struggle against worries that Trump will get a fair trial.\nYesterday afternoon, 96 prospective jurors were sworn in but more than 50 of them were almost immediately excused for admitting they could not serve as impartial jurors.\n\"It's a scam. It's a political witch hunt,\" Trump said after court adjourned Monday.\nJudge Juan Merchan, who Trump has repeatedly criticized as being partisan and serving the interest of Democrats, addressed Trump directly before calling the prospective jurors into the courtroom.\nThe judge told Trump that if he fails to be present, a warrant will be issued for his arrest. Judge Merchan also told Trump that he has a right to be present at the trial, but that if he disrupts the proceedings he would be removed. Trump nodded after hearing the instructions.\nJudge Merchan denied Trump's request to be excused from the trial next Thursday, after the president expressed he wanted to attend arguments at the Supreme Court about presidential immunity. The judge has not yet ruled on whether the trial will be adjourned so Trump can attend his son Barron's high school graduation.\nBefore jury selection began, Judge Merchan again denied the defense's request to recuse himself.\nJudge Merchan also set a hearing for next Tuesday, April 23 to discuss possible sanctions for Trump violating the gag order.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lawrence Richard","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1242021155.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.803021,"_id":"b767e5edaa33a5100b6d358af4777f73"},{"title":"Alabama lawmakers advance bills ensuring Biden appears on November ballot","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-17 23:56:52","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/alabama-lawmakers-advance-bills-ensuring-biden-appears-november-ballot","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Alabama lawmakers on Wednesday voted to advance legislation to ensure President Biden's presence on the Yellowhammer State's November ballot.","summary":"Alabama lawmakers advanced legislation Wednesday to ensure President Joe Biden will appear on the state's November ballot, mirroring accommodations made four years ago for then-President Donald Trump.\nLegislative committees in the Alabama House of Representatives and Senate approved identical bills that would push back the state's certification deadline from 82 days to 74 days before the general election in order to accommodate the date of Democrats' nominating convention.\nThe bills now move to to the full chambers.

Merika Coleman, the sponsor of the Senate bill, told the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nThe issue of Biden's ballot access has arisen in Alabama and Ohio as Republican secretaries of state warned that certification deadlines fall before the Democratic National Convention is set to begin on Aug. 19. The Biden campaign has asked the two states to accept provisional certification, arguing that has been done in past elections. The Republican election chiefs have refused, arguing they don't have authority, and will enforce the deadlines.\nDemocrats proposed the two Alabama bills, but the legislation moved out of committee with support from Republicans who hold a lopsided majority in the Alabama Legislature. The bills were approved with little discussion. However, two Republicans who spoke in favor of the bill called it an issue of fairness.\nRepublican Rep. Bob Fincher, chairman of the committee that heard the House bill, said this is \"not the first time we've run into this problem\" and the state made allowances.\n\"I'd like to think that if the shoe was on the other foot, that this would be taken care of. And I think that Alabamians have a deep sense of fairness when it comes to politics and elections,\" Republican Sen. Sam Givhan said during the committee meeting.\nTrump faced the same issue in Alabama in 2020. The Republican-controlled Alabama Legislature in 2020 passed legislation to change the certification deadline for the 2020 election. The bill stated that the change was made \"to accommodate the dates of the 2020 Republican National Convention.\" However, an attorney representing the Biden campaign and DNC, wrote in a letter to Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen that it was provisional certification that allowed Trump on the ballot in 2020, because there were still problems with the GOP date even with the new 2020 deadline.\nAllen has maintained he does not have the authority to accept provisional certification.\nSimilarly, in Ohio, Attorney General Dave Yost and Secretary of State Frank LaRose, both Republicans, rejected a request from Democrats to waive the state's ballot deadline administratively by accepting a \"provisional certification\" for Biden.\nIn a letter Monday, Yost's office told LaRose that Ohio law does not allow the procedure. LaRose's office conveyed that information, in turn, in a letter to Democratic lawyer Don McTigue. LaRose's chief legal counsel, Paul Disantis, noted it was a Democrats who championed the state's ballot deadline, one of the earliest in the nation, 15 years ago. It falls 90 days before the general election, which this year is Aug. 7.\nOhio Senate Democratic Leader Nickie Antonio said she is waiting to hear from the Democratic National Committee on how to proceed.

Kim Reynolds, a Republican, told Fox News Digital in a statement.\nImmigration surpassed all other issues in a poll by Gallup in February, as more Americans agreed it was \"the most important problem facing this country today.\" The number of respondents to say so jumped eight points from January, to 28%. The previous issue cited as most important by Americans was \"government,\" followed by immigration, inflation and the economy in general. While immigration concerns managed to climb, government, inflation and economic worries remained relatively steady.\nThe issue ranked as the most important for the first time since 2019, prior to President Biden taking office and during former President Trump's administration. This was the year Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border following congressional refusal to grant him requested funds for border wall construction.\n\"The federal government's inaction at our nation's borders has led to a crisis with direct impacts upon all fifty states,\" New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu told Fox News Digital in a statement.\nIn the state, which is more than 2,000 miles from the U.S. southern border, 83% of residents said they consider illegal immigration a serious issue for the country. Among those residents, 58% said it is \"very serious,\" according to a March University of New Hampshire Survey Center (UNHSC) poll.\nAndrew Smith, director of the UNHSC, noted that the percentage of those who agree that illegal immigration is a \"very serious\" issue nationally has remained steady for more than a decade.\nJulie Kirchner, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), told Fox News Digital in a statement, \"Americans are not only seeing total chaos at the borders, where foreign nationals are literally tearing down barriers and assaulting border agents, they are witnessing first-hand how the crisis impacts every aspect of society.\"\nAt the same time, the March polling revealed that support for the construction of a border wall has surged since 2017, when opposition among New Hampshire residents was at more than half. Now, 52% in the state are in favor of the border wall, while 39% are against it.\n\"Every state, including New Hampshire, has experienced firsthand the economic and emotional toll associated with the federal government's failed response,\" said Sununu.\nReynolds claimed, \"It's clear to Iowans, and the American people, that the only way this chaos and crisis at the border can be fixed is at the ballot box,\" crediting Biden with the widespread effects of illegal immigration.\nDemocratic strategist Eric Koch pushed back on the idea the surging concern over immigration is Biden's fault, however. He noted that Republicans and Democrats in the Senate had been negotiating a border package \"that President Biden said he would have signed.\" The deal was ultimately sunk after former President Trump came out against it and Republican lawmakers followed suit.\n\"Trump and Republicans don't actually want to solve problems and walking away from the bipartisan border deal only confirms that,\" Koch added.\nA White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement, \"The Administration spent months negotiating in good faith to deliver the toughest and fairest bipartisan border security bill in decades because we need Congress to make significant policy reforms and to provide additional funding to secure our border and fix our broken immigration system.\"\nThe statement accused Republicans of placing \"partisan politics ahead of our national security\" in rejecting the border deal.\n\"Even without significant action from Congress, DHS is maximizing its enforcement operations,\" the spokesperson said.\nIn South Carolina's recent Republican presidential primary, 37% of voters pointed to immigration as the issue that was of the most significance to them ahead of casting their vote, according to a Reuters exit poll.\nThe economy came in second at 33% in the state, which is similarly more than 1,000 miles from the southern border.\n\"Every state is a border state because the Biden administration policies are to allow hundreds of thousands of aliens to illegally enter the United States and then be transported by federally funded NGO's to wherever they choose,\" said James Massa, CEO of NumbersUSA.\n\"A reason those non-border state voters are so focused on this is because of the right-wing media obsession with the issue,\" claimed Democratic strategist Kaivan Shroff, who chalked some of the concern up to a tactic to rally the Republican base.\n\"The irony here is Biden and Democrats have put forth a bipartisan border deal that would address many of the cited concerns Republicans have been focused on, and the deal was killed because of Trump,\" he added, echoing both the White House and fellow strategist Koch.\nAs Massa pointed out, non-governmental organizations are involved in the transportation of illegal immigrants to various locations within the U.S., and many of these NGOs also receive federal reimbursement and advance payments from the Department of Homeland Security for providing shelter or other eligible services to migrants released by DHS.\n\"The border crisis is funded with taxpayer dollars, regardless of state,\" he claimed.\nHe further said that illegal immigrants are choosing to travel further into the U.S. once being paroled by DHS, opting to settle in states \"that have sanctuary policies and/or benefit programs.\"\nIllegal immigrants have also been transported by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's administration to locations that have touted \"sanctuary\" policies for illegal immigrants, which some have pointed to as a trigger for concerns about the border across the country.\n\"Since launching the border transportation mission in April 2022, Texas has transported over 112,000 migrants to self-declared sanctuary cities to provide much-needed relief to our overrun and overwhelmed border communities as the Biden administration leaves thousands of migrants in Texas border towns,\" said Renae Eze, Abbott spokesperson.\nRepublican strategist Doug Heye noted that \"complaints from Democratic politicians that they can't handle this crisis on their own\" lend some credence to the claim that every state is now effectively a border state.\nLeaders of cities such as Chicago and New York, among others, have been overwhelmed by the illegal immigrants pouring in, prompting them to request assistance from Biden and the White House and plead with Abbott to halt his busing program.\n\"The sheer hypocrisy of these Democrat mayors knows no bounds, going to extreme lengths to avoid fulfilling their self-declared sanctuary city promises, yet they remain silent as President Biden transports migrants all around the country and oftentimes in the cover of night,\" added Eze.\nIowa GOP strategist David Kochel suggested the \"squealing of [Democratic] mayors \u2026 is definitely related to the busing.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Julia Johnson","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Right-Half-left-Quarters-vertical-Inset-1.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.782948,"_id":"4536a02b5ffd4a1eefff755d05380642"},{"title":"Biden returns to campaign trail as Trump forced to remain in court for second day of New York hush money trial","author":"Lawrence Richard","published_date":"2024-04-16 13:46:01","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-returns-campaign-trail-trump-forced-remain-court-second-day-new-york-hush-money-trial","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"President Biden returns to the campaign trail on Tuesday while Trump has been ordered to attend the court proceedings Tuesday and every day of the trial.","summary":"President Biden returns to the campaign trail on Tuesday with a visit to his childhood hometown of Scranton to begin three consecutive days of campaigning in Pennsylvania. While the Democratic incumbent is holding events in the battleground state, his 2024 opponent, Donald Trump, is forced to spend the day in a New York City courtroom for the first ever criminal trial of a former president.\nBiden plans to use Scranton, a working class city of roughly 75,000 people, as the backdrop to pitch his new tax plan. His travels through Pennsylvania overlap with the start of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's criminal hush money case against Trump.\nDay two of the New York City trial continues with the jury selection at approximately 9:30 a.m. Tuesday. Trump has been charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree relating to alleged hush money payments to Stormy Daniels during his successful 2016 presidential campaign.\nTrump has been ordered to attend the court proceedings Tuesday and every day of the trial. Judge Juan Merchan told Trump that if he fails to be present, a warrant will be issued for his arrest.\nBiden plans to spend Tuesday night in Scranton before continuing to Pittsburgh on Wednesday morning. He is expected to then briefly visit the White House, but intends to return to Pennsylvania on Thursday, with an event in Philadelphia.\nScranton, Biden's first destination, blends the personal and political for Biden as he grew up in a three-story colonial home in the Green Ridge neighborhood. His family later moved to Delaware, the state Biden ultimately represented in the U.S. Senate.\n\"It's hard to draw paths to Biden winning the White House that don't involve Pennsylvania,\" said Daniel Hopkins, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\nHarry Truman, in 1948, was the last Democrat to become president who did not win the state.\nHis opportunity to campaign comes as Trump is sequestered in a courtroom, defending himself against criminal charges. If convicted, Trump could be sentenced to time behind bars.\nTrump pleaded not guilty to all counts last year.\nAs Monday showed, however, the criminal case against the former president continues to struggle against worries that Trump will get a fair trial.\nYesterday afternoon, 96 prospective jurors were sworn in but more than 50 of them were almost immediately excused for admitting they could not serve as impartial jurors.\n\"It's a scam. It's a political witch hunt,\" Trump said after court adjourned Monday.\nJudge Juan Merchan, who Trump has repeatedly criticized as being partisan and serving the interest of Democrats, addressed Trump directly before calling the prospective jurors into the courtroom.\nThe judge told Trump that if he fails to be present, a warrant will be issued for his arrest. Judge Merchan also told Trump that he has a right to be present at the trial, but that if he disrupts the proceedings he would be removed. Trump nodded after hearing the instructions.\nJudge Merchan denied Trump's request to be excused from the trial next Thursday, after the president expressed he wanted to attend arguments at the Supreme Court about presidential immunity. The judge has not yet ruled on whether the trial will be adjourned so Trump can attend his son Barron's high school graduation.\nBefore jury selection began, Judge Merchan again denied the defense's request to recuse himself.\nJudge Merchan also set a hearing for next Tuesday, April 23 to discuss possible sanctions for Trump violating the gag order.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lawrence Richard","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1242021155.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.7789345,"_id":"392effc7698392e9652a53af2aaed21e"},{"title":"Anti-Israel protests \u2018disturbing' as a Jew and American: Daniel Krauthammer","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-19 15:25:47","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6351244966112","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Writer Daniel Krauthammer joins \u2018America's Newsroom' to discuss the U.S. division over the Israel-Hamas war.","summary":"All times eastern Making Money with Charles Payne FOX News Radio Live Channel Coverage WATCH LIVE: Biden delivers remarks at union conference\nAll times eastern Making Money with Charles Payne FOX News Radio Live Channel Coverage WATCH LIVE: Biden delivers remarks at union conference","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/7a65a24a-a7de-428b-9820-a737dcb540a7/71ff7c50-65e5-4a43-b3ec-847b4189712a/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.778264,"_id":"401d9e0ed2161f92822e61c7b080253c"},{"title":"AG Garland pressed on Hur report, says Biden 'has no impairment'","author":"Greg Norman","published_date":"2024-04-16 17:41:11","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ag-garland-pressed-hur-report-biden-no-impairment","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Attorney General Merrick Garland, when asked on Capitol Hill about special counsel Robert Hur's report on President Biden, said the president has \"no impairment.\"","summary":"Attorney General Merrick Garland vowed Wednesday that President Biden has \"no impairment\" after being pressed by a Republican lawmaker about the findings of special counsel Robert Hur's report on Biden's improper handling of classified documents.\nGarland, speaking to Rep.

I don't know how many ways I can say this. I have complete confidence in the president and I reject your characterization,\" Garland also said.\nHur said in his report that he would bring no criminal charges against the president after a monthslong investigation into his improper retention of classified documents related to national security.\nDuring another part of his testimony, Garland said \"I am glad to be able to report that last year we saw a significant decrease in overall violent crime across the country compared to the previous year, including an over 13% decline in homicides.\n\"That is the largest one-year decline in homicides in over 30 years,\" he continued. \"And data indicates that this decline is continuing.\"\nGarland said the Justice Department is \"seeking a total of $21 billion to support the efforts of the FBI, ATF, DEA, the U.S. Marshals Service and U.S. Attorney's offices, as well as the criminal Division and the National Security Division.\"\nHe said the funding would be used to fight gun violence and \"strengthen our work to counter both foreign and domestic terrorism.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Greg Norman","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Merrick-Garland-2.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.7627344,"_id":"c994949f8f4a6a3bd8611b1427102946"},{"title":"Ilhan Omar's daughter among anti-Israel protesters arrested, released at Columbia University","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-19 15:05:23","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6351243875112","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The Lawfare Project CEO Brooke Goldstein and Fox News contributor Paul Mauro discuss New York City officials' response to the protests at Columbia University.","summary":"All times eastern Making Money with Charles Payne FOX News Radio Live Channel Coverage WATCH LIVE: Biden delivers remarks at union conference\nAll times eastern Making Money with Charles Payne FOX News Radio Live Channel Coverage WATCH LIVE: Biden delivers remarks at union conference","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/bfa69e62-bf5e-4c79-b068-50da6e7d8e59/6f1a1f75-ee08-434e-a15b-0161a2fdc631/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.76252,"_id":"576e3d381528c50dee3afceaf431c1e6"},{"title":"Australia church stabbing captured on livestream","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-15 14:18:36","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6350969718112","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"A suspect was apprehended after multiple people were injured during a stabbing at a church in Wakeley, a suburb of Sydney, Australia, on Monday night.

Kennedy Jr. is on the 2024 general election ballot in Michigan, a battleground that Trump carried by a razor-thin margin in 2016 and Biden narrowly won in\u2026","summary":"Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s campaign is spotlighting that the independent presidential candidate has moved a step closer to his goal of getting on the ballot in all 50 states.\nThe campaign of the longtime environmental activist and high-profile vaccine skeptic, who is the scion of the nation's most storied political dynasty, on Thursday showcased that he has made the ballot in Michigan.\nThe state is one of seven crucial general election battlegrounds that will likely decide the outcome of the 2024 election rematch between President Biden and former President Donald Trump.\nThe campaign announced that Kennedy and his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, have been nominated by the Natural Law Party, a small party with ballot access in Michigan. Trump carried the Great Lakes State by a razor-thin margin in his 2016 presidential election victory, and Biden narrowly captured the state four years later, as he won the White House in 2020.\n\"He's the most qualified candidate in the modern-day history of America,\" Natural Law Party Chairman Doug Dern said in a statement released by the Kennedy campaign. \"We welcome Mr. Kennedy and Ms. Shanahan to the party.\"\nThe Michigan Secretary of State's office confirmed to Fox News that the Natural Law Party had filed their documents with the Bureau of Elections and that Kennedy will appear on the ballot in November.\nThe Kennedy campaign announced that Kennedy will \"celebrate his ballot access win\" this Sunday when he hosts \"A Night of Laughter\" comedy show at a theater outside of Detroit.\nMichigan becomes the second state where Kennedy, a Democrat turned independent, has officially qualified for the ballot, following Utah. And his campaign said that Kennedy has collected enough signatures to meet ballot access thresholds in the battlegrounds of North Carolina and Nevada, the swing state of New Hampshire, as well as Nebraska, Iowa, Idaho and Hawaii.\nWhile attaining a spot on the ballot is a costly and time-consuming venture for independent candidates, Kennedy campaign press secretary Stefanie Spear recently emphasized, \"We have the field teams, volunteers, legal teams, paid circulators, supporters and strategists ready to get the job done.\"\nKennedy is polling in the double digits in some national surveys and in polls in some of the key general election battlegrounds \u2014 higher than any other third-party or independent White House contender since Ross Perot more than three decades ago.\nThe Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee \u2014 which recently brought on veteran communicators to target third-party and independent candidates \u2014 have repeatedly slammed Kennedy as a potential spoiler whose supporters could hand Donald Trump a presidential election victory in November.\n\"We are doing everything in our power to get President Biden and Vice President Harris re-elected. It's critical that we take seriously every possible obstacle to that goal,\" Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. Austin Davis emphasized in a recent conference call with reporters. \"And let me be clear, that's exactly what Robert F. Kennedy is in this election. He's a spoiler.\"\nThe threat of Kennedy serving as a spoiler for the Trump campaign is particularly acute in Michigan, where an activist group called Listen to Michigan is pushing for Democrats to reject a second Biden presidency over his support for Israel in the war in Gaza. Michigan is home to the highest per capita Muslim population in the U.S.\nPlenty of pundits and pollsters are making the case that Kennedy also could pose a similar problem for Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\nAnd in recent weeks, the former president's campaign has characterized Kennedy, whose populism on some issues seems similar to Trump's, as a far-left politician.\nTrump recently charged that Kennedy was \"the most Radical Left Candidate in the race, by far.\"\nOn Thursday, several members of the Kennedy family appeared with President Biden in Philadelphia to offer their public endorsement for the President over Robert Kennedy Jr.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Paul Steinhauser","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2126529969.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.7477407,"_id":"1b0514116cc4f00f2421ae26eff1b38a"},{"title":"Fox News Politics: Trump gets a jury","author":"Fox News Staff","published_date":"2024-04-19 21:03:02","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-politics-trump-gets-jury","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content","summary":"Welcome to Fox News' Politics newsletter with the latest political news from Washington D.C. and updates from the 2024 campaign trail.\nWhat's happening?\n- Biden taking heat for another gaffe\n- Democrats come to Speaker Johnson's rescue\n- Judge denies Trump's bid to halt Jan. 6 lawsuits\n- Fox News Digital at the southern border\nThe full jury, including alternate jurors, has been selected and sworn in former President Trump's criminal trial in New York City, setting the stage for opening arguments to begin next week.\nTwelve jurors were seated on Thursday at the end of the third day of jury selection.\nBy midday Friday, all alternate jurors had been selected and sworn in.
