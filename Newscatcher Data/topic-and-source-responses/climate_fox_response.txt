Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, was recently hosted for a private meeting at the White House.\nOn Thursday, members of the Washington, D.C.-based Climate Defiance \u2013 which was founded in early 2023 by activists Michael Greenberg and Rylee Haught \u2013 physically disrupted the event hosted by the Bryce Harlow Foundation as Murkowski was delivering remarks. Then, in a moment captured on video, several activists were forcibly shoved by security off the stage, tumbling to the ground.\n\"We just shut down a gala honoring U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski. Murkowski is a murderer. She incinerates us to enrich her cronies. As Chevron's top lobbyist gave her an award, we stepped in and stopped the ceremony,\" Climate Defiance said in a social media post. \"Respect us or expect us.\"\nAccording to video of the incident, which garnered nearly more than 3.5 million views in 24 hours, the Climate Defiance activists chanted anti-fossil fuels slogans as they were removed from the stage. The video further shows Murkowski slowly walking away as the activists tried to get closer to her.\nClimate Defiance also posted that Murkowski is an \"ecocidal pyromaniac\" and excoriated her for supporting the Willow Project, a massive oil drilling project in Alaska that the group characterized as \"cruel and barbaric beyond description.\"\nThe activist group has made a name for itself in recent months for disrupting events hosting lawmakers and public officials, as it demands aggressive climate action. It has shut down events with senior White House officials, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.\nHowever, Climate Defiance, which has been widely criticized over its disruptive methods, was invited to the White House for a private meeting with President Biden's senior clean energy czar John Podesta in December.\nAccording to White House records, on Dec. 15, Podesta met privately with Greenberg, the Climate Defiance co-founder, and Climate Defiance campaigner Bala Sivaraman. The group later boasted on social media that it had met with the top official and publicly shared a letter that its members had handed to him.\n\"Thank you for taking the time to meet with us today,\" the group wrote to Podesta in the letter. \"We appreciate your willingness to heed our deeply-held concerns. Echoing the voices of millions of Americans, we write to you in the eleventh hour of the greatest threat that humanity has ever faced: planetary and societal collapse due to the continued burning of fossil fuels.\"\n\"We urge you to wield your utmost authority to implement a swift end to any federal support for new fossil fuel infrastructure. Both the urgency of this action and the severe consequences of further delay cannot be overstated,\" it continued. \"Climate Defiance recognizes your commitment to climate action and commends you on your vital work developing and implementing the Inflation Reduction Act.\"\nThe White House and Murkowski did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Thomas Catenacci","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Podesta_Climate-Defiance.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":8.196567,"_id":"e770f097bea0f6c931f1a8c3cd1078c6"},{"title":"Left-wing climate group with shady backing takes prominent role against gas stoves","author":"Thomas Catenacci","published_date":"2024-04-20 08:00:44","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/left-wing-climate-group-shady-backing-prominent-role-gas-stoves","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"An upstart climate activist group known as Gas Leaks is increasing in prominence and financial backing, despite much of its information being shielded from the public.","summary":"A secretive climate activist group with significant financial backing is quietly taking on a more prominent role advocating against natural, gas-powered appliances, like stoves.\nThe Gas Leaks Action Campaign \u2014 which appears to have been first established in late 2021 or early 2022 \u2014 recently launched a $1 million ad campaign warning of the dangers posed by natural gas, the largest-ever effort of its kind. The group states on its website that natural gas harms the environment, pollutes the air inside homes and makes stoves \"constantly at risk of explosion.\"\nThe group has also spearheaded a campaign against the American Gas Association (AGA), the nation's leading industry group representing natural gas providers. At a Washington, D.C. event earlier this month, Gas Leaks hosted Sens. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., along with several environmental groups like the Sierra Club to blast the AGA's lobbying activities.\n\"Instead of turning off the tap on fossil fuels, our country has been flooding the market with gas and, unless we do something, we are all going to drown,\" said Markey, who is an original sponsor of the Green New Deal.\nAGA President and CEO Karen Harbert said in a statement that natural gas is \"fundamental to protecting America's energy security, achieving our environmental goals, and promoting economic prosperity.\"\n\"Despite advocacy groups willfully spreading misinformation and promoting ill-informed energy policy that would drive up prices and sacrifice environmental progress, this industry will continue to implement inclusive solutions to deliver life-essential energy and reduce emissions for our customers and communities,\" she added.\nMeanwhile, according to a Fox News Digital review of job search sites, Gas Leaks has posted several positions, including executive director, senior communications director, digital manager and digital designer, over the last two years with salaries ranging from $65,000 to $160,000. Altogether, the positions indicate the group's yearly salary and wage costs potentially exceed $465,000.\nBut despite Gas Leaks' growth and increasing influence with Democratic lawmakers and similarly climate-focused organizations, the group shares very little about itself online \u2013 its founders, funding and history are all shielded from public view. A Reuters report last month broadly stated that Gas Leaks was \"formed by climate advocacy veterans.\"\nA LinkedIn search revealed that those \"advocacy veterans\" include Caleb Heeringa, a former Sierra Club communications official who serves as Gas Leaks' campaign director; and Jamie Henn, the founder of Fossil Free Media, co-founder of 350.org and a board member of Gas Leaks.\nAccording to Gas Leaks' \"about page,\" which appears to have been removed from the group's site but remains archived, Gas Leaks is supported by the clean energy advocacy organization Climate Nexus, which is itself fiscally supported by Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, a nonprofit that regularly funnels money from donors to progressive initiatives.\nThe arrangement means Gas Leaks isn't required to file its own 990 tax ID form with the Internal Revenue Service and can, therefore, operate without publicly sharing information about its internal operations or finances.\n\"Senator Whitehouse conveniently abandons his soapbox railing against dark money when it's time for him to cozy up to a dark money group that is pushing his preferred radical climate agenda,\" said Caitlin Sutherland, Executive Director of Americans for Public Trust, a nonprofit government watchdog group. Sutherland noted the contrast between both Whitehouse's relationship with Gas Leaks and his high-profile push against dark money in politics.\n\"This latest pop-up green group is pedaling misinformation in a shadowy attempt to ban gas stoves.\"\nA Fox News Digital analysis of grants identified a single Gas Leaks donor: the California-based Heising-Simons Foundation, which states on its website that it seeks to advance \"sustainable solutions in climate and clean energy, enable groundbreaking research in science, enhance the education of our youngest learners and support human rights for all people.\"\nIn 2022 and 2023, the Heising-Simons Foundation wired two $150,000 grants to Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, earmarking both for the Gas Leaks Action Campaign.\nThe Heising-Simons Foundation has reportedly given more than $3.3 million in recent years to the Rocky Mountain Institute, a climate think tank that was involved in the aggressive push last year targeting gas stoves via regulation. The Heising-Simons Foundation was also co-founded in 2007 by Mark Heising, who remains its vice chair and is involved financially in a number of green energy companies.\n\"The only thing green about today's environmental movement is the billions in cash that flow freely between lefty billionaires, their operatives in the green movement, and the politicians who do their bidding,\" said Tom Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit.\n\"Their campaign to ban natural gas stoves is yet another example of the nexus between self-dealing wealthy elites like Mark Heising, green pressure groups like the Rocky Mountain Institute, and the Democratic Party machine.\"\nWhile environmentalists have for years sought to crack down on natural gas and gas appliances over their climate impacts, the push came to a head early last year when Richard Trumka Jr., a member of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, said banning gas stoves was \"on the table.\" The Department of Energy then issued regulations targeting gas stoves shortly thereafter.\nIn a social media post at the time, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm pointed to a Rocky Mountain Institute-funded study and said the government \"must FIX this\" by increasing access to electric stovetops. The study, which was also cited by environmentalists and other officials, tied 12% of childhood asthma cases to gas stoves.\nGas Leaks, Climate Nexus, Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors and the Heising-Simons Foundation didn't respond to requests for comment for purposes of this story. Markey and Whitehouse also didn't respond to requests for comment.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Thomas Catenacci","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/gas-stoves-protest.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.6626983,"_id":"6866deb0a06cb343baed02ee0b682b8e"},{"title":"Here's why experts don't think cloud seeding played a role in Dubai's downpour","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-18 20:13:28","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/why-experts-dont-think-cloud-seeding-played-role-dubais-downpour","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Meteorologists have said that while cloud seeding may bring rain, it doesn't typically cause pouring rain or flooding like the recent deluge that drenched the United Arab Emirates.","summary":"With cloud seeding, it may rain, but it doesn't really pour or flood \u2014 at least nothing like what drenched the United Arab Emirates and paralyzed Dubai, meteorologists said.\nCloud seeding, although decades old, is still controversial in the weather community, mostly because it has been hard to prove that it does very much. No one reports the type of flooding that on Tuesday doused the UAE, which often deploys the technology in an attempt to squeeze every drop of moisture from a sky that usually gives less than 4 or 5 inches (10 to 13 centimeters) of rain a year.\n\"It's most certainly not cloud seeding,\" said private meteorologist Ryan Maue, former chief scientist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"If that occurred with cloud seeding, they'd have water all the time. You can't create rain out of thin air per se and get 6 inches of water. That's akin to perpetual motion technology.\"\nMeteorologists and climate scientists said the extreme rainfall is akin to what the world expects with human-caused climate change, and one way to know for certain that it was not caused by tinkering with clouds is that it was forecast days in advance. Atmospheric science researcher Tomer Burg pointed to computer models that six days earlier forecast several inches of rain \u2014 the typical amount for an entire year in the UAE.\nThree low-pressure systems formed a train of storms slowly moving along the jet stream \u2014 the river of air that moves weather systems \u2014 toward the Persian Gulf, said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann. Blaming cloud seeding ignores the forecasts and the cause, he said.\nMany of the people pointing to cloud seeding are also climate change deniers who are trying to divert attention from what's really happening, Mann and other scientists said.\n\"When we talk about heavy rainfall, we need to talk about climate change. Focusing on cloud seeding is misleading,\" said Imperial College of London climate scientist Friederike Otto, who heads a team that does rapid attribution of weather extremes to see if they were caused by global warming or not. \"Rainfall is becoming much heavier around the world as the climate warms because a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture.\"\nWHAT IS CLOUD SEEDING?\nClouds need tiny water or ice droplets called nuclei to make rain. The weather modification method uses planes and ground-based cannons to shoot particles into clouds making more nucleai, attracting moisture that falls as snow and rain. Usually silver iodide is used, but it can also be dry ice and other materials. The method, first pioneered in the 1940s, became popular in the U.S. West starting in the 1960s, mostly for snow.\nIt can't create water from a clear sky \u2014 particles must be shot into a storm cloud that already holds moisture to get it to fall, or to fall more than it otherwise would naturally.\nHOW EFFECTIVE IS IT?\nA recent study of aerial seeding found a clear precipitation pattern on a radar that mirrored the seeding and offers evidence the method works. But exactly how effective it is remains unclear, scientists say.\nThe physics makes sense, but the results have been so small that scientists just can't agree on whether it is fair to say it really works, said Maue and Mann.\nAtmospheric forces are so huge and so chaotic that technically cloud seeding \"is way too small a scale to create what happened,\" Maue said. Extra rainfall from cloud seeding would have been minimal, both said.\nWHO USES IT?\nDespite not knowing its efficacy, governments in drought-stricken regions like the U.S. West and the UAE are often willing to invest in technology like seeding in the hopes of getting even a small amount of water.\nUtah estimates cloud seeding helped increase its water supply by 12% in 2018, according to an analysis by the state's Division of Water Resources. The analysis used estimates provided to them by the contractors paid to do the seeding.\nDozens of countries in Asia and the Middle East also use cloud seeding.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Reclamation spent $2.4 million last year on cloud seeding along the overtapped Colorado River. Utah recently increased its seeding budget by tenfold.\nSO WHAT CAUSED THE DELUGE?\nThat part of the Middle East doesn't get many storms, but when it does, they are whoppers that dwarf what people in the United States are used to, Maue said.\nHuge tropical storms like this \"are not rare events for the Middle East,\" said University of Reading meteorology professor Suzanne Gray. She cited a recent study analyzing nearly 100 such events over the southern Arabian Peninsula from 2000 to 2020, with most in March and April, including a March 2016 storm that dropped 9.4 inches (almost 24 centimeters) on Dubai in just a few hours.\nThe 2021 study said \"a statistically significant increase in the (whopper storms) duration over southeast Arabian Peninsula has been found, suggesting that such extreme events may be even more impactful in a warming world.\"\nWhile cloud seeding can work around the margins, it doesn't do big things, scientists say.\n\"It's maybe a little bit of a human conceit that, yeah, we can control the weather in like a Star Trek sense,\" Maue, who was appointed to NOAA by then-President Donald Trump, said. \"Maybe on long time scales, climate time scales, we're affecting the atmosphere on long time scales. But when it comes to controlling individual rain storms, we are not anywhere close to that. And if we were capable of doing that, I think we would be capable of solving many more difficult problems than creating a rain shower over Dubai.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Cloud-Seeding-Explainer.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.553207,"_id":"e68794fc5e3789895753765bc80f2217"},{"title":"Biden launches billion-dollar climate work program as part of Earth Day actions","author":"Thomas Catenacci","published_date":"2024-04-22 18:59:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-launches-billion-dollar-climate-work-program-earth-day-actions","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"President Biden is moving forward with establishing the \"groundbreaking\" climate corps program, employing thousands of Americans to fight global warming.","summary":"President Biden officially launched the so-called American Climate Corps, a program that is slated to \"mobilize\" tens of thousands of Americans for conservation and eco-friendly projects nationwide.\nThe president's actions on the work program come on Earth Day and are part of broader actions the White House unveiled Monday to commemorate Earth Day. In addition to the American Climate Corps announcement, the White House touted recent regulations blocking off 13 million acres of federal land from future oil drilling and revealed $7 billion in grants for mainly state-level solar projects.\n\"Here's the bottom line: President Biden laid out the most ambitious land and water conservation agenda in American history,\" White House Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory told reporters during a call about the administration's Earth Day actions. \"And he is delivering, already cementing a legacy as one of the nation's strongest conservation presidents.\"\n\"The groundbreaking corps represents, yet again, a way to make accessible the economic opportunity and upside that comes with tackling the climate crisis,\" added White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi. \"So, for young people of all backgrounds, no matter their qualification, no matter their zip code, there will now be pathways and positions that they can fill that help them gain the skills to succeed in the clean energy economy.\"\nOverall, the American Climate Corps will consist of 20,000 Americans who will work in a variety of roles combating climate change. The positions generally don't require previous experience and will be geared towards conservation, green energy and environmental justice work.\nOn Monday, the White House launched a new website for interested workers to apply for such roles. The site is expected to soon list 2,000 positions \u2013 such as field coordinator, forestry technician, hydrologic technician, and land conservation crew member \u2013 located across 36 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico.\nThe White House said the overarching goal of the corps is to make it easy for any American to \"find work tackling the climate crisis while gaining the skills necessary for the clean energy and climate resilience workforce of the future.\" It added the first class of the American Climate Corps will be deployed in June 2024.\n\"From day one, the President has seen the urgency of taking action on climate not just because of the situation it creates in our communities, represented in wildfires and floods and hurricanes, but also a profound sense of urgency to get American workers back in the game competing for the jobs of the future,\" a senior administration official told reporters.\nBiden first took executive action to begin forming the government work program in September after facing pressure from progressives and environmental groups who had called for such an action. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., the two architects of the Green New Deal, had led such calls among Democratic lawmakers.\nAccording to a senior administration official, ahead of the announcement Monday, the White House held listening sessions with Markey and Ocasio-Cortez to hear from Americans interested in the program.\nBut the program has faced heavy criticism from Republicans who have argued congressional action is needed to move forward with it.\nIn an October letter, Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., and Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, expressed concern that it is unclear where funding for the program would be coming from.\n\"Unlike the Civilian Conservation Corps, which was implemented by President Roosevelt in response to an authorization in a law passed by Congress, the announcement of the program does not reference any legal authority giving rise to the program,\" they wrote.\nTogether, Comer and Sessions are spearheading an oversight investigation of the program.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Thomas Catenacci","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/07/Biden-admin-rule-curbing-oil-drilling-mining-faces-widespread-opposition.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.424005,"_id":"82bd4d7731102f0c4976e9c3e8b09b79"},{"title":"Coral reefs around the world are experiencing mass bleaching in warming oceans, scientists say","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-16 10:40:17","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/science/coral-reefs-world-experiencing-mass-bleaching-warming-oceans-scientists-say","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Coral reefs around the world are experiencing global bleaching for the fourth time due to prolonged warming of the oceans, according to reef scientists.","summary":"Coral reefs around the world are experiencing global bleaching for the fourth time, top reef scientists declared Monday, a result of warming ocean waters amid human-caused climate change.\nCoral reef bleaching across at least 53 countries, territories or local economies has been confirmed from February 2023 to now, scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and International Coral Reef Initiative said. It happens when stressed coral expel the algae that are their food source and give them their color. If the bleaching is severe and long-lasting, the coral can die.\nCoral reefs are important ecosystems that sustain underwater life, protect biodiversity and slow erosion. They also support local economies through tourism.\nBleaching has been happening in various regions for some time. In the world's largest coral reef ecosystem, Australia's Great Barrier Reef, bleaching affected 90% of the coral assessed in 2022. The Florida Coral Reef, the third-largest, experienced significant bleaching last year.\nBut in order for bleaching to be declared on a global scale, significant bleaching had to be documented within each of the major ocean basins, including the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\nMonday's news marks the second worldwide bleaching event in the last 10 years. The last one ended in May 2017. Brought on by a powerful El Nino climate pattern that heated the world's oceans, it lasted three years and was determined to be worse than the prior two bleaching events in 2010 and 1998.\nThis year's bleaching follows the declaration that 2023 was the hottest year on record.\n\"As the world's oceans continue to warm, coral bleaching is becoming more frequent and severe,\" Derek Manzello, NOAA Coral Reef Watch coordinator, said in a statement.\nSelina Stead, a marine biologist and chief executive of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, called climate change \"the biggest threat to coral reefs worldwide.\" She said scientists are working to learn more about how coral responds to heat and to identify naturally heat-tolerant corals, but said it is \"critical the world works to reduce carbon emissions.\"\nOne reef that fared better than others last year was the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, which was afforded some protection by its location in deeper water in the Gulf of Mexico about 100 miles off the Texas coast.

These regulations would effectively lock up more than 13 million acres of public land within the National Petroleum Reserve (NPR-A), sources familiar with the agency's timing told Fox News Digital. The regulations represent one of the Biden administration's most aggressive actions pushed under its climate and conservation agenda.\nAccording to the DOI, the regulations as proposed would create an outright prohibition on any new leasing across 10.6 million acres of the area, equivalent to about 40% of the entire NPR-A. They would additionally require DOI subagency the Bureau of Land Management to review whether to expand protected areas or create new protected areas in the NPR-A at least every five years.\n\"With climate change warming the Arctic more than twice as fast as the rest of the planet, we must do everything within our control to meet the highest standards of care to protect this fragile ecosystem,\" Interior Secretary Deb Haaland previously said. \"President Biden is delivering on the most ambitious climate and conservation agenda in history.\"\nUnder the administration's actions curbing development in the NPR-A, future oil and gas leasing and industrial development would be strictly limited in the vast Teshekpuk Lake, Utukok Uplands, Colville River, Kasegaluk Lagoon and Peard Bay \u2013 \"special areas\" known for their rich wildlife populations on Alaska's North Slope. DOI said closing the land off from resource development would help protect various wildlife species, including caribou.\nThe regulations, initially proposed in September, have since garnered more than 10,000 public comment letters, reflecting both support for and opposition to the rules.\nAnd according to the Office of Management and Budget filings reviewed by Fox News Digital, DOI officials have met with several stakeholders.\nWhile the regulations have received support from Democrats and environmental groups, they have been blasted by the state of Alaska, Alaska's bipartisan congressional delegation, local leaders, Indigenous groups, energy industry associations and Republican lawmakers.\n\"Joe Biden is doing everything he can to attack American energy,\" Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said during a press conference late Thursday. \"They're going to prohibit oil production in, of all places, the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. That's like saying no more picnics in Yellowstone National Park.\"\nSen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, who organized the press conference, added in an interview with FOX Business on Thursday that locking up NPR-A lands would outsource oil and gas production to \"regimes that hate us\" like Russia, Venezuela and Iran.\nIn February, Sullivan, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, sent a letter to the White House, urging it to consider the perspectives of Native Alaskans, many of whom support oil and gas development in the NPR-A.\n\"While we obviously recognize the impacts of climate change on the Alaskan environment, the policy objectives of this administration do not negate congressional direction for the management of the Petroleum Reserve, nor do those objectives nullify the obligation to hear and consider the perspectives of the North Slope people that will be negatively impacted by this proposed rule,\" several Native Alaskan leaders wrote in a comment letter to DOI.\nOverall, NPR-A spans 23 million acres of public land in northern Alaska.

The president said Americans can now apply to become the first members of the American Climate Corps and get paid to fight climate change by learning how to install solar panels, fight wildfires, rebuild wetlands and winterize homes, among other things.\nBiden said he has seen the \"devastating toll\" of climate change firsthand, saying since becoming president, he has flown over all the major fires and \"thousands upon thousands of acres\" that were burned flat by wildfires.\nHe also said he met with families whose homes were \"wiped off the map\" by hurricanes, floods and storms last year, adding that last year Earth faced the hottest day on record. In just two years, he said, natural disasters and extreme weather in America caused $270 billion in damages.\n\"But folks, despite the overwhelming devastation in red and blue states, there's still those who deny climate is in crisis,\" Biden told the crowd. \"My MAGA Republican friends don't seem to think it's a crisis\u2026 they actually want to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, which actually provides the funding for a vast majority of these projects and roll back\u2026 protections for clean air and clean water.\n\"I'm not going to go into it now, but I'm not making it up. It's real. Just listen to what they say,\" the president said. \"Anyone in or out of government who willfully denies the impacts of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future, and the world, I might add. They want to take us backwards, sideline our workers, let China and others lead the race for clean energy. I'm determined, absolutely determined we move forward.\"\nBefore the president walked up to the podium, several lawmakers spoke about Earth Day, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who thanked Biden for launching the American Climate Corps.\nOcasio-Cortez also spoke about Franklin D. Roosevelt inspiring the idea through a bill he put forward in 1933, to create the original Civilian Conservation Corps. Ocasio-Cortez called Roosevelt's bill revolutionary in the wake of the Great Depression, as it put over 3 million young people to work, created 711 new state parks and improved the nation's public lands.\nAt the beginning of Biden's speech, he acknowledged comments made by Bernie Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez.\n\"Bernie, you're the best. And Representative Ocasio-Cortez of New York. You know, I learned a long time ago, listen to that lady. Listen to that lady. We're going to talk more about another part of the world, too, really quickly,\" Biden said in a cryptic way.\nDespite what looked to be foreshadowing before his speech, the president never spoke of other parts of the world, except for when he mentioned the U.S. rejoining the Paris Agreement.\nIn his closing statement, Biden spoke about Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps, which Biden said, \"was referenced by the Congress lady,\" failing to refer to Ocasio-Cortez by name.\nBiden quoted Roosevelt, saying, \"more important than the material gains, will be the moral and spiritual value of such work.\"\n\"He always put it in context and went beyond just what the immediate need was,\" Biden said. \"I'd say the same holds true for what we're doing here today as a moral imperative, and I've never been more optimistic about America's future.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Greg Wehner","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/Biden-1.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.9933577,"_id":"eb28f47707f286435f2fb53e5fb6c600"},{"title":"Biden sounding climate alarm to gain favor with youth and progressive voters","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-21 02:27:06","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6351340228112","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts react to the White House renewing internal talks on invoking a climate emergency as activists push for action from President Biden.","summary":"All times eastern FOX News Saturday Night with Jimmy Failla FOX News Radio Live Channel Coverage\nAll times eastern FOX News Saturday Night with Jimmy Failla FOX News Radio Live Channel Coverage","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/74b4a22e-b302-41ec-9b5c-98df5695c939/a0271976-794c-4c15-a7d8-f441533d23c6/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.7132063,"_id":"26e8321c0edf1f4b8afba8844d4ae19c"},{"title":"UK climate activist won't be charged for sign telling jurors to vote their conscience","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-22 20:53:57","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-climate-activist-wont-charged-sign-telling-jurors-vote-conscience","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"A judge has ruled that Trudi Warner cannot be charged with contempt of court for holding up a sign outside of a courtroom that reminded jurors of their right to acquit defendants.","summary":"A climate protester who could have faced up to two years in prison for holding a sign outside a courthouse reminding jurors of their right to acquit defendants cannot be charged with contempt of court, a London judge ruled Monday.\nTrudi Warner had been arrested last March and accused of \"deliberately targeting\" jurors before a trial of climate activists from the group Insulate Britain.\nShe held a sign in front of Inner London Crown Court that said: \"Jurors you have an absolute right to acquit a defendant according to your conscience.\"\nHigh Court Justice Pushpinder Saini said her act was not a crime because jurors can reach a verdict based on their conscience and Warner had not interfered with jurors.\n\"It is fanciful to suggest that Ms. Warner's behavior falls into this category of contempt,\" Saini said. \"At no point did Ms. Warner assault, threaten, block, accost or impede anyone's access to the court.\"\nThe ruling comes as hundreds of environmental activists have been arrested for peaceful demonstrations in Europe and the U.K., where tough new laws restrict the right to protest.\nWhile the Conservative British government says the laws prevent extremist activists from hurting the economy and disrupting daily life, critics say civil rights are being eroded without enough scrutiny from lawmakers or protection by the courts.\nHundreds of people followed Warner's lead and held similar signs outside courthouses to protest what they said undermined the foundations of trial by jury.

Cases in New York are largely associated with exposure to materials contaminated with rat urine from the Norway rat.\nThe disease can cause fever, headache, chills, muscle aches, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, conjunctival suffusion, jaundice, and rash, Celia Quinn, the deputy commissioner for the Division of Disease Control, who issued an April 12 memo warning of the disease.\nIf not treated, kidney failure, meningitis, liver damage, and respiratory distress can occur, she said.\n\"Transmission occurs through direct contact with infectious urine or urine contaminated water, soil, or food, entering the body through open wounds or mucous membranes,\" the memo states.\nThe Bronx had the most cases with 37, while Manhattan had 28, the memo said. Person-to-person transmission is rare, officials said.\nThe Leptospira bacteria can die within minutes in the dry heat and freezing cold, Quinn said.\n\"The cold winters of NYC likely limit the extent to which leptospires can survive in the environment,\" she said. \"However excessive rain and unseasonably warm temperatures, factors associated with climate change, may support the persistence of leptospires in more temperate areas like NYC.\"\nMore than half of the 24 cases reported last year were reported between June and October, a period when there was warmer and wetter climate with excessive rain and \"unseasonably\" warm days.\nThe number of cases raised alarms because only three per year were reported from 2001 to 2020.

They're getting poorer,\" Ayhan Kose, deputy chief economist for the World Bank and one of the report's authors, told Reuters.\n\"We see a very serious structural regression, a reversal in the world ... that's why we are ringing the alarm bells here,\" he said.\nThe report said the 75 countries eligible for grants and zero-interest loans from the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA) risk a lost decade of development without ambitious policy shifts and significant international aid.\nKose said growth in many IDA countries had already begun to taper off before the COVID-19 pandemic, but it would be just 3.4% in 2020-2024, the weakest half-decade of growth since the early 1990s. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, climate change, increases in violence and conflict also weighed heavily on their prospects.\nMore than half of all IDA countries are in Sub-Saharan Africa; 14 are in East Asia and eight are in Latin America and the Caribbean. Thirty-one have per capita incomes of less than $1,315 a year. They include the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan and Haiti.\nOne in three IDA countries is poorer now than on the eve of the pandemic. IDA countries account for 92% of the world's people who lack access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food. Half of the countries are in debt distress, meaning they are unable to service debt or are at high risk of not being able to.\nAnd despite their young populations - a demographic boon at a time when populations were aging nearly everywhere else, rich natural resources and abundant solar-energy potential, private and government creditors had been backing away from them.\nU.S. Treasury Undersecretary Jay Shambaugh raised concerns about the worsening situation last week, warning China and other emerging official creditors against free-riding by curtailing loans to low-income countries just as the IMF or multilateral development banks were pouring funds in.\nAlmost 40 countries saw external public debt outflows in 2022, and the flows likely worsened in 2023, he said.\nKose said ambitious policies were needed to accelerate investment, including domestic efforts to strengthen fiscal, monetary and financial policies, and structural reforms to improve education and increase domestic revenues.\nSignificant financial support from the global community was also essential to make progress and lower the risk of protracted stagnation, Kose said, noting that the World Bank hoped to drum up a robust replenishment of IDA funds by December.\nStronger international coordination on climate change, debt restructurings and measures supporting cross-border trade would also be crucial, it said.\nIndermit Gill, World Bank chief economist, noted that China, India and South Korea - now major economic powerhouses - had once been among the world's poorest countries, but were able to tackle extreme poverty and raise living standards.\n\"The world cannot afford to turn its back on IDA countries,\" he said.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/World-Bank-poorest-countries.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.013095,"_id":"f64b2cd160c2e48c4cd2413013eb1d47"},{"title":"Springtime

United Arab Emirates on Wednesday attempted to dry out after Dubai International Airport was flooded out and flights were disrupted; this follows the heaviest rain ever recorded in the country.","summary":"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 The desert nation of the United Arab Emirates attempted to dry out Wednesday from the heaviest rain ever recorded there after a deluge flooded out Dubai International Airport, disrupting flights through the world's busiest airfield for international travel.\nThe state-run WAM news agency called the rain Tuesday \"a historic weather event\" that surpassed \"anything documented since the start of data collection in 1949.\" That's before the discovery of crude oil in this energy-rich nation then part of a British protectorate known as the Trucial States.\nRain also fell in Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. However, the rains were acute across the UAE.\nThe flooding sparked speculation that cloud seeding -- flying small planes through clouds dispersing chemicals aimed at getting rain to fall -- may have caused the deluge. But experts said the storm systems that produced the rain were forecast well in advance and that cloud seeding would not have caused such flooding.\nSeveral reports quoted meteorologists at the National Center for Meteorology as saying they flew six or seven cloud-seeding flights before the rains. Flight-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed one aircraft affiliated with the UAE's cloud-seeding efforts flew around the country Monday.\nThe National, an English-language, state-linked newspaper in Abu Dhabi, quoted an anonymous official at the center on Wednesday as saying no cloud seeding took place on Tuesday, without acknowledging any earlier flights.\nThe center did not respond to questions Wednesday from the AP.\nThe UAE, which heavily relies on energy-hungry desalination plants to provide water, conducts cloud seeding in part to increase its dwindling, limited groundwater.\nJeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections, said the flooding in Dubai was caused by an unusually strong low pressure system that drove many rounds of heavy thunderstorms.\n\"You don't need cloud seeding's influence to account for the record deluge in Dubai,\" Masters said.\nScientists also say climate change in general is responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme storms, droughts, floods and wildfires around the world. Dubai hosted the United Nations' COP28 climate talks just last year. Rising temperatures and other effects of global warming long have been viewed as a threat to life in the already-baking region.\nThe rains began late Monday, soaking the sands and roadways of Dubai with some 20 millimeters (0.79 inches) of rain, according to meteorological data collected at Dubai International Airport. The storms intensified around 9 a.m. local Tuesday and continued throughout the day, dumping more rain and hail onto the overwhelmed city.\nBy the end of Tuesday, more than 142 millimeters (5.59 inches) of rainfall had soaked Dubai over 24 hours. An average year sees 94.7 millimeters (3.73 inches) of rain at Dubai International Airport, a hub for the long-haul carrier Emirates.\nAt the airport, standing water lapped on taxiways as aircraft landed. Arrivals were halted Tuesday night, and passengers struggled to reach terminals through the floodwater covering surrounding roads.\nOne couple, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to speak freely in a country with strict laws that criminalize critical speech, called the situation at the airport \"absolute carnage.\"\n\"You cannot get a taxi. There's people sleeping in the Metro station. There's people sleeping in the airport,\" the man said Wednesday.\nThey ended up getting a taxi to near their home some 30 kilometers (18 miles) away, but floodwater on the road stopped them. A bystander helped them over a highway barrier with their carry-on luggage, the bottles of gin they picked up from duty-free clinking away.\nDubai International Airport acknowledged Wednesday morning that the flooding had left \"limited transportation options\" and affected flights as aircraft crews couldn't reach the airfield.\n\"Recovery will take some time,\" the airport said on the social platform X.\nEmirates said the airline had halted check-in for passengers departing from Dubai itself from 8 a.m. until midnight Wednesday as it tried to clear the airport of transit passengers \u2014 many of whom had been sleeping where they could in its cavernous terminals.\nPassengers on FlyDubai, Emirates' low-cost sister airline, also faced disruptions.\nPaul Griffiths, the airport's CEO, acknowledged continued issues with flooding Wednesday morning, saying every place an aircraft could be safely parked was taken. Some aircraft had been diverted to Al Maktoum International Airport at Dubai World Central, the city-state's second airfield.\n\"It remains an incredibly challenging time. In living memory, I don't think anyone has ever seen conditions like it,\" Griffiths told the state-owned talk radio station Dubai Eye. \"We are in uncharted territory, but I can assure everyone we are working as hard as we possibly can to make sure our customers and staff are looked after.\"\nEgypt's national carrier, EgyptAir, also temporarily suspended flights between Cairo and Dubai due to the bad weather.\nSchools across the UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms, largely shut ahead of the storm and government employees were largely working remotely if able. Many workers stayed home as well, though some ventured out, with the unfortunate stalling out their vehicles in deeper-than-expected water covering spots on some roads. That included parts of the Sheikh Zayed Road, a 12-lane highway through downtown Dubai.\nAuthorities sent tanker trucks out into the streets and highways to pump away the water. Water poured into some homes, forcing people to bail out their houses.\nThe country's hereditary rulers offered no overall damage or injury information for the nation, as some slept in their flooded vehicles Tuesday night. In Ras al-Khaimah, the country's northernmost emirate, police said one 70-year-old man died when his vehicle was swept away by floodwater.\nKhatm al-Shakla, an area near Al Ain in Abu Dhabi, saw 254 millimeters (10 inches) of rain Tuesday, the most anywhere in the country, officials said.\nAuthorities canceled school and the government instituted remote work again for Wednesday. Dubai later closed schools for the rest of the week.\nRain is unusual in the UAE, an arid, Arabian Peninsula nation, but occurs periodically during the cooler winter months. Many roads and other areas lack drainage given the lack of regular rainfall, causing flooding.\nMeanwhile in neighboring Oman, a sultanate that rests on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, at least 19 people were killed in heavy rains in recent days, according to a statement Wednesday from the country's National Committee for Emergency Management. That includes some 10 schoolchildren swept away in a vehicle with an adult, which saw condolences come into the country from rulers across the region.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Arabian-Peninsula-Rain.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.774521,"_id":"d973ed231fc29479b614512795d3e705"},{"title":"State financial officers put Bank of America on notice for allegedly 'de-banking' conservatives","author":"Thomas Catenacci","published_date":"2024-04-18 18:16:51","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-financial-officers-put-bank-of-america-on-notice-for-allegedly-de-banking-conservatives","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"FIRST ON FOX: A group of 15 state financial officers penned a letter to bank of America, warning it against discriminating against conservatives and religious Americans.","summary":"FIRST ON FOX: A group of 15 financial officers representing 13 states issued a warning to Bank of America over its alleged practices of \"politicized de-banking\" targeting conservatives.\nIn a letter to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, the officials said the bank's practices threaten its own financial health and reputation with customers, while simultaneously harming the U.S. economy and Americans' civil liberties. They pointed to examples of Bank of America shuttering the accounts belonging to Christian groups and leaders, and joining a net-zero climate alliance, in addition to its poor viewpoint diversity rating.\n\"Americans should never have to worry that their personal financial decisions will be weaponized against them,\" Kentucky State Auditor Allison Ball said in a statement. \"This practice has become all too common, and banks must urgently course correct to uphold their fiduciary duty and safeguard the constitutional freedoms of Americans.\"\nShe blasted executives at financial institutions for taking advantage \"of the divided political climate to engage in politicized de-banking.\"\nIn one example highlighted by Ball and the other 14 officials, in April 2023, Bank of America shut down the bank account belonging to Indigenous Advance Ministries, a Christian charitable organization that assists at-risk children, prisoners and sex trafficking victims in Uganda. The bank further closed the accounts of a Memphis, Tenn., church that donated to that group.\nBank of America explained the action was taken because of the group's \"business type\" and that its activities exceeded the \"bank's risk tolerance.\" After repeated requests for clarification from Indigenous Advance Ministries, Bank of America claimed the accounts were closed because a business affiliated with the group engaged in debt collection, The Christian Post newspaper reported.\nAccording to the letter, in a similar action last year, Bank of America closed the account of Timothy Two Project International, which trains pastors in more than 65 countries. The bank reportedly informed Timothy Two Project International that it was \"operating a business type we have chosen not to service.\"\nAnd three years prior, Bank of America reportedly froze the accounts of Christian author and preacher Lance Wallnau for allegedly laundering money. It then unfroze his account after asking him \"invasive\" questions about his activities, the state officers wrote.\nThe letter stated that Bank of America's actions strongly suggest that \"systemic drivers of religious and political bias may be at work within the company as a whole. The bank, though, pushed back on those accusations.\n\"Given the large number of non-profits we serve that are affiliated with religious organizations, it's absurd to think religious beliefs are a factor in any account closing decision,\" Bank of America spokesperson Bill Halldin told Fox News Digital. \"Very simply, they are not.\"\nThe state financial officers also said Bank of America's membership in the so-called Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a global group that coordinates actions taken by banks to push a green energy transition, may facilitate de-banking. They noted that commitments made by Bank of America through its membership could greatly harm farmers in their states since it will lead to higher prices.\nAnd the letter pointed to Bank of America's low ranking on the Viewpoint Diversity Score Business Index, a benchmark measuring corporate respect for free speech and freedom of religion. The index found that Bank of America partners with left-wing groups like the Human Rights Campaign and the Center for American Progress when it comes to its gift-matching program, but leaves out faith-based groups, instead citing its support for \"homeless shelters, soup kitchens or other social service needs.\"\n\"This pattern of internal political and religious bias at Bank of America poses risks for public funds invested in the company as well as for the millions of individuals, businesses, and nonprofits who rely on its services,\" the letter to Moynihan stated. \"Bank of America's de-banking policies and practices improperly subordinate financial well-being to other factors and place the company's business interests at risk.\"\nThe letter concluded by asking Bank of America to take a number of good faith steps to address the concerns, including eliminating viewpoint discrimination and exiting the Net-Zero Banking Alliance.\n\"Financial institutions like Bank of America should not be allowed to restrict Americans' access to capital based solely on their political or religious views. SFOF will continue to work with our members to fight for financial sanity, free of political agendas,\" said State Financial Officers Foundation CEO Derek Kreifels.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Thomas Catenacci","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Bank-of-America-Mortgage.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.612379,"_id":"cee0c4dc8720621036a4c98271d8df57"},{"title":"Fundraising effort for conflict-hit Ethiopia garners $630M, just over half of $1B goal","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-16 21:31:08","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/fundraising-effort-conflict-hit-ethiopia-garners-630m-half-1b-goal","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"A U.N.-backed gathering has reportedly raised some $630 million in funding for conflict-ravaged Ethiopia, but still fell far short of its billion-dollar goal.","summary":"A United Nations-backed gathering raised pledges of almost $630 million for Ethiopia's humanitarian crisis on Tuesday but fell short of the $1 billion sought to help feed and support millions of people facing conflict and climate change in Africa's second most populous country.\nThe United States, Ethiopia's leading humanitarian donor, warned that its resources are \"increasingly stretched.\" The U.K., the second-largest donor, said Ethiopia risks being \"overshadowed by other humanitarian crises globally.\"\nDonors also called on the Ethiopian government to ensure aid is delivered without interference and reaches those in need.

Experts share risk factors and safety tips.","summary":"Many regions across the United States experienced \"record-breaking high temperatures\" in 2023 due to extreme heat, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nEmergency room visits due to heat-related illness peaked in several regions in the U.S. and remained elevated for a prolonged duration compared to visits between 2018 and 2022, the agency's recent Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report noted.\nMore males went to the emergency room for heat-related illnesses than females \u2013 especially those between 18 and 64 years old.\nAmericans are experiencing \"longer, hotter and more frequent episodes of extreme heat,\" the report states.\n\"Extreme heat could be considered an invisible killer in so much as many people become exposed and vulnerable to its dangers quickly and often without warning,\" Patrick McHugh, M.D., an emergency medicine physician at Cleveland Clinic Akron General in Akron, Ohio, told Fox News Digital.\nAlthough McHugh said Americans \"shouldn't worry,\" he emphasized the need to \"be aware and prepared for the dangers of heat waves.\"\nAn EPA spokesperson told Fox News Digital, \"As average temperatures rise due to climate change, the risk of extreme temperatures, heat waves and record-breaking temperatures increases.\"\nHere's what to know about extreme heat and how to stay safe.\n\"Extreme heat can be defined depending on a variety of factors, including location, weather conditions (such as cloud cover, humidity and temperature), and the time of year,\" said an EPA spokesperson in an email.\nIt typically occurs when the weather is much hotter and/or more humid than average in a particular area, the agency added.\nWhile summertime temperatures of 100 degrees Fahrenheit might be normal for Phoenix, Arizona, for example \u2014 the same temperatures are considered extreme for Boston, Massachusetts.\n\"Where in the U.S. people are most susceptible to heat depends on what is normal for a given location and the type of infrastructure (such as access to air conditioning),\" the EPA spokesperson noted.\n\"Extreme heat is becoming more common in places that have not historically experienced extreme heat \u2026 and don't have the infrastructure to keep people cool, which has major consequences for health and safety.\"\n\"Extreme heat could be considered an invisible killer \u2026 as many people become exposed and vulnerable to its dangers quickly and often without warning.\"\nA heat wave is typically defined as a \"prolonged period of abnormally hot weather, usually lasting more than two days in a row,\" the EPA spokesperson said.\nHeat waves can occur with or without humidity.\nThe average global temperature has risen by more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the mid-1800s, according to McHugh.\n\"This results in greater extreme heat temperatures, increased variability in temperatures and an increase in the risk of heat illness,\" he told Fox News Digital.\nThe EPA's Heat Waves indicator, which monitors trends in heat waves for 50 cities across the U.S. over the past 60 years, shows that heat waves are occurring more often over a longer period of time \u2014 both in average number of days and season length \u2014 and are also becoming hotter over time.\nElderly adults, infants, individuals taking certain medications and people with disabilities are at greater risk of heat-related illnesses, according to McHugh, who has a specialty in wilderness medicine.\nThese individuals may not have adequate resources to escape the heat and protect themselves, he warned.\n\"Many schools in northern parts of the U.S. do not have air conditioning, so when heat waves happen in May/June or [in] September, students and teachers can be at risk,\" the EPA spokesperson noted.\nCertain factors can also increase someone's risk of developing a heat-related illness, including fever, dehydration, prescription drug use, alcohol use or sunburn, according to the CDC.\nHealthy people can be at risk if they engage in strenuous physical activity when it's very hot outside \u2014 which means it's important to balance activities with actions that cool the body to prevent heat-related illness, the EPA advised.\nCertain settings \u2014 such as inside cars, construction worksites and homes with little to no air conditioning \u2014 can also put people at greater risk, according to the CDC.\nSome urban areas experience higher temperatures compared to outlying areas.\n\"Structures such as buildings, roads and other infrastructure absorb and re-emit the sun's heat more than natural landscapes like forests and water bodies,\" the EPA spokesperson said.\nThese highly concentrated areas, which have limited greenery, become \"islands\" of higher temperatures relative to outlying areas.\n\"Daytime temperatures in urban areas are about 1 to 7 [degrees Fahrenheit] higher than temperatures in outlying areas, and nighttime temperatures are about 2-5 [degrees Fahrenheit] higher,\" the agency noted.\nPeople living and working in these areas are at higher risk of heat-related illness and death.\n\"Prolonged exposure to high temperatures is associated with increased hospital admissions for cardiovascular, kidney and respiratory disorders.\"\nAs people lose control of their internal temperature amid extreme heat, they may experience a range of illnesses, including heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and hyperthermia, according to the EPA.\n\"Prolonged exposure to high temperatures is associated with increased hospital admissions for cardiovascular, kidney and respiratory disorders,\" the spokesperson said.\nSome 1,220 people die of heat-related illness every year in the United States due to extreme heat, per CDC estimates.\n\"Heat islands also increase energy demand for cooling, which can increase greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution and can be a financial burden for many people \u2014 particularly low- or fixed-income households,\" the EPA spokesperson said.\nEveryone should have a plan in case of extreme heat, McHugh advised. \"Either an air-conditioned home or building where shelter from the heat is easily available should be used.\"\nThose who counter climate change claims warn of extreme temperatures at both ends of the spectrum.\nMost studies have shown that extreme cold causes about 10 times more excess deaths than extreme heat, according to William Happer, PhD, professor emeritus of physics at Princeton University in New Jersey and a prominent critic of climate extremism.\nA 2015 international study that analyzed deaths between 1985 and 2012 in 13 countries, including the U.S., found that most of the deaths due to adverse temperatures were attributable to cold weather.\nThe study, which was published in The Lancet, also revealed that most deaths were caused not by extreme temperatures, but by exposure to moderately hot and cold temperatures.\nA more recent study published in The Lancet Planetary Health in 2021 found that for every death associated with heat, nine were connected to cold.\n\"No one knows how much of the modest recent warming, around 1 [degree Celsius] over the past century, has been due to greenhouse gases and how much is natural,\" Happer told Fox News Digital.\nHe estimates that less than half of the warming is from increasing greenhouse gases.\n\"Whatever the cause, observations clearly show that there has been very little change in daily high temperatures,\" Happer noted.\n\"The warming is almost all due to warmer minimum temperatures at night and in the winter.\"\nCompared to lives lost due to the extreme heat, the warming should have saved more lives that would have been lost because of the extreme cold, he said.\nFor local heat and health information, the EPA spokesperson recommended using the CDC's Heat and Health Tracker.\nAmericans can also visit their local National Weather Service (NWS) Forecast Offices for real-time heat-related warnings.\nFox Weather can also be consulted on a regular basis for up-to-date weather information and news.\nFor more Health articles, visit

It's an annual event founded by people who hoped to stir activism to clean up and preserve a planet that is now home to some 8 billion humans and assorted trillions of other organisms.\nHere are answers to some common questions about Earth Day and how it came to be:\nEarth Day has its roots in growing concern over pollution in the 1960s, when author Rachel Carson's 1962 book \"Silent Spring,\" about the pesticide DDT and its damaging effects on the food chain, hit bestseller lists and raised awareness about nature's delicate balance.\nBut it was a senator from Wisconsin, Democrat Gaylord Nelson, who had the idea that would become Earth Day. Nelson had long been concerned about the environment when a massive offshore oil spill sent millions of gallons onto the southern California coast in 1969. Nelson, after touring the spill site, had the idea of doing a national \"teach-in\" on the environment, similar to teach-ins being held on some college campuses at the time to oppose the war in Vietnam.\nNelson and others, including activist Denis Hayes, worked to expand the idea beyond college campuses, with events all around the country, and came up with the Earth Day name.\nA history of the movement by EarthDay.org, where Hayes remains board chair emeritus, says the date of the first Earth Day \u2014 April 22, 1970 \u2014 was chosen because it fell on a weekday between spring break and final exams and the aim was to attract as many students as possible.\nIt's not a federal holiday. But many groups use the day to put together volunteer events with the environment in mind, such as cleanups of natural areas. You can see a list of events worldwide, or register your own event, at EarthDay.org.\nIt has. The overwhelming public response to the first Earth Day is credited with adding pressure for the U.S. Congress to do more to address pollution, and it did, passing landmark legislation including the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. More broadly, it's seen as the birth of the modern environmental movement. In later years, Earth Day expanded to become a truly global event. It now claims to have motivated action in more than 192 countries.\nIn 2000, Earth Day began taking aim at climate change, a problem that has grown rapidly more urgent in recent years.\nThis year's Earth Day is focusing on the threat that plastics pose to our environment, with a call to end all single-use plastic and find replacements for their use so they can quickly be phased down.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Earth-Day-celebration.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.043693,"_id":"ed62a2515fa47fbda17d91abc4df8983"},{"title":"Your favorite coffee may be more than half a million years old","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-16 10:34:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/science/favorite-coffee-half-million-years-old","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Researchers have discovered the ancient origins of arabica coffee, the world's most popular type, tracing its lineage back about 600,000 years through genetic analysis.","summary":"That coffee you slurped this morning? It's 600,000 years old.\nUsing genes from coffee plants around the world, researchers built a family tree for the world's most popular type of coffee, known to scientists as Coffea arabica and to coffee lovers simply as \"arabica.\"\nThe researchers, hoping to learn more about the plants to better protect them from pests and climate change, found that the species emerged around 600,000 years ago through natural crossbreeding of two other coffee species.\n\"In other words, prior to any intervention from man,\" said Victor Albert, a biologist at the University at Buffalo who co-led the study.\nThese wild coffee plants originated in Ethiopia but are thought to have been first roasted and brewed primarily in Yemen starting in the 1400s. In the 1600s, Indian monk Baba Budan is fabled to have smuggled seven raw coffee beans back to his homeland from Yemen, laying the foundation for coffee's global takeover.\nArabica coffee, prized for its smooth and relatively sweet flavor, now makes up 60% - 70% of the global coffee market and is brewed by brands such as Starbucks, Tim Horton's and Dunkin'. The rest is robusta, a stronger and more bitter coffee made from one of arabica's parents, Coffea canephora.\nTo piece together arabica coffee's past, researchers studied genomes of C. canephora, another parent called Coffea eugenioides, and more than 30 different arabica plants, including a sample from the 1700s \u2014 courtesy of the Natural History Museum in London \u2014 that Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus used to name the plant.\nThe study was published Monday in the journal Nature Genetics. Researchers from Nestl\u00e9, which owns several coffee brands, contributed to the study.\nThe arabica plant's population fluctuated over thousands of years before humans began cultivating it, flourishing during warm, wet periods and suffering through dry ones. These lean times created so-called population bottlenecks, when only a small number of genetically similar plants survived.\nToday, that renders arabica coffee plants more vulnerable to diseases like coffee leaf rust, which cause billions of dollars in losses every year. The researchers explored the makeup of one arabica variety that is resistant to coffee leaf rust, highlighting sections of its genetic code that could help protect the plant.\nThe study clarifies how arabica came to be and spotlights clues that could help safeguard the crop, said Fabian Echeverria, an adviser for the Center for Coffee Research and Education at Texas A&M University who was not involved with the research.\nExploring arabica's past and present could yield insight into keeping coffee plants healthy \u2013 and coffee cups full \u2013 for future early mornings.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Coffee-Beans.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.0279436,"_id":"c365175140bec85b6852033e7830d002"},{"title":"California aquarium pairs stranded sea otter pups with surrogate moms","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-17 10:42:10","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-aquarium-pairs-stranded-sea-otter-pups-surrogate-moms","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Two California aquariums are addressing the issue of stranded sea otter pups found along the state's coast each year by pairing them with surrogate mothers.","summary":"Every year, around 10 to 15 sea otter pups are found stranded off the California coast, often due to storms that separate mother and offspring.\nThe Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach is partnering with the Monterey Bay Aquarium to pair pups with surrogate sea otter mothers with the hope of teaching them life skills and returning them to the wild.\nAs part of the program, the aquarium has successfully bonded their first surrogate mom, called Ellie, and a currently unnamed pup.\n\"That mom is going to teach them all of the behaviors that we cannot teach, being people,\" said Megan Smylie, the sea otter program manager at the Aquarium of the Pacific.\n\"That adult female will start to mimic behaviors that the pup should learn, will help it groom, will help it forage, will help it teach prey manipulation, how to open up shells and anything that they would need to know that humans are unable to teach them,\" Smylie added.\nCalifornia sea otters are a protected species. After being relentlessly hunted for their unique fur - they have the densest hair of any animal with up to a million hairs per square inch - they were thought to be extinct until a colony of 50 was found off the coast of Big Sur in the 1930s.\nNow, the numbers are up to around 3,000 but more are needed not only for the species' survival but also to protect California's near-shore ecosystems.\n\"They are a critical sort of predator in that system that keeps herbivores like sea urchins in check so that sea urchins don't overpopulate and take out kelp forests and eel grass beds, as an example,\" said Brett Long, a senior director at the Aquarium of the Pacific.\nThe sea grass and kelp ecosystems are credited with creating biodiversity, protecting against climate events and are a powerful tool in carbon sequestration, Smylie said.\nSea otters may be super cute and cuddly, but Long also says they are very territorial and are \"just a wolverine in the water.\"\nTheir eating habits are pricey, as they consume 25 percent of their bodyweight every day in restaurant-quality seafood. So a 45-pound otter eats 10-12 pounds of seafood a day.\nThat means that feeding an otter costs the aquarium $40,000 a year and demands constant fundraising.\nThe two aquariums have rescued eight stranded pups and hope other organizations can join the effort to increase the population in the wild and protect the California shore ecosystem.\n\"This is a bigger purpose,\" said Long. \"This is a higher challenge. So we invest and we invest a lot but we've all now learned and appreciate, boy, you see that juvenile otter survive out in the wild.

Perfection,\" Pollak wrote in a post to X.\nHirsi, who co-founded the U.S. Youth Climate Strike and has received fawning coverage from liberal media outlets, added the infamous symbol to her profile at some point in 2021.\n\"Barnard College has just suspended Ilhan Omar's daughter for her involvement in pro-Hamas and Iran protests at Columbia University,\" wrote Brigitte Gabriel, the founder and chairman of ACT For America. \"Supporting terrorism should be grounds for immediate expulsion!\n\"Ilhan Omar doesn't just hate America, she's also teaching her kids to hate America,\" Gabriel wrote in a follow-up post. \"Why are we bringing people to America who hate America? This is a road to terrorism.\"\nEmily Schrader, an Israeli-American human rights activist who campaigns against antisemitism, questioned why Hirsi is only facing a suspension and insisted that she \"should be expelled.\"\n\"Ilhan Omar's daughter suspended from Columbia for her leadership role in unsanctioned antisemitic and pro-terror protests,\" Schrader wrote in a post on X. \"My only question is, why only now, and why only a suspension? She should be expelled. I'll happily pay for a ticket to Gaza for her.\"\nStopAntisemitism \u2014 a group that frequently provides its social media followers with the names, accounts and employers of those it says espouse antisemitic viewpoints \u2014 also chimed in about the news.\n\"Seems the apple doesn't fall very far from the tree,\" the group wrote in a post to X.\nThe group also included in its post a photo of Omar and her daughter, with the caption reading, \"Antisemite Ilhan Omar's daughter, Isra Hirsi, suspended from Barnard/Columbia for radical anti-Israel protesting\".\nThe group also responded directly to Hirsi's initial tweet, saying, \"Good news! You were told several times to leave the encampment and you didn't. Now you're suffering the consequences.\"\nBrooke Goldstein, a human rights attorney who serves as the executive director of The Lawfare Project, also weighed in on Hirsi's suspension, saying she was not surprised by the news.\n\"Hirsi has acknowledged that she is one of the organizers of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), the hate group that has done so much damage \u2013 not just to Jewish students on campus, but to the rights of all students,\" Goldstein wrote. \"This may be breaking news, but somehow it is not shocking news. A lot of questions need to be answered, including by Rep. Ilhan Omar.\"\nHirsi was named to Forbes' \"40 Under 40 Government and Politics\" list in 2020 and has been featured in New York Magazine. She was described as \"saving the planet\" by Vice News for her climate change work.\nWhile several right-leaning and Israeli-supporting activists took aim at Hirsi over her involvement in the protest, others, including Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., offered words of support.\nTlaib, who was censured by her colleagues in the House in November for anti-Israel comments she made in the wake of the Jewish state's war against terror group Hamas, wrote in a post to X: \"From UM to Vanderbilt to USC to Columbia, students across our country are being retaliated against for using their constitutional rights to protest genocide. It's appalling.\"\nHirsi's suspension came after dozens of protesters camped out in tents on school grounds Wednesday, calling on the university to divest itself from companies that have ties to Israel. The encampment was set up the same day Nemat Shafik, the university's president, testified before Congress about antisemitism on the college campus.\nThe students from both Barnard and Columbia who set up the encampment had a \"stated intention to remain,\" Barnard College said in a statement about the matter.\n\"Before noon on April 17, Columbia made multiple requests that students participating in the unauthorized encampment leave the lawn. A number of Barnard Senior Staff also went to the lawn to ask Barnard students participating in the encampment to leave and to advise Barnard students that they would be subject to sanctions at Barnard if they did not leave the encampment,\" the school said Thursday. \"Members of the Barnard Senior Staff provided participants in the unauthorized encampment with written warnings at approximately 7 p.m. on April 17. These written warnings stated that students would receive interim suspensions if they did not leave the encampment by 9 p.m. on April 17.\"\n\"This morning, April 18, we started to place identified Barnard students remaining in the encampment on interim suspension, and we will continue to do so,\" the school added.\nIn addition to Hirsi, protest organizers said the two other Barnard students who received suspensions from the school were Maryam Iqbal, 18, a freshman, and Soph Dinu, 21, a junior majoring in religion, according to the New York Times.\nPolice began removing the protesters from Columbia University's campus in New York City on Thursday.\nShafik sent a message to the student body, saying that these \"extraordinary steps\" were necessary \"because these are extraordinary circumstances.\" She also said that those who established the encampment had \"violated a long list of rules and policies.\"\n\"Out of an abundance of concern for the safety of Columbia's campus, I authorized the New York Police Department to begin clearing the encampment from the South Lawn of Morningside campus that had been set up by students in the early hours of Wednesday morning,\" Shafik said.\nVideo from the campus showed officers loading dozens of protesters onto police buses.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kyle Morris","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Isra-Hirsi-ilhan-Omar.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.9447923,"_id":"7da46112b0cfb3e58903983b00676ac9"},{"title":"Swiss parliament approves Nazi symbol display ban","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-17 21:35:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/swiss-parliament-approves-nazi-symbol-display-ban","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The lower house of the Swiss parliament approved Wednesday a measure banning the use, wearing and display of extremist and Nazi-related symbols.","summary":"The lower house of Swiss parliament on Wednesday followed in the footsteps of the Senate, or upper house, in approving a measure that would ban the use of, public wearing or display of Nazi and racist symbols that could foment extremist hate or violence.\nThe proposal \u2014 years in the making \u2014 goes beyond a simple ban on Nazi memorabilia, which had failed in the past in parliament, to include other forms of extremist symbols that could stir hatred or violence. The National Council in the capital, Bern, in a 133-38 vote with 17 abstentions, passed.\nMost political groups backed the measure and overcame opposition from the right-wing Swiss People's Party, which has the most seats in the two chambers. The vote puts Switzerland on track to join other European countries that have enacted similar bans.\nEfforts to push for tougher legislation have accelerated in recent months in the wake of a surge of antisemitic attacks across Europe and beyond that accompanied the start of the latest Israel-Hamas war in Gaza more than six months ago.\nThe war erupted after militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people in Israel and seizing 250 as hostages. Israel responded with an offensive in Gaza that has caused widespread devastation and killed over 33,800 people, according to local health officials.\n\"Today in Switzerland, it's possible \u2014 even permitted \u2014 to fly a flag with a swastika on the balcony. It's possible to fly a flag with the image of the \u2018SS' on the windshield of your car. It's possible to make a Hitler salute in the public space,\" said Green lawmaker Raphael Mahaim, in a debate preceding the vote.\nHe said that until Wednesday's vote, such actions were banned only if they were linked to sympathy for Nazi ideology \u2014 not whether they spread it or stir hatred.\n\"This situation is intolerable,\" he added.\nHowever, Zurich lawmaker Barbara Steinemann of the Swiss People's Party disagreed. \"Our society must be able to deal with the fact that there will always be a base of a few insignificant cranks,\" she said.\nSteinemann further argued that the new law will do little to stop Jews from being afraid in an antisemitic climate. She alluded to the stabbing of a Jewish man early last month in Zurich, sending a chill through the Jewish community in Switzerland.\n\"Jews ... are taking their children out of schools, leaving Europe, because they no longer feel safe,\" said Steinemann.\n\"A ban on symbols will prevent no attacks, prevent no antisemitic attitudes, which are also rife at our universities and in intellectual environments,\" she added.\nThe measure will now head to the executive Federal Council for a finalized text that can be written into law by parliament.\nJustice Minister Beat Jans said the seven-member council last week expressed support for the measure, and noted the need to fine-tune the legislation so that it's clear about which actions are allowed \u2014 and which are not \u2014 while also providing flexibility to make changes easily if needed.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/beat_jans.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.906591,"_id":"d7ab881e69bdd82e7cce0d5bcc9ebf7c"},{"title":"Crawfish, gumbo and cicadas?

Depending on the variety, the emergence happens every 13 or 17 years. This year two groups are expected to emerge soon, averaging around 1 million per acre over hundreds of millions of acres across parts of 16 states in the Midwest and South.\nThey emerge when the ground warms to 64 degrees, which is happening earlier than it used to because of climate change, entomologists said. The bugs are brown at first but darken as they mature.\nRecently, Zack Lemann, the Insectarium's curator of animal collections, has been working up cicada dishes that may become part of the menu. He donned a chef's smock this week to show a couple of them off, including a green salad with apple, almonds, blueberry vinaigrette \u2014 and roasted cicadas. Fried cicada nymphs were dressed on top with a warm mixture of creole mustard and soy sauce.\n\"I do dragonflies in a similar manner,\" Lemann said as he used tweezers to plop nymphs into a container of flour before cooking them in hot oil.\nDepending on the type and the way they are prepared, cooked cicadas taste similar to toasted seeds or nuts. The Insectarium isn't the first to promote the idea of eating them. Over the years, they have appeared on a smattering of menus and in cookbooks, including titles like \"Cicada-Licious\" from the University of Maryland in 2004.\n\"Every culture has things that they love to eat and, maybe, things that are taboo or things that people just sort of, wrinkle their nose and frown their brow at,\" Lemann said. \"And there's no reason to do that with insects when you look at the nutritional value, their quality on the plate, how they taste, the environmental benefits of harvesting insects instead of dealing with livestock.\"\nLemann has been working to make sure the Bug Appetit cafe has legal clearance to serve wild-caught cicadas while he works on lining up sources for the bugs. He expects this spring's unusual emergence of two huge broods of cicadas to heighten interest in insects in general, and in the Insectarium \u2014 even though the affected area doesn't include southeast Louisiana.\n\"I can't imagine, given the fact that periodical cicadas are national news, that we won't have guests both local and from outside New Orleans, asking us about that,\" said Lemann. \"Which is another reason I hope to have enough to serve it at least a few times to people.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Cicada-Salad.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.8715396,"_id":"73e7b60f66485eab2e2cf8e3748eef34"},{"title":"Fox News Politics: Capitol grill","author":"Fox News Staff","published_date":"2024-04-17 21:21:05","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-politics-capitol-grill","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content","summary":"Welcome to Fox News' Politics newsletter with the latest political news from Washington D.C. and updates from the 2024 campaign trail.\nWhat's happening?\n- Democrats express openness to saving Speaker Mike Johnson\n- Seven jurors have been selected in Trump's trial\n- Far left reps launch \"Protect the Squad\" fundraising effort\nIn the Senate, the impeachment trial was over practically before it began.\nBefore House managers even presented the articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Democrats in a series of party-line votes dismissed the matter altogether.\nThe first of two articles of impeachment alleged Mayorkas engaged in the \"willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law\" regarding the southern border in his capacity as DHS secretary.

The Kentucky Republican warned his Senate colleagues against pushing for an amendment to require warrants, as Republicans in the House did unsuccessfully.\n\"Misguided efforts to require a criminal-law warrant to sort and organize those data on U.S. persons would end the ability of the FBI to keep America and Americans safe,\" McConnell said earlier this week.\n\"Frankly, they would forget the lessons of 9/11,\" he claimed. \"So I'll oppose any such efforts and urge my colleagues to do the same.\"\nHe noted that senators should expect votes on Friday if FISA is not reauthorized on Thursday.\nSome of the prominent senators voicing their opposition to the FISA bill are Sens.

Lee has made his objections to the lack of a provision requiring a warrant known. \"The documented abuses under FISA should provoke outrage from anyone who values the Fourth Amendment Rights of American citizens,\" he said in a March statement while introducing a bipartisan bill to amend FISA.\nPaul has further claimed the bill allows \"spying on Americans through FISA, the way they spied on Trump.\"\nOn the other side, Sen.

The energy secretary said Biden was \"really focused\" on lowering the cost, and touted the president's release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which put more supply on the market.\n\"The president is watching this.

As campaigning for the June 6-9 event heats up, mainstream parties fear that disenchanted voters might turn to the people at NatCon 2024.\n\"This is what we're up against. We're up against a new form of evil ideology,\" Nigel Farage, the man credited with taking Britain out of the European Union, told the gathering of a few hundred stridently nationalist and fundamentalist Christian politicians and think-tankers.\nAnti-migrant sentiment featured in a number of speeches. Some targeted what they saw as the follies of climate policy, \"narco-socialism\" or \"woke indoctrination,\" often with sharp opposition to multinational organizations like the EU.\nLashing out at the bloc's treaties, and the pledge in the preamble of the founding EU texts to an \"ever-closer Union\" among the 27 member countries, Polish lawmaker Ryszard Legutko said it all makes \"medieval monks look almost like intellectual anarchists.\"\nSurveys suggest that mainstream political parties are likely to retain power after the June elections, but quite possibly with a reduced majority.\nBelgian police quietly shut down the conference by barring attendees from re-entering the venue if they dared to leave. A dozen or so officers blocked the main entrance. It was the third venue for the gathering after the owners of two other locations shied away when anti-fascist protesters vowed to disrupt proceedings.\nThis year's NatCon, organized by the conservative U.S. think tank the Edmund Burke Foundation, was held under the banner of \"National Conservatism, Preserving the Nation-State in Europe.\"\nFrench far-right figurehead Eric Zemmour was scheduled to criticize the EU's new migrant and asylum rules but was turned away by police. Suella Braverman, who served as U.K. home secretary for just over a month in 2022 before being fired, railed for 27 minutes against the European Court of Human Rights.\nPoliticians and former leaders from Spain, Poland and the Netherlands were also on the agenda. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was due to speak on Wednesday.\n\"I guess they couldn't take free speech any longer,\" Orban posted on the social media platform X. \"The last time they wanted to silence me with the police was when the Communists set them on me in '88. We didn't give up then and we will not give up this time either!\"\nSpeakers summoned the grand ideas of figures like the Pope, Homer, Dostoyevsky, Leo Strauss, Tocqueville and Gramsci. English was the common language, spattered with classical Latin. Modern liberal democracy was likened to a form of \"neo-Marxist authoritarianism.\"\nMostly though, those who could speak before the gathering was shut down for the day focused on their \"enemies\" among the mainstream political parties.\n\"We have to know our enemies are in panic and they show it every day,\" said EU lawmaker Hermann Tertsch, from Spain's far-right Vox party. \"The enemy knows their time is running out.\"\nAs Brussels police warned that the conference's time was limited, too, Edmund Burke Foundation Chairman Yoram Hazony invited participants to stay as long as they dared.\n\"The new democracy works in mysterious ways. Your goal as someone in the new democracy is to prevent the other guy from speaking,\" Hazony said.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Belgium-Conservatism-Conference.gif","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.655319,"_id":"545b6eaaf2f7d95727647a70407746b2"},{"title":"Earth Day 2024 is a mix of woke and political correctness, so the Earth gets a raw deal","author":"Henry Miller","published_date":"2024-04-22 06:00:34","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/earth-day-2024-woke-political-correctness-earth-gets-deal","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Earth Day started in 1970 as consciousness raising. The 2024 version is a mix of woke and political correctness and at war with useful scientific discoveries like plastics.","summary":"\"Planet vs Plastics\" is the theme of Earth Day this year. Why? Because, according to the event's organizers, \"plastics are a danger to humanity and all living creatures, disrupting the balance of life on Earth.\" Therefore, \"EARTHDAY.ORG is unwavering in our commitment to end plastics for the sake of human and planetary health, demanding a 60% reduction in the production of ALL plastics by 2040.\"\nThat sort of hyperbolic condemnation is typical of many recent Earth Days. The reality is that Earthlings and plastics must coexist. In many ways, plastics improve our quality of life. They have revolutionized medicine with life-saving devices, made space travel possible, lightened cars and planes (conserving fuel and lowering air pollution), and made all manner of consumer goods less expensive.\nIt is true that their convenience and low cost have spawned a throw-away culture that has a dark side: Single-use plastics currently account for about 40% of the plastic produced every year. That percentage could and should be reduced, but the absolutism of the Earth Day organizers illustrates what is wrong with today's environmental movement.\nThe first Earth Day celebration, a nationwide environmental teach-in held in 1970, was the brainchild of Democratic Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, who was interested in environmental issues.\nHe recruited Pete McCloskey, a conservation-minded liberal Republican California congressman, to serve as his co-chair. In the spirit of the time, it was a touchy-feely, consciousness-raising New Age experience, and most activities were organized at the grassroots level.\nSadly, today's Earth Day shares much with the current zeitgeist: It reeks of wokeness, political correctness and virtue signaling. It has devolved into an occasion for environmental activists to prophesy apocalypse, dish anti-technology dirt and allow passion and zeal to trump reality.\nA generation ago, the mantra was simple and broadly accepted: \"reduce, re-use and recycle.\" However, we hasten to note, as John Tierney highlighted in his classic New York Times Magazine piece, \"Recycling is Garbage,\" recycling isn't always beneficial.\nInstead of setting up a false dichotomy of \"Planet vs. Plastics,\" environmental activists would do well to redirect their zeal and predictions of catastrophe to imagining what we can do to protect the planet. A little innovation can go a long way toward protecting our environment.\nYet, unfortunately, many of those stumping for Earth Day on April 22 this year will oppose environment-friendly advances in science and technology. Consider these several examples:\nWe are now scratching the surface for ingenious ways to remediate contaminated soil by using plants with the ability to remove toxins such as heavy metals from soil. A comprehensive review of the progress and promise of this technique, known as phytoremediation, states that, \"Plant abilities to uptake, translocate, and transform heavy metals, as well as to limit their toxicity, may be significantly enhanced via genetic engineering.\"\nHowever, most prominent environmental groups oppose genetic engineering and would rather soil a promising technology than abandon a deeply held ideological position.\nSimilarly, some green groups opposed one of the most innovative efforts to address allegations of climate change caused by animal agriculture \u2013 the Impossible Burger, an ingredient of which is a plant-sourced protein, leghemoglobin.\nThe protein contains heme, also present in animal meat, and is partly responsible for the taste, texture and appearance of bloody-good meat. As Business Insider noted, \"a handful of environmental activists have also taken issue with the burger. But their issue with the burger isn't heme \u2014 it's the fact that the Impossible Burger is made using genetically engineered ingredients, or GMOs. Those concerns largely take the shape of the old and unsubstantiated claim that GMOs cause everything from autism to cancer, despite the scientific consensus that they are safe.\"\nA pervasive Earth Day meta-message will be disdain for the capitalist system that drives the innovation needed for effective environmental protection and conservation. (It's no coincidence that low-income countries tend to be the most polluted.)\n\"Education\" features prominently in Earth Day activities, as in, \"Fifty four years ago, the first Earth Day started an environmental revolution. Now, we are igniting an education revolution to save the planet. EARTHDAY.ORG passionately envisions a world where every student ... is embraced by a rich education weaving together climate and environmental understanding, coupled with a strong civic engagement component.\"\nWell, education can take many forms. For a previous Earth Day, seventh graders at a tony private school near San Francisco were given an unusual Earth Day assignment: Make a list of environmental projects that could be accomplished with Bill Gates's fortune.\nThis approach to environmental awareness fits in well with the progressive worldview that the right to private property is subsidiary to undertakings that enlightened thinkers deem worthwhile.\nAnd how interesting that the resources made \"available\" for the students' thought experiment were not, say, the aggregate net worth of the members of Congress but the wealth of one of the nation's most successful and most innovative entrepreneurs.\nAnother Earth Day assignment for those same students was to read Rachel Carson's best-selling 1962 book, \"Silent Spring,\" an emotionally charged but deeply flawed excoriation of the widespread spraying of chemical pesticides to control insects.\nAs described by Roger Meiners and Andy Morriss in their scholarly yet eminently readable 2012 analysis, \"Silent Spring at 50: Reflections on an Environmental Classic,\" Carson exploited her reputation as a well-known nature writer to advocate and legitimatize \"positions linked to a darker tradition in American environmental thinking: neo-Malthusian population control and anti-technology efforts.\"\nCarson's proselytizing and advocacy led to the virtual banning of DDT and restrictions on other chemical pesticides even though \"Silent Spring\" was replete with gross misrepresentations and atrocious scholarship.\nHer observations about DDT were meticulously rebutted point by point by J. Gordon Edwards, a professor of entomology at San Jose State University, a longtime member of the Sierra Club and the Audubon Society, and a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences.\nIn his stunning 1992 essay, \"The Lies of Rachel Carson,\" Edwards demolished her arguments and assertions and called attention to critical omissions, faulty assumptions, and outright fabrications.\nMeiners and Morriss concluded correctly that the influence of \"Silent Spring\" \"encourages some of the most destructive strains within environmentalism: alarmism, technophobia, failure to consider the costs and benefits of alternatives, and the discounting of human well-being around the world.\" Sounds a lot like the agenda of Earth Day 2024.\nHenry Miller, a physician and molecular biologist, is the Glenn Swogger Distinguished Fellow at the American Council on Science and Health.

But a Petrobras appeal for Ibama to reverse its decision has drawn powerful political backing.\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said in September that Brazil should be able to \"research\" the region's potential resources, given the national interest. Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira last week told journalists that it is \"Brazil's right to know the potential\" of the offshore fields.\nThat has bolstered bullish rhetoric from Petrobras about its chances of getting a license to drill in the blocks off the coast of Amapa state.\n\"Get ready Amapa, because we are arriving,\" Petrobras CEO Jean Paul Prates told local politicians and oil executives at an event last month promoting offshore exploration along the northern coast in an area known as Equatorial Margin. He called it \"perhaps the last frontier of the oil era for Brazil.\"\nHe has said he expects to start drilling in the second half of this year or sooner in the most promising part of the Equatorial Margin, named the Foz do Amazonas basin, for the mouth of the Amazon River several hundred kilometers away. Foz de Amazonas shares geology with the coast of nearby Guyana, where Exxon is developing huge fields.\nIbama chief Rodrigo Agostinho said in November that a decision would be made in early 2024, although labor disputes at the agency have since slowed the pace of environmental licensing.\nVisits to four Indigenous villages, interviews with over a dozen local leaders, and previously unreported documents show organized opposition mounting to Petrobras' attempt to reverse the halt on exploratory drilling.\nPetrobras has drawn fresh government scrutiny. Indigenous affairs agency Funai asked Ibama regulators in December to run several more studies to assess impacts, according to a Dec. 11 government memo from Funai to Ibama obtained in a freedom of information request. The proposed studies would have to be done before Ibama can decide whether to accept the Petrobras appeal.\nIn July 2022, the Council of Chieftains of the Indigenous People of Oiapoque (CCPIO), an umbrella group representing more than 60 Indigenous villages in the area, asked federal prosecutors to get involved, denouncing an alleged violation of their rights.\nBrazilian prosecutors have a mandate to protect Indigenous peoples, often taking their side in disputes with firms or federal and state governments. In September 2022 they recommended that Ibama not issue the license before a formal consultation of the local communities. Records from the prosecutors' preliminary investigation, seen by Reuters, show that in December 2023, CCPIO asked them to broker a 13-month formal consultation with Petrobras about Indigenous views on the project.\nThe consultation process, along with studies proposed by Funai, would push a decision into 2025 when Brazil will host the COP30 climate change summit in the Amazon city of Belem, which could make it more politically difficult to approve drilling, a person close to CCPIO told Reuters.\nMinutes from a June 2023 meeting between Petrobras, CCPIO leaders and prosecutors show the company offered to consult local communities about eventual commercial oil production in the area, if Ibama requests it, but did not commit to a consultation before drilling exploratory wells.\nAsked about Indigenous leaders' calls for immediate consultations, Petrobras told Reuters in a statement that the time for such requests has passed.\n\"The definition of whether or not it is necessary to consult indigenous peoples and/or traditional communities takes place at the initial stage of the environmental licensing process,\" Petrobras said.\nIbama has not yet replied to the recommendation by Indigenous affairs agency Funai late last year for more assessments of the effects of Petrobras' exploration plans, according to an April 3 Funai document seen by Reuters.\nBoth agencies did not reply to requests for comment by Reuters. CCPIO and prosecutors said a consultation must be made before Ibama issues a license to drill.\nThe drilling standoff has created a fault line in Lula's government, which is balancing his vows to protect the Amazon and its Indigenous people with the interests of Petrobras and political allies that stand to reap the benefits of a new oil-producing region.\nSilveira, the energy minister, has said that a single Foz de Amazonas block off the coast of Amapa state could yield more than 5.6 billion barrels of oil, which would be the company's biggest discovery in over a decade.\nIn its appeal to Ibama, the company said that exploration will have no negative impact on local communities.\n\"We ratify the understanding that there is no direct impact of the temporary activity of drilling a well 175 km from the coast on Indigenous communities,\" Petrobras said.\nLocal people and some environmentalists warn that drilling could threaten coastal mangroves and vast wetlands rich with fish and plant life, while disrupting the lives of the 8,000 Indigenous people in Oiapoque, on Brazil's far northern coast.\nThe CCPIO, the highest Indigenous authority in Oiapoque, is composed of more than 60 caciques, or chieftains, representing over 8,000 people. They do not oppose the search for oil per se, but invoke what they say is a right to prior consultation by Petrobras, with supervision from the federal prosecutors' office and Funai.\nThe International Labor Organization convention 169, which Brazil signed, says that governments must consult Indigenous and tribal peoples through their representative institutions, whenever considering legislative measures that may affect them directly.\nThe plans to drill are already changing Oiapoque. Waves of migrant workers have arrived looking for jobs in an oil industry that does not yet exist, state lawmaker Inacio Monteiro said.\nMonteiro said he meets often with Indigenous constituents, talking to them about the benefits that Petrobras could bring to Oiapoque, including jobs, tax revenue and social programs.\nYet CCPIO and its allies have become increasingly vocal with their resistance as Petrobras garners support for its appeal, including at the COP28 climate summit in December, where Luene Karipuna told a panel that Petrobras and local politicians had tried to silence her people.\n\"Strategically, this prior consultation is our only safety net,\" 25-year-old Karipuna, who is studying to be a teacher, said near her home in the Santa Izabel village, where marshes fill with seawater at certain times of the year.\nWhen the rivers run low, tides bring in saltwater fish the villagers eat, but some interviewed by Reuters fear it could just as easily bring oil spills.\nIndigenous leaders said a full-court press from local politicians in support of Petrobras was on display at a May 2023 public hearing that Monteiro, the state lawmaker, called just days after Petrobras' license was denied.\nAmapa's political powerbrokers, including key Lula allies, rallied within days at Oiapoque's town hall for the hearing to promote Petrobras' plans to drill.\nAt the event, one man in a white polo shirt and a feathered headdress, Ramon Karipuna told the crowd that Indigenous people were in favor of drilling, according to minutes of the meeting seen by Reuters.\nKaripuna said he spoke for the coordinator of the CCPIO council of chieftains, who was absent for \"health reasons.\"\nPetrobras later cited Karipuna's endorsement in its appeal of the denied drilling license and described him as a \"CCPIO representative.\".\nHowever, CCPIO coordinator Cacique Edmilson Oliveira told Reuters he was not sick that day. CCPIO had refused to take part in the hastily summoned event, according to a May 18 letter sent in response to Monteiro's invitation to the hearing and seen by Reuters.\n\"This is very concerning. That's why we are saying that we already feel threatened,\" Oliveira said, accusing Petrobras of distorting the views of Indigenous leaders. \"We never sat down and reached an agreement for approval.\"\nIn a telephone interview, Karipuna confirmed he worked at the town hall and that he is not a member of CCPIO \u2013 even though Petrobras used his words as its main argument to Ibama that Indigenous representatives supported drilling. He also backed away from his comments in favor of drilling.\n\"To this day many people have doubts about this Petrobras business,\" he said.\nAsked about its mischaracterization of Karipuna, Petrobras cited the minutes of the May 2023 meeting, without elaborating.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Amazon.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.6059628,"_id":"76c040b11c068d1e08fbcb6f5855f2ea"},{"title":"3 Germans arrested after allegedly spying for China, transferring info on potential military tech","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-22 12:36:51","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/3-germans-arrested-allegedly-spying-china-transferring-info-potential-military-tech","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Three German citizens were arrested in Germany on suspicion of spying for China and illegally transferring technology with potential military uses, officials said.","summary":"Three people suspected of spying for China and arranging to transfer information on technology with potential military uses were arrested in Germany on Monday.\nProsecutors said the three German citizens are accused of having acted for Chinese intelligence since some point before June 2022.

F, a couple who own a company in Duesseldorf that was used to contact and work with German researchers.\nThe couple allegedly set up a research transfer agreement with an unidentified German university, the first step in which was to draw up a study for a Chinese partner on the technology of machine parts that could be used for powerful ship engines, including those in battleships. Thomas R.'s handler at the MSS was behind the Chinese partner and the project was financed by the Chinese state, prosecutors said.\nAt the time of the arrests, the suspects were in negotiations on further research projects that could be useful for expanding China's naval combat strength, they added.\nThe suspects also procured with MSS funding a special laser and exported it to China without permission, although it was classified as a \"dual-use\" instrument under European Union rules, prosecutors said.\nThe homes and offices of the suspects, who were arrested in Duesseldorf and in Bad Homburg, near Frankfurt, were searched.\nThe suspects were arrested a week after a three-day visit to China by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, his second since he took office in late 2021.\nGerman officials

parks as part of an $830 million program to protect biodiversity and marine ecosystems, with the plans to be formally announced at an international oceans conference starting in Athens Tuesday.\nBut the plan has irked Greece's neighbor and regional rival, Turkey, while environmental organizations say the initiative doesn't go far enough, noting that the country also allows environmentally harmful practices such as energy exploration in sensitive marine environments.\n\"We are increasing the size of our marine protected areas by 80%, banning harmful fishing practices and using new technologies to monitor and enforce the commitments we make here,\" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said ahead of the conference.\nThe two-day international meeting being held in Athens aims \"to catalyze global action against two overlapping crises, the climate crisis and the crisis of our ocean,\" Mitsotakis said. \"Countries have come with specific proposals to take decisive action.\"\nWith thousands of islands and islets and one of the longest coastlines in the Mediterranean, Greece has said it will create one new marine park in the Ionian Sea and one in the Aegean Sea, bringing the total area of marine protected areas to over 30% of its waters.\nBut environmental organizations have called for stronger commitments to environmental protection.\nUnder a slogan of \"The sea is not for sale,\" Greenpeace urged leaders attending the Our Ocean Conference in Athens to take concrete measures to protect the world's marine environment.\nThe conference \"must not be simply an opportunity for governments to congratulate themselves for what they have said until now,\" said Nikos Charalambidis, head of Greenpeace in Greece. \"On the contrary, this must be where serious steps and action plans are presented to prevent the looting of our seas.\"\nGreenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund and other organizations have leveled particular criticism at Greece for allowing deep-sea seismic exploration for energy and mineral resources in the Hellenic Trench, which includes the deepest waters in the Mediterranean at more than 5,200 meters (17,300 feet).\nThe trench, which stretches from southwestern Greece to Crete, is a vital habitat for the Mediterranean's few hundred sperm whales and for other marine mammals already threatened by fishing, ship collisions and plastic pollution.\nAsked whether the Greek government planned to extend protection to the entirety of the Hellenic Trench, Theodoros Skylakakis, Greece's minister for both the environment and energy, stressed that adapting to a green economy requires significant funds over the coming decades.\n\"We need to be a lot more efficient in everything we do. And not trigger our reaction by ideology but rather trigger it by science, by efficiency and by investment,\" Skylakakis said. \"And for that, we will need money. If anybody thinks we can meet this challenge of paying for the adaptation \u2026 and at the same time don't have economic growth, they don't live in this world.\"\nGreece's plan for the two marine parks has also irked its neighbor and regional rival Turkey. When the plan was initially aired last week, Turkey's foreign ministry accused Athens of exploiting environmental issues to push its geopolitical agenda. The two countries, both NATO members, have been at odds for decades over a series of issues, including territorial claims in the Aegean, and have reached the brink of war three times in the last 50 years.\nRelations have improved somewhat over the past year following a period of heightened tensions that saw the two countries' warships facing off in the eastern Mediterranean. But Ankara responded with annoyance to the plan for a marine park in the Agean.\n\"It is known that Greece has long been trying to benefit from almost every platform in the context of Aegean problems,\" the Turkish Foreign Ministry said. \"Despite the recent softening in our relations, it appears that Greece is exploiting environmental issues this time.\"\nGreece's foreign ministry retorted that Ankara was \"politicizing a clearly environmental issue.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Greece-Ocean.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.5430303,"_id":"ead0f7d3dbd82a47bbd803e06144841e"},{"title":"Half of US states revolt against EPA crackdown on gas cars with major legal challenge","author":"Thomas Catenacci","published_date":"2024-04-18 16:06:18","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/25-states-hit-biden-admin-legal-challenge-climate-crackdown-gas-cars","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"FIRST ON FOX: A coalition of 25 states filed a federal legal challenge against the Biden administration on Thursday, arguing its crackdown on gas-powered cars is illegal.","summary":"FIRST ON FOX: A coalition of 25 state attorneys general filed a legal challenge Thursday against the Biden administration over recent environmental regulations targeting gas-powered car emissions and pushing electric vehicles.\nLed by Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, the coalition filed a challenge against the Environmental Protection Agency in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, asking the court to declare the new rules unlawful. According to the filing, the EPA regulations impose \"unworkable emissions standards\" on passenger cars and medium-duty vehicles.\n\"Conservative attorneys general are slamming the brakes on President Biden's radical green agenda that is using the weight of the federal government to force expensive EVs on families, workers and farmers,\" Coleman said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\"Even if Americans wanted to buy an electric car, we can't afford them amid historic inflation,\" he continued. \"We're taking President Biden's EPA to court to block this latest big-government mandate and protect the free market.\"\nIn a joint announcement with the White House last month, the EPA issued the regulations, which are the most aggressive multi-pollutant emission standards ever finalized. Those standards were officially published Thursday, opening the door to legal challenges and congressional resolutions.\nWhile the regulations target gas-powered vehicles, they are explicitly designed to push wider, nationwide adoption of EVs and, to a lesser extent, hybrid cars. President Biden said after the rules were finalized that they would help ensure the U.S. meets his goal of EVs accounting for 50% of all new car sales in 2030.\nUnder the standards, automakers will be forced to rapidly curb the emissions of greenhouse gases, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from new passenger cars, light trucks, and larger pickups and vans beginning in two years with model year 2027 vehicles. EPA said the rules will help \"tackle the climate crisis\" by reducing the transportation sector's carbon dioxide emissions.\nWhen the tailpipe emissions rules kick in, automakers will be compelled to increase production and sales of EVs, plug-in hybrids, traditional hybrids and fuel cell vehicles. Under one so-called \"low cost\" model, EPA said automakers would be forced to ensure 56% of light-duty car sales are battery electric and another 13% are hybrid by 2032.\n\"Kentucky is an agriculture state, and EVs aren't tough enough to keep up with our farmers,\" said Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell. \"We put a lot of miles on the Kentucky Department of Agriculture's vehicles to serve rural communities, and we can't stop on the side of the road to plug in. The Biden administration has it out for rural America, and I'm proud Kentucky is leading the fight to stop them.\"\nJoining Kentucky and West Virginia in the legal challenge filed Thursday are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming.\nEPA's regulations have been heavily criticized by state officials, Republican and Democratic lawmakers, agriculture industry groups like the National Corn Growers Association and energy associations, such as the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers and the American Petroleum Institute.\nIn 2023, 9.5% of new, light-duty vehicle sales were EVs, up from 7% in 2022 and 4.3% in 2021, according to data from the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group that represents major automakers. At the same time, EVs remain more expensive than traditional, gas-powered cars.\nAnd the share of Americans who said they are considering an EV purchase has declined from 55% to 44% year-over-year, according to a Gallup poll conducted in March.\nCalls placed to the EPA seeking comment were not immediately returned.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Thomas Catenacci","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/10/biden-evs-2.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.5430303,"_id":"9a4a9edf3f8f1390cbec360bad6da8fd"},{"title":"Plumbing problem at Glen Canyon Dam threatens water supply of Colorado River system","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-17 12:54:59","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/plumbing-problem-glen-canyon-dam-threatens-water-supply-colorado-river-system","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Plumbing issues at Glen Canyon Dam, which holds back the second-largest reservoir in the U.S., are causing concerns about future water delivery to southwestern states.","summary":"Plumbing problems at the dam holding back the second-largest reservoir in the U.S. are spurring concerns about future water delivery issues to southwestern states supplied by the Colorado River.\nFederal officials recently reported damage to four tubes known as \"river outlet works\" at Glen Canyon Dam on the Utah-Arizona border. The dam is responsible for generating hydropower and releasing water stored in Lake Powell downstream to California, Arizona, Nevada and eventually Mexico.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which operates the major dams in the Colorado River system, is evaluating issues related to Glen Canyon Dam when Lake Powell reaches low levels. Those issues include problems with the four tubes such as sedimentation and cavitation \u2014 when tiny air bubbles develop while water passes through plumbing. Cavitation can cause tears in metal and other mechanical damage.\nThe Colorado River provides water to seven U.S. states, nearly 30 Native American tribes and two states in Mexico. Years of overuse by farms and cities, and stubborn drought worsened by climate change has meant that much less water flows today through the 1,450-mile river than in previous decades.\nLake Mead and Lake Powell, which store water and are used for recreation and power generation, serve as barometers of the Colorado River's health. In recent years, they have fallen to historic lows then recovered somewhat thanks to above-average recent winter precipitation and water conservation.\nThe structural problems at Glen Canyon Dam, first reported by the Arizona Daily Star, could complicate how federal officials manage the river in years to come when hydrologists and others predict Lake Powell will fall below current levels. The damaged tubes sit below much larger ones known as penstocks that normally carry the reservoir's water. The smaller tubes that make up the \"river outlet works\" allow water releases at lower reservoir levels.\nLake Powell currently sits at about 32% capacity.\nBrenda Burman, general manager of the Central Arizona Project, a 336-mile canal system that delivers Colorado River water to Arizona's cities, raised the issue at a meeting last month related to the river.\n\"We received some difficult news from the Bureau of Reclamation,\" Burman said, adding that CAP would be working with Reclamation to investigate the problems in coming months.\nJB Hamby, chairman of the Colorado River Board of California, said the dam's design leaves open the possibility that huge amounts of water could be stranded in Lake Powell under low elevations.\nHe said an engineering solution would be the best way forward because other options could involve additional water cuts to states.\nDoug MacEachern, communications administrator at the Arizona Department of Water Resources, said his agency was working with Reclamation to see \"what, if any, technical fixes might exist.\"\nIf federal officials can't repair the tubes, MacEachern said his agency expected Reclamation to not place the burden of more water cuts solely on Arizona, California and Nevada, which make up the river's so-called Lower Basin. Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming form its Upper Basin.\nSeparately, states and tribes that rely on the Colorado River are working on a long-term deal to share the dwindling resource after current rules and guidelines governing how its water is divvied up expire in 2026.\nEnvironmental groups for years have cautioned that water levels at Lake Powell could reach a point where Glen Canyon dam can no longer be used for hydropower or release water downstream.\n\"What's at risk?\" said Kyle Roerink, executive director of environmental advocacy group Great Basin Water Network. \"The water supply for 25 million people and major agricultural producers.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Glen-Canyon-Dam.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.533109,"_id":"e59caa8ce57bca4a3902d853ed2eb756"},{"title":"Texas farming crisis looms as US, Mexico spar over long-standing water treaty","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-18 12:34:26","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-farming-crisis-looms-us-mexico-spar-long-standing-water-treaty","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Texas farm groups are sounding alarms over water shortages stemming from a dispute between Mexican and U.S. officials over a long-standing water treaty.","summary":"Texas farm groups warn of a disastrous season ahead for citrus and sugar as Mexican and U.S. officials try to resolve a dispute over a decades-old water treaty that supplies U.S. farmers with critical irrigation.\nThe neighboring countries have tussled over the 1944 treaty before, but the current drought-driven water shortages are the most severe in nearly 30 years and add to existing political tensions over genetically modified corn.\nUnder the treaty designed to allocate shared water resources, Mexico is required to send 1.75 million acre-feet of water from the Rio Grande to the U.S. over a five-year cycle.\nNow in year four, Mexico has sent only about 30% of its expected deliveries, the lowest amount at this point of any four- or five-year cycles since 1992, according to data from the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), which oversees the treaty.\nThe last sugar mill in Texas has shut down due to the lack of water, at a time of low U.S. supplies and high prices for the sweetener.\n\"This water is impacting not only the farmers, but it's impacting the employment of citizens within our community,\" U.S. Representative from Texas Monica De La Cruz told Reuters.\nManuel Morales, secretary of the Mexican section of the IBWC, said Mexico is working to comply with its commitments but that the water shortage is due to climate change and the treaty allows more time to deliver water in the event of extraordinary drought.\nMexico's national water authority, Conagua, says severe drought has gotten worse and the country is facing the worst drought conditions since 2011.\nSome residents have protested in Mexico City after going without running water for weeks.\nDe La Cruz and three other members of Texas' Congressional delegation met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken on April 11 to ask the State Department to do more to enforce the treaty.\nBlinken on the call committed to speaking with Mexican officials about the issue, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nA State Department spokesperson said the agency is closely following the water shortages and has urged Mexico to sign a revised water agreement.\nU.S. IBWC spokesperson Frank Fisher said commission officials from both countries have met several times since 2023 to renegotiate aspects of the treaty in hopes of increasing reliability.\nBoth countries have had agricultural water shortages in recent decades, Fisher said.\nTexas's half-billion-dollar citrus industry is heavily dependent on water from Mexico, especially with drought conditions growing more severe in the region, said Dale Murden, president of the industry group Texas Citrus Mutual.\n\"You can't count completely on rainfall. It's nice when it happens, but you need to control the water on the tree,\" he said.\nTexas is the third-largest citrus state behind California and Florida.\nData from the U.S. National Integrated Drought Information System shows below-normal precipitation and moderate to severe drought conditions in the region.\nFor Texas sugarcane farmers, the outlook this season is \"complete and absolute despair,\" said Sean Brashear, president and CEO of Rio Grande Valley Sugar Growers.\nThe group in February shut its sugar mill in Santa Rosa, Texas, after 51 years of operation due to the lack of water from Mexico.\nThough Texas is not a major sugar producing state, global sugar supplies are tight and the closure will likely lead to increased U.S. sugar imports, said broker and supply chain services provider Czarnikow.\nThe U.S. imports around a third of its sugar and has increased imports of highly taxed, pricey sugar since countries holding low-tariff import quotas failed to fulfill them.\nIBWC's Morales said the weather conditions have led to lower levels in the Rio Grande River basin.\n\"It is not a question of only affecting users on the U.S. side, we in Mexico are also suffering the consequences of this shortage,\" Morales said.\nThe USDA in April reduced its estimate for Mexico's 2023/24 sugar production to the lowest in 10 years.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Mexico.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.4348025,"_id":"9a0eba10910ceea166fc206715ad8361"},{"title":"Young 2020 Biden voter says president is not any 'better' than Trump: 'I would rather Trump win' in 2024","author":"Hanna Panreck","published_date":"2024-04-21 13:18:31","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/young-2020-biden-voter-says-president-not-any-better-than-trump-i-would-rather-trump-win-in-2024","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"A young 2020 Biden voter told the NYT during a podcast on Thursday that President Biden hasn't proven to be a better president than Donald Trump.","summary":"A young voter, who \"reluctantly\" voted for Biden in 2020, argued in a podcast published on Thursday that she would rather see Donald Trump win this time around and said Biden had not proven to be a better president than the presumptive GOP nominee.\nA young voter who identified herself as Eloise Navarro told the New York Times' Astead Herndon in an episode of \"The Run-Up\" podcast that she \"reluctantly\" voted for Biden in 2020. Navarro said she would not be voting for him again this time around. Herndon noted she was a politically engaged young voter, who one of his New York Times colleagues met previously at a climate protest.\n\"My response is that, at this point, Biden has shown that he's not necessarily a better president than Trump, in my opinion,\" the young voter said. \"And so the reason I'm saying, you know, no to Biden is because I would rather Trump win and then us probably experience very similar impacts, negative impacts that we had from the Biden administration than let his administration know that in any way I approve of what he's done or of what he's going to do.\"\nNavarro cited Biden's \"attitude\" towards the national scene as being \"cruel and atrocious.\"\nAnother young voter said they did plan to vote for Biden, despite their criticisms of the president, and said it was because she had to vote for the \"lesser of two evils.\"\nThe voter, who said she is 19, said that she's voted Democrat in the past but now feels \"politically homeless,\" adding that she is, \"economically, very progressive leftist,\" and a \"radical feminist.\" The person said the choice between Biden and Trump was \"disheartening.\"\n\"The fact that we have now literally the same choices as back in 2020 is incredibly disheartening.

Nobody's running against him,\" they said. \"I mean, it's not that I'm not going to vote in November. I certainly will be voting for Biden in November, because I do think it's important to choose the lesser of two evils.\"\nThe young voter said she felt that people would be \"reasonable\" and end up voting for Biden in the 2024 election. Biden, who is facing mounting criticism from progressives over his support for Israel, has also faced multiple protest votes in primary elections across the country. However, he ultimately came out on top.\nOne young voter, identified as Kelvin, said he was considering voting for Trump in the election. He voted for Trump in 2020 as well.\nCNN's Jeff Zeleny recently spoke to college students in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin who showed up to protest the president during his recent campaign stops, where some students held \"Genocide Joe\" signs.\nThey told Zeleny they could not vote for Biden unless there was a drastic change in U.S. foreign policy.\n\"I do not believe so. And I do believe that many people will not be voting for Joe Biden,\" University of Pittsburgh PhD student Karim Safieddine told CNN.\nAnna Soryal, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said she was surprised by how the Biden campaign was \"disregarding public opinion\" on the Israel war.\nSoryal confessed she regretted voting for Biden in 2020 and felt ashamed about her choice.\n\"That was the first time I could vote in a presidential election. Frankly, I look back \u2014 I\u2018m embarrassed,\" she told CNN.\nThe Biden campaign previously responded to these criticisms in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\"The President believes making your voice heard and participating in our democracy is fundamental to who we are as Americans. He shares the goal for an end to the violence and a just, lasting peace in the Middle East. He's working tirelessly to that end,\" a spokesperson said.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Hanna Panreck","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/Donald-Trump-Joe-Biden.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.4348025,"_id":"6fe6af708e1c2803f7467c32a9427f31"},{"title":"'Our Revolution': Far-left lawmakers host event taking aim at 'anti-peace' pro-Israel group","author":"Elizabeth Elkind","published_date":"2024-04-22 15:10:05","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/our-revolution-far-left-house-dems-host-event-taking-aim-anti-peace-pro-israel-group","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Leftist lawmakers in the House of Representatives are featured at a Monday evening event aimed at attacking the pro-Israel lobby in the U.S. and \"building progressive power in Congress.\"","summary":"A group that's backing leftist candidates for Congress who want to place conditions on U.S. aid to Israel is hosting a Monday night event aimed at bashing the pro-Israel lobby and \"building progressive power in Congress.\"\nOur Revolution, an organizing group founded by self-described \"democratic socialist\" Sen.

Even the medical examiner's report hasn't placated activists.","summary":"\u2018Never let a good tragedy go to waste' is the unspoken mantra of the radical progressive left, and that mantra has been hard at work in Oklahoma these past few weeks in the case of Nex Benedict. Indeed, the grotesquely distorted radical, progressive, Democrat narrative surrounding the death of a teenage girl in Oklahoma last month has been the source of a great deal of national media attention.\nHowever, this child's memory and the truth of what actually happened to her are just the latest instances of collateral damage in the woke mob and corporate media's efforts to smear school choice, traditional values and the Oklahomans who believe in them.\nHere's how the leftist narrative goes: a young girl who identified herself as nonbinary was beaten up in a high school bathroom in Owasso. She later tragically died of her injuries all as the result of hateful rhetoric of national conservative leaders all across the country. These leaders led others to cause violence against her. This narrative was spun for weeks without any evidence or proof.\nThey continuously tried to co-opt this story into a tale of martyrdom, where everything they claimed that this was all from a so-called \"climate of hate and bigotry\" and allege some deluge of new information about harassment in Oklahoma's public schools because of the values that the Oklahoma State Department of Education has been working to reinstill in public education.\nThat is not hyperbolic in the least. If you believe the leftist opinion headlines, this tragedy was a direct and inescapable outcome of making students use bathrooms that correspond with biological reality.\nIn response, hundreds of LGBT organizations and activists called for me to step down. Now, as then, I will disappoint the woke mob and give them every reason to run back to their keyboards and spin even more dishonest rhetoric.\nBut facts \u2014 John Adams reminds us \u2014 are stubborn things. And the facts of this case have turned out to be quite inconvenient for the narrative peddlers. It still remains unclear specifically why Benedict was beaten in that bathroom.\nNo reason is sufficient to justify a physical altercation. While details are murky at best, the motive is not something to be assumed or spun up out of thin air. Further, bodycam footage released amid the aftermath of the incident shows Benedict admitting to starting the altercation. Further, law enforcement authorities have indicated that Benedict did not die as the result of trauma. Finally, and most awful, deeper reporting on the matter revealed allegations of a longer horrific history of parental sexual abuse and psychological trauma than mere bullying at school. Yet the media and the activist cadre have yet to own up to their crass manipulation of this young woman's suffering.\nBecause let's be frank about what's actually going on here. This isn't about a teenager's death. It isn't even really about bullying. This is a pretext for attacking the traditional values and the educational freedom agenda that the people of Oklahoma elected me to fight for. The mob took the first news story that it could use for its own ends and ran with it. That's it. That's why the facts don't matter, the narrative is what they needed.\nTragically, Nex took her own life, according to the medical examiner's report in March.\nThe bottom line is this: the safety of my students has always been my first and foremost priority as an educator, from my first day in the classroom to now. I never tolerated bullying of any kind for any reason when I was a teacher, and I do not tolerate it whatsoever as the superintendent of Education.\nAny Oklahoma public school teacher or administrator who believes otherwise on the topic is always welcome to find other employment. But, I will make zero apologies for representing the values of the Oklahoma voters who elected me. I make zero apologies for working to serve the needs and interests of the parents and students that I serve.\nI'm not afraid of politics. I knew I would be attacked when I decided to get into this business, and I knew I would be lied about. Nevertheless, it is still despicable that anyone would not only so brazenly use a thing as horrific as a child's death to gin up political discord for personal gain. It is even more despicable that so many would willfully and knowingly turn a blind eye to the facts, simple reason and basic human dignity to keep the whole thing going once contradicted.\nThis mob and its rabid propaganda cannot change the facts of Benedict's death any more than they can change the simple realities of human biology, no matter how much bile and misinformation they spew into the public discourse.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ryan Walters","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/nex-benedict.jpg","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.2440224,"_id":"47ce0c6d766f8ec2ef45068b6a19e337"},{"title":"Prehistoric lake sturgeon denied endangered species status, US wildlife officials say","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-22 14:49:46","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/prehistoric-lake-sturgeon-denied-endangered-species-status-us-wildlife-officials-say","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Federal wildlife officials have decided not to place lake sturgeon on the endangered species list, allowing annual spearing seasons in some states to continue.","summary":"Lake sturgeon don't need Endangered Species Act protections, federal wildlife officials announced Monday, saying that stocking programs have helped the prehistoric fish return to areas where they had vanished.\nThe decision ends the Arizona-based Center of Biological Diversity's petition filed in May 2018 asking the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list lake sturgeon as endangered or threatened. Such listings would make harvesting the fish illegal, but without them, popular sturgeon harvest seasons in states such as Wisconsin and Michigan can continue.\nThe center argued that overharvesting and deteriorating habitat have \"severely depleted\" the species. Dams block access to spawning and rearing habitat and water pollution and diversions have done \"irreparable harm,\" the center said.\nBut stocking has helped grow adult lake sturgeon populations and increase spawning, agency officials said. Putting the creatures on the list would be like going to the emergency room, and the rebounding species doesn't need that level of protection, said Chuck Traxler, the wildlife service's Midwest deputy regional director.\n\"It doesn't mean everything is good right now,\" he said. \"It means keep up the good work.\"\nPopulations aren't at historical highs, the agency acknowledged in a December assessment, but stocking returned them to the Red River of the North between Minnesota and North Dakota, the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers, portions of the Mississippi River and the Coosa River.\nDam removals and habitat restoration efforts also have helped, the agency has said, citing work in 2015 to retrofit a dam on Wisconsin's Menominee River to allow spawning sturgeon to travel upstream and the removal of the Brecksville Dam on Ohio's Cuyahoga River in 2020.\nThe agency also pointed to reef restoration work in the corridor connecting Lake Huron and Lake Erie that has created a place for sturgeon to lay eggs and noted that nine of 43 toxic spots along Great Lakes shorelines have been cleaned up.\nThe assessment also noted the adaptable species should be able to withstand warmer water due to climate change.\nMedia officials with the Center for Biological Diversity didn't immediately respond to email messages seeking comment Monday.\nLake sturgeon are ancient North American freshwater fish. They're essentially living fossils, first appearing about 136 million years ago when dinosaurs ruled the planet. They resemble torpedoes, with dorsal ridges and snouts. They can grow up to 7 feet long and weigh up to 300 pounds. Males typically live about 50 years. Females can live anywhere between 80 and 150 years.\nThey're found in the upper and lower Mississippi River basin as well as the Great Lakes. Commercial anglers considered lake sturgeon a nuisance because they tore their nets, leading to widespread over-harvesting in the 1800s that continued into the 20th century.\nLake sturgeon can't reproduce fast enough to replace the losses. It takes up to three decades before they reach spawning age, and even then they don't spawn annually. And many don't survive the trip back to their birth waters to spawn. The wildlife service has compared lake sturgeon losses to the mass destruction of the American buffalo.\nTwenty states have outlawed sturgeon harvesting. Fourteen of those states have listed lake sturgeon as threatened or endangered. Volunteers and Wisconsin natural resources officials have been guarding spawning sturgeon from poachers on the Wolf River for 30 years.\nMichigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin still hold hook-and-line lake sturgeon fishing seasons. Michigan and Wisconsin hold sturgeon spearing seasons each winter as well where anglers drill holes through lake ice and impale sturgeon as they swim past.\nThe Wisconsin natural resources department reported 432 sturgeon were taken in February, down from 1,405 in 2023. Warm weather and poor ice conditions led to the diminished return, according to the department. Michigan officials set the total harvest limit at just six sturgeon but ended up canceling due to warm weather and unsafe ice conditions.\nThose states' seasons are so tightly regulated that the harvests don't impact the species overall, said Lori Nordstrom, the wildlife service's Midwest assistant regional director of ecological services.\nMichigan and Wisconsin, for example, allow an angler to take only one sturgeon per year.

He did not specify what actions Turkish forces would take in Iraq but Turkish forces have in the past carried out numerous ground offensives against PKK in northern Iraq and Turkish jets frequently target suspected PKK sites.\nAnkara now aims to create a 19-25 mile deep security corridor along the joint border with Iraq, Turkish Defense Minister Yasar Guler told journalists last month.\nThe insurgency \u2014 the PKK is fighting for an autonomous Kurdish state in southeast Turkey \u2014 has claimed tens of thousands of lives since the 1980s and Turkey and its Western allies have labelled PKK a terrorist organization.\nBaghdad has long complained that Turkish actions in Iraq against the PKK violate its sovereignty, but appears to be acquiescing with Ankara's operations.\nIn March, after a meeting between the Iraqi and Turkish foreign ministers, Baghdad announced that the Iraqi National Security Council had issued a ban on the PKK, although it stopped short of designating it as a terrorist organization. Erdo\u011fan on Monday praised the ban.\nAl-Sudani told journalists during a visit to Washington last week that Iraq and Turkey have \"true interests with one another and common projects.\" He noted that the PKK has long had a presence in northern Iraq, \"but we are not allowing any armed group to be on Iraqi territory and using it as a launchpad for attacks.\"\nAnkara has argued that PKK's presence in Iraq threatens the planned construction of a major trade route, the Iraq Development Road, that would connect the port in Basra, southern Iraq, to Turkey and Europe through a network of rail lines and highways.\nBaghdad may take a similar approach to the PKK as it has taken to Iranian Kurdish dissident groups based in northern Iraq.\nThe presence of Iranian dissidents had become a point of tension with Tehran, which periodically launches airstrikes on their bases in Iraq. Last summer, Iran and Iraq reached an agreement to disarm the groups and relocate their members from military bases to displacement camps.\nEnergy issues and water rights are also key in Iraq-Turkey ties.\nAn oil pipeline running from the semiautonomous Kurdish region to Turkey has been shut down since March 2023, after an arbitration court ruling ordered Ankara to pay Iraq $1.5 billion for oil exports that bypassed Iraq's central government in Baghdad. The sharing of oil and gas revenues has long been a contentious issue between Baghdad and Kurdish authorities in Irbil.\nIn recent years, Iraqi officials have complained that dams built by Turkey are reducing Iraq's water supply.\nThe Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which provide most of Iraq's fresh water, originate in Turkey. Experts fear that climate change is likely to exacerbate existing water shortages in Iraq, with potentially devastating consequences.\nMustafa Hassan, a Baghdad resident, said he hopes that Erdo\u011fan's visit \"will help to solve problems related to water, because Iraq is suffering from a water scarcity crisis, and this affects agriculture.\"\nErdo\u011fan said Ankara was aware of the water problems Iraq faces and that the two countries have set up \"a joint permanent committee which is going to help through cooperation ... taking our shared interests into consideration.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Iraq-Turkey-Erdogan.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":3.8230662,"_id":"f05cee04fcb687ca8d082b2256f2eca7"},{"title":"Pittsburgh congressional race could be early test for progressives who criticize Israel's handling of war","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-15 15:19:26","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pittsburgh-congressional-race-early-test-progressives-criticize-israels-handling-war","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The Israel-Hamas war is a potent and polarizing issue for Americans. Upcoming elections will show whether progressives' outspoken criticisms of Israel resonate with their constituents.","summary":"An election this month in Pittsburgh and some of its suburbs is emerging as an early test of whether Israel's war with Hamas poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized how the conflict has been handled.\nU.S. Rep. Summer Lee, a first-term lawmaker who has aligned herself with \"the squad,\" is facing a primary challenge from Bhavini Patel and the war has become a flashpoint in the race.\nPatel frames Lee's criticism of Israel as part of a broader pattern of left-wing politics that are extreme for the district and potentially damaging to Democratic President Joe Biden in a state crucial to his reelection bid against Republican Donald Trump. Lee counters that she has helped move calls for a cease-fire in Gaza more into the mainstream of the Democratic Party.\nThe war has scrambled Democratic politics across the United States. It's dividing traditionally progressive groups, including Pittsburgh's sizable Jewish community, in ways that don't always fall neatly along ethnic or cultural lines. But it's an especially potent issue in Lee's district, which is home to the synagogue where a gunman in 2018 killed 11 congregants in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.\nThe April 23 primary could shed light on whether the war alone is enough to turn a critical mass of Democrats against Lee.\n\"It clearly is big enough with a certain group in this district,\" said Sam Hens-Greco, the party chair in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. \"Whether it is big enough for the entire populace, we're going to find out.\"\nIf Lee is defeated, she would be the first Democratic incumbent in Congress to lose a primary this year. Other progressive Democrats, including Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, face primary challengers this summer.\nLee has raised far more money than Patel and has backing from Pennsylvania's Democratic establishment, including Sen. Bob Casey, and a constellation of progressive groups that include both Jewish and Muslim organizations.\nThe first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania, the 36-year-old Lee is a Howard University law school graduate and community activist who began her political career in 2018 with a successful challenge from the left to an entrenched Pittsburgh-area state lawmaker.\nIn this year's campaign, Lee has promoted herself as a hardworking representative who delivers for constituents and speaks in Congress for marginalized communities on issues from fighting inequality to climate change and bigotry, including antisemitism and Islamophobia.\nOn the Israel-Hamas war, Lee has condemned Hamas' attack, but has also accused Israel of committing \"war crimes\" in Gaza, demanded an end to U.S. military aid to Israel and called for a cease-fire within days of the war starting as the best way to end the cycle of violence and work toward peace.\nThat set her apart from Biden's stance and that of most House Democrats, although now dozens more have joined her in calling for a cease-fire. At Biden's State of the Union speech, Lee donned a kaffiyeh, a checkered scarf that has come to symbolize solidarity with Palestinians.\nPatel, 30, a small-town municipal councilwoman who worked in former Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald's administration, declared her candidacy a few days before Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Patel, who is Hindu and of Indian heritage, has cultivated the Jewish community, opening a campaign office in the Jewish enclave in Squirrel Hill, attended post-Oct. 7 vigils and bussed with community members to a pro-Israel rally in Washington in November.\nMost recently, Patel has hammered Lee for being aligned with backers of the \"uncommitted\" campaign that is encouraging Democrats to protest Biden's handling of the war by voting \"uncommitted\" in primaries.\nThat, Patel suggested, is dangerous.\n\"I would say that every Democrat in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District should take notice that my opponent is equivocating on her support for President Biden and failed to denounce the \u2018uncommitted' movement,\" Patel said in an interview. \"I think that is the issue that is a big concern for Democrats in this district.\"\nLee defended the \"uncommitted\" movement, saying it's wrong to discourage people from voting and potentially lose a crucial part of the electorate that Democrats want to persuade to support Biden in November's presidential contest. Biden recognizes that, as well, Lee said.\nLee said she has met with people on all sides of the war, including families of hostages and families of Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza, and that her calls for a cease-fire reflect the district's majority.\nLee also accused Patel of aligning herself more with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than with Biden.\n\"Joe Biden is now coming more into alignment with us, which means that, no, we were not wrong to come out early and to come out strong, because as we're seeing now this was always where we needed to get,\" Lee said in an interview. \"This was always the only pathway to peace.\"\nFor now, the sharpest questions about the war have largely been limited to debate exchanges between Lee and Patel.\nThe issue has barely registered on the airwaves, and pro-Israel groups that spent heavily to try to defeat Lee in the 2022 primary \u2014 Democratic Majority for Israel and the American Israel Public Affairs committee, better known as AIPAC \u2014 haven't waded into the race.\nIn Pennsylvania, one potential boost for Lee could come from college students who, unlike in 2022's primary, will be on campus this time. At the University of Pittsburgh, the war has had a \"commanding presence\" on campus, with most students for a cease-fire, said Will Allison, president of Pitt's College Democrats.\nThe group endorsed Lee unanimously, despite the war causing some division among members, and the College Democrats are campaigning for Lee.\nIn one possible sign of shifting politics around the war, the 14th Ward Independent Democratic Club, a nonparty organization based around Squirrel Hill, voted to endorse Patel after backing Lee in 2022.\nSue Berman Kress, a Patel supporter who is Jewish, said she knows some Jewish Democrats who won't vote for Lee again. They feel she's abandoned the Jewish community and that her politics could open the door to a Trump victory and a surge in antisemitism.\n\"Those things feel very divisive in a way that's very scary,\" Kress said.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Bhavini-Patel.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":3.7764177,"_id":"58b53eaba299e7ae134cb70c6956038f"},{"title":"In the new Portland, legalized hard drugs are out, business is in","author":"Monique Claiborne","published_date":"2024-04-22 09:00:27","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/portland-legalized-hard-drugs-business","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Times are changing rapidly in the new Portland. The tolerance of drugs is long gone and business is back. The region is working hard to welcome investment and serve as a tech hub.","summary":"After three years of legalized hard drugs and rampant overdose deaths in Portland, Oregon, lawmakers this month rightly said enough is enough. There is a better option: strong progressive economic policies and ending untethered drug use promises to help repair the Portland image, attract new businesses and retain others downtown. This new more pragmatic progressivism we see shows a major shift in our state.\nGovernor Tina Kotek and the Democratic-majority legislature decisively steered away from ultra-progressive drug policies this year. The state's evolution reflects an increasing recognition among bipartisan policymakers of the need for practical solutions to address challenging social issues while becoming a more business-friendly state. And I have seen this work before.\nI hail from Detroit and contributed to the city's post-bankruptcy restructuring, which is currently drawing in investors, innovators and young adventurers. Coming to Portland, I was struck by the similarities between my new city today with that of my youth in Detroit's Cass Corridor.\nLike Detroit's blend of academic and economic opportunities juxtaposed with the stark realities of urban decay and crime, Portland's downtown today grapples with a similar set of opportunities and challenges.\nThis was exacerbated by voter-approved Measure 110 which ushered in the most lenient drug laws in the nation in attempt to encourage drug treatment and cut down addictions. Despite the well-meaning intentions of Portland voters, the unintended outcomes have been severe.\nLike Detroit, beneath visible urban challenges, Portland pulsates with vitality. Greater Portland boasts an extraordinary industrial base, fosters the education of trailblazers, and remains a strategic West Coast location for any sector.\nThe repeal of Measure 110, effective September 1, signals a commitment to growth, creating a safer and more conducive business climate. Unfortunately, Measure 110's failures reminded Portlanders of the importance of basic order to maintain a city's quality of life.\nAnd when polls this year showed 56% of voters favored repealing the measure, bipartisan legislators went for it, allowing local governments and law enforcement agencies the option to arrest or pursue substance abuse treatment for hard drug users. Kotek's leadership here mirrors Portland's metamorphosis, as she emerges as a centrist West Coast leader.\nHer work to allocate $240 million in tax incentives to 15 semiconductor companies also underscores Portland's dedication to embracing change and propelling progress in ways it simply had not done before to attract business. In June 2023, the state had approximately $11 million in cash incentives available for companies expanding their footprint in the state.\nOregon's political shift on tax incentives has solidified greater Portland's position as the nation's leading location in the semiconductor sector, shaping America's new economy in this critical industry that employs 40,000 people in the region.\nMoreover, this strategic move aligns seamlessly with the overarching federal effort for manufacturing investment, most notably from the CHIPS Act. Last December, the governor led a Portland central city task force of public and private sector leaders. We created solutions to the city's more pressing challenges and a long-term strategic vision for economic prosperity for the region.\nThis month, Multnomah County and Portland leaders unveiled an ambitious goal to cut the region's unsheltered homeless population in half by 2026, by adding hundreds of new shelter beds, building more affordable housing, and expand access to mental health and substance abuse treatment.\nRecently, Portland city council introduced an innovative Downtown Business Incentives Credit Program, expanded enterprise zones, and is exploring new Tax Increment Financing districts, signifying a turning point in the economic posture of the city nestled between the majestic Cascade Mountains and the tranquil vineyards of the Willamette Valley.\nCombined, these new incentives and the reversal of legalized open-air hard drug use show a region committed to turning the page on three years of economic uncertainty. With these changes, business leaders can now confidently consider expanding in the Portland area, knowing that favorable policies are in place to support their success.\nDriving down drug use and crime creates economic wins. In Detroit, policies like these ended much of the dilapidation I witnessed in my youth. That city now experiences high-priced condos, retail, and the newly erected Little Caesars Arena (home to two of the city's pro sports teams, the Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Pistons).\nOregon's political shift on tax incentives has solidified greater Portland's position as the nation's leading location in the semiconductor sector, shaping America's new economy in this critical industry that employs 40,000 people in the region.\nSimilarly, Portland's allure transcends its urban confines. Today, as Portland confronts its challenges head-on, it stands on the cusp of emerging stronger, more vibrant, and more resilient than ever before.\nAs someone who talks to corporations seeking fresh industrial land, high-value talent, and a high quality of life, the repeal of Measure 110 will help further reposition Portland once again as the Pacific Northwest's prime choice for business. My new hometown of Portland is charting a course toward once again being the West Coast's best value for business.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Monique Claiborne","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-108309382.jpg","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":3.6908324,"_id":"869766f997efa7063bd9cecdcaae93c2"},{"title":"Paris prepares for 100-day countdown to Olympics, aiming to reignite passion for the Games","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-15 15:36:34","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/paris-prepares-100-day-countdown-olympics-aiming-reignite-passion-games","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"April 17 marks the 100 days countdown to the Paris Olympics ambitious opening ceremony. The city is aiming to rekindle love for the Games, officials say.","summary":"In Paris' outskirts, a bright-eyed young girl is eager for the Olympic and Paralympic Games to end.\nThat's because the swimming club where 10-year-old Lyla Kebbi trains will inherit an Olympic pool. It will be dismantled after the Games and trucked from the Olympic race venue in Paris' high-rise business district to Sevran, a Paris-area town with less glitter and wealth. There, the pieces will be bolted back together and \u2014 voila ! \u2014 Kebbi and her swim team will have a new Olympic-sized pool to splash around in.\n\"It's incredible !\" she says. \"I hope it's going to bring us luck,\" adds her mother, Nora.\nIn 100 days as of Wednesday, the Paris Olympics will kick off with a wildly ambitious waterborne opening ceremony. But the first Games in a century in France's capital won't be judged for spectacle alone. Another yardstick will be their impact on disadvantaged Paris suburbs, away from the city-center landmarks that are hosting much of the action.\nBy promising socially positive and also less polluting and less wasteful Olympics, the city synonymous with romance is also setting itself the high bar of making future Games generally more desirable.\nCritics question their value for a world grappling with climate warming and other emergencies. Potential host cities became so Games-averse that Paris and Los Angeles were the only remaining candidates in 2017 when the International Olympic Committee selected them for 2024 and 2028, respectively.\nAfter scandals and the $13 billion cost of the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021, unfulfilled promises of beneficial change for host Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi tarnished by Russian doping and President Vladimir Putin's subsequent land grabs in Ukraine, the Switzerland-based IOC has mountains of skepticism to dispel.\nVirtuous Summer Games in Paris could help the long-term survival of the IOC's mega-event.\nThe idea that the July 26-Aug. 11 Games and Aug. 28-Sept. 8 Paralympics should benefit disadvantaged communities in the Seine-Saint-Denis region northeast of Paris was built from the outset into the city's plans.\nSeine-Saint-Denis is mainland France's poorest region. Thanks to generations of immigration, it also is vibrantly diverse, counting 130 nationalities and more than 170 languages spoken by its 1.6 million inhabitants. For Seine-Saint-Denis kids facing racial discrimination and other barriers, sports are sometimes a route out. World Cup winner Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 honed his silky soccer skills as a boy in the Seine-Saint-Denis town of Bondy.\nOnce heavily industrialized, Seine-Saint-Denis became grim and scary in parts after many jobs were lost. Rioting rocked its streets in 2005 and again last year. Members of an Islamic extremist cell that killed 130 people in the French capital in 2015 hid after the carnage in an apartment in the town of Saint-Denis and were killed in a shootout with heavily armed SWAT teams. That drama unfolded just a 15-minute walk from the Olympic stadium that will host track and field and rugby and the closing ceremonies.\nConcretely, the Games will leave a legacy of new and refurbished sports infrastructure in Seine-Saint-Denis, although critics say the investment still isn't enough to catch it up with better equipped, more prosperous regions.\nMamitiana Rabarijaona grew up close to the Olympic stadium, built originally for the 1998 soccer World Cup. He says it didn't provide much of a boost for Seine-Saint-Denis residents. He believes the Olympics will be \"a big party\" and he will be among 45,000 volunteers who'll be helping. But he is not expecting Olympic-related investments to magically erase Seine-Saint-Denis' many difficulties.\n\"It's like lifting the carpet and brushing the dust underneath,\" he said. \"It doesn't make it go away.\"\nSeine-Saint-Denis got the new Olympic village that will become housing and offices when the 10,500 Olympians and 4,400 Paralympians have left. It also is home to the Games' only purpose-built competition venue, an aquatics center for diving, water polo and artistic swimming events. Other competition venues already existed, were previously planned or will be temporary.\n\"We really were driven by the ambition of sobriety and above all not to build sports facilities that aren't needed and which will have no reason to exist after the Games,\" Marie Barsacq, the organizing committee's legacy director, said in an interview.\nThe hand-me-down 50-meter pool for Sevran will be a significant upgrade. The Seine-Saint-Denis town of 51,000 people was whacked by factory closures in the 1990s. Its existing 25-meter pool is nearly 50 years old.\nOther Seine-Saint-Denis towns are also getting new or renovated pools \u2014 particularly welcome for the region's children, because only half of them can swim.\n\"The ambition for these Olympic Games ... is that they benefit everyone and for the longest time possible,\" said Sevran Mayor St\u00e9phane Blanchet. The Olympics, Blanchet said, can't \"carry on just passing though and then moving on without thinking about tomorrow.\"\nAt close to $9.7 billion, more than half from sponsors, ticket sales and other non-public funding, Paris' expenses so far are less than for the last three Summer Games in Tokyo, Rio and London in 2012.\nIncluding policing and transport costs, the portion of the bill for French taxpayers is likely to be around $3.25 billon, France's body for auditing public funds said in its most recent study in July.\nSecurity remains a challenge for the city repeatedly hit by deadly extremist violence. The government downsized ambitions to have 600,000 people lining the River Seine for the opening ceremony. Citing the risk of attacks, it shelved a promise that anyone could apply for hundreds of thousands of free tickets. Instead, the 326,000 spectators will either be paying ticket-holders or have been invited.\nPrivacy advocates are critical of video surveillance technology being deployed to spot security threats. Campaigners for the homeless are concerned that they will be swept off streets. Many Parisians plan to leave, to avoid the disruptions or to rent their homes to the expected 15 million visitors. With trade unions pushing for Olympic bonuses, strikes are also possible.\nAnd all this against an inflammable backdrop of geopolitical crises including but not limited to the Israel-Hamas war and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As a consequence, the IOC isn't allowing athletes from Russia and ally Belarus to parade with other Olympians at the opening ceremony.\nStill, Olympics fans expect big things of Paris. They include Ayaovi Atindehou, a 32-year-old trainee doctor from Togo studying in France. The Olympic volunteer believes the Games can bridge divisions, even if just temporarily.\n\"The whole world without racial differences, ethnic differences, religious differences. We will be all together, shouting, celebrating,\" he said. \"We need the Olympic Games.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Eiffel-Tower.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":3.6470437,"_id":"01590c2acb24414dc94dcde906e5e6f0"},{"title":"Jewish students slam elite colleges for letting antisemitism run rampant: 'Moral corruption'","author":"Emma Colton","published_date":"2024-04-17 08:00:24","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jewish-students-slam-elite-colleges-letting-antisemitism-run-rampant-moral-corruption","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Students at elite universities react to an ADL report report that a handful of elite colleges, including Harvard and MIT, received failing grades for their handling of antisemitism.","summary":"An anti-hate watchdog recently handed out failing grades to some of America's most prestigious universities for their handling of antisemitism on campus, and students at the same elite institutions are speaking out, saying the findings are not surprising.\n\"The moral corruption surrounding our elite academic institutions should be alarming to not only Jews,\" University of Pennsylvania undergraduate student Eyal Yakoby told Fox News Digital.\n\"The hate that our professors and fellow students harbor has been running rampant, and administrations are still searching for their moral compasses. This study should be a wake-up call, and academic institutions must stop being ambivalent about antisemitism,\" he continued.\nYakoby was reacting to a recent report released by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) that found universities including Harvard, MIT and Stanford received failing F grades for the state of antisemitism on their campuses, while schools such as Penn, University of California at Berkeley and Princeton received D grades.\nThe grades are part of the ADL's new Campus Antisemitism Report Card, which examined 85 schools and assigned grades ranging from A through F, based on \"21 criteria for assessment, categorized into: administrative action and policies, incidents on campus, and Jewish student life on campus,\" according to the press release published last week.\nCases of antisemitism have spiked on campuses nationwide following the outbreak of war in Israel on Oct. 7, with college leaders coming under intense fire on the national stage for their handling of antisemitism.\nThe University of Pennsylvania and Harvard both saw their presidents resign amid national and campus outrage after they appeared before Congress in December and were grilled about their handling of antisemitism on their respective campuses.\nWhen asked for comment on the study and Yakoby's comments, a Penn spokesperson said in a statement that the ADL's \"work to combat antisemitism is vital\" and that the school values \"its expertise and ongoing engagement as we actively work to prevent antisemitism on our campus, now and for the long term.\"\n\"We recognize we have more work to do and are undertaking it with urgency and focus.\"\n\"The University of Pennsylvania celebrates our robust Jewish community and strives to be a place where all Jewish students, faculty, and staff can thrive,\" the spokesperson continued. \"Penn has repeatedly condemned antisemitism, emphatically and unconditionally. We are implementing a comprehensive Action Plan to Combat Antisemitism and have taken decisive and significant action to ensure safety and security on our campus. We have hosted multiple experts and panels to provide knowledge about the history of antisemitism and strategies to prevent it. Over the past few months, our Antisemitism Task Force has worked diligently to provide interim recommendations and will soon offer additional action steps Penn can take for enduring impact.\"\nJewish high school students in the New York City area were even warned this year against applying to Cornell University over the school's reported failure to protect Jewish students from repeated instances of antisemitism.\nMIT graduate student Talia Khan, who has provided congressional testimony on the rise in antisemitism on campuses, said the prestigious school's failing grade did not come as a shock.\n\"As an MIT student, it is unfortunately no surprise that MIT received an F, making it one of the worst schools in the country for Jews. Recently, in a shocking display of disturbing disconnection from reality, President Sally Kornbluth inquired of a professor as to why the Jewish students remain so upset. He was shocked,\" Khan told Fox News Digital.\n\"Sally Kornbluth and the MIT administration have done nothing tangible to improve life for all students on campus whose academic experience is being disrupted by Hamas and PFLP terrorist sympathizers who repeatedly flout MIT rules and are never disciplined in a way that stops them from continuing to make MIT an unsafe environment for all students, especially Jews and Israelis.\"\nKornbluth was grilled alongside Harvard's and Penn's respective presidents during a congressional hearing in December, but she did not resign like her academic colleagues. MIT had been repeatedly accused of failing to stop antisemitic acts from a student group called the Coalition Against Apartheid, including before the outbreak of war, including the vandalism of a Holocaust display and allegedly declaring support for Hamas, the New York Post reported in December.\nMIT suspended the student group after \"once again\" carrying out \"a demonstration on campus without going through the normal permission processes that apply to every student group at MIT,\" Kornbluth said in February.\nColleges have seen repeat protests and rallies against Israel since October, including this month when an estimated 150 students at Pomona College in California stormed an administrative building, resulting in arrests and a stern warning from the college president that such behavior would not be tolerated; New Jersey's Rutger University required police assistance at a town hall when anti-Israel protesters this month.\nBeyond the world of academia, anti-Israel agitators shut down San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, as well as the Brooklyn Bridge and Wall Street in New York City just on Monday alone, with many chanting \"Free, free Palestine\" and \"Israel bombs. USA pays. How many kids did you kill today?\"\nThe protests Monday follow Iran launching a failed attack on Israel over the weekend, including deploying hundreds of drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles launched from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. The attack only caused minor damage in Israel.\nWhen asked if a culture of antisemitism on U.S. campuses and across the nation has possibly emboldened Iran, Khan said terrorists are likely \"thrilled\" with anti-Israel protests in America.\n\"I couldn't begin to put myself inside the minds of those people, but I would imagine they're thrilled seeing 18-year-old kids from the U.S. hold events in support for their terror groups,\" she said.\nThe ADL's report found that only two schools received A grades: Brandeis University and Elon University. While 17 schools received B grades and 29 schools received C marks.\n\"It's time for campuses to step up and protect our children from the hate and antisemitism that has proliferated on college campuses across the country this year,\" said Emma Law-Oppman of Mothers Against College Antisemitism in the ADL's press release. \"It is our hope that ADL's Report Card serves as a much-needed [wake-up] call for schools to prioritize creating a safe and welcoming environment for all students. At M.A.C.A., our members are fully prepared and energized to demand a massive change from school leadership across the country.\"\nSome universities have since pushed back on the report's findings, including Tufts University, which received an F grade.\n\"We disagree with the ADL's grade and encourage people to look at the underlying data,\" a Tufts spokesperson told Fox News Digital when the report was first released.\n\"As the ADL itself notes, Tufts has a vibrant Jewish student life, has established policies, practices and training to improve our campus climate and fight antisemitism, has leaders who are committed to this work, has promoted listening and dialogue across campus, has firmly opposed the BDS movement, and has vigorously condemned antisemitic incidents on campus.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Emma Colton","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/talia.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":3.5245152,"_id":"5f72008f06858ec3de5d036631a2625d"}],"user_input":{"q":"climate","search_in":["title_summary_en"],"lang":["en"],"not_lang":null,"countries":null,"not_countries":null,"from":"2024-04-15 00:00:00","to":null,"ranked_only":"True","from_rank":null,"to_rank":null,"sort_by":"relevancy","page":1,"size":100,"sources":["foxnews.com"],"not_sources":[],"topic":null,"published_date_precision":null}}
