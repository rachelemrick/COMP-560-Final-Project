            "summary": "The historic criminal trial of former President Donald Trump is poised to kick off in a Manhattan courtroom Monday, when he will become the first former president in U.S. history to stand trial.\nThe proceedings before Judge Juan Merchan are set to move forward after Trump made multiple attempts to delay them, resulting in a string of losses that failed to derail the trial's start.\nThe prosecution by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg stems from allegations Trump made a \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star in an effort to conceal damaging information about him during the 2016 election.\nIt is the first of four criminal cases involving the former president to go to trial and comes as Trump is making a bid to return to the White House for a second term. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges he faces and claims the prosecutions are politically motivated.\nHere's what to know about the case as jury selection gets underway on Monday:\nWhat is the case about, and what is Trump charged with?\nFormer President Donald Trump attends a pretrial hearing in a New York courtroom on Thursday, Feb. 15, 2024.\nJefferson Siegel/The New York Times/Bloomberg via Getty Images\nAt the heart of this case is a payment made days before Trump was elected president in 2016. His attorney at the time, Michael Cohen, paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair, which Trump denies.\nProsecutors say Cohen was then reimbursed by Trump in a series of 12 monthly payments from the Trump Organization that were logged and characterized as checks for ongoing legal services, as opposed to repayments for the hush money. Trump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and has pleaded not guilty.\nJustice Juan Merchan will explain the case to potential jurors with these words, according to a court filing:\n\"The allegations are, in substance, that Donald Trump falsified business records to conceal an agreement with others to unlawfully influence the 2016 presidential election. Specifically, it is alleged that Donald Trump made or caused false business records to hide the true nature of payments made to Michael Cohen, by characterizing them as payment for legal services rendered pursuant to a retainer agreement. The People allege that in fact, the payments were intended to reimburse Michael Cohen for money he paid to Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, in the weeks before the presidential election to prevent her from publicly revealing details about a past sexual encounter with Donald Trump.\"\nWhat's happening Monday?\nJudge Juan Merchan's courtroom at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City on March 12, 2024.\nANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images\nThe trial formally kicks off on Monday with jury selection. More than 500 Manhattan residents have been summoned to appear as potential jurors in the trial. They will be asked to fill out a form with questions ranging from the mundane — what jobs they hold — to the more pointed, like whether they follow Trump on social media.\nWhat do prosecutors say about the case?\nBragg said after Trump was arraigned in April 2023 that the core of the case is that Trump \"repeatedly and fraudulently falsified New York business records to conceal crimes that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election.\"\nIn a December radio interview, Bragg said the case is about \"conspiring to corrupt a presidential election and then lying in New York business records to cover it up.\"\nWhat has Trump said about the case?\nTrump has repeatedly accused Bragg of pursuing the case for political gain, and has sought to tie the case to a broader accusation — without proof — that his political enemies have conspired to use the courts against him. He has also raged against Merchan, whom he has similarly accused of bias.\nIn a social media post on Wednesday, Trump made many of his typical unfounded claims about the case, including that it's \"an illegal attack on a Political Opponent,\" and that he will be \"forced to sit, GAGGED, before a HIGHLY CONFLICTED & CORRUPT JUDGE, whose hatred for me has no bounds.\"\nTrump will be \"gagged\"?\nWell, not literally. But he is under a gag order limiting what he can say about the trial.\nOn March 26, Trump was barred from commenting on potential witnesses in the case, prospective jurors, court staff, lawyers in Bragg's office and the relatives of any counsel or court staffer — but was free to attack Bragg and Merchan.\nTrump lashed out at the judge, and in the ensuing days focused on Merchan's adult daughter, who works for a consulting firm that works with Democratic candidates and causes. On April 1, Merchan expanded his gag order to prevent Trump from making more public comments about the judge's family. Merchan wrote that he had potential jurors and their families in mind.\n\"The average observer must now, after hearing [Trump's] recent attacks, draw the conclusion that if they become involved in these proceedings, even tangentially, they should worry not only for themselves, but their loved ones,\" Merchan wrote. \"Such concerns will undoubtedly interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitutes a direct attack on the Rule of Law itself.\"\nWill the trial be live-streamed?\nNo, there will be no live footage or audio from the courtroom, since New York state law prohibits broadcasting criminal proceedings. Photographers will be allowed to capture images at the start of each day of the trial.\nCBS News will have reporters covering the trial from the courtroom itself and from an overflow room on the same floor in the courthouse, where there will be a live feed.\nWho are Trump's lawyers?\nTodd Blanche arrives at Trump Tower in New York on Feb. 15, 2024.\nMichael/ Getty Images\nTrump is represented by Todd Blanche, Susan Necheles and Emil Bove, among others. Blanche is also leading Trump's defense in two unrelated federal criminal cases. Necheles has been an attorney in Trump's orbit for years, and represented his company during a 2022 trial in which two of its entities were forced to pay a fine after being convicted of 17 felony counts related to tax fraud committed by executives.\nWhere is the trial?\nThe trial is taking place at the Manhattan Criminal Court, the same courthouse that has been used for eight decades to process cases for thousands of New Yorkers who each year come into contact with the criminal justice system.\nWill Trump attend the trial?\nYes. Defendants in New York criminal cases are required to attend trials unless they apply for a waiver from proceedings. Trump has not done so.\nWill Trump testify?\nTrump told reporters after a March 25 hearing that he \"would have no problem testifying,\" but his lawyers have not said if they intend to call him. Pretrial filings in the case indicate the two sides have sparred over what topics prosecutors would be allowed to broach if Trump does take the stand.\nHow long will the trial last?\nCourt personnel and lawyers from both sides have said they expect the trial to last between six and eight weeks. Proceedings will generally be held four days a week, on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, with exceptions for holidays.\nThe prosecution will present its case first, followed by the defense.\nIf Trump is convicted, can he be sentenced to prison?\nYes. Each of the counts against Trump carries a maximum sentence of four years incarceration. Trump would be a first-time, nonviolent offender. The judge would have wide discretion in imposing a sentence, and could even give Trump no prison time at all.",

            "summary": "First day of Trump's 'hush money' trial\nFirst day of Trump's 'hush money' trial\nJury selection begins in first criminal trial for former President Donald Trump\n03:06\nThe first criminal trial of a former president in U.S. history is getting underway Monday in a crowded Manhattan courtroom, with both sides preparing for the arduous task of seating a 12-person jury in the case of The People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump.\nFlanked by his attorneys in room 1530 of the Manhattan Criminal Court, Trump is seated at a table where countless defendants before him have appeared. The presumptive Republican nominee for president addressed reporters outside the courtroom before making his way inside.\n\"This is really an attack on a political opponent. That's all it is,\" Trump said. \"So I'm very honored to be here.\"\nThe case is the first of four criminal prosecutions against Trump to make it to trial. He is charged with 34 state counts of falsifying business records related to a \"hush money\" payment his attorney made to an adult film star before the 2016 election. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges, claiming the prosecution is part of a plot by Democrats aimed at preventing him from retaking the White House.\nThe first day of the Trump trial\nFormer President Donald Trump attends the first day of his \"hush money\" trial at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City on April 15, 2024.\nJEFFERSON SIEGEL/POOL/AFP via Getty Images\nJudge Juan Merchan took his seat on the bench just before 10 a.m. and called the proceedings to order. He quickly denied a motion from Trump's legal team asking him to recuse himself from the case. Trump's attorneys had argued that Merchan should step aside because of his daughter's employment at a consultancy firm that does work for Democratic candidates and progressive groups. Merchan said their argument relied upon \"a series of inferences, innuendos and unsupported allegations.\"\nTrump's lawyers and prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office argued over some outstanding issues related to trial rules and the questions that potential jurors will answer.\nJoshua Steinglass, a member of Bragg's team, said the prosecution would offer evidence that Trump conspired with his former attorney Michael Cohen and an executive at the parent company of the National Enquirer to suppress damaging stories about Trump, and publish negative stories about his rivals, before the 2016 election.\nSteinglass said David Pecker, then the CEO of American Media, Inc., would testify that Pecker that \"he ran these stories to bolster Mr. Trump's campaign\" and that they were \"shown to Mr Trump before they were published, so he could approve, suggest or reject changes.\" Steinglass said prosecutors would introduce evidence pointing to \"a deal struck between the defendant and AMI to put their thumbs on the scale.\"\nTodd Blanche, an attorney for Trump, said the evidence has \"nothing to do with the charged crime.\" Merchan soon said he would allow prosecutors to use the evidence at trial.\nOnce the final pretrial questions are resolved, more than 500 members of the jury pool will soon be escorted into the room for jury selection. Many will be able to see Trump and observe any of his reactions while the judge describes the case. The allegations, Merchan is expected to say, \"are, in substance, that Donald Trump falsified business records to conceal an agreement with others to unlawfully influence the 2016 presidential election.\"\nHe'll continue by mentioning the names of two well-known key witnesses in the case, both of whom Trump considers archnemeses: his former attorney Michael Cohen, and Stormy Daniels, the adult film star.\n\"Specifically, it is alleged that Donald Trump made or caused false business records to hide the true nature of payments made to Michael Cohen, by characterizing them as payment for legal services rendered pursuant to a retainer agreement,\" Merchan will say, according to pretrial court filings. \"The [prosecutors] allege that in fact, the payments were intended to reimburse Michael Cohen for money he paid to Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, in the weeks before the presidential election to prevent her from publicly revealing details about a past sexual encounter with Donald Trump.\"\nThe potential jurors will be asked to fill out a form with 42 questions ranging from the mundane — what jobs they hold — to the more pointed, like whether they follow Trump on social media. Trump's lawyers and prosecutors will seek to whittle the group of potential jurors down to just 12, plus a few alternates, in a process that is expected to take more than a week. The two sides will then begin presenting their cases.\nAs a criminal defendant, Trump is required to attend proceedings each day of the trial unless he applies for a waiver. Court personnel and lawyers from both sides have said they expect the trial to last between six and eight weeks.",

Trump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and has pleaded not guilty.\nJustice Juan Merchan will explain the case to potential jurors with these words, according to a court filing:\n\"The allegations are, in substance, that Donald Trump falsified business records to conceal an agreement with others to unlawfully influence the 2016 presidential election. Specifically, it is alleged that Donald Trump made or caused false business records to hide the true nature of payments made to Michael Cohen, by characterizing them as payment for legal services rendered pursuant to a retainer agreement. The People allege that in fact, the payments were intended to reimburse Michael Cohen for money he paid to Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, in the weeks before the presidential election to prevent her from publicly revealing details about a past sexual encounter with Donald Trump.\"\nWhat's happening Monday?\nJudge Juan Merchan's courtroom at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City on March 12, 2024.\nANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images\nThe trial formally kicks off on Monday with jury selection. More than 500 Manhattan residents have been summoned to appear as potential jurors in the trial. They will be asked to fill out a form with questions ranging from the mundane — what jobs they hold — to the more pointed, like whether they follow Trump on social media.\nWhat do prosecutors say about the case?\nBragg said after Trump was arraigned in April 2023 that the core of the case is that Trump \"repeatedly and fraudulently falsified New York business records to conceal crimes that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election.\"\nIn a December radio interview, Bragg said the case is about \"conspiring to corrupt a presidential election and then lying in New York business records to cover it up.\"\nWhat has Trump said about the case?\nTrump has repeatedly accused Bragg of pursuing the case for political gain, and has sought to tie the case to a broader accusation — without proof — that his political enemies have conspired to use the courts against him. He has also raged against Merchan, whom he has similarly accused of bias.\nIn a social media post on Wednesday, Trump made many of his typical unfounded claims about the case, including that it's \"an illegal attack on a Political Opponent,\" and that he will be \"forced to sit, GAGGED, before a HIGHLY CONFLICTED & CORRUPT JUDGE, whose hatred for me has no bounds.\"\nTrump will be \"gagged\"?\nWell, not literally. But he is under a gag order limiting what he can say about the trial.\nOn March 26, Trump was barred from commenting on potential witnesses in the case, prospective jurors, court staff, lawyers in Bragg's office and the relatives of any counsel or court staffer — but was free to attack Bragg and Merchan.\nTrump lashed out at the judge, and in the ensuing days focused on Merchan's adult daughter, who works for a consulting firm that works with Democratic candidates and causes. On April 1, Merchan expanded his gag order to prevent Trump from making more public comments about the judge's family. Merchan wrote that he had potential jurors and their families in mind.\n\"The average observer must now, after hearing [Trump's] recent attacks, draw the conclusion that if they become involved in these proceedings, even tangentially, they should worry not only for themselves, but their loved ones,\" Merchan wrote. \"Such concerns will undoubtedly interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitutes a direct attack on the Rule of Law itself.\"\nWill the trial be live-streamed?\nNo, there will be no live footage or audio from the courtroom, since New York state law prohibits broadcasting criminal proceedings. Photographers will be allowed to capture images at the start of each day of the trial.\nCBS News will have reporters covering the trial from the courtroom itself and from an overflow room on the same floor in the courthouse, where there will be a live feed.\nWho are Trump's lawyers?\nTodd Blanche arrives at Trump Tower in New York on Feb. 15, 2024.\nMichael/ Getty Images\nTrump is represented by Todd Blanche, Susan Necheles and Emil Bove, among others. Blanche is also leading Trump's defense in two unrelated federal criminal cases. Necheles has been an attorney in Trump's orbit for years, and represented his company during a 2022 trial in which two of its entities were forced to pay a fine after being convicted of 17 felony counts related to tax fraud committed by executives.\nWhere is the trial?\nThe trial is taking place at the Manhattan Criminal Court, the same courthouse that has been used for eight decades to process cases for thousands of New Yorkers who each year come into contact with the criminal justice system.\nWill Trump attend the trial?\nYes. Defendants in New York criminal cases are required to attend trials unless they apply for a waiver from proceedings. Trump has not done so.\nWill Trump testify?\nTrump told reporters after a March 25 hearing that he \"would have no problem testifying,\" but his lawyers have not said if they intend to call him. Pretrial filings in the case indicate the two sides have sparred over what topics prosecutors would be allowed to broach if Trump does take the stand.\nHow long will the trial last?\nCourt personnel and lawyers from both sides have said they expect the trial to last between six and eight weeks. Proceedings will generally be held four days a week, on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, with exceptions for holidays.\nThe prosecution will present its case first, followed by the defense.\nIf Trump is convicted, can he be sentenced to prison?\nYes. Each of the counts against Trump carries a maximum sentence of four years incarceration. Trump would be a first-time, nonviolent offender. The judge would have wide discretion in imposing a sentence, and could even give Trump no prison time at all.",

He faces charges in two federal cases brought by special counsel Jack Smith in Washington, D.C., and Florida, and in a second state case brought by prosecutors in Georgia. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges, claiming the prosecutions are part of a plot by his political opponents aimed at keeping him from retaking the White House.\nMonday's proceedings will begin with Trump's lawyers and prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office arguing over some outstanding issues related to trial rules. Then, the first of more than 500 potential jurors will be escorted into the room. By that point, many will have noticed the extraordinary security apparatus outside and within the courthouse, as well as anticipated demonstrators for and against Trump. In Trump's recent civil defamation trial just a block away, several would-be jurors appeared visibly shocked when they first saw him sitting at the defense table.\nMany will be able to see Trump and observe any of his reactions while the judge describes the case. The allegations, New York State Justice Juan Merchan is expected to say, \"are, in substance, that Donald Trump falsified business records to conceal an agreement with others to unlawfully influence the 2016 presidential election.\"\nHe'll continue by mentioning the names of two well-known key witnesses in the case, both of whom Trump considers archnemeses: his former attorney Michael Cohen, and the adult film star Stormy Daniels.\nJudge Juan Manuel Merchan's courtroom at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York, seen on March 12, 2024.\nANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images\n\"Specifically, it is alleged that Donald Trump made or caused false business records to hide the true nature of payments made to Michael Cohen, by characterizing them as payment for legal services rendered pursuant to a retainer agreement,\" Merchan will say, according to pretrial court filings. \"The [prosecutors] allege that in fact, the payments were intended to reimburse Michael Cohen for money he paid to Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, in the weeks before the presidential election to prevent her from publicly revealing details about a past sexual encounter with Donald Trump.\"\nAs a criminal defendant, Trump is required to attend proceedings each day of the trial unless he applies for a waiver. He'll watch on Monday, and likely several more days, as his lawyers and prosecutors seek to whittle the group of potential jurors down to just 12, plus a few alternates. The two sides will then begin presenting their cases.\nTrump has entered a not guilty plea to 34 counts of falsification of business records. He has accused Bragg of bringing the case for political gain.In a letter to members of Congress last year, a lawyer for Bragg hit back at that accusation, saying \"were brought by citizens of New York, doing their civic duty as members of a grand jury, who found probable cause to accuse Mr. Trump of having committed crimes in New York.\"",

Before Trump selected him to be RNC chair, Whatley worked on election integrity initiatives as the chair of the North Carolina Republican Party.\nHis history with these efforts was a motivating factor for Trump when he selected him to succeed Ronna McDaniel as party chair.\nThe announcement underscores an effort by the former president to refocus the RNC on election integrity, which Trump felt previous party leaders failed to accomplish during the 2020 election.\nDespite Trump's focus on the issue, there was no evidence of widespread fraud during the 2020 election. Trump is currently facing federal and state charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\nThe Democratic National Committee accused the Trump political operation of trying to undermine the results of the 2024 presidential election.\n\"Donald Trump knows he's running a losing campaign, so he's working with his handpicked team of election deniers at the RNC to once again lay the groundwork to undermine our democracy and spread baseless lies about a rigged election,\" said DNC Rapid Response Director Alex Floyd in a press release.",

            "excerpt": "Special counsel Jack Smith said Trump's attorneys have had more than enough time to prepare to meet the May 9 deadline for reviewing the documents",
            "summary": "(CNN) - Special counsel Jack Smith told the federal judge overseeing Donald Trump's classified documents case she should reject the former president's attempt to use his first criminal trial, set to begin Monday in New York, to try to delay facing a jury over the more serious federal charges in Florida.\n(CNN) - Special counsel Jack Smith told the federal judge overseeing Donald Trump's classified documents case she should reject the former president's attempt to use his first criminal trial, set to begin Monday in New York, to try to delay facing a jury over the more serious federal charges in Florida.\nIn Trump's latest effort to capitalize on colliding court schedules, the 2024 presumptive Republican nominee asked US District Judge Aileen Cannon on Saturday to push back a May deadline for reviewing classified evidence in the criminal case over his alleged mishandling of classified and sensitive government information stored at his Mar-a-Lago estate.\nTrump can't meet the deadline, his lawyers said in a filing, because he'll be on trial for state charges in Manhattan. That trial - over allegations that Trump falsified business records to conceal hush money payments to cover up an alleged affair with an adult film star before the 2016 election - could last into June.\nBut Trump and his primary defense lawyers, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, can't be in two places at once, they said.\n\"President Trump has a constitutional right to be present at the trial in New York and, as a result, cannot participate in this work relating to important parts of his defense,\" Trump's attorneys wrote in the filing to Cannon.\nSmith countered in a Sunday evening court filing that, while Trump has a constitutional right to counsel, that \"right is not boundless.\"\nSmith said Trump's attorneys have had more than enough time to prepare to meet the May 9 deadline for reviewing the classified materials in the federal documents case. Smith also noted that Trump has local lawyers in Florida who can continue to review the classified materials while the New York hush money trial is underway.\n\"Each time the Court sets a new deadline in this case and attempts to keep it moving toward trial, the defendants reflexively ask for an adjournment. That must stop,\" Smith said.\nAs the former president's legal team steps into the Manhattan courtroom Monday, work in the Mar-a-Lago documents case will grind to a near-total halt. The classified documents case has stalled in Florida federal court, and Trump's defense team has already dramatically reduced the amount of time they've spent working on the criminal case over the last six weeks.\nCannon, who is overseeing the case, has not yet set a trial date, has few other deadlines on the calendar, and has a backlog of legal disputes she has yet to resolve.\nMoreover, the sensitive nature of the information handled in the case makes it difficult for attorneys to continue any work outside Florida. The next phase of their work requires extensive discussions between Trump and his legal team in a secure facility in remote Fort Pierce, Florida, people familiar with Trump's legal team said.\nIn the filing Saturday, Trump's attorneys said that meeting the deadline to review evidence \"will require lengthy classified submissions and extensive time in a SCIF to prepare and discuss those submissions, which is time President Trump and his attorneys simply do not have during the trial that is about to begin in New York.\"\nFederal prosecutors from the special counsel's office are also attempting to keep up the pressure on the case in Florida, making clear to Cannon that they believe Trump's team should be prepared for their arguments over classified records in the defense case already.\n\"They have had the classified discovery for months now ... they are well steeped in it,\" prosecutor Jay Bratt said in a March hearing, adding that the fight over classified documents is \"what leads to how the case can be presented at trial.\"\nIn his filing Saturday, Trump's lawyers said that the special counsel's office indicated that they \"cannot agree\" with the request to push back deadlines.",

            "summary": "Opening statements are set to begin this morning in former President Donald Trump's criminal trial in New York, when prosecutors will begin laying out their case for jurors.\nTrump is accused of falsifying business records to cover up a \"hush money\" payment during his 2016 campaign. Defense attorneys are expected to argue Trump has been charged on flimsy evidence from an untrustworthy key witness.\nArriving at the courthouse, Trump claimed the trial was \"election interference\" and part of an effort to keep him off the campaign trail. He called the case a \"witch hunt\" and \"a shame.\"\nThe start of the trial is a moment nearly eight years in the making, dating back to just days before the 2016 election, when that witness, Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen, paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence about an alleged sexual encounter.\nProsecutors say Trump reimbursed Cohen for the payment in 12 monthly installments during the first year of his presidency, portraying them as checks for ongoing legal services in a scheme to conceal the \"hush money.\" Trump was charged last year with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies having had a sexual encounter.\nFormer President Donald Trump sits in Manhattan Criminal Court for his trial for allegedly covering up hush money payments, on April 19, 2024.\n/ Getty Images\nHe seethed about the case last week as the trial got underway with jury selection. Trump lashed out at Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg in public appearances and posted about Bragg, Judge Juan Merchan and Cohen on social media. But inside the courtroom, Trump was reserved, speaking rarely and even appearing to nod off from time to time, as 192 potential jurors were narrowed to a dozen, plus six alternates.\nThat group is the first panel of jurors in U.S. history to sit in judgment of a former president in a criminal case.\nAfter opening statements, prosecutors are expected to call as their first witness David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, according to a source familiar with the plan.\nHe's expected to testify that he, Cohen and Trump orchestrated a \"catch and kill\" scheme, in which Pecker's publication purchased the rights to negative stories about Trump and suppressed them, while publishing unflattering stories about Trump's opponents.",

            "summary": "New York — Former President Donald Trump met Wednesday in New York with Polish President Andrzej Duda, the latest in a series of meetings with foreign leaders as Europe braces for the possibility of a second Trump term.\nThe presumptive Republican nominee hosted Duda at Trump Tower, where the two discussed the war in Ukraine and Duda's push to boost NATO members' defense spending, according to a readout from Trump's campaign.\nDuda, who has long expressed admiration for Trump, is also a staunch supporter of Ukraine and has encouraged Washington to provide more aid to Kyiv amid Russian's ongoing invasion. That funding has been held up by Trump allies in Congress.\nAs he arrived, Trump praised the Polish president, saying, \"He's done a fantastic job and he's my friend.\"\nDonald Trump stands with Polish President Andrzej Duda at Trump Tower on April 17, 2024 in New York City.\nMichael M Santiago / Getty Images\n\"We had four great years together,\" Trump added. \"We're behind Poland all the way.\"\nFollowing the almost 2 1/2 hour meeting, Duda said only that it was a \"friendly meeting in very nice atmosphere.\"\nHis aide, Wojciech Kolarski, also in attendance, described it as an \"excellent meeting\" of \"two friends who reminisced on the time when for four years they cooperated while holding presidential offices,\" a time that was \"very fruitful for Polish-U.S. relations.\"\nDuda is the latest foreign leader to meet with Trump in the weeks since he locked up the Republican nomination. U.S. allies across the world were caught off guard by Trump's surprise 2016 win, forcing them to scramble to build relationships with a president who often attacked longstanding treaties and alliances they valued. Setting up meetings with him during the 2024 campaign suggests they don't want to be behind again.\nTrump's allies have been encouraging foreign countries to send diplomats and official emissaries to Mar-a-Lago to reconnect ahead of another potential Trump stint in the White House, sources with direct knowledge of the meetings confirmed to CBS News.\nTrump advisers and allies believe he'll be able to capitalize on the decline in Americans' approval of President Biden's foreign policy decisions. An April CBS News poll found that only 33% of Americans approve of Mr. Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict, down from 44% in October.\nEven as he goes on trial for one of the four criminal indictments against him, Trump and Mr. Biden are locked in a rematch that most observers expect will be exceedingly close in November.\nSuch meetings aren't unprecedented\nWhile some in Poland worried the visit might damage the country's relationship with Biden, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. - a Biden ally and a major voice in his party on foreign affairs - said such meetings make sense.\n\"The polls are close,\" he said. \"If I were a foreign leader - and there's a precedent attached to meeting with candidates who are nominated or on the path to being nominated - I'd probably do it too.\"\nMurphy noted that former President Barack Obama did a lengthy international tour and met with foreign leaders when he first ran for the White House. So did Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, who challenged Obama in 2012 and whose trip included a stop in Poland's capital, Warsaw.\nDuda's visit comes a week after Trump met with British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, another NATO member and key proponent of supporting Ukraine, at the former president's Florida estate.\nIn March, Trump hosted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, an autocrat who has maintained the closest relationship with Russia among European Union countries. Orbán shared a montage of footage of the visit on his Instagram feed, which included an image of him and his staff meeting with Trump and the former president's aides in a scene that looked like an official bilateral meeting.\nTrump also met briefly in February with Javier Milei, the fiery, right-wing populist president of Argentina who ran a campaign inspired by Trump, complete with red \"Make Argentina Great Again\" hats. Milei gave Trump an excited hug backstage at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, according to video posted by a Trump campaign aide.\nBiden administration officials have been careful not to weigh in publicly on foreign leaders' meetings with Trump, acknowledging he has a real chance of winning the race.\nWhile some officials have privately expressed frustration with such meetings, they are mindful that any criticism would open the U.S. to charges of hypocrisy because senior American officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, meet frequently with foreign opposition figures at various forums in the United States and abroad.\nSecurity and policy officials monitor the travel plans of foreign officials visiting the U.S., but generally don't have a say in where they go or with whom they meet, according to an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss protocol.\nTrump has been back in his hometown this week for the start of his criminal hush money trial, which has dramatically limited his ability to travel and campaign. While in town, aides have been planning a series of events that began Tuesday evening when Trump, after court adjourned, stopped by a Harlem bodega where a man was killed to rail against crime and blast the district attorney who made him the first former president in U.S. history to stand criminal trial.\nTrump-Duda as \"friends\"\nDuda, a right-wing populist who once proposed naming a military base in his country \"Fort Trump,\" described the dinner earlier Wednesday as a private get-together between friends at Trump's former residence while he is in town for meetings at the United Nations, where Duda is to deliver a speech.\n\"I have been invited by Mr. Donald Trump to his private apartment,\" Duda told reporters, saying it was \"a normal practice when one country has good relations with another country\" to want those relations to be as strong as \"possible with the representatives of various sides of the political stage.\"\n\"We know each other as people. Like two, I can say in some way, friends,\" said Duda, whose term ends in 2025.\nDuda's visit comes as House Republicans wrangle over a $95 billion foreign aid bill that would provide new funding to Ukraine, including money for the U.S. military to replace depleting weapon supplies. Polish leaders have been urging the House to approve the aid bill and ease domestic concerns.\nMany Trump allies in the House are fiercely opposed to aiding Ukraine, even as the country warns that it's struggling amid a fresh Russian offensive. Trump has said he might be open to aid in the form of a loan.\nOne area where Trump and Duda agree when it comes to the conflict is a desire to push NATO members to increase their defense spending. Duda has called on fellow members of the alliance to raise their spending to 3% of gross domestic product as Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine. That would represent a significant increase from the current commitment of 2% by 2024.\nTrump, in a stunning break from U.S. precedent, has long been critical of the Western alliance and has threatened not to defend member nations that do not hit that spending goal. That threat strikes at the heart of the alliance's Article 5, which states that any attack against one NATO member will be considered an attack against all.\nIn February, Trump went even further, recounting that he'd once told leaders that he would \"encourage\" Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to members that are - in his words - \"delinquent.\"\nTrump's campaign said the two discussed the NATO proposal during the meeting. The two also discussed Israel and the Middle East, Trump's 2017 trip to Warsaw \"and many other topics having to do with getting to world peace,\" the campaign said in its readout, which described the men as \"great friends.\"\nThe visit was met with mixed reaction in Poland, where fears of Russia run high and Duda's friendly relationship with Trump has been a source of controversy.\nPoland's centrist Prime Minister Donald Tusk, a political opponent of Duda, was critical of the dinner but expressed hope that Duda would use it as an opportunity \"to raise the issue of clearly siding with the Western world, democracy and Europe in this Ukrainian-Russian conflict.\"",

            "excerpt": "CBS News Confirmed examines three viral claims that have emerged so far during Trump's first criminal trial.",
            "summary": "As former President Donald Trump's historic criminal trial gets underway in New York this week, the CBS News Confirmed team has been tracking potentially misleading narratives that have gained some traction on social media. Here are three of the viral claims that have emerged during the trial so far and what to know about them.\nClaim 1: Judge Juan Merchan won't let Trump go to his son's graduation\nOn Monday, Trump posted to his nearly 7 million followers on Truth Social that Judge Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the trial, likely will not allow him to go to his 18-year-old son Barron's graduation in May.\n\"Who will explain for me, to my wonderful son, Barron, who is a GREAT Student at a fantastic School, that his Dad will likely not be allowed to attend his Graduation Ceremony, something that we have been talking about for years,\" Trump wrote in a post that had garnered over 18,000 likes by Tuesday.\nThe claim was echoed by others online, including his son Eric Trump, who posted on X that \"Judge Merchan is truly heartless in not letting a father attend his son's graduation.\"\nThe facts\nJudge Merchan has not yet made any decision about whether Trump can attend his son's graduation. But on Monday, he signaled that he's open to it, although it is also possible that if the trial is behind schedule, he will not allow it. In an excerpt from the court transcript obtained by CBS News' Graham Kates, Judge Merchan said this:\nRegarding counsel's request that the Court adjourn on Friday, May 17th for Mr. Trump to attend his son's high school graduation and Friday June 3rd to allow a member of the defense team to attend their son's graduation, I cannot rule on those two requests at this time. It really depends on how we are doing on time and where we are in the trial. If everything is going according to schedule without unnecessary delays, then I am sure we will be able to adjourn for one or both of those days, but if we are running behind schedule, we will not be able to.\nClaim 2: Stormy Daniels denies having an affair with Trump\nIn a tweet from April 10 flagged by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg on Monday as a potential violation of Trump's gag order, Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"Look what was just found! Will the fake news report it?\" The post included a picture of a 2018 letter written by adult film star Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, which included the statement, \"I am denying this affair because it never happened.\"\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican operative Roger Stone, and others shared the same picture in posts on X that attracted over 60,000 \"likes.\"\nThe facts\nAlthough it was presented by Trump as being new, this letter from Daniels has been public knowledge since January 2018 — and she has since recanted it. A few months after she signed her name to it, in March 2018, Daniels went on \"60 Minutes\" to say she had been pressured into signing and releasing the letter by former Trump attorney Michael Cohen and others. Daniels said that she did have an affair with Trump.\nHere's what she said on \"60 Minutes\" to correspondent Anderson Cooper:\nAnderson Cooper: So you signed and released — a statement that said, 'I am not denying this affair because I was paid in hush money. I'm denying it because it never happened.' That's a lie?\nStormy Daniels: Yes.\nAnderson Cooper: If it was untruthful, why did you sign it?\nStormy Daniels: Because they made it sound like I had no choice.\nShe went on to tell Cooper that she felt there might be legal repercussions for not signing the letter.\n\"The exact sentence used was, 'They can make your life hell in many different ways,'\" she said. She believed \"they\" in that case was Michael Cohen.\nClaim 3: Trump's gag order is unconstitutional\nTrump posted on Truth Social Monday, \"This Crooked Judge has GAGGED me. Unconstitutional! The other side can talk about me, but I am not allowed to talk about them!\" The claim was later echoed by others on social media.\nThe facts\nJudge Merchan's April 1 gag order prohibits Trump from speaking about witnesses, court staff, the family members of court staff, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's family, or Judge Merchan's family. The judge said the order was necessary because some of Trump's rhetoric might keep jurors, lawyers and court employees from performing their duties in the court.\n\"This pattern of attacking family members of presiding jurists and attorneys assigned to [Trump's] cases serves no legitmate purpose,\" Merchan wrote of Trump in the gag order. \"It merely injects fear in those assigned or called to participate in the proceedings, that not only they, but their family members as well, are 'fair game' for Defendant's vitriol.\"\nTrump is still allowed to criticize Judge Merchan or Bragg. And the former president may talk about the case publicly and call the trial political if he wishes.\nMany legal experts argue Judge Merchan's gag order is lawful and doesn't interfere with Trump's First Amendment rights. Duncan Levin, who worked in the district attorney's office before Bragg, told Politifact that gag orders \"with very limited exceptions have long been found not to violate the First Amendment… [Trump] is free to discuss the criminal justice system but not to make ad hominem attacks on particular people associated with the case.\"\nHowever, Trump's lawyers have challenged the order and said it is unconstitutional because it curbs his free speech rights. Trump's request to lift the order will now go to a five-judge panel for consideration.",

They were part of an initial batch of 96 residents who were asked, in bulk, if they could be impartial while deciding a case involving Trump. More than half of that group said they could not and were immediately excused. The remaining people were whittled down through questioning from lawyers and the judge, Juan Merchan.\nSome had scheduling issues that might have conflicted with serving on jury for a trial that could last up to two months, while others later concluded — after spending hours in the room with Trump and hearing about the case — that they couldn't be impartial, either. More than two dozen answered, one at a time and out loud, a 42-question assessment designed to help the lawyers glean their feelings about Trump and ability to fairly decide the case.\nFinally, a smaller group was questioned individually as consultants for the lawyers pored through their online lives. Some were confronted by Trump's attorneys with social media posts dating back years before they were excused. Each side in the case is allowed 10 peremptory challenges, enabling them to excuse a potential juror without explanation, and there are an unlimited number of \"for cause\" challenges, which call for a person to be excused if there's a clear conflict.\nFormer President Donald Trump leads Polish President Andrzej Duda as he arrives at Trump Tower on April 17, 2024, in New York City.\nMichael M Santiago / Getty Images\nWith a new batch of 96 Manhattanites set to be considered Thursday, there are five jurors yet to be seated, and each side has four peremptories remaining. The attorneys will also select up to six alternate jurors, and the two sides will receive five more peremptory challenges during that process.\nTrump entered a not guilty plea after he was indicted more than a year ago on 34 felony counts of falsification of business records. He denies all allegations in the case, which revolves around reimbursements to former attorney Michael Cohen, for a \"hush money\" payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Prosecutors say Trump covered up the reimbursements in order to distance himself from the payment, which days before the 2016 presidential election temporarily bought Daniels' silence about an alleged affair. Trump has also denied having the affair.\nTrump has raged against the case, accusing prosecutors of charging him for political reasons. He has also frequently lashed out at the judge on social media, accusing Merchan of bias. But in the courtroom, Trump has been largely quiet and reserved, even appearing to nod off from time to time.\nStill, Merchan had to warn Trump on Tuesday about \"audibly uttering something … speaking in the direction of the juror\" under questioning at the time about one of her social media posts.\n\"I won't tolerate that. I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom. I want to make that crystal clear,\" Merchan said.",

Engoron held that as \"the trier of fact, I find [Trump's] testimony rings hollow and untrue.\"\nHe also plans to introduce that Trump was found in his civil fraud case to have \"repeatedly and persistently falsified business records, conspired to falsify business records, issued fake financial statements, conspired to issue false financial statements and conspired to commit insurance fraud,\" according to Bragg's filing.\nTrump has denied all allegations in the civil fraud case and is appealing. He has accused attorneys and prosecutors in each of these cases of pursuing him for political gain.\nTrump told reporters on March 25 that he \"would have no problem testifying\" at the trial.\n\"Well, it could also make me more popular because the people know it's a scam,\" he said.\nHowever, choosing not to testify cannot be held against him.

Elsewhere, a different judge denied a last-ditch effort by Trump to halt the proceedings and get the trial moved out of Manhattan.\nBut the events inside the courtroom were briefly overshadowed by a shocking turn of events outside, where a man lit himself on fire at a park across the street shortly after the jury was finalized.\nPolice officials said the man, later identified as Max Azzarello, walked into the park, opened a backpack and scattered papers and pamphlets on the ground. He then poured what appeared to be a liquid accelerant on his head and ignited himself. Footage from the scene showed flames shooting high in the air before emergency personnel extinguished the blaze. He was rushed away on a stretcher and taken to a nearby hospital, where officials said he was in critical condition.\nAn account on the platform Substack that appeared to belong to Azzarello posted a rambling statement regarding a wide range of conspiracy theories before Azzarello set himself ablaze. The pamphlets Azzarello dropped on the ground were unrelated to Trump or his criminal case.\nThe incident cast a sobering pall over the rest of the day's proceedings, which saw prosecutors and attorneys for Trump argued over what the former president could be asked about if he chooses to take the stand in his own defense.\nDay 4 of the Trump trial\nFormer President Donald Trump attends the fourth day of jury selection for his trial in New York on April 19, 2024.Friday got underway with both sides resuming questioning of potential alternates who said they could remain impartial. Several were dismissed after saying they were suffering from anxiety or no longer believed they could judge the case fairly.\nThose concerns arose one day after two jurors who had previously been seated were excused. One said she became concerned about her ability to be impartial after people in her life figured out she was a juror based on details reported about her in the press. Another was dismissed after prosecutors discovered legal issues that hadn't been disclosed.\nQuestioning of the remaining potential alternates continued into Friday afternoon until all five seats were filled.\nThe court then proceeded to a pretrial hearing to discuss the topics prosecutors would be allowed to broach if Trump decides to take the stand.\nProsecutors indicated in a filing made public Wednesday that they want to question Trump about a host of high-profile legal defeats to attack his credibility. The list includes an almost half-billion-dollar civil fraud judgment recently handed down in another New York court, a pair of unanimous civil federal jury verdicts finding him liable for defamation and sexual abuse of the writer E. Jean Carroll, gag order violations, and sanctions for what a judge concluded was a \"frivolous, bad faith lawsuit\" against Hillary Clinton.\nTrump's attorneys believe all those topics should be out of bounds in this case, which revolves around reimbursements to former Trump attorney Michael Cohen for a \"hush money\" payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Prosecutors say Trump covered up the reimbursements in order to distance himself from the payment, days before the 2016 presidential election, which temporarily bought Daniels' silence about an alleged affair. He has also denied having the affair.\nTrump has entered a not guilty plea to 34 felony counts of falsification of business records. He has denied all allegations in the case.\nThe judge delayed a ruling on what topics Trump could be asked about, saying he would make a decision on Monday.\n11th-hour appeal\nAs Merchan weighed that issue, Trump attorney Clifford Robert was at a different New York courthouse, arguing to a mid-level appeals court judge that the jury selection process revealed that Manhattan is too biased to host a fair trial, and that the process was conducted too quickly.\n\"I think to state the obvious, to think that a jury could be selected in three days, even in what I'd call a garden-variety felony case in New York, would be unusual,\" said Robert, who also represents Trump's sons in a separate civil fraud case.\nRobert called Trump's New York criminal case \"one of the most consequential cases in, if not New York, this country's history\" and asked the judge to pause the case while Trump pursues a change of venue.\nThe effort was the second time in two weeks that Trump had gone to the Appellate Division, First Department to seek a stay. Steven Wu, a lawyer for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, said that was reason enough to reject the effort, since defendants are only allowed to make that request once.\nRobert noted that more than two-thirds of potential jurors said they could not be impartial and were dismissed. Wu countered, saying the dismissal rate was proof the system was weeding out people who shouldn't serve on the jury.\n\"What it is showing is jury selection works,\" Wu said.\nWu also defended the pace of the process, noting the potential jurors answered a 42-prompt questionnaire that was \"much longer than the usual questionnaire given.\" He said the 30 minutes given to each side to question potential jurors was also much longer than the norm.\nRobert cited one of the seated jurors who asked to be excused Thursday, the woman who expressed concerns about being identified through media reports. He said it was more proof Manhattan was the wrong venue.\nWu said Trump himself \"amplified and stoked the very press coverage\" that led to her departure. He pointed to a social media post by Trump that he said was a veiled reference to that juror.\nThe judge, Marsha Michael, quickly denied the stay request, without explanation.",

            "summary": "Prosecutors and attorneys for former President Donald Trump will meet a new cohort of Manhattan residents Thursday, as they enter the third day of jury selection in Trump's New York criminal trial.\nSeven New Yorkers were selected on Tuesday, or Day Two, to serve as jurors in the first criminal trial of a former president in U.S. history. They were part of an initial batch of 96 residents who were first asked, in bulk, to identify themselves and if they believed they could be impartial while deciding a case involving Trump. More than half of that group said they could not and were immediately excused. The remaining people were whittled down through questioning from lawyers and the judge, Juan Merchan.\nSome had scheduling issues that might conflict with serving on a trial that could last up to two months, while others later concluded — after spending hours in the room with Trump and hearing about the case — that they, too, couldn't be impartial. More than two dozen answered, one at a time and out loud, a 42-question assessment designed to help the lawyers glean their feelings about Trump and ability to fairly decide the case.\nFinally, a smaller group was questioned individually as consultants for the lawyers pored through their online lives. Some were confronted by Trump's attorneys with social media posts dating back years before they were excused. Each side in the case is allowed 10 peremptory challenges, enabling them to excuse a potential juror without explanation, and there are an unlimited number of \"for cause\" challenges, which call for a person to be excused if there's a clear conflict.\nRepublican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump leads Polish President Andrzej Duda as he arrives at Trump Tower on April 17, 2024 in New York City.\nMichael M Santiago / Getty Images\nWith a new batch of 96 Manhattanites set to be considered Thursday, there are five jurors yet to be seated, and each side has six peremptories remaining. The attorneys will also select up to six alternate jurors, and the two sides will receive five more peremptory challenges during that process.\nTrump entered a not guilty plea after he was indicted more than a year ago on 34 felony counts of falsification of business records. He denies all allegations in the case, which revolves around reimbursements to former attorney Michael Cohen, for a \"hush money\" payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Prosecutors say Trump covered up the reimbursements in order to distance himself from the payment, which days before the 2016 presidential election temporarily bought Daniels' silence about an alleged affair. Trump has also denied having the affair.\nTrump has raged against the case, accusing prosecutors of charging him for political reasons. He has also frequently lashed out at the judge on social media, accusing Merchan of bias. But in the courtroom, Trump has been largely quiet and reserved, even appearing to nod off from time to time.\nStill, Merchan had to warn Trump on Tuesday about \"audibly uttering something….speaking in the direction of the juror\" under questioning at the time about one of her social media posts.\n\"I won't tolerate that. I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom. I want to make that crystal clear,\" Merchan said.",

            "summary": "Some members of Congress who led the investigation into former President Donald Trump's role in the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot acknowledge they've talked to their families about their safety — and the risk of their arrest — if Trump wins a second term in November.\nIn a series of interviews with CBS News, House Democrats who helped lead the House Jan. 6 select committee and some of the police witnesses who testified before it predicted they'd be targeted for retribution by a future Trump administration.\nTrump raised the prospect of future arrests of some of the Jan. 6 committee participants in a social media post on March 18. Referring to the panel's vice chair, former Rep. Liz Cheney, Trump wrote, \"She should go to Jail along with the rest of the Unselect Committee!\"\n\"My wife and I have had conversations about what life would look like if the worst happened,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who was one of seven Democrats on the Jan. 6 select committee. Speaking to CBS News near the House chamber between votes last week, Schiff said, \"You can't avoid the conversations about 'What if?' And I have to think about my own personal safety.\"\nRep. Pete Aguilar, who chairs the House Democratic Caucus and was a member of the Jan. 6 committee, told reporters last week that he takes Trump's threat of jailing seriously. But Aguilar, noting the proximity of the Washington, D.C., jail to the U.S. Capitol, smiled and wryly noted, \"My family has told me that they're going to come to D.C. either way — and they'll visit me, no matter where I am.\"\n\"One of the things that I observed during our Jan. 6 committee work was that when Trump says something, he intends to do it,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, another California Democrat who helped lead the panel.\n\"I take that lesson to heart,\" she told CBS News. \"When he says various things, I think that's what he means he'll do.\"\nShe acknowledged she has been harassed by some Trump supporters.\n\"He's going to weaponize the Department of Justice...and use it to go after people like myself,\" former Washington, D.C. police officer Michael Fanone told CBS News. Fanone testified at a 2021 public hearing of the committee and has been an outspoken Trump critic, accusing him of employing authoritarian rhetoric.\n\"He's telling us exactly what he plans on doing,\" Fanone said.\nHarry Dunn, a former U.S. Capitol Police officer who also testified before the select committee, told CBS News, \"Trump means what he says. Anybody who has testified against him, or spoken out in a public capacity, should be worried.\" Dunn, who is seeking the Democratic Party's nomination for a U.S. House seat in Maryland, said the threat of arrest \"is a little scary to think about, but you have to continue to do the right thing.\"\nThe Trump campaign did not respond directly to questions about whether Trump intends to pursue arrests of the Jan. 6 committee members.\n\"Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Liz Cheney, and the Corrupt Democrats on the sham January 6th Committee have lied to the American public for years, denied key witnesses from testifying to the truth, and covered up evidence that proved President Trump, nor any of his supporters, ever engaged in an alleged 'insurrection.' Their entire narrative is a lie and Americas know that Joe Biden is the true threat to democracy,\" a Trump spokeswoman said in a statement to CBS News.\nTrump's March 18 social media post prompted criticism from scholars who study the rhetoric and practices of authoritarian regimes.\n\"This sort of post is not what you want to see out of your political leaders in a healthy democracy,\" said Erica Frantz, a political science professor at Michigan State University. Frantz, who specializes in authoritarian politics, told CBS News that calls by political leaders \"to jail their political opponents are red flags in terms of potential slides to authoritarianism.\"\nFrantz said when political figures talk about jailing some critics, it can have a chilling effect on others.\n\"It's intended to invoke fear among them and deter them from speaking out against Trump,\" she said. \"The more that critics are silenced, the more leaders with authoritarian ambitions are able to get away with their power grab.\"\nThe select committee executed a high-profile investigation of Trump that included a series of nationally televised public hearings. The committee spoke with hundreds of witnesses, including Trump's top White House aides, as it reviewed his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The committee voted to refer criminal charges to the Justice Department for Trump and accused him of threatening the future of democracy and inciting the violent Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol.\nThe committee was disbanded in late 2022, after Republicans won control of the House. Two of its members lost their campaigns for reelection, including Cheney. Two others retired from the House.\nSome committee members have reported being targeted by threats and harassment by Trump supporters.\nOne senior U.S. House aide said a presidential candidate's threats to jail legislators for public speech and legislative work also run afoul of the Speech and Debate Clause, which protect the independence of Congress.\nOne senior U.S. House aide said a presidential candidate's threats to jail legislators for public speech and legislative work also run afoul of the Speech and Debate Clause, which protect the independence of Congress.\nIn remarks to reporters last week, Aguilar said Trump's ongoing rhetoric raises the risk of continued harassment, threats and danger to public officials. Aguilar said, \"Trump wants to act like those dictators he hosts at Mar-a-Lago. That's difficult rhetoric, and it's not anything that any of us, any of the members under this Dome take lightly.\"",

            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump's allies have been encouraging foreign countries to send diplomats and official emissaries to Mar-a-Lago to reconnect ahead of another potential Trump stint in the White House, sources with direct knowledge of the meetings confirmed to CBS News.\nTrump advisers and allies believe he'll be able to capitalize on the decline in Americans' approval of President Joe Biden's foreign policy decisions. An April CBS News poll found that only 33% of Americans approve of Mr. Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict, down from 44% in October.\nIt is rare for foreign ambassadors and ministers to meet with the presumptive GOP presidential nominee half a year before the presidential election and suggests that they're laying the groundwork for another Trump administration.\n\"The biggest handle Biden had on Trump was that this guy is unpredictable, especially on the world stage,\" said Terry Sullivan, who ran Sen. Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign. \"When you take your opponent's strength and your personal weakness and turn them on their head, that's a big move.\"\nThe 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Sen. Mitt Romney, implemented a similar strategy of meeting foreign leaders shortly before he won the GOP presidential nomination in 2012. On a trip to London for a fundraiser that year, Romney met with several British leaders. At the time, CBS News chief political analyst John Dickerson told \"CBS This Morning\" that Romney's campaign had calibrated his talking points about the meetings to project a presidential aura.\n\"It's something every campaign does to some degree if they can get away with it and show they have gravitas and can handle major foreign policy situations,\" said Sullivan, who also worked on Romney's earlier presidential bid in 2008 and is now a CBS News contributor.\nForeign leaders have made stops at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Florida club, too. The former president recently hosted British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, whose spokesperson said it was \"standard practice for ministers to meet with opposition candidates as part of their routine international engagement.\" The two spoke about the war in Ukraine, NATO spending and upcoming elections, according to the Trump campaign.\nBut unlike recent presidential nominees, Trump has also hosted controversial foreign leaders. The willingness by some Trump advisers to contact these foreign governments reflects the approach another Trump administration could take on foreign policy.\nLast month, the former president hosted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, the closest European Union ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, at Mar-a-Lago. The two also discussed the war in Ukraine, Orban later told state media.\nFormer President Donald Trump with Hungarian President Viktor Orbán.\nScreenshot from Orbán Facebook video\nMr. Biden reacted swiftly, criticizing the rendezvous on the day it took place.\n\"You know who he's meeting with today down at Mar-a-Lago? Orbán of Hungary, who stated flatly he doesn't think democracy works. He's looking for dictatorship,\" Mr. Biden said at a rally near Philadelphia. \"That's who he's meeting with.\"\nTrump also spoke recently with Saudi Arabia's Prince Mohammed bin Salman, The New York Times reported, who was found by U.S. intelligence to have signed off on killing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi,\" a longtime U.S. resident and Washington Post journalist.\nThe former president has also spoken with government officials from other Western countries, including Finland last year, a source familiar with the conversations told CBS News.\nThe outreach by Trump's allies to foreign dignitaries was first reported by Politico.\nIn a CBS News national poll in March, Trump was leading Mr. Biden, as voters remembered the economy under Trump as being better than it is under the president. The Biden campaign and Democratic National Committee are trying to close the gap by exploiting their considerable financial advantage over the Trump campaign and Republican Party, placing multimillion-dollar ad buys in key battleground states.",

            "summary": "Opening statements are set to begin this morning in former President Donald Trump's criminal trial in New York. Prosecutors will begin laying out their case for jurors, alleging Trump falsified business records to cover up a \"hush money\" payment during his 2016 campaign, while defense attorneys are expected to argue Trump has been charged on flimsy evidence from an untrustworthy key witness.\nIt's a moment nearly eight years in the making, dating back to the fall of 2016, just days before the election, when that witness, Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen, paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence about an alleged sexual encounter. Prosecutors say Trump reimbursed Cohen for the payment in 12 monthly installments during the first year of his presidency, portraying them as checks for ongoing legal services in a scheme to conceal the \"hush money.\" Trump was charged last year with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\nTrump, who has entered a not guilty plea in the case, denies having had a sexual encounter and has called the case a \"witch hunt\" and \"election interference.\"\nHe seethed about the case last week as the trial got underway with jury selection. Trump lashed out at Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg in public appearances and posted about Bragg, Judge Juan Merchan and Cohen on social media. But inside the courtroom, Trump was reserved, speaking rarely and even appearing to nod off from time to time, as 192 potential jurors were narrowed to a dozen, plus six alternates.\nThat group is the first panel of jurors in U.S. history to sit in judgment of a former president in a criminal case.\nFormer President Donald Trump sits in Manhattan Criminal Court for his trial for allegedly covering up hush money payments, on April 19, 2024.\n/ Getty Images\nAfter opening statements, prosecutors are expected to call as their first witness David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer.\nHe's expected to testify that he, Cohen and Trump orchestrated a \"catch and kill\" scheme, in which Pecker's publication purchased the rights to negative stories about Trump and suppressed them, while publishing unflattering stories about Trump's opponents.",

            "summary": "When order is called in room 1530 of the Manhattan Criminal Court at about 9:30 ET on Monday morning, it will mark the beginning of an event never before seen in American history: a former president on trial for alleged crimes.\nFlanked by his attorneys, Secret Service agents and key campaign staff, Donald Trump will be seated on the left side of the largest courtroom in the 83-year-old building, at a table where countless defendants before him have appeared.\nThe case is the first of four criminal prosecutions against Trump to make it to trial. He faces charges in two federal cases brought by special counsel Jack Smith in Washington, D.C., and Florida, and in a second state case brought by prosecutors in Georgia. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges, claiming the prosecutions are part of a plot by his political opponents aimed at keeping him from retaking the White House.\nMonday's proceedings will begin with Trump's lawyers and prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office arguing over some outstanding issues related to trial rules. Then, the first of more than 500 potential jurors will be escorted into the room. By that point, many will have noticed the extraordinary security apparatus outside and within the courthouse, as well as anticipated demonstrators for and against Trump. In Trump's recent civil defamation trial just a block away, several would-be jurors appeared visibly shocked when they first saw him sitting at the defense table.\nJudge Juan Manuel Merchan's courtroom at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York, seen on March 12, 2024.\nANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images\nMany will be able to see Trump and observe any of his reactions while the judge describes the case. The allegations, New York State Justice Juan Merchan is expected to say, \"are, in substance, that Donald Trump falsified business records to conceal an agreement with others to unlawfully influence the 2016 presidential election.\"\nHe'll continue by mentioning the names of two well-known key witnesses in the case, both of whom Trump considers archnemeses: his former attorney Michael Cohen, and the adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\"Specifically, it is alleged that Donald Trump made or caused false business records to hide the true nature of payments made to Michael Cohen, by characterizing them as payment for legal services rendered pursuant to a retainer agreement,\" Merchan will say, according to pretrial court filings. \"The [prosecutors] allege that in fact, the payments were intended to reimburse Michael Cohen for money he paid to Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, in the weeks before the presidential election to prevent her from publicly revealing details about a past sexual encounter with Donald Trump.\"\nAs a criminal defendant, Trump is required to attend proceedings each day of the trial unless he applies for a waiver. He'll watch on Monday, and likely several more days, as his lawyers and prosecutors seek to whittle the group of potential jurors down to just 12, plus a few alternates. The two sides will then begin presenting their cases.\nTrump has entered a not guilty plea to 34 counts of falsification of business records. He has accused Bragg of bringing the case for political gain.In a letter to members of Congress last year, a lawyer for Bragg hit back at that accusation, saying \"were brought by citizens of New York, doing their civic duty as members of a grand jury, who found probable cause to accuse Mr. Trump of having committed crimes in New York.\"",

I left for the courthouse around 6:30 a.m. on the first day of the trial.\nWhenever Trump is at the courthouse, or moving in and out of the courtroom, we are frozen in place, unable to leave our seats.\nI'll have a guaranteed seat in the main courtroom for most of the trial, but during jury selection all but six reporters are in the overflow room because prospective jurors take up all available seats in the main courtroom.\nIn overflow, we have a video monitor with four different feeds. The six rotating pool reporters tell us what we can't see happening in the main courtroom.\nWe can see the defense table, a sideview of the defense table, the prosecution table and the judge in overflow, but we cannot see prospective jurors.\nAll of those angles are up at once on the screen, so I brought binoculars to get a better look at people's faces.\nDid Trump fall asleep?\nOn the first day, some journalists and sketch artists said Trump appeared to have his eyes closed. Was he dozing off?\nSince bringing binoculars, I've seen Trump sitting with his eyes closed for stretches of time. I've seen it while they were going over outstanding issues with the judge in the morning and when jurors have given answers to the 42-question questionnaire.\nTrump looks at some prospective jurors, those being questioned individually by attorneys, and pays attention.\nFormer President Donald Trump sits as final jurors are sworn in during his criminal trial on charges that he falsified business records to conceal money paid to silence porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016, in Manhattan state court in New York, Friday, April 19, 2024, in this courtroom sketch. (Jane Rosenberg via AP, Pool)\nJane Rosenberg / AP\nThe former president was scolded by the judge for allegedly gesturing in the direction of a juror and saying something audibly, although we could not see this in overflow nor could we hear it. He has not done it since.\nLunchbreak and reporting for the evening news\nI don't leave the building during the lunchbreak, due to the security screenings and needing to be back in my seat before Trump returns to the courtroom.\nInstead, I try to find a hallway with an outlet to charge my devices. Then I get back on the security line.\nI usually stay in the courthouse until late afternoon. Then I go outside and meet up with my crew to finish my story for the evening news.\nI do live reports for CBS2 News at 5 p.m., and sometimes 6 p.m. I've also done a Q&A with WCBS Newsradio 880.\nNext week, I'll be back to cover opening statements.",

            "summary": "Former first lady Melania Trump is making a return to her husband's presidential campaign with a rare political appearance after months of being absent from Donald Trump's latest run for the White House.\nShe plans to attend a fundraiser Saturday for the Log Cabin Republicans, an advocacy group for LGBTQ+ members of the GOP. The event at the Palm Beach, Florida, estate that she shares with the former president is scheduled to take place behind closed doors. It will be the first major political event for her this year.\nMelania Trump had for months not appeared at her husband's campaign events, notably being absent at his victory party on Super Tuesday. Her attendance at the fundraiser — for a group she has previously supported — could be a sign that she will ramp up her schedule with several months left before the November election.\nBoth Trumps went together to cast their ballots in the Florida primary last month. When a reporter asked if she would return to the campaign trail, she responded with a smile, \"Stay tuned.\"\nThe former first lady then attended a high-profile fundraiser at hedge-fund billionaire John Paulson's house in Palm Beach, where she was photographed with her husband in front of the mansion facing the ocean.\nThe Log Cabin Republicans group describes itself on its website as the county's \"largest organization representing LGBT conservatives and straight allies who support fairness, freedom, and equality for all Americans.\" Melania Trump was a special guest and award recipient of the organization's Spirit of Lincoln award in 2021 at a dinner hosted at Mar-a-Lago.\nThe Log Cabin Republicans on Friday posted on X thanking Melania Trump for her message in a Fox News Digital interview.\n\"We must unite in our effort to establish a society where equality is the everyday experience of every American,\" Melania Trump said in the interview.\nIn a 2020 endorsement of the former president for his reelection bid, the Log Cabin Republicans described Trump as having a \"commitment to govern from a place of inclusion.\" In this endorsement, the group praised Trump for his \"commitment to end the spread of HIV/AIDS\" and his initiative to \"end the criminalization of homosexuality internationally.\"\nYet critics often criticize Trump's record on LGBTQ+ issues. During his presidency, he nominated judges for the U.S. Supreme Court, including Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, who were criticized by liberal advocates for LGBTQ+ people.\nTrump also faced national criticism in 2017 when he announced transgender people were barred from military service, when about 15,000 transgender people were enlisted at the time. In 2019, he barred U.S. embassies from displaying the rainbow or pride flag during Pride Month.\nThroughout his campaign, Trump has repeatedly mocked transgender people using language of gender identity that LGBTQ+ critics call harmful. He has acted out a young athlete struggling to lift heavy barbells compared with other competitors \"who transitioned.\"\nIn campaign speeches he has touted his promise to cut federal funding on schools pushing what he calls \"transgender insanity.\"\nSome additional promises Trump has made in his rallies include prohibiting federal money going to hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to minors, or ending any program that promotes sex or gender transition. He has also promised that he'd push Congress to ban chemical or surgical interventions on minors.",

            "summary": "Truth Social insider trading\nTruth Social insider trading\nBrothers plead guilty to insider trading after Trump's Truth Social goes public\n02:00\nAfter a short-lived honeymoon, former President Donald Trump's media company is experiencing a rough reception on Wall Street. Trump Media & Technology Group — which trades under the ticker DJT, his initials — tumbled 18.4% in Monday trading, a drop that follows last week's 21% plunge.\nThe sharp drop in value comes after Trump Media, whose primary asset is Truth Social, the social media platform, on Monday filed a document with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that opens the door for the future potential sale of millions of shares. The document, called an S-1, relates to warrants held by investors that can be transformed into shares of stock, as well as shares held by company insiders.\nThe filing also includes all the shares held by the former president. Trump, however, remains under a \"lockup\" deal that largely restricts him from selling his shares for another roughly five months. His son, Donald Trump Jr., who is a director on the board, and CEO Devin Nunes, are also bound by the lockup.\nThe stock plunge has erased billions from Trump's stake — at least on paper. The shares soared when they began trading on March 26, giving Trump's 57% ownership position a value of $6.25 billion. But after DJT's recent slump, that stake is worth $2.1 billion, representing a paper loss of $4.15 billion.\nOverall, shareholders have lost $7.2 billion in value since the stock touched a high of $79.38 on March 26. The shares tumbled $5.98, or 18.4%, to $26.61 on Monday.\nWhen companies issue additional shares, they take on the risk of their stock price coming under downward pressure. That's due, in part, to simple laws of supply and demand — with more stock available, a company's share price tends to fall unless there's a commensurate increase in demand.\nSo far, the former president's supporters comprise a significant part of the company's investor base, with Trump Media CEO Nunes praising their support on Fox Business earlier this month. On Truth Social, some investors said they believed the stock would recover, while others said they were taking advantage of the stock's plunge to buy more shares.\n\"Bought more today just like a lot of you,\" one member of a Truth Social group dedicated to DJT shares wrote on Monday. \"I believe time is our friend. Half a year until election. I can definitely hold until then at the minimum.\"\nOther supporters on Truth Social noted that the Monday filing doesn't necessarily mean Trump plans to sell any of his 57% ownership stake in Trump Media.\n\"Trump has NOT signaled intentions to sell his shares,\" wrote Chad Nedohin, a pastor and musician, on Truth Social on Monday. \"There is no new unexpected issuance of new shares. The increase in total shares in the S-1 is for the warrants.\"\nS-1 filings are typically filed quickly after a SPAC deal closes, usually within 15 or 30 days, said Kristi Marvin, founder of SPACInsider.com, which specializes in SPAC deals.\nTrump Media & Technology Group didn't immediately return a request for comment.\n200,000 new retail investors\nTrump, who relies on Truth Social as his primary social media platform, has about 7 million followers on the app, where he frequently blasts his critics and promotes favorable polls. He's also turned to Truth Social to rail about his criminal trial, which began Monday, over accusations of falsifying business records related to a \"hush money\" payment.\nAbout 600,000 retail investors have bought shares in Trump Media & Technology group, with about 200,000 of them buying into the stock within the last few weeks, Nunes told Fox Business earlier this month. He called these small investors \"the most amazing part about our company.\"\nThose investors have had a wild ride since the stock began trading as DJT on March 26. The shares soared on its first two days of trading, but have since shed more than two-thirds of their value.\nSuch swings have prompted comparisons with so-called \"meme\" stocks like GameStop, which typically attract individual investors based on social media buzz, rather than traditional metrics favored by investors, such as revenue and profit growth.\nLast year, Trump Media lost $58 million on revenue of $4.1 million — about half the annual sales booked by a single Chick-fil-A location.\n—With reporting by the Associated Press.",

            "summary": "Jury selection in former President Donald Trump's historic criminal trial in New York is continuing for a second day on Tuesday, when the process of seating potential jurors resumes as the defendant looks on.\nThe first batch of jurors were sworn in on Monday after pretrial arguments over evidence and rules for the proceedings. Roughly two thirds of the group of 96 New Yorkers were quickly dismissed, with most of them saying they wouldn't be able to be fair and impartial in the trial. Others were excused for various other reasons, including their answers to a list of questions posed to each juror. The slow process of identifying suitable jurors is likely to last at least a week.\nSeveral more jurors were sent home when Tuesday's session got underway. One woman was dismissed with flu-like symptoms. Several others said they couldn't be fair or impartial, including a man who moved to Manhattan from Texas and said he got his news from Fox News and Barstool Sports, among other sources. He said it was \"going to be hard for me to be impartial,\" since many of his family and friends growing up were Republicans. Judge Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the case, thanked him for his candor and excused him.\nProsecutors and defense attorneys may also briefly argue, without jurors present, over what topics the state can question Trump about if he chooses to testify in his own defense later in the trial.\nTrump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, is charged with 34 state felony counts of falsification of business records related to a \"hush money\" payment his attorney made to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges, claiming the prosecution is part of a plot by Democrats aimed at preventing him from retaking the White House. The case is the first of four criminal prosecutions against Trump to make it to trial.\nEntering the courtroom on Tuesday, Trump called the trial a \"sham\" and said the charges should have been dismissed.\n\"This is a trial that should never happen. It should have been thrown out a long time ago,\" he told reporters.\nFormer President Donald Trump sits in the courtroom as he awaits the start of the second day of his criminal trial at Manhattan Criminal Court on April 16, 2024.\nJUSTIN LANE / Getty Images\nThe first day of the trial also featured a series of rulings by Merchan. He sided with prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office on several matters, and ruled for Trump's attorneys on other questions.\nAt several points during Monday morning's pretrial arguments, Trump appeared to fall asleep at the defense table, his chin dropping to his chest briefly. In one instance, he was stirred awake by his attorney.\nThe trial is expected to last between six and eight weeks, convening every weekday except Wednesdays, with some shortened days for the Passover holiday. The schedule severely limits Trump's ability to hit the campaign trail, which he has cited to support his claims of political bias.\n\"I should be right now in Pennsylvania, in Florida, in many other states — North Carolina, Georgia — campaigning,\" Trump said Tuesday.\nMerchan made clear that Trump is expected to attend each day of the trial, and said he would face arrest if he fails to appear. He denied a request by defense attorneys to allow Trump to attend Supreme Court arguments over his claim of presidential immunity in one of his federal cases next week.\n\"Your client is a criminal defendant in New York County Supreme Court. He is required to be here. He is not required to be in the Supreme Court. I will see him here next week,\" Merchan told one of Trump's lawyers.",

            "summary": "Jury selection in former President Donald Trump's historic criminal trial in New York will continue for a second day on Tuesday, when the process of seating potential jurors resumes as the defendant looks on.\nThe first batch of jurors were sworn in on Monday after pretrial arguments over evidence and rules for the proceedings. Roughly two thirds of the group of 96 New Yorkers were quickly dismissed, with most of them saying they wouldn't be able to be fair and impartial in the trial. Others were excused for various other reasons, including their answers to a list of questions posed to each juror.\nThe slow process of identifying suitable jurors is likely to last at least a week. More jurors will face questioning when the second day of proceedings kicks off at 9:30 a.m.\nTrump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, is charged with 34 state felony counts of falsification of business records related to a \"hush money\" payment his attorney made to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges, claiming the prosecution is part of a plot by Democrats aimed at preventing him from retaking the White House. The case is the first of four criminal prosecutions against Trump to make it to trial.\nFormer President Donald Trump at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York on Monday, April 15, 2024.\nJeenah Moon/Bloomberg via Getty Images\nThe first day of the trial also featured a series of rulings by Judge Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the case. He sided with prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office on several matters, and ruled for Trump's attorneys on other questions.\nAt several points during Monday morning's pretrial arguments, Trump appeared to fall asleep at the defense table, his chin dropping to his chest briefly. In one instance, he was stirred awake by his attorney.\nThe trial is expected to last between six and eight weeks, convening every weekday except Wednesdays, with some shortened days for the Passover holiday. The schedule severely limits Trump's ability to hit the campaign trail, which he has cited to support his claims of political bias.\nMerchan made clear that Trump is expected to attend each day of the trial, and said he would face arrest if he fails to appear. He denied a request by defense attorneys to allow Trump to attend Supreme Court arguments over his claim of presidential immunity in one of his federal cases next week.\n\"Your client is a criminal defendant in New York County Supreme court. He is required to be here. He is not required to be in the Supreme Court. I will see him here next week,\" Merchan told one of Trump's lawyers.",
