The Interior Department will block oil drilling on over 13 million acres in the Western Arctic, including about 40% of the land of the NPR-A \u2013 a remote area that is home to protected animal species including polar bears and caribou.\nThe reserve is more than 23 million acres of public land and an underground emergency oil supply for the US Navy that was designated in the early 1920s. More recently, it's become the site of the ConocoPhillips-owned Willow project, a controversial oil drilling venture in the Arctic.\npublic land and an underground emergency oil supply for the US Navy that was designated in the early 1920s. More recently, it's become the site of the ConocoPhillips-owned Willow project, a controversial oil drilling venture in the Arctic. When the Biden administration approved Willow in March 2023, it sparked intense backlash among young people on social media, as well as environmental and climate groups. Friday's action could improve President Joe Biden's approval among young voters.\n'These natural wonders demand our protection,' Biden said in a statement. Biden said he was 'proud' of his administration's move to conserve more than 13 million acres in the Western Arctic, but added, 'as the climate crisis imperils communities across the country, more must be done.'\nSome Alaska Natives are critical of the drilling ban across such a significant swath of the NPR-A. It has proved controversial with Alaska's bipartisan congressional delegation, as well as Alaska Native groups who say they depend on the tax revenue from oil drilling to fund schools and basic services.\nIt has proved controversial with Alaska's bipartisan congressional delegation, as well as Alaska Native groups who say they depend on the tax revenue from oil drilling to fund schools and basic services. The final rule 'does not reflect our communities' wishes,' said Voice of the Arctic I\u00f1upiat President Nagruk Harcharek, adding the move 'will hurt the very residents the federal government purports to help by rolling back years of progress, impoverishing our communities, and imperiling our I\u00f1upiaq culture.'\nThe ban will also open the president to attacks from Republicans that he is failing to prioritize American energy independence and is driving up the price of gasoline. But under Biden's tenure, the US is producing more oil than any country in history, CNN Business reported, and gas prices are down $1.35 from their all-time high in June 2022.\nIn addition to protecting a vast amount of the NPR-A on Friday, the Biden administration moved to block the Trump administration-approved Ambler road in the Alaskan wilderness. If built, the road would serve as the access point for a proposed copper mine. The administration signaled it wanted to take 'no action' on the mine, effectively blocking the road's access to federal land.\nIn a statement, Ambler Metals, the company seeking to mine copper in the region, said it was 'deeply disappointed' in Interior's decision. Ambler's managing director Kaleb Froehlich said the move would deprive local communities of jobs and tax revenue and prevent the US 'from developing a domestic supply of minerals that are critical for clean energy technology and national security.'\nThe Alaska announcements cap off a week that saw a flurry of actions from Biden's Interior Department. On Thursday, the department announced a new rule that elevated conservation to put it on equal footing as other public land uses like grazing, mining and other energy development. The new conservation rule covers 245 million acres largely in the Western United States \u2013 about a tenth of the land in the nation.\nNext week, Biden is poised to expand two national monuments in California, CNN previously reported, adding to the several he has already designated throughout his presidency.\nInterior Sec. Deb Haaland said the administration's Alaska conservation announcements 'underscore our commitment to ensure that places too special to develop remain intact for the communities and species that rely on them.'\nIn a statement, Haaland added the move would be big step to safeguard 'the way of life for the Indigenous people who have called this special place home since time immemorial.'\nEnvironmental groups and some indigenous groups applauded Biden's announcements on Alaska conservation as an 'important step.'\n'It's no secret that the Reserve \u2013 a vast region of tundra and wetlands teeming with wildlife \u2013 has frequently landed in the crosshairs of the insatiable fossil fuel industry,' said Earthjustice attorney Jeremy Lieb in a statement. 'We applaud this move and call for even bolder action to keep the fossil fuel industry out of the Arctic, for the sake of the climate and future generations.'\nRosemary Ahtuangaruak, the former mayor of the North Slope village of Nuiqsut, and a staunch opponent of Willow, called upon the Biden administration to build on the protections in a statement, saying it would help Alaska Natives 'continue to sustain and pass along the traditions and activities of our elders for years to come.'\nAhtuangaruak told CNN in a recent interview that construction of infrastructure and ice and gravel roads needed for the Willow project is well underway. Ahtuangaruak fears the project is already impacting an annual caribou migration that's an important source of food for locals.\n'The animals have already begun their migration; we also have animals that get impeded and get stuck on the ice road areas,' Ahtuangaruak told CNN.

Flaco fans posted social media updates every time they sighted him soaring, landing and catching prey, sparking an intense love affair.\nBut then it was over. After a year on the lam, Flaco died after flying into a Manhattan high rise. Crying emojis dominated social media. The reactions almost seemed outsized \u2013 but paying attention to nature will do that to a person. We had come to know Flaco, in a way. A necropsy showed he had also ingested a potentially lethal amount of rat poison.\nThe attention to Flaco's life and death isn't an anomaly. During the pandemic, people who had never been interested in the wildlife in their own backyards began to take notice.\nOwls' popularity has soared in the US along with the number of Americans engaged in birdwatching. A survey by the US Fish and Wildlife Service found a whopping 96 million people now take part in observing or photographing birds in parks or their backyards. That's double the birdwatching going on just eight years ago.\nBut there's something particularly special about owls people seem to appreciate.\n'Maybe it's because they look like us,' says, Denver Holt with the Owl Research Institute.\n'They've got a big head; they have the symmetry of the eyes, nose and mouth,' muses Holt. 'We tend to gravitate to animals with big, round eyes.'\nHolt says owls are one of the most widely recognized groups of animals in the world. 'They have been so since prehistoric times. In the caves of France, there are etchings of owls scratched on the cave walls.'\nAnd, he says, they make such cool sounds - hooting, tooting, and trilling. They help humans with pests, he says, eating an average of six mice or rats a night. And they're beautiful.\n'Often with bright yellow eyes, it's fascinating how these birds can hunt in the dark- their vision is amazing at night,' says David Wiedenfeld, Senior Conservation Scientist with the American Bird Conservancy.\n'If you look at their feather patterns, (they're) very intricate,' Wiedenfeld says. 'Owls have special feathers that are softer than a lot of birds. They make almost no sound in flight,' so they can surprise their prey.\nSadly, many species of owls are declining with some highly threatened, says Wiedenfeld.\nOf 19 owl species found in the United States, more than half are losing populations \u2013 a similar trend to all birds. The biggest reasons are habitat loss from climate change and human land use, collisions (especially during migrations) and pesticides that kill insects and rodents that owls rely on, according to the American Bird Conservancy.\n'We have to start making sure we keep the habitat for the owl,' says Wiedenfeld.\nOld-growth forests are dwindling in the US and Canada because of the high value of timber, a major reason for the huge drop in spotted owl populations, according to the American Bird Conservancy.\npopulations, according to the American Bird Conservancy. Open grasslands are shrinking where the tiny burrowing owl makes its home nesting in underground burrows.\nWhere it was once plentiful, the Burrowing Owl's numbers have plummeted in Florida.\n'Florida is largely turning into condominiums,' Wiedenfeld tells CNN.\nThe lack of open grassland has also impacted the short-eared owl, whose population has decreased an estimated 65 percent since 1970, according to the Audubon Society. 'Much of that grassland is being used for agriculture \u2013 corn, soybeans, wheat,' says Wiedenfeld. The American Bird Conservancy is working with farmers to set aside some undisturbed land for nature.\nwhose population has decreased an estimated 65 percent since 1970, according to the Audubon Society. 'Much of that grassland is being used for agriculture \u2013 corn, soybeans, wheat,' says Wiedenfeld. The American Bird Conservancy is working with farmers to set aside some undisturbed land for nature. People who'd never birdwatched before have flocked to snowy owl sightings over the years, says Holt, the owl researcher. But their future also looks dim.\nThe snowy owl has lost half its population in the past 50 years, according to the State of the Birds 2022 report. Holt has been tracking them for more than three decades in Montana and their breeding grounds in Canada.\nLast year, he and his fellow field researchers found zero nests. 'It's disappointing. Each year you go up with hopes the lemming population is high (their food source) and Snowy Owls will make a rebound. You get there, and you just don't find nests.'\nOwl experts say they don't know exactly what's causing the Snowy Owl's decline, but the American Bird Conservancy says climate change is likely affecting their prey, as well as collisions with vehicles, communications towers, wind turbines and airplanes.\n1. Keep large, older trees\n1. Keep large, older trees Leaving trees is the most important thing people can do for most of the owls, says Wiedenfeld.\nMost owls sleep and roost in tree holes which are often found in older trees. Many, like screech owls, will use big woodpecker holes or a hollow where a branch has broken off. Great horned owls, don't use holes, but build their large nests in trees.\n'A lot of people in suburban areas don't like to leave old trees. They worry about them falling,' says Wiedenfeld. 'But if you have a place where you don't have to worry about safety or buildings, leave them so they can have tree cavities.'\n'There are so many reasons people use to take snags down,' says Holt. 'One of the last things they think about is their importance to wildlife.'\n2. Leave some of yard natural or 'messy'\n2. Leave some of yard natural or 'messy' Many homeowners strive to maintain spotless lawns with no weeds, no leaves, no brush, no mess. But if you want owls or any birds in your backyard, that's not what draws them.\n'Allow there to be some disorder. Allow a few tree snags; leave the corner of your field a little bit weedy,' says Wiedenfeld. 'Try not to have everything mowed as a lawn.'\nAnd, he says, keep a small brush pile in a corner away from your house, if you can.\n'It will benefit birds and makes a place for prey that will help the owls.'\n3. Put up a nest box\n3. Put up a nest box If you're looking for a fun project with the kids, 'a nest box can be a really nice thing to do at home,' says Holt. Owls will often use those boxes for shelter and brooding, especially if there is a lack of tree holes on your property. Then you might get to see baby owls \u2013 talk about cute.\nThe Cornell Lab of Ornithology has a great guide for building nest boxes for many types of owls or birds.\n4. Avoid using pesticides and rodenticides\n4. Avoid using pesticides and rodenticides If you're trying to get rid of rats or mice, owls are the perfect pest control. Poisons may be lethal to rodents, but they also kill the owls and hawks that prey on them.\nAll over the country pest companies continue to use 'second generation rodenticides.' They are anticoagulants which cause vermin to bleed to death.\n'The mice or rats will eat the rodenticide, and then they don't die immediately,' says Wiedenfeld.\n'They wander out into the open, sick from having ingested the poison, and they make an easy target for the owl.'\nAn owl can pick up a lot of poison eating at least four rodents a night, and many more during breeding season.\nIf the poison doesn't kill them, eventually an injury will because they'll bleed to death. 'Any slight injury (to the owl) can cause internal bleeding. It's a pretty horrible death,' Wiedenfeld says.\nThe EPA has banned their use in products sold to individual homeowners, but they are still allowed in the commercial market, including restaurants, farms or any business.\n5. Use bird-safe glass or decals\n5. Use bird-safe glass or decals It's extremely common for birds, like Flaco did, to collide with buildings. The windows on our homes and office buildings reflect the sky and clouds, making it look like safe passage. Collision is one of the leading causes of bird mortality. An estimated one billion birds die this way each year.\nOne way to combat this is with decals for home windows.\nMost are transparent and only birds can see the ultraviolet reflection that wards them off. Many birding groups like American Bird Conservancy are working with developers and state governments to build bird-safe buildings from the start. In fact, Flaco's death spurred the New York State Senate to rename its Bird Safe Buildings Act the FLACO (' Feathered Lives Also Count') Act. If passed, it would require new state buildings (and those significantly altered) to adopt bird-friendly designs.\n6. Become a wildlife volunteer or citizen scientist\n6. Become a wildlife volunteer or citizen scientist Wildlife rescue centers are always looking for volunteers to help with the care of tens of thousands of injured and orphaned animals every year. When it comes to owls, many have been poisoned, hit by cars, hurt in a building collision, or caught up in fish netting and barbed wire.\nOnce they've lost the use of a wing, or sight in an eye, it's hard for them to be released back into the wild.

CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 As Justice Sonia Sotomayor approaches the 15th anniversary of her historic appointment to the Supreme Court, some liberal pundits and lawmakers want her to consider stepping down. They think that Sotomayor's health, and the possibility that Democrats might lose the presidency and the Senate in November, put the future of the court's liberal wing at risk.\nThe worry is that the high court's 6-3 conservative majority could potentially become an emboldened 7-2 majority if former President Donald Trump were elected and filled a vacancy. These critics fear the scenario that played out with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. After resisting calls to retire, Ginsburg died in 2020, which allowed then-President Trump to appoint Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\nThe push for Sotomayor to retire is misguided and deeply flawed. It ignores political reality and reflects ignorance of the lives of people with disabilities. The arrogance of those who want the country's first Latina justice to abdicate her position is exceeded only by their wishful thinking that she will listen to them.\nWhile praising Sotomayor as 'the greatest liberal to sit on the Supreme Court in my adult lifetime,' The Guardian's Mehdi Hasan wonders, 'Why not retire now?' The answer is because the Constitution, which Sotomayor took an oath to uphold, says that justices 'shall hold their offices during good behavior.' Sotomayor's position is a lifetime appointment, not one to be cut short due to political vagaries.\nColumnist Josh Barro writes that Sotomayor's 'age problem can be dealt with very simply by her retiring.' But by modern Supreme Court standards, Sotomayor is relatively young. Consider that Ginsburg served on the court for 27 years and was a four-time cancer survivor before she passed away at 87. Justice John Paul Stevens was 90 when he retired in 2010. Justice Stephen Breyer stepped down in 2022, paving the way for the appointment of Ketanji Brown Jackson, but he was 83 when he did so.\nIn contrast, Sotomayor is only 69. She has yet to reach the average life expectancy for an American (76), for an American woman (79), or for a Hispanic woman (81). Sotomayor's mother lived to be 94.\nEven if Sotomayor stepped down tomorrow, there is no guarantee that President Joe Biden could successfully name her replacement. With Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) in the Senate, it's an open question as to whether Democrats have the votes to confirm a new justice, given that both are centrists with a history of bedeviling establishment leaders with their own agendas. Plus, it's doubtful that Biden would name a successor to Sotomayor who would be as strong a champion of marginalized people.\nBesides, people with type 1 diabetes can live long and healthy lives, so long as they have reliable access to health care and medication. Sotomayor's condition, shared by singer Nick Jonas, Olympians and NFL players, is no reason for her to give up one of the influential posts in the nation.\nThe fact that a few liberal pundits are so comfortable speculating about Sotomayor's medical issues is an insult to the 42 million Americans living with disabilities. Her health is her own business. And aren't progressives usually the ones criticizing conservatives for making decisions about women's bodies?\nUrging Sotomayor's retirement, Hasan and Barro mention her type 1 diabetes, pointing to a report that she travels with a medic. Yet it has not been established that Sotomayor travels with a medic. The HuffPost article cited as a source for this claim states that the Marshals Service incurred costs for traveling with 'baggage (medic),' while noting that this 'could refer to medical personnel or be a more benign reference to medical equipment in the justice's luggage.'\nSome of these same liberal writers declare that it will be better for 'ordinary Latina women' if Sotomayor retires, and that 'Latinas especially, will suffer most' with a more conservative court. No evidence is offered for these sweeping statements. In fact, the Latino community is home to both conservatives and liberals, and Latinas can make up their own minds about what is good for them.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook True, in 2018 paramedics were called to Sotomayor's home when she had a low blood sugar episode. She was treated and then returned to work. But Chief Justice John Roberts was hospitalized in 2020 for a fall and suffered seizures in 1993 and 2007. Justice Clarence Thomas spent a week in the hospital in 2022 for flu-like symptoms. They're still doing their jobs, and so can Sotomayor. In a January public appearance, she described how the impact of the court keeps her going. 'I live in frustration. Every loss truly traumatizes me in my stomach and in my heart,' she said. 'But I have to get up the next morning and keep on fighting.'\nJustice Sotomayor does not serve in fealty to the interests of the Democratic Party. Her responsibility is to the law \u2014 and calls for her retirement are disrespectful and unwarranted.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Opinion Raul A.

He called the climate crisis an 'existential threat' that requires 'full and clear action.'\n'As president, I've seen the devastating toll of climate firsthand,' Biden said, speaking of wildfires, extreme weather and deadly heat. 'Despite the overwhelming devastation in red and blue states, there are still those who deny the climate is in crisis. They want to take us backwards. I'm determined \u2013 absolutely determined [that] we move forward.'\nUnder the Environmental Protection Agency's Solar for All program, the administration announced funding awards to states territories, tribal governments, municipalities and nonprofits 'to develop long-lasting solar programs that are targeted towards the communities and people who need them most,' EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe told reporters during a Friday call.\nPer McCabe, the funding will enable nearly one million households in low-income and disadvantaged communities to benefit from solar power, saving more than $350 million in electric costs annually and more than $8 billion over the life of the program for overburdened households.\nBiden also announced new action on the federal Climate Corps \u2013 a workforce training and service initiative aimed at preparing young Americans for jobs in clean energy and climate resilience. The government will ease Climate Corps members' transition to other federal jobs after they graduate from the program.\nBiden said service programs like the Climate Corps bring 'out the best in young people to do what's best for America.'\n'You'll get paid to fight climate change, learning how to install those solar panels, fight wildfires, rebuild wetlands, weatherize homes, and so much more,' Biden added.\nHe also announced a new partnership between the administration and TradesFutures, the non-profit arm of the North America's Building Trades Unions, allowing Climate Corps members to access some of the union's apprenticeship programs.\nHe also touted an announcement from three states \u2014 Vermont, New Mexico and Illinois \u2014 launching their own state-based climate corps.

It's sort of like breathing,' said Justice Elena Kagan. 'You can say breathing is conduct, too, but presumably you would not think that it's OK to criminalize breathing in public. And for a homeless person who has no place to go, sleeping in public is kind of like breathing in public.'\nMuch of the argument focused on whether the 'anti-camping' ordinances in Grants Pass, Oregon, prohibited conduct, such as sleeping with bedding in a public space, or the status of being homeless. The city of 38,000 argues that the rules are focused narrowly on conduct but the plaintiffs have argued that enforcement has been targeted at people who are unhoused.\nPolice regularly ticketed people who were sleeping in parks and other public spaces under those ordinances. Each violation carries a $295 fine, which increases to more than $500 if not paid.\nThe case is the most significant appeal involving unhoused Americans to reach the Supreme Court in decades, and it's being closely watched by cities and states across the nation that are wrestling with a sharp increase in homelessness.\nOn any given night, more than 650,000 people in the United States are experiencing homelessness, according to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. That number increased 12% from 2022 to 2023.\nChief Justice John Roberts and other members of the court's conservative majority raised a series of questions that noted the ordinance doesn't explicitly say anything about prohibiting homelessness \u2013 and that defining someone's status as 'homeless' can be tricky because it can change nightly.\n'Eating is a basic human function as well that people have to do \u2013 just like sleeping,' Roberts said. 'If someone is hungry and no one is giving him food, can you prosecute him if he breaks into a store to get something to eat?'\nEdwin Kneedler, representing the Biden administration in the case, said that the government could 'absolutely' prosecute someone in that situation.\nSeveral members of the court \u2013 both conservative and liberal \u2013 seemed to wrestle with how to draw the line between status and conduct. That distinction is especially important because a 1962 Supreme Court decision found that a California law that criminalized drug addiction \u2013 as opposed to drug possession \u2013 amounted to a 'cruel and unusual' punishment under the Eighth Amendment because the law was attempting to punish someone's status.\nSeveral city residents experiencing homelessness sued Grants Pass. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with them, holding that it could not 'enforce its anticamping ordinances against homeless persons for the mere act of sleeping outside with rudimentary protection from the elements, or for sleeping in their car at night, when there was no other place in the city for them to go.'\nGrants Pass officials said the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on 'cruel and unusual' punishment was aimed at torture or hard labor sentences, not tickets.\nA decision in the case, City of Grants Pass v. Johnson, is expected by the end of June.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,John Fritze","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2148008870.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":5.6944566,"_id":"fed572c68958d4a9070564edce3671ad"},{"title":"GOP-led House panel uses Democratic votes to push foreign aid bills, setting up confrontation with conservatives","author":"Annie Grayer","published_date":"2024-04-19 04:58:36","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/18/politics/foreign-aid-bills-house-rule-vote","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The House voted Friday in a bipartisan manner to advance a key foreign aid package, a significant step in sending aid to Ukraine and Israel and setting up a final vote as soon as Saturday.","summary":"The House voted Friday in a bipartisan manner to advance a key foreign aid package, a significant step in sending aid to Ukraine and Israel and setting up a final vote as soon as Saturday.\nIn an extraordinary move, more Democrats (165) supported the measure than Republicans (151). The Democratic votes were necessary to overcome opposition from Speaker Mike Johnson's right flank, who will likely only increase their calls to oust him.\nThe fight over the bills \u2013 and the potential for right-wing members of the GOP to attempt to oust Johnson over it \u2013 adds up to the most intense pressure that the speaker has faced over his future in his short time in the role. Rep. Thomas Massie on Tuesday said he would co-sponsor Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to vacate, which would boot Johnson from the speakership if it passed, leading the speaker to defiantly tell reporters that he would not be resigning.\nGreene left the US Capitol on Friday following the vote without moving to oust Johnson.\nThe GOP-led House Rules Committee late Thursday night also used Democratic support to advance the bills.\nThe move is likely to further inflame conservatives who are against additional aid to Ukraine and have threatened Johnson's job over the issue.\nThe committee activity capped off another contentious day on Capitol Hill as the renewed push to send foreign aid to Ukraine has divided House Republicans. The right wing of the GOP conference has come out against the plan and vented their anger over a separate effort to change House rules regarding the process for removing the speaker \u2013 a rule change Johnson said Thursday he would not make.\nThree Republicans \u2013 Massie, Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Chip Roy of Texas \u2013 voted against the foreign aid legislation in committee Thursday night, but all Democrats on the panel voted for it.\nThree bills in the foreign aid package would provide aid for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific region, with the latter intended to help deter Chinese aggression in the area. A fourth bill includes other House GOP priorities, including sanctions on Iran, the seizure of frozen Russian sovereign assets and a measure that could lead to a nationwide ban of TikTok.\nThe three House aid bills add up to about $95 billion \u2013 the same amount the Senate bill included \u2013 with an adjustment that $10 billion in Ukraine economic assistance is in the form of a repayable loan, CNN has reported.\nThe three assistance bills are similar to the foreign aid legislation that passed the Senate in February. The fourth House bill was not part of the Senate package.\nJohnson, appearing on Newsmax, suggested the timing for a vote on the package would be 'early Saturday.' He did not elaborate, and his office told CNN exact timing is still being worked out.\nAccording to the rule, if the bills pass the House, they will be combined into one amendment before being sent to the Senate.\nEarlier Thursday, the House Freedom Caucus took an official stance urging House Republicans to oppose the procedural vote, arguing 'to secure the border we must kill the rule.'\n'The House Freedom Caucus will vote NO on rule for the \u2018America Last' foreign wars supplemental package with zero border security, and urge all House Republicans to do the same,' the group said in a statement posted on X.\nWith Republicans controlling the House only by a razor-thin margin, Johnson will have to rely on a significant number of Democrats to get the bill through procedural hurdles, especially with a growing number of hardliners upset about border security provisions.\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.

Last week, former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson treated a Canadian crowd to a helping of his signature bombast.\n'The party of Winston Churchill wants to ban [cigars]?' he moaned. 'Donnez-moi un break, as they say in Quebec. It's just mad.'\nThe source of his ire was the proposed UK smoking ban, which was spearheaded by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at last October's Conservative Party Conference and underwent its second reading in the House of Commons on Tuesday evening.\nIn a free vote, the House leaned in favor of the plan by 383 to 67, meaning the bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle.\nUnder the proposed bill, no one born on or after January 1, 2009, would ever be allowed to buy tobacco, effectively raising the legal smoking age every year. This would mean today's 15-year-olds will never legally be able to buy cigarettes.\nDespite what Johnson may have led his audience to believe, a potential smoking ban enjoys broad popular support in the UK. A February survey by YouGov for the charity Action on Smoking and Health found that 71% of adults backed the goal of making Britain a country where no one smokes (12% are opposed). Like most people, I'm certain this would save many lives and relieve a massive strain on the National Health Service (NHS). Whether that goodwill proves sufficient to overcome the many obstacles still ahead remains to be seen.\n(NHS). Whether that goodwill proves sufficient to overcome the many obstacles still ahead remains to be seen. Johnson may have invoked one of the most tired clich\u00e9s in British politics (his obsession with Churchill's legacy is matched only by his obsession with his own), but in this instance, it's at least adjacent to something relevant. Conservative backbenchers led by former Prime Minister Liz Truss have condemned the proposed bill as 'profoundly unconservative,' adding that it 'only gives succor to those who wish to curtail freedom.'\n'only gives succor to those who wish to curtail freedom.' This, whatever people's politics, is a sticking point. Smoking isn't just the teenage rite of passage glamorized by shows like 'Skins' and 'Euphoria.' For some, it's synonymous with bodily autonomy. The health benefits of quitting \u2014 or better, never taking it up in the first place \u2014 are irrefutable. But for years, people have weighed the risks of cigarettes and decided they're worth it. As adults, we reserve the right to raise a glass in celebration, bake sugar-packed birthday cakes, drive a car, play extreme sports and do all manner of things that might ultimately harm us. It's our time, our money, our health to do with as we wish.\nThe harder line to draw is how severely our own pleasures should be curtailed for the sake of other people. The UK's 2007 ban on smoking indoors in public places was impactful partly because it vastly reduced children's exposure to second-hand smoke, a cause even the most committed smoker could get behind. It's one thing to puff away on the street, another to do so in a crowded restaurant almost directly into growing lungs.\nThen, there's the question of money. New Zealand's conservative National Party introduced a similar phased smoking ban last year, but reversed it before it went into effect to help pay for tax cuts. When Prohibition was introduced by the 18th Amendment in 1920s America imposing a ban on the sale, manufacture and transportation of alcohol, swathes of the population refused to comply. This resulted in a booming bootleg market and spiraling gang violence. It cost the federal government $11 billion in lost tax revenue and over $300 million to enforce, ultimately contributing to the Amendment's repeal in 1933.\nSmoking costs the NHS an estimated \u00a32.5 billion ($3.1 billion) every year, equivalent to 2% of the health service's budget. Cancer Research UK estimates that in 2022, the gross cost of smoking to public finances was \u00a320.6 billion ($25.7 billion), thanks to a combination of reduced tax revenue, increased benefits payments, unemployment, and premature death. The long-term economic benefits of a smoke-free Britain are obvious. But those savings would take time to materialize, and this government isn't known for staying its course.\nestimated \u00a32.5 billion ($3.1 billion) every year, equivalent to 2% of the health service's budget.

The long-term economic benefits of a smoke-free Britain are obvious. But those savings would take time to materialize, and this government isn't known for staying its course. If cigarettes were invented now, they'd probably never reach the stores. Sadly, getting rid of something the population is already acclimatized to is far trickier than never introducing it in the first place. A phased ban might be a gentler approach than forcing the nation to go cold turkey, but how it'll be enforced in practical terms is far from clear. Among other things, it raises the possibility that in 10 years, we could be in a position where a shopkeeper is 'too young' to smoke, but obliged to sell cigarettes to older people.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook The legal smoking age is a devolved issue, meaning the ban would only apply in England. Depending on how Wales and Scotland choose to proceed, someone who's unable to buy cigarettes in England might be able to do so across the border. And anyway, underage kids have never struggled to get hold of cigarettes in the past, so how will this be managed differently?\nThe Tory rebels' abhorrence of the 'nanny state' might be less sympathetic among the general public at a time when 250 people per week are dyingdue to NHS waiting lists and a cost of living crisis is stunting the growth of our children. Some who might once have blanched at the idea of state intervention may feel more amenable in this climate. The question is whether Rishi Sunak can make an enforceable plan and stick with it.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Holly Thomas,Opinion Holly Thomas","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-102165893.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":5.6831737,"_id":"bea4de9367db3418cef0a5b9f1eabd29"},{"title":"Supreme Court permits Idaho to enforce ban on gender-affirming care for minors","author":"John Fritze","published_date":"2024-04-15 21:15:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/15/politics/idaho-gender-affirming-care-ban-minors-supreme-court","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The Supreme Court on Monday allowed Idaho officials to temporarily enforce a strict statewide ban on gender-affirming care for most minors, in one of the first such cases to reach the nation's highest\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday allowed Idaho officials to temporarily enforce a strict statewide ban on gender-affirming care for most minors, in one of the first such cases to reach the nation's highest court.\nIn an emergency request filed in February, Idaho asked the justices to block a lower court's order that halted implementation of the law. Signed by Republican Gov. Brad Little last year, the law makes it a felony to provide medical treatment \u2013 such as puberty-blocking drugs, hormone therapy and certain surgeries \u2013 to transgender minors.\nThe high court's decision, which came over the dissent of liberal justices, doesn't resolve the underlying legal challenges raised by the case but instead allows the state to enforce the law against most people while the lower courts resolve those questions.\nThough there was no formal opinion from the court, as is often the case on the court's emergency docket, several justices wrote to explain their positions.\nThe court's conservatives said the decision was intended as a signal to lower courts to limit how far they rule when they are temporarily blocking the state from enforcing a law. Justice Neil Gorsuch, in an opinion joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, noted that the lower court that reviewed the Idaho law didn't just block it for the parties involved but blocked its enforcement for everyone in the state.\nThat, they said, represented an overreach by the courts.\n'A return to a more piecemeal and deliberative judicial process may strike some as inefficient. It may promise less power for the judge and less drama and excitement for the parties and public,' Gorsuch wrote.

CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 There is a major disconnect between two CNN stories on Wednesday about Russia and the US.\n\u25ba First, read this report from CNN's Sean Lyngaas about a hacking group with ties to the Russian government that may be responsible for a cyberattack on a Texas water facility, one of several possible attacks on US water facilities about which the federal government has warned.\nKey line: '\u2026if it is confirmed that the (Russian intelligence service) GRU or one of its proxies was involved, this would mark an escalation in targeting US critical infrastructure for a Russian group often known for focusing on Ukraine.'\nKey line: '\u2026if it is confirmed that the (Russian intelligence service) GRU or one of its proxies was involved, this would mark an escalation in targeting US critical infrastructure for a Russian group often known for focusing on Ukraine.' \u25ba Then, read the latest from CNN's Capitol Hill team on the long-stalled effort to provide additional military aid to Ukraine in its war to repel Russia's invasion. GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson may finally be primed to defy the right wing of his party and allow a bipartisan majority to bless the aid six months after it was requested by the White House.\nKey line: 'Conservative hardliners were quickly fuming at Johnson for his decision to move ahead with billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine and loudly warning him it could cost him his job.'\nKey line: 'Conservative hardliners were quickly fuming at Johnson for his decision to move ahead with billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine and loudly warning him it could cost him his job.' What's clear from the water facility hack is that Russia continues to meddle in the US, either by attacking infrastructure or meddling in elections.\nWhat's clear from the Ukraine funding story is that a very small minority of lawmakers, with help from right-wing media, does not view Russia as much of a threat.\nWhile it is mostly Republicans who oppose additional funding for Ukraine, they are still a minority, even within their own party. In February, 22 Republicans in the Senate joined all but three Democrats to form a 70-vote majority in favor of the funding. It's fair to think a similar bipartisan majority would support Ukraine funding in the House's latest foreign aid package unveiled on Wednesday.\n'We're the greatest nation on the planet and we have to act like it,' Johnson told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview on 'The Lead' on Wednesday. He defended his plan, promised a future bill would address the Republican priority of border security and argued that the vast majority of $60 billion in Ukraine aid would go to US defense contractors.\n'The responsibility for the free world has been shifted onto our shoulders,' he said, adding US troops would not be committed in Ukraine. 'We're not the world's policeman.'\nNot all Republicans are buying the pitch, and the divide within the GOP over Ukraine is getting more heated, which is jeopardizing Johnson's ability to lead. CNN's Capitol Hill team reports that some potential Johnson rivals are quietly positioning themselves in case there is yet another ousted speaker.\nJohnson's Republican critics, meanwhile, are getting louder.\nFlorida Rep. Matt Gaetz described Johnson's strategy, a complicated four-part parliamentary gambit to tie aid for Ukraine with aid for Israel, Taiwan and the US border, as 'surrender.'\nTexas Rep. Chip Roy didn't commit to voting to oust Johnson but said he's 'past the point of giving grace' to the still-new speaker.\nAnd they aren't even the two Republicans who have already said they would soon vote to end Johnson's speakership, although it's not clear when.\nThe first who's already on the record is Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who described Ukraine as 'the only country that for some weird, sick and evil reason that they care about.' She was referring to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who has raised the alarm about the threat of Russia to the rest of the world if Ukraine falls.\nThe other Republican already publicly in favor of ousting Johnson is Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky. He praised Tucker Carlson for that softball interview the former Fox News host conducted with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this year. That's the interview CNN's media team described as a 'propaganda victory' for Putin.\nJohnson may need help from moderate Democrats to fend off the effort to oust him, and a few Democrats have said they would break tradition and cross party lines to support him. It's not clear if Johnson would want the help, since party loyalty is prized in the GOP.\nThe Russia divide is clearly testing that loyalty. Former Rep. Liz Cheney, the Republican from Wyoming, who was ousted for her opposition to former President Donald Trump, has referred to the 'Putin wing' of the GOP as a threat to the US.\nFormer Rep. Liz Cheney sees a \"Putin wing\" in the GOP.\n07:47 - Source: CNN\n07:47 - Source: CNN Rep. Michael McCaul, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told Puck News this month that Russian propaganda has 'infected a good chunk of my party's base,' threatening the Ukraine aid.\nAsked about that propaganda comment by Tapper earlier this month, Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, agreed.\n'Oh, it is absolutely true,' he said.\nRepublican lawmaker says Russian propaganda has 'infected a good chunk' of GOP base\n01:29 - Source: CNN\n01:29 - Source: CNN 'To the extent that this propaganda takes hold, it makes it more difficult for us to really see this as an authoritarian-versus-democracy battle, which is what it is,' Turner said.\nGreene, who former Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado described as 'Moscow Marjorie' during one recent CNN interview, has said on conservative media outlets that she is not concerned that Putin's aggression against Ukraine will spread.\nIn a post on X this past weekend, she suggested US military funding would go to 'Ukrainian Nazis,' repeating a false claim about Ukraine pushed by Putin.\nJohnson still has the key support of Trump. The two appeared together at Mar-a-Lago last week, and Johnson has bought into Trump's proposal to structure some Ukraine aid as a loan rather than direct aid. While Democrats have long complained that Trump shows deference to Putin, Johnson made the argument to Tapper that Trump could negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine.\nJohnson said he's not going to be consumed by thinking about efforts within his own party to oust him. 'Right now I gotta do my job,' he said, although he refused to comment on what would happen if Democrats ultimately vote to keep him as speaker. 'When you do the right thing, you let the chits fall where they may,' he said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Zachary B.

London CNN \u2014\nLondon CNN \u2014 Last week, former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson treated a Canadian crowd to a helping of his signature bombast.\n'The party of Winston Churchill wants to ban [cigars]?' he moaned. 'Donnez-moi un break, as they say in Quebec. It's just mad.'\nThe source of his ire was the proposed UK smoking ban, which was spearheaded by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at last October's Conservative Party Conference and underwent its second reading in the House of Commons on Tuesday evening.\nIn a free vote, the House leaned in favor of the plan by 383 to 67, meaning the bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle.\nUnder the proposed bill, no one born on or after January 1, 2009, would ever be allowed to buy tobacco, effectively raising the legal smoking age every year. This would mean today's 15-year-olds will never legally be able to buy cigarettes.\nDespite what Johnson may have led his audience to believe, a potential smoking ban enjoys broad popular support in the UK. A February survey by YouGov for the charity Action on Smoking and Health found that 71% of adults backed the goal of making Britain a country where no one smokes (12% are opposed). Like most people, I'm certain this would save many lives and relieve a massive strain on the National Health Service (NHS). Whether that goodwill proves sufficient to overcome the many obstacles still ahead remains to be seen.\n(NHS). Whether that goodwill proves sufficient to overcome the many obstacles still ahead remains to be seen. Johnson may have invoked one of the most tired clich\u00e9s in British politics (his obsession with Churchill's legacy is matched only by his obsession with his own), but in this instance, it's at least adjacent to something relevant. Conservative backbenchers led by former Prime Minister Liz Truss have condemned the proposed bill as 'profoundly unconservative,' adding that it 'only gives succor to those who wish to curtail freedom.'\n'only gives succor to those who wish to curtail freedom.' This, whatever people's politics, is a sticking point. Smoking isn't just the teenage rite of passage glamorized by shows like 'Skins' and 'Euphoria.' For some, it's synonymous with bodily autonomy. The health benefits of quitting \u2014 or better, never taking it up in the first place \u2014 are irrefutable. But for years, people have weighed the risks of cigarettes and decided they're worth it. As adults, we reserve the right to raise a glass in celebration, bake sugar-packed birthday cakes, drive a car, play extreme sports and do all manner of things that might ultimately harm us. It's our time, our money, our health to do with as we wish.\nvideo\nvideo Related video New Zealand scraps world's first youth smoking ban\nRelated video New Zealand scraps world's first youth smoking ban The harder line to draw is how severely our own pleasures should be curtailed for the sake of other people. The UK's 2007 ban on smoking indoors in public places was impactful partly because it vastly reduced children's exposure to second-hand smoke, a cause even the most committed smoker could get behind. It's one thing to puff away on the street, another to do so in a crowded restaurant almost directly into growing lungs.\nThen, there's the question of money. New Zealand's conservative National Party introduced a similar phased smoking ban last year, but reversed it before it went into effect to help pay for tax cuts. When Prohibition was introduced by the 18th Amendment in 1920s America imposing a ban on the sale, manufacture and transportation of alcohol, swathes of the population refused to comply. This resulted in a booming bootleg market and spiraling gang violence. It cost the federal government $11 billion in lost tax revenue and over $300 million to enforce, ultimately contributing to the Amendment's repeal in 1933.\nSmoking costs the NHS an estimated \u00a32.5 billion ($3.1 billion) every year, equivalent to 2% of the health service's budget. Cancer Research UK estimates that in 2022, the gross cost of smoking to public finances was \u00a320.6 billion ($25.7 billion), thanks to a combination of reduced tax revenue, increased benefits payments, unemployment, and premature death. The long-term economic benefits of a smoke-free Britain are obvious. But those savings would take time to materialize, and this government isn't known for staying its course.\nestimated \u00a32.5 billion ($3.1 billion) every year, equivalent to 2% of the health service's budget.

The long-term economic benefits of a smoke-free Britain are obvious. But those savings would take time to materialize, and this government isn't known for staying its course. If cigarettes were invented now, they'd probably never reach the stores. Sadly, getting rid of something the population is already acclimatized to is far trickier than never introducing it in the first place. A phased ban might be a gentler approach than forcing the nation to go cold turkey, but how it'll be enforced in practical terms is far from clear. Among other things, it raises the possibility that in 10 years, we could be in a position where a shopkeeper is 'too young' to smoke, but obliged to sell cigarettes to older people.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook The legal smoking age is a devolved issue, meaning the ban would only apply in England. Depending on how Wales and Scotland choose to proceed, someone who's unable to buy cigarettes in England might be able to do so across the border. And anyway, underage kids have never struggled to get hold of cigarettes in the past, so how will this be managed differently?\nThe Tory rebels' abhorrence of the 'nanny state' might be less sympathetic among the general public at a time when 250 people per week are dyingdue to NHS waiting lists and a cost of living crisis is stunting the growth of our children. Some who might once have blanched at the idea of state intervention may feel more amenable in this climate. The question is whether Rishi Sunak can make an enforceable plan and stick with it.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Opinion Holly Thomas,Holly Thomas","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-102165893.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":5.560443,"_id":"7aca261374a47184c7b02e3d641d3dd7"},{"title":"By passing Ukraine aid, the accidental speaker became an unlikely Churchill","author":"Stephen Collinson","published_date":"2024-04-20 22:56:52","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/20/politics/mike-johnson-ukraine-aid-russia-zelensky-putin/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Republican Speaker Mike Johnson showed political courage that is rare in Washington and notable legislative skill for an inexperienced leader in forcing a long-delayed $60 billion aid bill for Ukraine\u2026","summary":"Republican Speaker Mike Johnson showed political courage that is rare in Washington and notable legislative skill for an inexperienced leader in forcing a long-delayed $60 billion aid bill for Ukraine through the House of Representatives on Saturday.\nJohnson put his own job in extreme peril to stand up for a democratic nation victimized by an unprovoked invasion by Russian strongman Vladimir Putin and to bolster America's leadership of the West. His actions could save thousands of Ukrainian lives, even if Russia's determination to win a bloody war in which it is targeting civilians shows no sign of fading.\nJohnson's support for the bill followed a period of self-examination and a political evolution that is also unusual in the hyperpolarized Capitol. One of his senior colleagues in the House said the 'transformation' involved prayer by the devout Louisiana hardline conservative, who expressed a wish to be on the right side of history.\nJohnson's piloting of the bill through the House, after months of bitter infighting that split the GOP, saw him side with the diminished internationalist Ronald Reagan wing of his party while turning his back on the 'America First' faction where he previously made his political home.\nJohnson argued that without the United States continuing its arms and ammunition lifeline to Ukraine, Russia could score a victory that would prompt it to march deeper into Europe, drawing the US into another world war. He said a failure to act would bolster the emerging de facto axis of totalitarianism between Russia, Iran and China. Two other bills that Johnson shepherded through the House in a rare Saturday session will also send new aid to Israel and Taiwan, reinforcing other vital US national security goals in two other world hot spots. His decisions also preserved and prolonged the central planks of President Joe Biden's foreign policy less than seven months before he seeks reelection. Classified briefings by US covert agencies appear to have played a major role in his shift in thinking \u2014 another factor likely to anger Make America Great Again Republicans who view the intelligence community as a 'deep state' that targets ex-President Donald Trump.\nBut Johnson argued that the international situation is so grave that the House had no choice, warning that Russia, China and Iran are 'a global threat to our prosperity and our security. Their advance threatens the free world, and it demands American leadership. (If) we turn our backs right now the consequences could be devastating.'\nThe significance of the remarkable events on a charged floor of the House was underscored by a message from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had spent months warning he could lose the war if US help already worth tens of billions of dollars dried up. 'I am grateful to the United States House of Representatives, both parties, and personally Speaker Mike Johnson for the decision that keeps history on the right track,' he wrote on his Telegram channel. 'Democracy and freedom will always have global significance and will never fail as long as America helps to protect it.'\nCNN's Frederik Pleitgen reported from Ukraine on Saturday that US aid could quickly start funneling into Ukraine \u2014 assuming the Senate signs off on the bill, as expected. Zelensky's forces especially need anti-aircraft missiles and new air defense systems to counter growing Russian air superiority and an expanding assault on civilian and energy infrastructure targets. Ukrainian soldiers fighting in grim trench warfare conditions have meanwhile been rationing bullets and artillery. The House vote will also offer a vitally needed boost of morale as the vicious war has turned against Ukraine in recent months.\nJohnson's actions, however, represented a flagrant challenge to the populist base of the Republican Party, which is adamantly against more Ukraine aid, hews closer to Putin than Zelensky and views America's traditional leadership of the West as propping up globalist policies antithetical to US interests. This seam of opinion is hugely influential in the GOP and has been harnessed over the years by Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. And 112 Republicans \u2014 a majority of the conference \u2014 voted against the Ukraine bill. Millions of Americans share the ex-president's worldview that America's allies \u2014 who pleaded with Johnson not to abandon Ukraine \u2014 are freeloading off its defense umbrellas and that the US should take a much narrower view of its international obligations. They don't believe that Ukraine is America's fight and warn that standing up to Russia could lead to World War III.\nJohnson is also increasingly vulnerable because in passing the Ukraine bill, he repudiated the demand of right-wing Republicans to use the aid as leverage to force the Biden administration to introduce hardline policies at the US-Mexico border. In this, however, he was undercut by his own side. The president had previously agreed to many of the GOP's demands in the most conservative immigration bill in years \u2014 but Trump's allies in the House killed the measure, apparently to deprive Biden of a win on an issue that the ex-president sees as his path back to the White House. That move \u2014 which deprived Johnson's tiny majority of a significant policy win \u2014 taken together with the use of Democratic votes to pass Saturday's Ukraine measure reflects the utter disarray in a Republican Party that is at war with itself. The optics turned even more perilous for Johnson when Democrats waved Ukrainian flags on the House floor, creating a scene that is already going viral among conservatives on social media and that the speaker was quick to condemn.\nGeorgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a vehement opponent of funding Ukraine's war effort, warned after the vote that Johnson was a 'lame duck,' though she did not trigger the vote on ousting him that she had threatened in an attempt to thwart the Ukraine bill. Greene slammed Johnson for funding what she called America's 'murder industry' by supporting foreign wars and warned, 'It's unbelievable. I'm thankful that America gets to see who this man is.'\nThe Georgia hardliner is one of at least three Republicans who have said they will support a move to oust Johnson \u2014 whose majority is so slim he cannot afford to lose any Republicans on a party-line vote and would likely need the support of Democrats to remain speaker.\nGreene predicted fury among grassroots Republicans as lawmakers return home for a short recess after Johnson also worked to pass vital spending bills that funded the government \u2014 in what Greene says is a betrayal of GOP voters. She may be correct in her analysis, and a slow buildup of pressure may represent Johnson's biggest vulnerability.\nStill, there were also signs even among Republicans disappointed with Johnson of no appetite for another debacle that would likely unfold in seeking a new speaker so close to elections. If Johnson has correctly read the mood of those members, he may survive in a display of political dexterity that few observers expected to see after he was elevated to the speakership from the backbenches in October as almost the last resort after better-known figures failed to amass a majority after the toppling of then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy. But his chances of staying in his post if the GOP wins in November still seem slim. Nevertheless, in passing aid to Israel and Ukraine, Johnson may have provided a service to vulnerable freshmen Republicans in swing districts whose victories in the 2022 midterms paved the way to their party's control of the House. One of their number, Rep. Marc Molinaro of New York, told CNN's Manu Raju that after speaking with his constituents, 'It is clear to me that there are moments in time where we must do the right thing, and today we did that.'\nOne intriguing question Saturday was the position of Trump \u2014 a longtime antagonist of Zelensky and mentor of Greene, whose pressure on Kyiv to investigate Biden caused Trump's first impeachment. Johnson traveled to Mar-a-Lago to see Trump recently and bolstered the ex-president's false claims of election fraud in an apparent bid to shore up his own position. The ex-president, who has long genuflected to Putin, stayed on the sidelines of the Ukraine debate. It remains unclear whether he was seeking to preserve his options in the event he is the next commander in chief and wants to follow through with his vow to end the war in Ukraine. Or perhaps Trump was preoccupied with his own political goals \u2014 and his first criminal trial ahead of opening arguments on Monday.\nWith the GOP in uproar following Saturday's vote, Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries refused to say whether his party will back Johnson if Greene and her allies seek to unseat him with a maneuver known as a motion to vacate. Even if Democrats save Johnson as payback for the passage of the aid bills \u2014 a key Biden priority \u2014 a long-term effort to keep him in office seems unlikely. The speaker may be the most conservative person to hold the job in modern US history, and many Democrats disdain his efforts to promote Trump's election-fraud falsehoods following the last election. And any Republican speaker propped up by Democrats might hemorrhage support among GOP lawmakers and be forced to resign.\nThere was, however, grudging support among some Democrats for the speaker. Rep Mike Quigley, who co-chairs the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, was asked whether he had new respect for Johnson. 'I guess I do,' the Illinois Democrat said. 'The old adage is \u2018It's never too late to do the right thing.' We tested that,' Quigley added. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer praised both Johnson and Jeffries, saying, 'I know it was a difficult road, but the House is on the right side of history for approving this bill.'\nAmerica's enemies, including Putin, had been betting that US political divisions \u2014 exacerbated by past Russian election interference \u2014 would mean that the US would be unable to protect its traditional interests on the world stage. But Johnson put those assumptions on hold, even if the long-term prospects for continued US support for Ukraine and traditional leadership of the West look dim if Trump wins in November.\nBut House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Mike McCaul, a Texas Republican who previously revealed Johnson had prayed for guidance, said the speaker showed true leadership. 'He said, \u2018I want to be on the right side of history.' And I think he will be. And again, I think putting the nation above himself, it's a real profile in courage, what he did.'\nAs the debate over Ukraine aid peaked, McCaul had drawn analogies between the US posture toward Putin and Britain's appeasement of Nazi Germany under one prime minister and the stalwart resistance of his successor. 'As we deliberate on this vote, you have to ask yourself this question. Am I Chamberlain or Churchill?' he said.\nThe accidental speaker makes an unlikely Churchill, but on Saturday he proved to be a far more daring and substantial figure than many of his Republican and Democratic critics previously believed.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Stephen Collinson","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/b5ca8a42-d9e5-4732-940d-95d63d46e7c3.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":5.459938,"_id":"29db4ef63ef0e594628e14d79e575617"},{"title":"Analysis: By passing Ukraine aid, the accidental speaker became an unlikely Churchill","author":"Stephen Collinson","published_date":"2024-04-20 22:56:52","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/20/politics/mike-johnson-ukraine-aid-russia-zelensky-putin/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Republican Speaker Mike Johnson showed political courage that is rare in Washington and notable legislative skill for an inexperienced leader in forcing a long-delayed $60 billion aid bill for Ukraine\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Republican Speaker Mike Johnson showed political courage that is rare in Washington and notable legislative skill for an inexperienced leader in forcing a long-delayed $60 billion aid bill for Ukraine through the House of Representatives on Saturday.\nJohnson put his own job in extreme peril to stand up for a democratic nation victimized by an unprovoked invasion by Russian strongman Vladimir Putin and to bolster America's leadership of the West.

This seam of opinion is hugely influential in the GOP and has been harnessed over the years by Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. And 112 Republicans \u2014 a majority of the conference \u2014 voted against the Ukraine bill. Millions of Americans share the ex-president's worldview that America's allies \u2014 who pleaded with Johnson not to abandon Ukraine \u2014 are freeloading off its defense umbrellas and that the US should take a much narrower view of its international obligations. They don't believe that Ukraine is America's fight and warn that standing up to Russia could lead to World War III.\nJohnson is also increasingly vulnerable because in passing the Ukraine bill, he repudiated the demand of right-wing Republicans to use the aid as leverage to force the Biden administration to introduce hardline policies at the US-Mexico border. In this, however, he was undercut by his own side. The president had previously agreed to many of the GOP's demands in the most conservative immigration bill in years \u2014 but Trump's allies in the House killed the measure, apparently to deprive Biden of a win on an issue that the ex-president sees as his path back to the White House. That move \u2014 which deprived Johnson's tiny majority of a significant policy win \u2014 taken together with the use of Democratic votes to pass Saturday's Ukraine measure reflects the utter disarray in a Republican Party that is at war with itself. The optics turned even more perilous for Johnson when Democrats waved Ukrainian flags on the House floor, creating a scene that is already going viral among conservatives on social media and that the speaker was quick to condemn.\nGeorgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a vehement opponent of funding Ukraine's war effort, warned after the vote that Johnson was a 'lame duck,' though she did not trigger the vote on ousting him that she had threatened in an attempt to thwart the Ukraine bill. Greene slammed Johnson for funding what she called America's 'murder industry' by supporting foreign wars and warned, 'It's unbelievable. I'm thankful that America gets to see who this man is.'\nThe Georgia hardliner is one of at least three Republicans who have said they will support a move to oust Johnson \u2014 whose majority is so slim he cannot afford to lose any Republicans on a party-line vote and would likely need the support of Democrats to remain speaker.\nGreene predicted fury among grassroots Republicans as lawmakers return home for a short recess after Johnson also worked to pass vital spending bills that funded the government \u2014 in what Greene says is a betrayal of GOP voters. She may be correct in her analysis, and a slow buildup of pressure may represent Johnson's biggest vulnerability.\nStill, there were also signs even among Republicans disappointed with Johnson of no appetite for another debacle that would likely unfold in seeking a new speaker so close to elections. If Johnson has correctly read the mood of those members, he may survive in a display of political dexterity that few observers expected to see after he was elevated to the speakership from the backbenches in October as almost the last resort after better-known figures failed to amass a majority after the toppling of then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy. But his chances of staying in his post if the GOP wins in November still seem slim. Nevertheless, in passing aid to Israel and Ukraine, Johnson may have provided a service to vulnerable freshmen Republicans in swing districts whose victories in the 2022 midterms paved the way to their party's control of the House. One of their number, Rep. Marc Molinaro of New York, told CNN's Manu Raju that after speaking with his constituents, 'It is clear to me that there are moments in time where we must do the right thing, and today we did that.'\nOne intriguing question Saturday was the position of Trump \u2014 a longtime antagonist of Zelensky and mentor of Greene, whose pressure on Kyiv to investigate Biden caused Trump's first impeachment. Johnson traveled to Mar-a-Lago to see Trump recently and bolstered the ex-president's false claims of election fraud in an apparent bid to shore up his own position. The ex-president, who has long genuflected to Putin, stayed on the sidelines of the Ukraine debate. It remains unclear whether he was seeking to preserve his options in the event he is the next commander in chief and wants to follow through with his vow to end the war in Ukraine. Or perhaps Trump was preoccupied with his own political goals \u2014 and his first criminal trial ahead of opening arguments on Monday.\nWith the GOP in uproar following Saturday's vote, Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries refused to say whether his party will back Johnson if Greene and her allies seek to unseat him with a maneuver known as a motion to vacate. Even if Democrats save Johnson as payback for the passage of the aid bills \u2014 a key Biden priority \u2014 a long-term effort to keep him in office seems unlikely. The speaker may be the most conservative person to hold the job in modern US history, and many Democrats disdain his efforts to promote Trump's election-fraud falsehoods following the last election. And any Republican speaker propped up by Democrats might hemorrhage support among GOP lawmakers and be forced to resign.\nThere was, however, grudging support among some Democrats for the speaker. Rep Mike Quigley, who co-chairs the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, was asked whether he had new respect for Johnson. 'I guess I do,' the Illinois Democrat said. 'The old adage is \u2018It's never too late to do the right thing.' We tested that,' Quigley added. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer praised both Johnson and Jeffries, saying, 'I know it was a difficult road, but the House is on the right side of history for approving this bill.'\nAmerica's enemies, including Putin, had been betting that US political divisions \u2014 exacerbated by past Russian election interference \u2014 would mean that the US would be unable to protect its traditional interests on the world stage. But Johnson put those assumptions on hold, even if the long-term prospects for continued US support for Ukraine and traditional leadership of the West look dim if Trump wins in November.\nBut House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Mike McCaul, a Texas Republican who previously revealed Johnson had prayed for guidance, said the speaker showed true leadership. 'He said, \u2018I want to be on the right side of history.' And I think he will be. And again, I think putting the nation above himself, it's a real profile in courage, what he did.'\nAs the debate over Ukraine aid peaked, McCaul had drawn analogies between the US posture toward Putin and Britain's appeasement of Nazi Germany under one prime minister and the stalwart resistance of his successor. 'As we deliberate on this vote, you have to ask yourself this question. Am I Chamberlain or Churchill?' he said.\nThe accidental speaker makes an unlikely Churchill, but on Saturday he proved to be a far more daring and substantial figure than many of his Republican and Democratic critics previously believed.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Stephen Collinson,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/b5ca8a42-d9e5-4732-940d-95d63d46e7c3.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":5.4578223,"_id":"25ccaa1415dbd4480f06377dea3ba60b"},{"title":"Biden administration considers scrapping a futuristic proposal to slash power plant pollution","author":"Ella Nilsen","published_date":"2024-04-18 21:25:58","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/18/climate/biden-epa-power-plant-rules-hydrogen-climate","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The Biden administration is contemplating scrapping the most futuristic aspect of its highly anticipated and impactful power plant pollution rules, two sources familiar with the plan told CNN.

The administration may also allow a slower phase-in for a portion of the rules, which are due to be finalized as soon as next week.\nThe potential change of plans comes as the administration faces fierce political headwinds, a conservative Supreme Court majority that has shown aggressive interest in curtailing the Environmental Protection Agency's authority and questions over how fast electric utilities can pivot to the most innovative climate solutions.\nThe EPA is considering eliminating a proposal for new natural gas plants to use hydrogen alongside natural gas to make electricity, the sources said. The expected changes mean both existing coal and new gas plants would primarily rely on carbon capture and storage to cut their climate pollution, rather than hydrogen fuels. Hydrogen, while in its infancy, is seen by scientists as the future of clean fuel.\nThe power plant rules are still under review and no final decisions on them have been made.\nEPA spokesperson Tim Carroll declined to comment, saying, 'The draft final rule is currently with the Office of Management and Budget under interagency review.' A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe EPA power plant rules are one of the most important and highly anticipated planks of President Joe Biden's climate agenda.\nThe potential change comes amid questions on how quickly the industry could scale up clean hydrogen, a relatively nascent technology derived both from fossil fuels such as natural gas, as well as cleaner hydrogen \u2013 which uses clean electricity to split water.\nA handful of projects have demonstrated the ability to burn hydrogen in a gas turbine, 'but it's not a widespread technology yet,' Mike O'Boyle, the senior director of electricity at nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, told CNN.\nUtilities have proposed building more natural gas plants to keep electricity flowing onto a grid with increased demands from the growing number of electric vehicles and AI and data centers. Clean energy and climate groups have argued in favor of cleaner and cheaper sources of energy such as wind, solar and battery storage.\nThe possible move away from hydrogen could make it easier for the EPA to defend against potential court challenges to the plan.\nThe conservative Supreme Court and its 2022 ruling on West Virginia v. EPA has loomed large over how the agency has crafted its rules. The Supreme Court ruling significantly curtailed the EPA's ability to regulate carbon pollution at power plants by having utilities outfit their power plants with carbon capture, rather than requiring a shift from coal or natural gas-fired power to cheaper and cleaner sources like wind and solar.\nWest Virginia v. EPA has loomed large over how the agency has crafted its rules. The Supreme Court ruling significantly curtailed the EPA's ability to regulate carbon pollution at power plants by having utilities outfit their power plants with carbon capture, rather than requiring a shift from coal or natural gas-fired power to cheaper and cleaner sources like wind and solar. One of the thorny issues facing the EPA was how using hydrogen at natural gas plants would fall in the Supreme Court's narrow definition. And some environmental groups were concerned it would be tough for the federal government to ensure the hydrogen was clean, not more polluting.\nThe EPA is also considering pushing back its initial timeline requiring existing coal-fired power plants to cut or capture 90% of their planet-warming pollution using carbon capture and storage by two years to 2032, the sources said.\nThe EPA announced in February it would delay the rule-making process for carbon emissions from existing gas plants, which had initially been covered under the agency's proposal last year.\nO'Boyle said that, judging from the comments and wide disagreement from industry and environmental groups, it is very likely that EPA will face a lawsuit.\n'One thing we can all count on is that the EPA will be sued by an aggrieved party under this rule, no matter what,' O'Boyle said. 'There will be lawsuits.'\nVickie Patton, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund, told reporters on a Thursday call she believes the EPA's final rule will be on 'strong' legal footing.\n'They've really followed the law, and they have also a very rigorous record,' Patton said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Ella Nilsen","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1246984994.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":5.386788,"_id":"35c0431926c5858c9a6de967e57d29c5"},{"title":"UK passes controversial bill to send asylum seekers to Rwanda after two years of challenges","author":"Luke McGee","published_date":"2024-04-22 23:36:16","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/22/uk/uk-passes-rwanda-bill-intl/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The UK parliament has finally passed a contentious bill that will allow the government to send asylum seekers to Rwanda for their claims to be considered by the East African nation.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 The UK parliament has finally passed a contentious bill that will allow the government to send asylum seekers to Rwanda for their claims to be considered by the East African nation.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak's efforts had been stuck between opposition in the Houses of Parliament and challenges in the British courts, as lawmakers and activists have sought to scupper the legislation on human rights grounds.\nSunak's inability to implement the policy has caused considerable embarrassment, as the British government has sent millions of pounds to Rwanda to fund a scheme which to date has failed to deliver any results.\nIt is designed to deter irregular migration into the United Kingdom, particularly people traveling on illegal \u2013 and dangerous \u2013 small boats from France, arranged by criminal gangs.\nIn theory, the legislation will see some landing in the UK sent to Rwanda where their asylum claim will be considered. If their claim is accepted, they will stay in Rwanda. If it is declined, the bill says they cannot be deported by Rwanda to anywhere other than the UK, though it is unclear what would ultimately happen in this scenario.\nTwo years after the scheme was first conceived, the absence of any deportations so far has been considered a major failure for Sunak, who has previously marked out stopping small boats as a key priority.\nRelated article Everything seems to be going wrong for Rishi Sunak\nRelated article Everything seems to be going wrong for Rishi Sunak The Supreme Court of the UK ruled last year that the policy is unlawful 'because there are substantial grounds for believing that asylum seekers would face a real risk of ill-treatment by reason of refoulement to their country of origin if they were removed to Rwanda.'\nRefoulement is the practice where asylum seekers or refugees are forcibly returned to a place where they would face persecution or danger, against important principles of international human rights law.\nThe judges also found that Rwanda's asylum system, its poor human rights record, and its previous failure to comply with non-refoulement agreements meant that the British government could not be sure asylum seekers would have their claims considered safely and properly.\nThey also noted that, as recently as 2021, the UK government criticized Rwanda for 'extrajudicial killings, deaths in custody, enforced disappearances and torture.'\nThe government responded by introducing the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill in January of this year, which effectively enshrines in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country, overriding the judges' concerns.\nEven with the bill passed, it is possible that the government will face legal challenges in the European Court of Human Rights, as the UK is still a signatory to the European Convention of Human Rights. The European court has previously barred it from sending asylum seekers to Rwanda.\nThe bill has suffered long delays because of attempts to amend it. A process colloquially known as 'ping pong,' where the two parts of the UK's parliament \u2013 the House of Commons and the House of Lords \u2013 send legislation back and forth, has been going on for months. Every time the House of Lords makes amendments to the bill, the House of Commons, where Sunak has a majority, must vote to remove them.\nThe bill's passage is not necessarily a major political win for Sunak. Even if the policy stopped all the small boat crossings Sunak says he wants to prevent, it would still barely touch the sides in terms of the UK's net migration figures. In 2022, the number of people arriving by small boats was 45,744, according to Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. Net migration the same year, according to government figures, was 745,000.\nThis is a problem for Sunak and his governing Conservative Party, as they are set to face the public in a general election that must be called before the end of this year. Parties on the right \u2013 most notably Reform UK, the new political home of arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage \u2013 will push the issue of illegal migration as hard as possible.\nThere is also a danger that Sunak gets dragged into a wider debate around the UK leaving the ECHR, should deportations be blocked by the European court after the bill passes. This issue has already caused deep divisions between different sections of the Conservative Party.\nTo date, the Rwanda policy has cost the British government \u00a3220m ($274m), and that figure could rise to \u00a3600m after the first 300 people have been sent to East Africa. That leaves Sunak open to criticism from both the left and the right, who can say not only that the policy violates international human rights law, but that it is expensive and ineffective.\nThe opposition Labour Party, currently expected to win at the next general election, has already said that it will scrap the policy should it come to power.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Luke McGee","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1402944541.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":5.219303,"_id":"8d79b7921f0162f3c2c59e4bc0eb3b90"},{"title":"Reagan-era emergency health care law is the next abortion flashpoint at the Supreme Court","author":"Tierney Sneed","published_date":"2024-04-20 16:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/20/politics/abortion-supreme-court-idaho-emergency-care","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Two years after ending the national right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court will scrutinize one of the marquee efforts by the Biden administration to preserve abortion access\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Two years after ending the national right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court will scrutinize one of the marquee efforts by the Biden administration to preserve abortion access in the post-Roe v. Wade era.\nIn a case being heard by the court Wednesday, the Biden administration is challenging Idaho's enforcement of its abortion ban in medical emergencies, putting a spotlight on what has been one of the most politically explosive flashpoints in the aftermath of Roe's demise.\nThe Justice Department maintains that federal law requires hospitals to offer abortions if necessary to stabilize the health of emergency room patients, even in states like Idaho that ban that procedure. At the time the lawsuit was filed, Attorney General Merrick Garland characterized the case as part of the department's promise to 'work tirelessly to protect and advance reproductive freedom' in the wake of Roe's reversal.\nThe lawsuit has proceeded somewhat under the radar and has been overshadowed by the other blockbuster abortion case at the Supreme Court this year, concerning the federal regulations for abortion pills. Yet, the Idaho case could yield the most significant ruling from the court on abortion since the 2022 Roe reversal and one that could further elevate an issue Democrats want front and center in the 2024 election this November.\nIdaho argues that the Biden administration is trying to retrofit the federal law known as EMTALA \u2013 or the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act \u2013 to 'create a nationwide abortion mandate in hospital emergency rooms.'\nIdaho's abortion law has a narrow exemption for abortions provided to save a pregnant woman's life. However, the Justice Department argues that federal law overrides state abortion bans that prohibit emergency room doctors from offering the procedure to women whose pregnancies are causing medical emergencies that are not yet life-threatening.\n'Many pregnancy complications do not pose a threat to the woman's life when she arrives at the emergency room \u2013 but delaying care until necessary to prevent her death could allow her condition to deteriorate, placing her at risk of acute and long-term complications,' the Justice Department told the high court in a brief.\nAnti-abortion advocates meanwhile hope the Supreme Court will use the case to rebuke what they say is an unlawful Biden administration effort to undermine its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson, the ruling that overturned Roe.\n'This is an opportunity for the Supreme Court to push back against the Biden administration's campaign of massive resistance to the Dobbs decision,' said Roger Severino, a vice president of domestic policy for the conservative Heritage Foundation.\nA bipartisan Congress enacted EMTALA in 1986 to address the issue of 'patient dumping,' the practice by hospitals to refuse emergency room care to patients, often uninsured, in order to save costs.\nThe Justice Department sued Idaho under the law just over a month after the Supreme Court's Dobbs ruling cleared the way for the state to enact a strict abortion ban, and within weeks the administration secured a lower court order blocking Idaho's abortion ban in scenarios of medical emergencies. Until the order was put on pause by higher courts, including the Supreme Court, it was the rare example of a successful action the Biden administration was able to take to try to mitigate the effects of Roe's reversal.\nIt is also a case that highlights what has been a particularly troubling narrative for the anti-abortion movement post-Dobbs: that abortion bans \u2013 even those with ostensible life-of-the-mother exemptions \u2013 are putting the health of pregnant women in jeopardy.\n'Those stories are hugely sympathetic to the public, to voters,' said Gretchen Borchelt, the vice president for reproductive rights and health at the National Women's Law Center, which is supporting the Biden administration in the case. 'I think that crystallizes for people the fallout of the Dobbs decision in a way that nothing else is.'\nAbortion on the ballot in AZ this November\n03:25 - Source: CNN\n03:25 - Source: CNN John Bursch, the vice president of appellate advocacy for the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, which is Idaho's co-counsel in the case, told CNN that it was a 'scare tactic' to claim that Idaho's ban did not adequately protect women facing complications from their pregnancy, as he sought to distance the case from abortion politics.\n'Protecting the mother's life is always possible when that's the only choice that you have,' he said. 'So, this case really isn't about that. And it's really not even about abortion, although the other side is trying to make it about that.'\n(Health care providers in Idaho have said that in the few months that the abortion ban has been in effect, it has prevented them from providing abortions to patients who were suffering pregnancy complications causing them organ failure and other severe conditions \u2013 including conditions that would threaten their future fertility.)\nBursch framed the case around the question of 'whether EMTALA was an intentional attempt by the federal government to take control of the state practice of medicine.'\n'And no one ever thought that before Dobbs,' he said.\nIn the other major abortion case on the docket this term, a challenge brought by anti-abortion doctors to how the federal government has regulated the abortion drug known as mifepristone, the justices in oral arguments indicated they were leaning towards rejecting the case because the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit.\n'Even if they kick out the mifepristone case on standing, to decide to make it harder for people get emergency abortion care is going to have huge ramifications for voters,' Borchelt said.\nIn a troubling sign for the administration in this case, the Supreme Court paused lower court rulings that partially blocked Idaho's abortion ban and agreed to take up the case before the lower courts had fully considered it on the merits. There were no public dissents to those moves.\nThe case could turn on how the justices read the term 'unborn child' in EMTALA. The term is referenced multiple times in the law, which includes scenarios in its definition of medical emergencies where the health of an unborn child is in serious jeopardy and transfers of patients in labor that would put the safety of their unborn child at risk are restricted.\nThe references to the 'unborn child' were added by Congress in 1989 to make clear the EMTALA's protections applied to women who showed up to hospitals because they were in labor or facing other pregnancy-related medical emergencies.\nSupreme Court briefs filed by Idaho point to the language to argue that EMTALA's 'text demands equal treatment for \u2018the unborn child.''\n'To say that a statute that requires the protection of the unborn somehow requires doctors to take their lives in emergency rooms, it's just nonsensical,' Bursch told CNN.\nThe Charlotte Lozier Institute, an anti-abortion think tank, said in a friend-of-the-court brief that EMTALA 'expressly protects the lives of unborn children' and that it requires hospitals 'to follow the two-patient paradigm to protect both the mother and her unborn child.'\n'The United States' attempt to diminish the \u2018unborn child's' life as secondary\u2014one that must be protected only if her mother's health is not threatened but loses all value if her mother's health is in jeopardy\u2014is atextual,' the brief said. 'Congress expected hospitals and physicians to preserve both lives wherever possible.'\nIdaho's opponents counter that the provisions in question were meant to ensure that ER patients whose pregnancies were in medical trouble would receive treatment for those complications, even if the women themselves did not face serious risks to their health or possible death.\n'I think it's incredibly dangerous, the implications of what the argument Idaho is trying to push, with respect to the term and the use of the unborn child in the statute,' said Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, the deputy director of the Reproductive Freedom Project of the ACLU, which filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case.\nAbortion rights advocates fear that, beyond just the dispute over Idaho's abortion ban, the conservative majority will issue a ruling that will encourage the anti-abortion movement to take more aggressive steps in their push towards fetal personhood.\n'We have this case for the court where they are going to be talking about what the term \u2018unborn child' means. And so even though it's going to be specific to EMTALA, and its definition there, what we're going to see is anti-abortion folks seize on that, policymakers seize on what the court says,' said Borchelt of the National Women's Law Center.\nBursch said it was 'laughable' to claim the case, depending on the court rules, could lay groundwork for fetal personhood and framed the case as being more about states' authority to regulate medicine within their borders.\n'This case is about whether EMTALA regulates that state's practice of medicine and overrides Idahoans' choice to preserve life,' Bursch said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Tierney Sneed","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-1405450341.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":5.2054048,"_id":"5b35401823d797769dac2d604989b30d"},{"title":"Takeaways from the Supreme Court's arguments over obstruction charge used against January 6 rioters","author":"John Fritze","published_date":"2024-04-16 18:31:11","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/takeaways-supreme-court-january-6-rioters","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The Supreme Court's conservative majority indicated Tuesday that it may toss out a charge prosecutors have lodged against hundreds of people who took part in the January 6, 2021, riot on the US\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 The Supreme Court's conservative majority indicated Tuesday that it may toss out a charge prosecutors have lodged against hundreds of people who took part in the January 6, 2021, riot on the US Capitol, a decision that could force the Justice Department to reopen some of those cases.\nDuring over 90 minutes of arguments, most justices signaled concern with how the Justice Department is using the law enacted by Congress more than two decades ago in response to the Enron accounting scandal. Critics claimed the felony charge, which carries a prison sentence of up to 20 years, was intended to prevent evidence tampering \u2013 not an insurrection in support of a president who lost reelection.\nThe court's decision, expected by July, could have significant ramifications for some 350 people who were charged with 'obstructing' an official proceeding for their part in the Capitol attack \u2013 including more than 100 people who have already been convicted and received prison sentences.\nThe high court's ruling could also affect the federal election subversion criminal case pending against former President Donald Trump, who was also charged with the obstruction crime.\nHere's what to know about Tuesday's oral arguments:\nThe appeal was brought by a former Pennsylvania police officer, Joseph Fischer, who was charged with multiple crimes for pushing his way into the Capitol after attending Trump's rally outside the White House on January 6. Fischer's attorney told the justices that prosecutors overstepped by charging his client with what critics previously framed as an anti-shredding law.\nMostly absent from oral arguments Tuesday was recognition of the traumatic and deadly turn of events that took place just across the street from the Supreme Court three years ago after Trump ginned up a crowd with false claims of fraud and encouraged them to march on the Capitol and 'fight like hell.'\nInstead, the discussion turned largely on a technical and legalistic debate about the meaning of the words in the law \u2013 in particular the word 'otherwise.'\nThat 2002 law makes it a felony to 'corruptly' alter, destroy or mutilate a record with the intent of making it unavailable for use in an 'official proceeding,' or to 'otherwise' obstruct, influence, or impede such a proceeding. Fischer argued that, taken together, the law was geared toward prohibiting records destruction. But the Justice Department said it swept far more broadly than that, encompassing a wider range of actions \u2013 including physical intrusion \u2013 that would obstruct a proceeding.\nsaid it swept far more broadly than that, encompassing a wider range of actions \u2013 including physical intrusion \u2013 that would obstruct a proceeding. 'The key word is \u2018otherwise,'' Justice Brett Kavanaugh, often a critical vote in high-profile cases, said at one point as he quizzed Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar. 'It would be odd to have such a broad provision tucked in and connected by the word \u2018otherwise.''\nThat position seemed to draw attention from Chief Justice John Roberts as well, who at one point sharply pushed back on the government for trying to separate the 'evidence' portion of the law from a provision dealing with 'obstruction.'\n'You can't just tack it on and say, \u2018Look at it as if it's standing alone,'' Roberts said. 'Because it's not.'\nSee how the Capitol Riot on January 6 unfolded\n04:49 - Source: CNN\n04:49 - Source: CNN Occasionally, Prelogar sought to remind the justices of the details of the case at hand. In one especially pointed response to a question from Kavanaugh about the other charges the DOJ can use in Capitol riot prosecutions, Prelogar argued that Fischer, in advance of the attack, had expressed an intent to storm the Capitol and use violence if necessary to disrupt the vote.\n'He said, \u2018they can't vote if they can't breathe,'' Prelogar argued, referring to Fischer's texts from before January 6. 'And then he went to the Capitol on January 6, with that intent in mind, and took action \u2013 including assaulting a law enforcement officer \u2013 that did impede the ability of the officers to regain control of the Capitol and let Congress finish its work.'\n'And then he went to the Capitol on January 6, with that intent in mind, and took action \u2013 including assaulting a law enforcement officer \u2013 that did impede the ability of the officers to regain control of the Capitol and let Congress finish its work.' There was a heavy dose of 'whataboutism' from the conservative justices, who repeatedly brought up left-wing protests while pressing both sides about exactly which conduct they believed would \u2013 and wouldn't \u2013 be covered by the felony obstruction law.\nwould \u2013 and wouldn't \u2013 be covered by the felony obstruction law. Justice Neil Gorsuch posed several hypotheticals to Prelogar, asking if prosecutors could use the law to charge someone who participated in a sit-in that disrupted a trial 'at a federal courthouse' or who was caught 'pulling a fire alarm before a vote' in Congress.\nHe didn't mention Rep. Jamaal Bowman by name, but the allusion to the New York Democrat was clear: He pulled the fire alarm shortly before a critical vote on a government funding bill in September. Bowman later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor offense and was censured by the House.\nJustice Samuel Alito brought up the disruptions at the Golden Gate Bridge that occurred Monday.

She said many of the January 6 rioters violently breached multiple police lines, brought tactical gear and weapons, and made explicit threats before arriving in DC. The Supreme Court's three liberals appeared to be lined up in favor of the Justice Department's position that the federal obstruction law is broad enough to include the rioters' conduct on January 6.\nThe law, Justice Elena Kagan said, could have been written by Congress to limit its prohibition to evidence tampering. But, she stressed, 'it doesn't do that.'\nKagan and Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson pressed Fischer's attorney, Jeffrey Green, on the plain text of the law \u2013 embracing a conservative notion of 'textualism,' or reading the law for its plain meaning without considering legislative history and other factors.\nJackson noted that the language in the statute 'does not use the term \u2018evidence'' but rather 'uses the term \u2018official proceeding,'' which is defined as including a congressional proceeding.\nThough Trump is not a party in the case, the appeal indirectly thrust him onto the Supreme Court's docket for the third time this election year. In March, the justices unanimously ruled that the former president should appear on the ballot in Colorado despite claims he violated the 14th Amendment's 'insurrectionist ban' because of his actions on January 6.\nappear on the ballot in Colorado despite claims he violated the 14th Amendment's 'insurrectionist ban' because of his actions on January 6.

The former president and presumptive GOP nominee would almost certainly use a win for Fischer to try to further undermine the Justice Department's prosecution of the January 6 defendants. How much Fischer's case would spill over to Trump's is open for debate. Smith has argued that the obstruction charge against Trump is based on the fake slate of electors the former president attempted to have submitted to Congress, not the riot itself. Unless the court rules broadly in a way that undermines the charge entirely, the case against Trump may still stick even if Fischer wins his case.\nJustice Clarence Thomas was absent from oral arguments on Monday, with the court refusing to explain his absence. He was back on Tuesday for a case that critics say he shouldn't be involved in at all.\nThe Fischer case has prompted some liberal critics of the court to demand that Thomas recuse himself.

Thomas has ignored the requests to recuse and posed a number of questions that challenged both sides in the case.\n'There have been many violent protests that have interfered with proceedings,' Thomas asked Prelogar, pressing on a theme he returned to repeatedly during the arguments. 'Has the government applied this provision to other protests in the past?'\nPrelogar said the Justice Department has applied the law more broadly than in evidence tampering cases but acknowledged it has not been used previously against 'a situation where people have violently stormed' a building. But that, she said, was based on the unusual nature of the Capitol attack itself.\n'I'm not aware,' she said, 'of that circumstance ever happening prior to January 6.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Hannah Rabinowitz,Tierney Sneed,Marshall Cohen,John Fritze","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/pxl-20240416-180508330-2.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":5.1107783,"_id":"35d58fe0d73223c1353c363584f524d8"},{"title":"House GOP leaders plan to move on four separate bills as Johnson faces pressure over aid to Israel and Ukraine","author":"Melanie Zanona","published_date":"2024-04-15 16:45:27","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/15/politics/house-republicans-israel-ukraine-iran","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"House Republican leaders will try to pass four separate bills this week to provide aid to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan, according to three sources familiar, heeding demands from the far right to keep\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Speaker Mike Johnson announced Monday evening the House will take up separate bills this week to provide aid for Israel and Ukraine, heeding demands from the far right to keep the issues separate as the threat of a vote to oust him from the speakership looms.\nThe long-awaited decision by Johnson marks a pivotal moment for the Louisiana Republican as he has faced intense pressure from his conference over how he would handle foreign aid to the key US allies.\nJohnson predicted the House will vote Friday evening on the separate bills.\n'There are precipitating events around the globe that we're all watching very carefully,' Johnson told reporters after a GOP conference meeting Monday evening. 'And we know that the world is watching us to see how we react.'\nDespite the speaker's attempt to thread the needle, however, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who continues to dangle the threat of a vote on Johnson's ouster, was quick to criticize the foreign aid plan.\n'I am firmly against the plan as it stands right now,' Greene told reporters, though when asked whether she would force a vote on the motion to vacate as a result, she said, 'I haven't decided on that yet.'\nJohnson dismissed concerns over a vote to oust him by his conservative flank if he moves on aid to Ukraine, telling CNN, 'I don't spend my time worrying about motions to vacate. We're having to govern here and we're going to do our job.'\nIn addition to aid for Israel and Ukraine, Johnson said in a post on X that the bills would support allies in the Indo-Pacific and there would be additional measures to 'counter our adversaries and strengthen our national security.'\nBut Republican leaders could still take procedural steps to send all those pieces as one package to the Senate, which could enrage the right wing of the House GOP conference.\nJohnson left open the possibility that the bills could ultimately be packaged together, setting up a potential fight with the right flank.\n'We're discussing whether they would be merged together in one package that's sent to the Senate or if it goes over as individual measures,' Johnson said. 'My personal preference is to do it individually, but we'll let the body decide.'\nAmong the ways GOP leaders plan to address Ukraine aid: a bill to seize Russian assets, a lend-lease program for Ukraine military aid and convertible loans for humanitarian relief.\nFormer President Donald Trump, who recently met with House Speaker Mike Johnson at Mar-a-Lago, has expressed openness to structuring Ukraine aid as a loan.\nGOP Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma told CNN that Johnson is allowing germane amendment votes on these bills as well \u2013 a process that far right Republicans had been demanding of Johnson.\nIn the wake of Iran's unprecedented retaliatory strikes on Israel, Democrats have called on Johnson to bring up a Senate-passed foreign aid package that includes aid to Israel and Ukraine, but hardline conservatives have urged the Louisiana Republican against attaching Ukraine funding to any Israel aid package \u2013 a warning that comes as the speaker faces the threat of a potential vote to oust him from his leadership post.\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries urged immediate passage of the foreign aid package passed by the Senate in a new letter to colleagues.\n'The gravely serious events of this past weekend in the Middle East and Eastern Europe underscore the need for Congress to act immediately. We must take up the bipartisan and comprehensive national security bill passed by the Senate forthwith,' Jeffries wrote.\nIn November, the House passed a bill to provide $14.3 billion in aid to Israel, but Democrats objected to the fact that the bill did not include aid to Ukraine and would enact funding cuts to the Internal Revenue Service.\nThe Senate passed its bill in February \u2013 a $95.3 billion foreign aid bill with assistance for Ukraine, Israel and other priorities.\nA significant number of House Republicans are opposed to sending further aid to Ukraine. Now, Johnson faces the most significant threat to his speakership to date after GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is among those who oppose additional Ukraine aid, filed a motion against him that could be used to force a vote on his ouster.\nGreene told CNN on Monday that Trump's backing of Johnson during a Friday press conference will not deter her from moving to oust the speaker.\n'No, no, and as a matter of fact, there's more people that are probably going to be angry from whatever happens this week,' she said.\nLater, Greene said, 'He's definitely not going to be speaker next Congress if we're lucky enough to have a majority. I think that is a widely held belief throughout the Congress.'\nAsked if she thinks he'll remain speaker for the remainder of the current session of Congress, the congresswoman said, 'That is to be determined. Like I said, I'm still processing.'\nJohnson called Greene's decision to file the motion to vacate a 'distraction' during an interview on Fox News.\n'That's a distraction. What Marjorie has done with the motion to vacate is not helpful for our party, for our mission to save the country, because if we don't grow the House majority, keep the House majority, win the Senate and win back the White House for President Trump, we're going to lose the republic,' he said.\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.

Hundreds of thousands of Americans' information is incidentally collected during that process and then accessed each year without a warrant \u2014 down from millions of such queries the US government ran in past years.

'I mean, how could you not?' Rosamira Guillen laughed, gesturing up at the family above.\nWhen she learned that the illegal pet trade and slash-and-burn cattle ranching were erasing a species that lived only in her homeland of Colombia, her architect mind suddenly shifted from building zoos to rebuilding forests.\nAnd River, it didn't take long to understand that this job could not be done by dropping seeds from drones. It would take shovels and sweat and an intimate acre-by-acre knowledge of the ecology. It would take community organizing and youth education and economic development so the titi's human neighbors wouldn't need to cut down trees and poach animals to survive.\nBut to connect enough fragmented habitat for the remaining gene pool to thrive, she would need land. And the cooperation of cattle ranchers who do not share her love for toy-sized primates.\n'I would be happy to just hang out with the monkeys and in the forest than to have to interact with people,' she laughed as we bumped over dirt roads in her worn pickup, and described how wanton deforestation can change water cycles and trigger ecosystem crash.\n'In a country like Colombia, where there's so many challenges, people don't realize that if you screw up the forest we're all going to be screwed. The ranchers see us as romantic,' she laughed with grim resignation.\nBut still, Rosamira wanted to be a helper, and in a search for funding met an American super-helper named Charlie Knowles.\nAs the scion of a family that invented the small microphones used in everything from Apollo spacecraft to Richard Nixon's office to the iPhone, Charlie went into software and made enough of a fortune to retire at 34. Inspired by the story of biologist Laurie Marker who sold all her possessions and moved to Namibia to save cheetahs, Charlie told me he felt the same calling but knew that he had none of the skills required.\n'What are my core competencies?' he asked himself. 'I'm really good at throwing parties and raising money.'\nWith a cheetah borrowed from a petting zoo as a conversation starter, his first party raised $5,000, and with kindred souls from Silicon Valley, he set out to disrupt the world of nature philanthropy. 'I became really frustrated by the lack of transparency,' Charlie told me. 'I didn't feel I knew where my money was going or what the impact it was having.'\nSo \u2013 alongside Akiko Yamazaki, John Lukas \u2013 Charlie co-founded the Wildlife Conservation Network and instead of telling donors to simply write a check and trust the process, WCN set out to create venture capital for animals like the titi and helpers like Rosamira.\nThey created expos to connect philanthropists in wealthy American suburbs with data-proven, wilderness-restoring, boots-on-the-ground conservationists. And they helped those folks make their operations more efficient and effective and often expanded their original vision of what was possible.\nMore than 20 years later, Charlie tells me that WCN supports hundreds of projects around the world with raves from the likes of Jane Goodall and a rare perfect score of 100 from the watchdog Charity Navigator.\nOne million-dollar donation funded over 200 scholarships for kids to study conservation. Another donor personally installed over 50 solar power arrays around the world. And at an expo in 2006, the fate of the titis turned for the better when the Vargas family walked in.\n'I told my 12-year-old daughter, Kira, to go interview all the conservationists at the expo,' Chris Vargas told me. As another successful tech entrepreneur with a heart for wildlife and some money to give, he was searching for maximum bang for his buck.\n'And on the drive home. I said, \u2018Who is your favorite?' Mine was Rosamira. She's Steve Jobs and Jane Goodall all wrapped into one. Her energy, her passion, her clarity of purpose and her just sheer ingenuity,' Chris said. 'But I wanted my daughter's vote, without missing a beat she goes, \u2018Daddy, you know that that woman from Colombia? Rosamira? She was my favorite'. So we high fived.'\nFor 18 years, the Vargas family would support Rosamira as she revived her corner of Colombia, one tree at a time. But when she needed $1.2 million to buy nearly 1,000 acres of neighboring ranchland, Chris needed to find more helpers.\n'We thought, \u2018Why don't we just build a website? And build a technology that lets anybody in the world click on a map, pick an acre, pick ten acres, pick 50 acres, and get all that feedback one exactly what happened with your money.''\nCombining the eyes of a satellite and the hearts of nature lovers, Chris began an experiment in crowdsourced conservation he called ReWorld.\nFor a one-time donation of around $1,200, he promised to secure two-and-a-half acres of degraded Colombian forest, bring it back to life and preserve it for the titis forever. Thanks to real-time images from the satellite, the donors would be able to watch their hectare grow from scrub brush and dirt into trees that look like broccoli tops from the sky.\nRiver, after we watched the cotton-topped titis pass by, I followed Rosamira's team to a shady gully where I planted a tree dedicated to you and your sister, Olivia. We flew home, and after my story of the titis aired just once on CNN, enough helpers pitched in to buy the ranch.\nI just got word that Rosamira signed the papers today.\n'It may take a day to cut a hectare of forest,' she told me as we hiked past her plantings and into a meticulous greenhouse.

Their refusal to lead the US into debt or financial crises or to compromise America's global role ended up driving them into political oblivion.\nNow, as Johnson tries to pass billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan \u2014 vital to protecting US allies from Russian, Iranian and Chinese totalitarianism and preserving US power and prestige \u2013 he's having to put his own job on the line to confront GOP extremists who accuse him of betraying the party's base.\n'When you do the right thing, you let the chits fall where they may,' Johnson said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on Wednesday ahead of three critical days that could decide whether he can cling to his gavel.\nThe prospects for the rookie speaker look grim. His tiny majority means he can't afford to lose more than one GOP vote to pass a bill on a party-line vote. And two hardliners, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, are threatening to call a vote to oust him if he puts the Ukraine bill on the floor.\nOther right-wing Republicans are warning Johnson must make $60 billion in Ukraine aid conditional on tough new border security measures despite the party's trashing of the most conservative immigration compromise in decades at presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump's behest.\nThe schism in the GOP highlights how Trump has eroded the party's internationalist principles in favor of his 'America First' creed. Lawmakers like Greene and Texas Rep. Chip Roy counter traditional national security arguments by warning there is no greater US interest than protecting the southern border, following high levels of crossing by undocumented migrants in recent months.\nRoy, who is yet to decide whether to back an effort to oust Johnson, told CNN Wednesday that he was 'disappointed' in the speaker and was 'past the point of giving grace.' Johnson's increasing vulnerability on this issue is particularly acute since he was also arguing for months that there could be no Ukraine aid without using the same measure to force the White House to introduce draconian measures at the US border with Mexico.\nRising right-wing opposition to his foreign aid plans has left Johnson in a deeply vulnerable position. To even pass a rule to set up a cascading series of votes on the bills this weekend, Johnson is almost certain to need Democratic votes. The minority party may also have to save him if Greene calls up her motion to vacate the speaker's chair \u2013 a step several Democrats say they are prepared to take to ensure that Ukraine aid will pass at a moment when Kyiv warns it will lose its war of survival without urgent help. This could save Johnson in the short term. But a GOP speaker dependent on Democratic votes will be seen by many Republicans as a tool of the minority party and would be on borrowed time.\nJohnson's problem is a more extreme version of one that has dogged Republican speakers for years. A strong but small group of right-wing Republicans elected on absolutist platforms in deep-red districts comes to Washington with an expansive agenda and adamant they won't compromise with Democrats. But they lack the power or numbers to force their will apart from in the rare phases when Republicans have a monopoly on Washington power. The frustrated extremists then turn on GOP leaders and accuse them of becoming traitors \u2013 simply because they live in the land of political reality.\nFor example, Greene told CNN's Manu Raju on Wednesday: 'I don't know how long people are going to tolerate this because he is doing nothing but serving the Democrats.'\nJohnson, who is facing claims that he's sold out despite being possibly the most conservative speaker in history, tried to explain his constraints in the interview with Tapper. 'The Republicans run the House. We have the smallest majority in the House. The Democrats are in charge of the Senate and the White House. So, by definition, we won't get everything we want,' he said.\nThe idea, however, that the party should settle for something less than an absolutist position is not one that flies in the modern GOP, where stunt politics that play well on conservative media are as important as legislating. 'There's certain members that just prefer the minority,' Texas GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw, who supports sending new aid to Ukraine, told CNN's Raju. 'It's easier, just, you can always just be against something, you never really have to work.'\nThe speaker had seemed to buy himself some time after traveling to Mar-a-Lago last week to bolster Trump's false claims of election fraud and securing in return about the strongest public endorsement the ex-president is likely to give. Johnson 'is doing a very good job,' Trump said. Logic suggests that the presumptive GOP nominee has an interest in delaying a third debacle over electing a GOP speaker since the party won the majority in the 2022 midterm elections because it might distract from his own campaign to take back the White House. Yet Greene, one of Trump's top supporters, hasn't taken his hint and is still determined to bring Johnson down. The speaker might be wise not to trust Trump. Loyalty to others is a fungible commodity for the ex-president. Once Trump senses an associate is vulnerable or no longer serves his political interests, he usually casts them loose.\nJohnson's push to put foreign aid bills on the floor separately ahead of a possible attempt to jam them together to send to the Senate \u2013 another move infuriating hardliners \u2013 might be a logical solution in a normal House. In this way, those who oppose Ukraine aid on principle could vote against it, allowing Democrats who support it to ensure its passage. There could be a strong bipartisan vote to help Israel, days after Iran's air attacks, and to support Taiwan, which is increasingly vulnerable to China's massive military buildup. And Republicans could get cover by voting for a separate bill that Johnson plans to put on the floor strengthening border security. But the extreme polarization of the GOP majority \u2013 and the lack of maneuvering room Johnson has after the 'red wave' failed to materialize in the 2022 midterms \u2013 gives individual members the opportunity to create chaos and makes governing all but impossible.\nOn Wednesday evening, for example, in another defeat for Johnson, the House Rules Committee recessed because it was unable to pass a rule on the border security bill, with Republicans threatening to vote against the measure in committee.\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Johnson's new strategy is the way that he is now forcibly arguing about the need for the US to send billions of dollars in aid to its allies. (In order to placate some Republicans, some economic aid to Ukraine has been refashioned as a loan). As a backbencher, Johnson voted against sending more funds to Ukraine several times and he's been careful in his six months as speaker not to get too far ahead of GOP critics of bankrolling Kyiv's war effort.\nBut on Wednesday, he was making the kind of foreign policy argument that could have been voiced by any GOP leader from President Dwight Eisenhower to President George W. Bush \u2013 one that was a clear departure from Trumpism.\n'We are going to stand by Israel, our close ally and dear friend, and we're going to stand for freedom and make sure that Vladimir Putin doesn't march through Europe. These are important responsibilities,' Johnson told Tapper. 'Since World War II, really, the responsibility for the free world has been shifted onto our shoulders. And we accept that role. We're an exceptional nation.'\nJohnson added: 'We're the greatest nation on the planet, and we have to act like it. And we have to project to Putin and Xi and Iran and North Korea and anybody else that we will defend freedom.'\nIt was not immediately clear what has prompted Johnson's change of emphasis.\nThe shocking magnitude of Iran's missile and drone attack on Israel last week \u2013 even if it was largely repelled by US, Israeli, British and Jordanian military forces \u2013 has concentrated minds on Capitol Hill about the urgency of replenishing the Israeli arsenal.\nUkraine's need is even more acute. Russia has continued relentless attacks on civilians and infrastructure, and there have been multiple warnings from top US defense and intelligence officials that without Biden's vitally needed aid package, Kyiv could lose the war. 'I think we're already seeing things on the battlefield begin to shift a bit in terms of in Russia's favor,' Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told the House Defense Appropriations subcommittee Wednesday. The implications for a Russian victory would be grave and create new security threats to the West in Europe. And the possibility that the United States would abandon a fellow democracy under assault from a ruthless leader in the Kremlin would shatter the country's reputation abroad and weaken its power as a result. That may be a stain the speaker doesn't want on his conscience or as part of his legacy.\nJohnson, unlike his extremist members, has responsibilities as speaker \u2013 one of the great offices of state that go beyond short-term political interests. And he's been under relentless pressure from foreign leaders, as well as the White House. Biden, for instance, warned in a Wall Street Journal article Wednesday that 'both Ukraine and Israel are under attack by brazen adversaries that seek their annihilation.'\nIf Johnson can somehow engineer passage of the bills aiding Israel and Ukraine this weekend, he'd be bolstering a global leadership role the US played for decades. It's a measure of how much the GOP has changed that such a role might be considered political apostasy and could cost him his job.\nBut he told reporters on Wednesday evening, while making the case that military aid for Ukraine was now critical, 'I'm doing here what I believe to be the right thing.'\n'History judges us for what we do.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Stephen Collinson,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2148847580-20240417203920057-20240417203938535.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":4.917893,"_id":"a86c8553abada7c443341c7f46d64669"},{"title":"Analysis: Doing \u2018the right thing' may cost Johnson his speaker's gavel","author":"Stephen Collinson","published_date":"2024-04-18 04:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/politics/mike-johnson-foreign-aid-analysis","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"It took less than six months for Speaker Mike Johnson to reach his existential moment.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 It took less than six months for Speaker Mike Johnson to reach his existential moment.\nThe Louisiana Republican has arrived at fateful but familiar crossroads where he must either choose to honor a conventional vision of US national interests or side with the wrecking ball antics of his party's far-right bloc.\nIt's a choice with which his immediate predecessors \u2013 Kevin McCarthy, Paul Ryan and John Boehner \u2013 wrestled before him.

Loyalty to others is a fungible commodity for the ex-president. Once Trump senses an associate is vulnerable or no longer serves his political interests, he usually casts them loose.\nJohnson's push to put foreign aid bills on the floor separately ahead of a possible attempt to jam them together to send to the Senate \u2013 another move infuriating hardliners \u2013 might be a logical solution in a normal House. In this way, those who oppose Ukraine aid on principle could vote against it, allowing Democrats who support it to ensure its passage. There could be a strong bipartisan vote to help Israel, days after Iran's air attacks, and to support Taiwan, which is increasingly vulnerable to China's massive military buildup. And Republicans could get cover by voting for a separate bill that Johnson plans to put on the floor strengthening border security. But the extreme polarization of the GOP majority \u2013 and the lack of maneuvering room Johnson has after the 'red wave' failed to materialize in the 2022 midterms \u2013 gives individual members the opportunity to create chaos and makes governing all but impossible.\nOn Wednesday evening, for example, in another defeat for Johnson, the House Rules Committee recessed because it was unable to pass a rule on the border security bill, with Republicans threatening to vote against the measure in committee.\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Johnson's new strategy is the way that he is now forcibly arguing about the need for the US to send billions of dollars in aid to its allies. (In order to placate some Republicans, some economic aid to Ukraine has been refashioned as a loan). As a backbencher, Johnson voted against sending more funds to Ukraine several times and he's been careful in his six months as speaker not to get too far ahead of GOP critics of bankrolling Kyiv's war effort.\nBut on Wednesday, he was making the kind of foreign policy argument that could have been voiced by any GOP leader from President Dwight Eisenhower to President George W. Bush \u2013 one that was a clear departure from Trumpism.\n'We are going to stand by Israel, our close ally and dear friend, and we're going to stand for freedom and make sure that Vladimir Putin doesn't march through Europe. These are important responsibilities,' Johnson told Tapper. 'Since World War II, really, the responsibility for the free world has been shifted onto our shoulders. And we accept that role. We're an exceptional nation.'\nJohnson added: 'We're the greatest nation on the planet, and we have to act like it. And we have to project to Putin and Xi and Iran and North Korea and anybody else that we will defend freedom.'\nIt was not immediately clear what has prompted Johnson's change of emphasis.\nThe shocking magnitude of Iran's missile and drone attack on Israel last week \u2013 even if it was largely repelled by US, Israeli, British and Jordanian military forces \u2013 has concentrated minds on Capitol Hill about the urgency of replenishing the Israeli arsenal.\nUkraine's need is even more acute. Russia has continued relentless attacks on civilians and infrastructure, and there have been multiple warnings from top US defense and intelligence officials that without Biden's vitally needed aid package, Kyiv could lose the war. 'I think we're already seeing things on the battlefield begin to shift a bit in terms of in Russia's favor,' Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told the House Defense Appropriations subcommittee Wednesday. The implications for a Russian victory would be grave and create new security threats to the West in Europe. And the possibility that the United States would abandon a fellow democracy under assault from a ruthless leader in the Kremlin would shatter the country's reputation abroad and weaken its power as a result. That may be a stain the speaker doesn't want on his conscience or as part of his legacy.\nJohnson, unlike his extremist members, has responsibilities as speaker \u2013 one of the great offices of state that go beyond short-term political interests. And he's been under relentless pressure from foreign leaders, as well as the White House. Biden, for instance, warned in a Wall Street Journal article Wednesday that 'both Ukraine and Israel are under attack by brazen adversaries that seek their annihilation.'\nIf Johnson can somehow engineer passage of the bills aiding Israel and Ukraine this weekend, he'd be bolstering a global leadership role the US played for decades. It's a measure of how much the GOP has changed that such a role might be considered political apostasy and could cost him his job.\nBut he told reporters on Wednesday evening, while making the case that military aid for Ukraine was now critical, 'I'm doing here what I believe to be the right thing.'\n'History judges us for what we do.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Stephen Collinson","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2148847580-20240417203920057-20240417203938535.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":4.9143357,"_id":"8b571f68271be9eb601c237659289ffc"},{"title":"Supreme Court to review Biden's \u2018ghost gun' regulations","author":"John Fritze","published_date":"2024-04-22 13:34:37","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/22/politics/supreme-court-to-review-bidens-ghost-gun-regulations","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide whether the Biden administration overstepped a 1968 federal law by imposing new regulations on the makers of 'ghost guns,' mail-order kits that allow\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide whether the Biden administration overstepped a 1968 federal law by imposing new regulations on the makers of 'ghost guns,' mail-order kits that allow people to build untraceable guns at home.\nGhost guns are kits that a user can purchase online to assemble a fully functional firearm at home. They carry no serial numbers, do not require background checks and provide no transfer records for traceability. Critics say they are attractive to people who are otherwise legally prohibited from buying firearms.\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives approved a regulation in 2022 that required the manufacturers to have serial numbers on the kits and keep records of who purchased them. Advocacy groups and five companies that manufacture the kits sued, arguing the regulation wasn't permitted under law.\nThe rule does not prohibit the sale or possession of any ghost gun kit, nor does it block an individual from purchasing such a kit. Instead, it requires compliance with federal laws that impose conditions on the commercial sale of firearms.\nA US district court in Texas threw out the rule and the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals mostly upheld that decision. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, has weighed into the case twice on its emergency docket, pausing lower court rulings that barred the regulation from taking effect.\nLast summer, a 5-4 court sided with the Biden administration in the first emergency request, allowing the regulations to remain in effect while legal challenges played out. At the time, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett sided with the liberal justices in the administration's favor.\nAfter the order was issued, the district court stepped in to block the regulations as applied to two manufacturers. The Supreme Court stepped in again last fall to allow the regulations to remain in effect.\nThe Biden administration said police departments have faced an 'explosion of crimes involving ghost guns' in recent years. In 2017, police submitted about 1,600 ghost guns for tracing. Four years later, the number had grown to more than 19,000.\nBoth sides \u2013 the administration and the manufacturers \u2013 asked the Supreme Court to take the case.\nThe kit makers said their product is intended to cater to 'law-abiding citizens making their own firearms' and accused the Biden administration of attempting to shut their companies down.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,John Fritze","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2147857583.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":4.8769655,"_id":"9f4768aa02fe83028ed59f1bd5dea923"},{"title":"CIA director warns Ukraine\u00a0could\u00a0lose war\u00a0with\u00a0Russia by the end of the year unless US sends more aid","author":"Katie Bo Lillis","published_date":"2024-04-18 19:12:57","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/18/politics/cia-director-ukraine-russia-warning","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"CIA Director Bill Burns on Thursday warned that unless US sends more military support, Ukraine could 'lose' the war against Russia by the end of the year.","summary":"CIA Director Bill Burns on Thursday warned that unless US sends more military support, Ukraine could 'lose' the war against Russia by the end of the year.\nHis comments mark one of the starkest warnings to date from the Biden administration on the stakes in Ukraine as Congress debates whether to approve a long-delayed aid package to Kyiv.\nJust a month ago, Burns had warned in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee that if Congress did not move to authorize additional support \u2014 long hampered by conservative opposition in the House of Representatives \u2014 'Ukraine is likely to lose ground and probably significant ground in 2024.'\nBut on Thursday during an appearance at the George W. Bush Center, he warned that Ukraine could be forced to capitulate entirely.\n'With the boost that would come from military assistance, both practically and psychologically, I think the Ukrainians are entirely capable of holding their own through 2024,' Burns said.\n'Without supplemental assistance, the picture is a lot more dire,' he continued. 'There is a very real risk that the Ukrainians could lose on the battlefield by the end of 2024, or at least put Putin in a position where he could dictate the terms of a political settlement.'\nThe warning comes as the Biden administration is trying to seize an unexpected political opportunity on Capitol Hill to push the House to pass the long-stalled aid package. The legislation also includes aid for Israel, and as a result, House Speaker Mike Johnson has been under pressure to move the package after the Iranian attack on Israel over the weekend. In an effort to satisfy divided factions of the GOP, some of whom support and some of whom oppose aid for Ukraine, he has split the legislation into separate bills and the Ukraine aid portion is expected to come up for a vote on Saturday night.\nBurns on Thursday did not detail further how he defined 'lose,' and one source familiar with Western intelligence noted to CNN that if the package doesn't pass, officials still believe Russia is unlikely to overrun Ukraine from coast to coast.\nBut Russia could retake significant additional territory then effectively freeze the battlelines in place in a de facto ceasefire, similar to what happened after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in 2014. That would still be deemed 'a loss.'\nBurns detailed the dire need for basic ammunition that Ukraine faces on the battlefield. He recounted two battalions \u2014 2,000-plus man units \u2014 that had '15 artillery rounds per day' and 'a grand total of 42 mortar rounds,' respectively.\n'They were overwhelmed, and it wasn't for lack of bravery or determination on their part, and my worry is that we're going to see more Avdiivkas in the future without supplemental assistance,' Burns said, referring to a Ukrainian city recently lost to Russian advances.\nUkraine's shortage of ammunition and military equipment resulting from the US and its allies' struggle to resupply the country's military has had an increasingly dire effect on the battlefield, CNN has previously reported.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Katie Bo Lillis","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/570408b3-0268-4a0b-bccd-7d54134fa125.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":4.732683,"_id":"d2fdb5627625d074eb060fdfb613573d"},{"title":"Opinion: The basic problem with putting Trump on trial","author":"Patrick T.

CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 In his 1987 novel about a high-profile criminal trial in New York City, author Tom Wolfe has one of the lead characters, Assistant District Attorney Larry Kramer, share an open secret about how juries are selected: 'You get people who come into the jury box with their minds \u2013 how should I say it? \u2013 set in a certain way. There's a lot of Us versus Them.'\nIn 'The Bonfire of the Vanities,' the big dividing line was race. In this week's mammoth New York trial of former President Donald Trump on charges of falsifying business records in connection to hush money paid to an adult film star, the yawning gap between 'Us' and 'Them' is along partisan lines.\nThat dynamic has already reared its head, as at least 50 jurors \u2013 representing more than half of the first group of prospective jurors \u2013 were dismissed on the first day of jury selection Monday because they said they couldn't be impartial. The mass dismissal underscores the difficulty of finding acceptable jurors and is just the first obstacle facing the unprecedented prosecution of a former president that will leave a bad taste in many voters' mouths from the unmistakable political undertones.\nIt should come as no surprise that it will be hard to find jurors who don't bring strong political predispositions to bear given that the motivation for bringing this case looks to be so transparently political. The circus that is the first-ever criminal trial of a former president illustrates why this particular case may have been a poor choice to break that precedent.\nThough seven were sworn in on Tuesday, there were still illustrations of the problems of a politicized jury pool. One potential juror who underwent questioning, for instance, was subsequently struck for cause after Trump's team found social media posts from the juror referencing Trump that say, 'Get him out' and 'Lock him up.'\nRelated article Opinion: Don't call it a \u2018hush money' case\nRelated article Opinion: Don't call it a \u2018hush money' case Indeed, it seems unlikely that this case would be being prosecuted with the same vigor and creative legal theorizing if Trump were an everyday citizen. After all, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg came into office promising to focus on the ongoing investigation of Trump, and would have likely felt political heat from New York Democrats had he decided to close the investigation without bringing charges.\nIn the end, as The New York Times reported in March 2023, Bragg's office took a 'circuitous and sometimes uncertain road' to filing criminal charges, reviving a dying investigation that originally focused on Trump's business practices with a renewed focus on hush money payments.\nTo Bragg's supporters, it's a mark of his diligence and fortitude that he left no stone unturned. To his detractors, the drawn-out investigation, seeming to pivot from one potential crime to another, gives the impression of a DA looking for a crime to pin on an unfavored individual. (Trump has pleaded not guilty.)\nAfter all, making hush money payments, as Trump is alleged to have done with former adult film actress Stormy Daniels, isn't illegal. Instead, the case is built around a rather aggressive interpretation of the relevant statutes: In his records, Trump recorded his reimbursement to former 'fixer' Michael Cohen, who handled the Daniels payment, as a legal expense. This deception would normally be considered a misdemeanor offense in New York state.\nBut Bragg, unwilling to let Trump off the hook easily, is hinging his case on the allegation that this misdemeanor offense was in service of a violation of federal campaign finance laws. The Federal Election Commission opted not to charge Trump with a violation of election law on this front, with two Republican commissioners noting that Cohen had already pleaded guilty in relation to the alleged violation, and further government action 'was not the best use of resources.'\nAnother problem, as National Review's Andrew McCarthy has pointed out, is that Bragg, a state prosecutor, is seeking to enforce a federal statute, bringing this case against an offense 'that the feds themselves did not believe Trump committed, and that Bragg is politically engineering into a new election law of his very own.'\nNot that Trump is blameless in this. Trump's manifest character flaws and history of shady dealings are being highlighted, once again, by a trial that includes the phrases 'hush money' and 'porn star.' And even while this case faces significant legal scrutiny from lawyers and legal commentators, his other pending trials, such as his handling of classified materials at his Mar-a-Lago home or his attempt to bully Georgia election officials in 2020, do run a much stronger risk of placing him in serious legal danger.\nIn a sense, it's hard to blame the jurors who feel they can't be impartial. For decades, Trump has been a fixture on our airwaves, social media sites and political coverage. And his well-documented celebrity, outrageous social media posts and charged political rhetoric make him a challenge for even the most sober-minded juror to treat as an individual rather than a politician.\nTrump also has an unquestioned ability to push his supporters to defend the indefensible, even as he induces his opponents to stretch the envelope in their attempts to derail his candidacy. As such, no matter how the current trial is resolved, it will emphasize yet again how Republicans could \u2013 and, I would argue, should \u2013 have picked a presidential nominee with less baggage.\nBut they didn't, and now many are feeling a rally-round-the-flag effect in what is likely the first and potentially only Trump criminal case that's going to trial before Election Day.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook If Democrats are so willing to come up with creative legal theories to keep him out of office, some voters may think that all their rhetoric about 'constitutional norms' wasn't as high-minded as it sounded.\nThe recent Supreme Court decision unanimously striking down Colorado's attempt to remove Trump from the ballot was a reminder that too-cute attempts to keep Trump out of the White House can backfire. And the flimsiness of the hush money case will allow Trump's supporters to downplay the seriousness of the other charges against him, making it less likely that they will have a significant political impact in November.\nBragg's decision to bring this case, with its attenuated connection to an actual crime, can't be taken out of its political context. The weakness of this case muddies the water for future efforts to attack Trump's more egregious conduct. The jury selection and following court maneuverings will highlight how strong the disagreements are between 'Us' and 'Them.' And Trump's ability to push both his supporters and his detractors past the bounds of normal political battles, and to pull out all the stops to win, will remain unparalleled.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Opinion Patrick T.

The redesign is the company's latest effort to reduce the environmental impacts from its cups, which have been criticized for piling up waste.\nThe new cups were developed internally at Starbucks as part of its ongoing sustainability efforts to reduce its waste and carbon output in half by 2030. Similar to other large companies, the chain wants to cut down on its reliance on plastic because the material is mostly made from polymers created from dangerous fossil fuels.\nThe new cups will debut at select US and Canada locations this year, with the full rollout expected to be complete by spring 2025.\nIn addition to using less plastic for the cups themselves \u2014 Starbucks projects the new cups will save more than 13.5 million pounds of plastic going to landfills annually \u2014 it is 'projected to reduce emissions and conserve water in the production process,' the chain said.\nStarbucks said it conducted tests with baristas and customers to ensure the changeover doesn't reduce the cups' sturdiness or ability to keep drinks cold.\nSlight design tweaks includes the addition of new accessibility features, including black and white 'fill lines' that allows for contrast against light and dark-colored drinks.\nAnother change is that tall, grande and venti cups now use the same-sized lid; in the past, the tall cup used its own lid and grande and venti cups shared the same one.\nFor employees, that will cut down on clutter and save time finding the correct lid. Starbucks also said that it added embossed letters on the bottom of the cup, so 'baristas can quickly confirm what size they're grabbing during a busy rush when all the cups are stacked upside down.'\nStarbucks notes its largest trenta size, which holds 31 ounces, will still use a different lid size.\nCups \u2014 and the waste they create \u2014 have long been a major issue for Starbucks.\nIn January, the chain expanded the way customers can have their drinks filled with their own cups by adding option to drive-thru and app orders.\nOther sustainable ideas Starbucks have tried included experimenting with a borrow-a-cup program, in which customers pay a deposit for a durable cup that they take with them and drop back off after use.\nIn a test location in Seattle in 2021, customers paid a $1 deposit and had to return the recyclable cup to a smart bin located in the store to get their dollar back. The company has tested similar pilot programs in Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom.\nStill, these tests and changes aren't enough to solve the 'plastic crisis,' according to Emma Priestland, global corporate campaigns coordinator for Break Free from Plastic.\n'While the world urgently needs to cut plastic production for the sake of the climate, from the perspective of waste management and the amount of plastic pollution entering the environment, simply reducing the amount of plastic but keeping the same number of plastic items is a false solution,' she told CNN.\nPriestland suggests that Starbucks develop reusable and returnable on-the-go cups to help them fully achieve their sustainability goals.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"food","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Jordan Valinsky","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cold-cup-lineup-with-lids.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":4.6106005,"_id":"953c06cc5606cf40457b403cb0aa8357"},{"title":"House GOP lines up bills targeting Iran as Congress remains divided over how to send aid to Israel","author":"Clare Foran","published_date":"2024-04-15 16:45:27","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/15/politics/house-republicans-israel-ukraine-iran","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"House Republicans have lined up a slate of bills targeting Iran and showing support for Israel, but the exact path forward for aid to Israel remains unclear as Congress remains divided over the issue\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 House Republicans have lined up a slate of bills targeting Iran and showing support for Israel, but the exact path forward for aid to Israel remains unclear as Congress remains divided over the issue in the wake of Iran's unprecedented retaliatory strikes on Israel.\nIn the aftermath of the attack, Democrats have called on Speaker Mike Johnson to bring up a Senate-passed foreign aid package that includes aid to Israel and Ukraine, but hardline conservatives have urged Johnson against attaching Ukraine funding to any Israel aid package \u2013 a warning that comes as the Louisiana Republican faces the threat of a potential vote to oust him from his leadership post.\nJohnson did not respond to questions from CNN on Monday on how Congress will respond to Iran's attack, including whether he will tie Israel and Ukraine aid together.\nIn the meantime, House Republicans have announced that a series of pro-Israel and anti-Iran bills will be taken up, including a measure condemning the attack by Iran and affirming that lawmakers stand with Israel and support its right to respond to Iranian aggression.\nJohnson has indicated he will put some sort of Israel aid bill on the floor but has said the details are still being finalized.

Now, Johnson faces the most significant threat to his speakership to date after GOP Rep.

The Republican primary was also decided in a runoff Tuesday, with real estate lawyer Caroleene Dobson clinching the nomination over former state Sen. Dick Brewbaker.\nFigures will be the favorite against Dobson in November in a seat that cuts across the southern portion of the state and would have backed President Joe Biden by 12 points in 2020. Victory for Figures would likely see him make history with Rep. Terri Sewell, a fellow Black Democrat who is heavily favored to win an eighth term in the neighboring deep-blue seat. Alabama has never had two Black members in its congressional delegation serving at the same time.\nThe new seat came into existence after a three-judge panel approved a new map last fall that significantly boosted the district's Black population, creating a pickup opportunity for Democrats with control of the US House on the line in this year's elections. The fight over the new Alabama map went all the way to the US Supreme Court, which in a surprise ruling affirmed the panel's opinion that ordered the state to include a second Black-majority district or 'something quite close to it.'\nA statement by former US Attorney General Eric Holder, who chairs a national Democratic redistricting group, called Tuesday's election 'another step toward progress and increased voter turnout as a result of the state's new, fair map.'\n'Alabama voters now stand on the cusp of making history in November, when Black Alabamians could \u2014 for the first time \u2014 elect two members of Congress who truly reflect their political desires,' Holder said.\nBefore court action, Alabama \u2013 which is 27% Black \u2013 had one Black-majority district out of seven seats.\nPrior to entering the race, Figures served as deputy chief of staff to US Attorney General Merrick Garland. He also worked in the Obama administration and as a counsel in Congress.\nFigures comes from a prominent family in Alabama politics. His late father, Michael Figures, was a state senator and lawyer, who assisted in bringing a successful lawsuit against the United Klans of America and others over the lynching of a Black teenager in 1981 that effectively bankrupted the organization.

A similar amendment narrowly failed in the House last week when the bill was passed there.\n'We are going to have people who will want amendments, and so that's what it's going to take. I assume they'll want to have the same vote they had in the (House) on search warrants,' he said. 'There is going to be a bit of a pile up, I think. But hopefully we'll be able to transact FISA.'\nWithout a time and amendment agreement, it could take the Senate until Sunday to process the bill, meaning a lapse in the programs would occur.\nOne conservative senator with concerns over FISA was hopeful Democrats who control the chamber will cede to their demands and the bill will pass in time.\n'I would imagine we get amendments considering how important this is,' said Alabama GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who said most of the Republicans he's talked to would be satisfied if they got votes on amendments.\n'They don't want this to run out,' he said referencing pressure on Democrats to make a deal.\nA top Democratic senator, Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, told reporters Monday that he believes the intelligence community could continue eavesdropping for a year or more even after the program lapses.\n'My staff tells me there are provisions for that possibility, that they can continue applying FISA, I think, for a year or even longer,' he said.'\nBut that was sharply disputed by top Republicans.\n'That's not true,' said Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee. 'I know there is a legal theory that because the Foreign Surveillance Court certified the program for a year that somehow, maybe, we can continue to use those tools. But I don't believe that's true. I think that certification was in expectation that the authorization would resume.'\nCornyn added that it's very important the authority is not interrupted: '60% of the president's daily brief is composed of 702 derived material, so this is absolutely critical.'\nSen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, agreed.\n'I think that if it's not authorized, you have to be very careful with it. As sympathetic as I may be to that concept, they better follow the law,' he said. 'That was an unproductive comment by Sen. Durbin, probably out of frustration. But that is not what we want to be doing.'\nOne Democratic aide involved in the issue said when there was a previous lapse in Section 702 authority, providers like Google and AT&T stopped giving material to the government, so that would be at risk now.\nRepublican senators who are demanding FISA amendment votes are some of the same group that is frustrated that Democrats are poised to short-circuit the impeachment trial of DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas when it hits the floor Tuesday and Wednesday. Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah is venting that frustration, in part, by forcing the Senate to take time-consuming procedural votes on motions that are typically approved by unanimous consent.\nDurbin was asked if he was concerned Lee's moves could cause FISA to lapse.\n'I'm always concerned with Mike Lee,' he said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ted Barrett,Ted,CNN,Ted  Barrett","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231216171105-us-capitol-dome-1024.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":4.4770617,"_id":"aa122e297be52958f77762070c40c9d1"},{"title":"Federal appeals court blocks West Virginia from enforcing anti-trans sports ban against 13-year-old girl","author":"Devan Cole","published_date":"2024-04-16 18:09:11","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/west-virginia-anti-trans-sports-ban/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that West Virginia cannot enforce its anti-trans sports ban against a 13-year-old girl, dealing a blow to one of nearly two dozen such laws enacted by GOP-led\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that West Virginia cannot enforce its anti-transgender sports ban against a 13-year-old girl, dealing a blow to one of nearly two dozen such laws enacted by GOP-led states in recent years.\nThe 4th Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals said in a 2-1 decision that the state cannot 'lawfully' enforce its law against Becky Pepper-Jackson, a transgender athlete who has been challenging the ban since it was enacted in 2021.\n'The question before us is whether the Act may lawfully be applied to prevent a 13-year-old transgender girl who takes puberty blocking medication and has publicly identified as a girl since the third grade from participating in her school's cross country and track teams. We hold it cannot,' Circuit Judge Toby Heytens wrote in the decision, which was joined by Judge Pamela Harris.\nThe ruling is a major win for LGBTQ advocates, who have brought challenges against a slew of anti-trans laws enacted by Republican-led states over the past several years, including ones prohibiting minors from accessing gender-affirming care.\nSigned into law by West Virginia Republican Gov. Jim Justice in 2021, the 'Save Women's Sports Act' bans transgender women and girls from participating on public school sports teams consistent with their gender identity.\nThe court's majority said the law violates Pepper-Jackson's rights under Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex at schools that receive federal aid.\n'B.P.J. has shown that applying the Act to her would treat her worse than people to whom she is similarly situated, deprive her of any meaningful athletic opportunities, and do so on the basis of sex,' Heytens wrote.\nJudge Steven Agee wrote in a partial dissent that 'allowing transgender girls \u2013 regardless of any advantage \u2013 as participants in biological girls' sports turns Title IX on its head and reverses the monumental work Title IX has done to promote girls' sports from its inception.'\nAgee said he would have allowed the state to enforce the law against Pepper-Jackson and concluded his dissenting opinion by writing: 'One can only hope that the Supreme Court will take the opportunity with all deliberate speed to resolve these questions of national importance.'\nLower courts had temporarily blocked West Virginia from enforcing the law against Pepper-Jackson, whose lawsuit against the sports ban asked that the state be prohibited from enforcing it against her, instead of declaring it totally invalid. The federal judge who initially blocked the law in 2021 reversed course last year and sided with state officials.\nAs the yearslong litigation played out, West Virginia last year asked the US Supreme Court to let it enforce the law while the lower courts considered the case, but the justices, in an unsigned order, declined. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito said they would have granted the request.\nJoshua Block, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who represents Pepper-Jackson, said in a statement Tuesday that the appeals court ruling 'is a tremendous victory for our client, transgender West Virginians, and the freedom of all youth to play as who they are.'\n'It also continues a string of federal courts ruling against bans on the participation of transgender athletes and in favor of their equal participation as the gender they know themselves to be,' Block said.\nWest Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, said he stands by the law and that the state 'will use every available tool to defend it.'\n'I am deeply disappointed in the court's divided decision today,' he said in a statement, going on to argue that the law 'is \u2018constitutionally permissible' and the law complies with Title IX.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Devan Cole,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230406132432-02-becky-pepper-jackson.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":4.387667,"_id":"5981a53e77079c431b19f7861d25d82e"},{"title":"Democrats build financial edge in battle for the House","author":"David Wright","published_date":"2024-04-19 16:30:29","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/politics/democrats-fundraising-edge","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Democrats are building a significant financial edge in the battle for the House of Representatives, outraising their GOP counterparts and placing big fall ad reservations as Republicans grapple with\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Democrats are building a significant financial edge in the battle for the US House of Representatives, outraising their GOP counterparts and placing big fall ad reservations as Republicans grapple with the fallout of ongoing leadership battles.\nHouse Democrats' official campaign committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, announced this week that it hauled in a record-breaking $45.4 million during the first quarter of the year, outraising its Republican counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee, which brought in $33.4 million over the same period.\nThe DCCC also touted a war chest of $71.1 million, while the NRCC said it had about $55.9 million in cash on hand, funds each committee will use to support candidates in key battleground states with control of the House up for grabs.\nMeanwhile, a pair of super PACs aligned with the House leadership of both parties also announced their most recent quarterly fundraising totals this week, showing Democrats with another advantage.\nHouse Majority PAC, the Democratic super PAC, said that, along with its affiliated organization, House Majority Forward, it had raised $37 million in the quarter for Democrats' House effort. Their GOP counterparts, the Congressional Leadership Fund, along with its affiliate, American Action Network, announced a combined fundraising haul of $30 million in the first quarter. The groups are set to play pivotal roles in the upcoming House contests, devoting tens of millions of dollars to independent expenditures.\nDemocrats also have a fundraising edge when it comes to the candidates themselves. First-quarter FEC filings showed that in 20 of 22 races rated as 'toss-ups' by the Cook Political Report \u2013 its most competitive category \u2013 the lead Democratic candidate outraised the lead Republican candidate. Many of the Democratic candidates, hauling in millions, hailed from highly competitive seats in California and New York, critical sections of the House map.\nAdding to the pressure, House Republicans are still dealing with the fallout from leadership fights as they seek to defend their razor-thin majority. During his first full quarter as speaker, Mike Johnson struggled to keep pace with the fundraising of his predecessor, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who was ousted last year. Johnson hauled in $20 million for House Republicans in the first quarter, while McCarthy raised at least $30 million for the party in the first quarter of the previous two years.\nAnd the leadership drama appears poised to drag on. With less funds to distribute to the party than his predecessor \u2013 a key lever of influence \u2013 Johnson faces threats to his job as he has sought to advance legislation on Capitol Hill.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has led an effort to potentially oust the speaker amid disputes over foreign aid and the renewal of a foreign surveillance law. Johnson has said he will not resign, and on Thursday, he took the extraordinary step of relying on Democratic votes to move advance a package providing foreign aid for Ukraine and Israel. Greene left the US Capitol on Friday following the vote without moving to oust Johnson.\nMeanwhile, a conservative dark money group, American Prosperity Alliance, launched new ads this week targeting three House Republicans who had voted to oust McCarthy, slamming their voting records. It is spending about $700,000 on the ad campaign, which is set to run through the rest of the month, another example of costly intraparty divisions.\nDemocrats, for their part, are prepping massive fall advertising reservations. House Majority PAC, the lead Democratic super PAC, announced earlier this month plans to spend $186 million on advertising campaigns targeting a series of key battleground races.\nThe group, whose 2024 investment surpasses the $102 million initially reserved in ads in the 2022 cycle and the $41 million in the 2020 cycle, said it was making its largest investment ever to flood key districts with an aggressive ad campaign, including attacks against Republicans on abortion and the collapse of a bipartisan border security deal.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,David Wright","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2115165051.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":4.387667,"_id":"f526121bb9bed9cbbf6cfaadcd4855a1"},{"title":"Duke University's move to end full ride scholarship for Black students gets mixed reaction from former scholars","author":"Nicquel Terry Ellis","published_date":"2024-04-20 12:23:53","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/20/us/duke-universitys-move-to-end-full-ride-scholarship-for-black-students-gets-mixed-reaction-from-former-scholars/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Duke University's decision to end a full ride scholarship program for Black students has received both support and criticism from former recipients of the award.","summary":"Duke University's decision to end a full ride scholarship program for Black students has received both support and criticism from former recipients of the award.\nThe university announced earlier this month that the Reginaldo M. Howard Memorial Scholarship would be replaced by the Reginaldo Howard Leadership Program, which 'will be open to all Duke undergraduates.'\nIn an announcement published on Duke's website, the university said it told current scholarship recipients that the transition was necessary 'due to the legal landscape related to race-based considerations in higher education.'\n'We are reimagining the Reginaldo \u2018Reggie' Howard Scholars program to expand the impact of Howard's legacy to many more Duke students with a commitment to leadership and social justice,' Duke University spokesman Frank Tramble said in a statement to CNN. 'The Reginaldo Howard Leadership Program will elevate the experience of our Black students by enriching their academic connections with faculty, providing funding for internships and research, strengthening community ties, and developing scholarly programming that highlights Black excellence through the Mary Lou Williams Center for Black Culture.'\nLast year, the Supreme Court struck down race-based college admissions.\nCraig Vincent, a former Reginaldo Howard Memorial scholar who graduated in 2016, told CNN Friday that he was disappointed in the university's decision to end the scholarship.\nThe scholarship, Vincent said, was critical to attracting talent to the university. He added that scholars have gone on to become CEOs, authors and have earned PhDs.\n'It felt a little bit like the university was reducing the scholarship down to the race of the people that were in it,' Vincent said. 'Where they kind of made the interpretation that this\u2026 was only a scholarship for Black students and there was nothing else unique or interesting about the folks that made up this pool and therefore they chose to eliminate it. That was very saddening to me.'\nWilton Alston, another former scholar who graduated from Duke in 1981, told CNN he initially felt 'anger, sadness and loss' about Duke ending the scholarship but ultimately decided to support the new leadership program.\n'I decided it made sense to give the leadership program a chance, and more importantly, engage in the future plans for developing the program,' Alston said.\nThe scholarship program targeted 'exemplary students of African descent' and paid full tuition, room and board for recipients, according to the program's website, which has now been archived.\nThe scholarship, established in 1979, was named after Duke's first Black student body president, who was killed in an automobile accident during his sophomore year.\nDuke isn't the only North Carolina college making changes or reevaluating diversity programs.\nEarlier this week, the University of North Carolina's Board of Governors, voted to repeal and replace the school's existing diversity and inclusion policy. The board oversees 16 public universities and one high school in the state.\nThe new policy \u2013 which goes to the full board for a final vote in May \u2013 will emphasize the university's commitment to 'non-discrimination and institutional neutrality,' Andrew Tripp, senior vice president for legal affairs for the university and board of governors, said during a committee meeting.\nThe Reginaldo M. Howard Memorial Scholars Program has supported 234 students since it was first created, Tramble said in the statement. Tramble said current scholars will still receive their scholarship until they graduate from Duke.\n'Under this new model, the redefined Reggie program will support hundreds of students each year through a variety of methods including need-based financial aid, leadership programming, and more,' Tramble said.\nThe removal of the scholarship at Duke also comes as diversity, equity and inclusion programs at colleges, along with race-based internships and scholarships, are being targeted by Republican lawmakers and conservative activists across the country.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Nicquel Terry Ellis,Kaylin C.

That law makes it a felony to 'corruptly' alter, destroy or mutilate a record with the intent of making it unavailable for use in an 'official proceeding,' or to 'otherwise' obstruct, influence, or impede such a proceeding.\nProsecutors say the charge should apply to the January 6 cases because the plain meaning of the words 'obstruct' an 'official proceeding' should cover the attack that interrupted Congress' counting of ballots to certify President Joe Biden's win in the 2020 election.\nCritics counter that the law was intended to prevent evidence tampering before a trial or investigation.\nThough Trump is not a party in the case, the appeal has indirectly thrust him onto the Supreme Court's docket for the third time this election year. In March, the justices unanimously ruled that the former president would appear on the ballot in Colorado despite claims he violated the 14th Amendment's 'insurrectionist ban' because of his actions on January 6.\nNext week the court will hear arguments on Trump's explosive claim that he is entitled to immunity from the special counsel's federal election subversion case, including the obstruction charge.\nelection subversion case, including the obstruction charge. Joseph Fischer, a former Pennsylvania police officer who brought the case to the Supreme Court, told the justices that by the time he arrived at the Capitol on January 6, Congress had already recessed. His lawyers said Fischer spent less than four minutes inside the building and that he advanced fewer than 25 feet.\nProsecutors paint a different picture. They say Fischer warned his police chief by text that the day might get violent. He texted that protestors should drag Democrats 'into the street and have a mob trial.' Fischer captured a video on his own cell phone in which he can be heard yelling 'charge!' before he ran into the Capitol, prosecutors say.\nA grand jury returned a seven-count indictment against Fischer weeks after the attack that included charges of civil disorder; assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers as well as the obstruction charge. The case before the Supreme Court involves only that last charge.\nThe US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit combined Fischer's case with two others and ruled that the charge could be used against January 6 defendants \u2013 siding with 14 of 15 district court judges who ruled the same way. All three defendants appealed to the Supreme Court, but the justices granted only Fischer's case. The other two are pending and will likely be summarily resolved after Fischer.\nYet the political ramifications are potentially enormous.\nExactly how much impact the court's ruling may have on other January 6 cases is unclear. Most defendants who were convicted of the obstruction charge and sentenced to prison were also convicted of additional felony or misdemeanor charges, according to a CNN analysis. The average sentence in those cases was just over four years, the analysis shows \u2013 far less than the 20-year maximum the obstruction count carries.\n'A Fischer win would not be a revolutionary blow to the DOJ's Capitol riot cases, but would be a stinging reminder that improbably broad interpretations of criminal statutes will not be tolerated,' said Nicholas Smith, who represented the defendants before the DC Circuit.\nTrump would almost certainly use a win for Fischer to try to further undermine the Justice Department. Depending on how the court rules, he might also attempt to have that charge thrown out in his own case.\nThe special counsel appears eager to head that argument off.\nIn a filing last week at the Supreme Court in Trump's immunity case, Smith argued the obstruction charge should stick against Trump even if Fischer wins. In a footnote, Smith pointed out that Trump's charge is based on the fake slate of electors he attempted to have submitted to Congress.\n'The Trump charges probably survive almost no matter what the court does in Fischer,' said Randall Eliason, a former federal prosecutor and George Washington University law professor.\nProgressive groups have called on Justice Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from cases involving January 6 because his wife, conservative activist Ginni Thomas, acknowledged she attended Trump's rally at the White House before the attack. Text messages reviewed by a congressional committee also showed that Ginni Thomas repeatedly texted senior officials inside the White House after the election to offer her support.\nThomas has largely ignored those requests.\nFischer relies heavily on a 2015 precedent from a deeply fractured Supreme Court that centered on a commercial fisherman who was caught with undersized red grouper on his boat . The fisherman had ordered the offending fish to be tossed overboard before authorities could confirm he had violated federal fishing regulations.\nfisherman who was caught with undersized red grouper on his boat. The fisherman had ordered the offending fish to be tossed overboard before authorities could confirm he had violated federal fishing regulations. The fisherman was convicted of a related crime that prohibits people from altering or destroying 'any record, document, or tangible object' with the intent to obstruct an investigation. The government argued the fish fell within the definition of 'tangible object.'\nBut a 5-4 majority of the Supreme Court that included Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the leader of the court's liberal wing at the time, and Justice Samuel Alito, a stalwart conservative, disagreed. Viewed in context, a plurality of the court reasoned, a 'tangible object' included items 'used to record or preserve information,' like a document \u2013 not a fish.\nFischer told the Supreme Court that context and history of the law at issue in the January 6 prosecutions is just as clear. It was meant to apply, his attorneys argue, to efforts to tamper with evidence, not to charge people involved in a riot.\nBut that interpretation has drawn considerable pushback from the government and some outside experts. The way the law at issue in the January 6 charges is written is different from how it looks in the earlier case.\nThe section on 'obstruction' is more separated, which the Justice Department argues suggests Congress intended to lay down a broad prohibition on disrupting congressional proceedings.\nEliason thinks the earlier decision about the undersized fish will probably ultimately work to the government's benefit. Among those who joined the dissent in the fisherman case was the late Justice Antonin Scalia, a leader of the widely accepted notion of interpreting the law based on its words rather than its legislative history or other factors.\n'If they're being consistent, at least two out of the three Trump justices ought to vote against Fischer's positions,' Eliason said. 'The ambiguity is not there. It's a broad statute, but it's not unclear.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,John Fritze,Hannah Rabinowitz","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240117190637-02-jan-6-rioter-sentencing-011724.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":4.342711,"_id":"d2d80dfd8961ee234e0b8845adb69a00"},{"title":"How Johnson came to embrace Ukraine aid and defy his right flank","author":"Annie Grayer","published_date":"2024-04-21 11:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/21/politics/ukraine-aid-mike-johnson-house-speaker-israel-taiwan","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The day after Iran attacked Israel, House Speaker Mike Johnson was on the phone with a man who suddenly held the keys to his legislative agenda and potentially his own future: House Democratic leader\u2026","summary":"Watch 'Inside Politics Sunday with Manu Raju' at 8 a.m. ET and 11 a.m. ET on Speaker Johnson and the tension in the House GOP.\nWatch 'Inside Politics Sunday with Manu Raju' at 8 a.m. ET and 11 a.m. ET on Speaker Johnson and the tension in the House GOP. CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 The day after Iran attacked Israel, House Speaker Mike Johnson was on the phone with a man who suddenly held the keys to his legislative agenda and potentially his own future: House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.\nIn a phone call that has not been previously reported, Johnson said he was ready to act on foreign aid, even though that would enrage Republicans who did not support additional assistance to Ukraine and could potentially cost him his job, a source familiar with the conversation told CNN.\nJeffries pressed Johnson on how many Republicans he could deliver to support the aid for Ukraine, knowing House Democrats would have to bring the rest, the source added.\nBut when Johnson returned to Washington, DC, on Monday plotting his path forward, he was faced with an onslaught of attacks from many of his GOP colleagues.\nThe Louisiana Republican quickly began hearing an earful from hardline conservatives, coming to realize his risky gambit of holding separate votes on aid for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan \u2013 and later tying those bills together in one package without including conservative demands over stricter border policies \u2013 could trigger a snap vote to remove him as speaker.\nOn Tuesday, Johnson sat in his office as members streamed in to voice their complaints and level their demands. By nighttime, he was wrestling how to proceed. Feeling the weight of his future and knowing history was watching him, Johnson, a devout Christian, turned to prayer.\n'He was torn between trying to save his job and do the right thing,' House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a top Ukraine advocate who was with Johnson the night before the legislation was released, told CNN. 'He prayed over it.'\nJohnson ultimately emerged Wednesday firm in his convictions that he was on the right path to make the most consequential decision of his political career by moving ahead with billions of dollars in foreign aid. The decision culminated in a tense scene on the House floor as Republican members traded insults and the speaker navigated his warring factions.\n'Kick rocks, tubby,' Rep. Derrick Van Orden said to Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican trying to derail Johnson's plans.\nIn a message to his colleagues ahead of the release of legislative text, Johnson acknowledged the 'significant member feedback and discussion.' And publicly, Johnson \u2013 who came into the job somewhat accidentally after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted in October \u2013 was even more blunt.\n'My philosophy is do the right thing and let the chips fall where they may. If I operated out of fear over motion to vacate, I would never be able to do my job. Look, history judges us for what we do. This is a critical time right now,' Johnson said Wednesday.\n'I can make a selfish decision and do something that is different, but I'm doing here what I believe to be the right thing. I think providing aid to Ukraine right now is critically important,' the speaker added.\nThe $95 billion aid package, which has the backing of President Joe Biden, ultimately passed Saturday with the support of 210 Democrats and 101 Republicans. It now heads to the Senate, which is expected to give final approval this week.\nDespite the bipartisan vote, Johnson admonished Democrats who waved Ukrainian flags on the House floor after the bill's passage.\n'We should only wave one flag on the House floor. And I think we know which flag that is,' Johnson said.\nThe speaker's embrace of Ukraine aid represents a remarkable evolution for Johnson, who voted against funding for the country as a rank-and-file member. But almost immediately after securing the speaker's gavel, sources say he began to hear directly from critical Republican national security voices \u2013 including Donald Trump's former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who impressed upon him the urgent need to approve assistance for Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion.\nIn March, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky lobbied the speaker directly. Within minutes of the House approving a new military aid package for Ukraine on Saturday, Zelensky offered his thanks to US lawmakers, and in particular to Johnson for his decision that 'keeps history on the right track.'\nAnd more recently, Johnson received a key intelligence briefing from CIA Director Bill Burns, who painted a picture of the dire situation on the battlefield in Ukraine and the global consequences of inaction, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the situation. The briefing left a lasting impression, and Johnson became increasingly convinced the fate of Western democracy was on his shoulders, sources close to him said.\nAnother factor that sources say weighed heavily on his decision-making: Johnson's oldest son was recently accepted into the Naval Academy.\n'To put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys. My son is going to begin in the Naval Academy this fall. This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is so many American families,' Johnson told reporters. 'This is not a game, this is not a joke.'\nIf Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and her supporters make good on their threat to force a vote on ousting him as speaker, Johnson will almost certainly need to rely on Democrats to bail him out. Johnson maintains that he has not asked any Democrats for their help, but senior Republicans believe they will be able to count on support across the aisle to swiftly kill any motion to vacate the speaker's chair \u2013 a feeling that may have bolstered Johnson's confidence in pressing ahead with his plans.\nIt is still unclear whether Democrats will throw him a lifeline. But they have expressed a willingness to save Johnson, especially after he defied his right flank to move ahead with a foreign aid package that closely resembles a Senate-passed version.\n'We'll have to have the conversation before the House caucus. But first thing's first, we still have to get the national security bills over the finish line,' Jeffries told reporters Friday.\nJohnson did not come to his decision on how to handle foreign aid quickly.\nIn one of his first acts as speaker, Johnson put on the floor a bill that provided $14.3 billion in aid for Israel. The measure went nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate because it did not include money for Ukraine and would have enacted funding cuts to the Internal Revenue Service.\nHe remained resistant to moving on Ukraine funding, letting the Senate-passed foreign aid package sit idle for months \u2013 even when Biden and the other three top congressional leaders, including Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, pressured him to act in a tense Oval Office meeting in February.\n'Slow,' New York Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said when asked how Johnson handled Ukraine aid. 'It should have been done months ago; should have just put the Senate bill on the floor. It would have gotten 300 votes.'\nMany Republicans believe Johnson could have arrived at his position of supporting Ukraine aid much sooner, as the bipartisan support was inevitable.\n'We have walked through broken glass to get a result, all of which could have been done before Christmas, but we're bringing it out until nearly summer,' GOP Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina told CNN. 'That is an active choice that I disagree with.'\nPart of Johnson's reluctance: Trump, who has been critical of Ukraine aid and has the power to make or break any legislation \u2013 and his own speakership. In recent weeks, allies counseled Johnson to keep the former president in the loop on his potential foreign aid plans.\nSo Johnson trekked down to Mar-a-Lago last week for an unrelated news conference, at Johnson's behest, where Trump expressed support not only for structuring some Ukraine aid as a loan but also for Johnson's speakership.\n'I stand by the speaker,' Trump said at the joint news conference.\nThe next day, Israel was attacked by Iranian missiles, fueling a new sense of urgency for Congress to act. Johnson knew he could no longer put off a decision, vowing over the weekend to put some form of Israel aid on the floor. But he was still wrestling with how to proceed.\nWhen Johnson finally announced his plans and the legislative text became public on Wednesday, he was facing an all-out revolt from his right flank.\n'It's tough to defend him right now,' said Arizona Rep. Eli Crane, one of the GOP members who voted to depose McCarthy.\nHardliners were furious that aid for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan would be voted on separately but ultimately merged into a single package to be sent to the Senate. A separate vote on a border security bill, meant to placate conservatives, was also met with swift opposition.\n'I don't defend the performance of the speaker. I don't defend the actions that have been taken. \u2026 I think this is a terrible mistake,' said GOP Rep. Bob Good of Virginia, who also supported McCarthy's ouster, adding that Johnson 'has failed us.'\nMeanwhile, moderate Republicans were lobbying Johnson to raise the threshold required to trigger a motion to vacate the speaker's chair to make it harder for any single member to use, essentially neutralizing the threat from Greene.\nJohnson, a self-described 'wartime speaker,' walked into a meeting with center-right Republicans who showed him overwhelming support, giving him multiple standing ovations.\n'I think he needed it,' a GOP lawmaker in the closed-door meeting told CNN. 'He certainly said that.'\nBut news of Johnson weighing a rule change on the motion to vacate sparked a fury on his right.\nThursday morning, Johnson found himself essentially pinned against the wall of the House floor as he was swarmed by right-wing lawmakers pressing him for assurances that he would not change the rules on the motion to vacate and making last-ditch efforts to change his course on foreign aid.\nIn one particularly bizarre moment, as the intense huddle was taking place, Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas stood at the microphones at the front of the chamber for a floor speech and began citing the Pledge of Allegiance. Johnson and the group of hardliners stopped their conversation, turned to the American flag at the front of the room, put their hands over their hearts, and recited the pledge along with Green, according to a GOP member who witnessed the moment. They then turned back around and resumed arguing.\nThe huddle grew so heated, that at one point, Van Orden \u2013 a Johnson ally who decided to step in and provide backup for the speaker \u2013 told Gaetz to 'kick rocks, tubby.'\n'I'm a retired Navy Seal, and Navy Seals only go places with a swim buddy, and the speaker didn't have a swim buddy,' Van Orden told CNN, recounting the exchange. 'So he didn't ask me to come over there. I went and was his swim buddy.'\n'Matt Gaetz is a bully, Chip Roy's a bully, Bob Good's a bully, and the only way to stop a bully is to push back harder,' the Wisconsin Republican added.\nGaetz told reporters Van Orden was acting 'unhinged' and called him 'not particularly intelligent.'\nBut Democrats, too, were leery of rules changes to make it harder to kick out the speaker, according to multiple congressional sources. Jeffries had been supportive of making other rules changes to empower Democrats \u2013 something Republicans opposed. It was clear Johnson couldn't get a deal with Democrats or the votes to change the threshold to call for such a vote.\nHours later, Johnson announced he would not move ahead with changing the motion to vacate tool, declaring there was not enough support in the House.\nLate Thursday night, Democrats joined Republicans to deliver the votes needed to move the foreign aid package out of the House Rules Committee and onto the floor, a rare bipartisan move and something a minority party has never done in recent history.\nThat bipartisan spirit carried into Friday, when Democrats again crossed party lines to help Republicans clear another key legislative hurdle on the House floor.\nBut then Greene's effort to oust Johnson grew by one, with GOP Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona announcing shortly after the vote that he was co-sponsoring the motion to vacate, becoming the third member to do so.\nStill, Johnson's foreign aid plan sailed over the finish line Saturday, leaning heavily on Democratic support \u2013 with less than half of the Republican conference voting for aid for Ukraine. Johnson has relied on a bipartisan coalition to pass every bill that has become law under his watch, and Democrats will likely be needed for other must-pass bills this year \u2013 and potentially, to save Johnson's speakership.\nJohnson has forcefully defended his plans, arguing his foreign aid package is a better product than the Senate-passed version, which some Republicans had been threatening to join with Democrats in forcing a floor vote on if the speaker didn't act.\n'I know there are critics of the legislation. I understand that. It is not a perfect piece of legislation. We're not ensured that in a time of divided government and in a time where there are lots of different opinions,' Johnson said after the bills passed Saturday. 'But there's no question whatsoever that the House has made many strong improvements to the Senate bill, and the product that we've sent over there is much better.'\nVeteran GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma also argued Johnson's dependence on Democrats is the reality of governing in a razor-thin majority.\n'This place is probably operating right now more like the founders thought it would,' Cole told reporters.\nBut even if Johnson keeps his job, some hardliners are warning it's politically untenable if he is propped up by Democrats.\n'There's probably a clear consensus that next Congress, he won't be speaker,' said Rep. Warren Davidson, a Freedom Caucus member from Ohio.\nCNN's Haley Talbot and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.\nCNN's Haley Talbot and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Annie Grayer,Manu Raju,Melanie Zanona","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/283939c2-de00-4978-adb1-35926f765fa7.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":4.2962337,"_id":"214391be4b0008b4b5d5e8cb46476716"},{"title":"Pro-Trump network OAN and Smartmatic settle 2020 election defamation case","author":"Marshall Cohen","published_date":"2024-04-16 16:27:37","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/media/oan-smartmatic-settlement","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Voting technology company Smartmatic and the far-right network One America News said Tuesday they have reached a confidential settlement over a defamation lawsuit stemming from the outlet's lies about\u2026","summary":"Voting technology company Smartmatic and the far-right network One America News said Tuesday that they had settled a defamation lawsuit stemming from the outlet's lies about the 2020 election.\n'The case has been resolved pursuant to a confidential agreement,' OAN attorney Chip Babcock told CNN.\nBoth parties declined to share details about the settlement.\nThe case against OAN was one of a spate of lawsuits filed against right-wing outlets in the aftermath of the election. In the wake of the 2020 presidential contest, pro-Donald Trump outlets spread lies wrongfully suggesting President Joe Biden had not been legitimately elected president.\nSmartmatic filed its lawsuit against OAN in 2021, alleging that the right-wing conspiracy network 'victimized' the company and spread lies about its role in the 2020 election to 'increase viewership and revenue.'\nThe development comes one year after Fox News reached a massive settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, another voting technology company that was similarly smeared in 2020. Fox News paid more than $787 million to end that lawsuit, becoming the largest publicly known defamation settlement in US history.\nSmartmatic still has pending lawsuit against Fox News, the smaller conservative channel Newsmax, and several pro-Trump figures who also pushed lies about the election.\nOAN has established itself as perhaps the most extreme of the pro-Trump cable news outlets. And its reporters have sometimes crossed the line into right-wing politicking.\nThe little-watched network has regularly given airtime to baseless conspiracy theories that support Trump, most prominently about the 2020 election.\nThe channel worked closely with Russian operatives on a propaganda-style documentary during Trump's first impeachment in 2019 over allegations he pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. One of its correspondents, who is also an attorney, even worked with Trump's legal team to subvert the 2020 election results.\nOAN settled a defamation suit in September with former Dominion executive Eric Coomer, whose case revealed how the network worked with former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell and others to lie about the election.\nDirecTV dropped the far-right network from its lineup in 2022, dealing a significant blow to the outlet, hitting the network's viewership and revenue.\nIn its lawsuit, Smartmatic alleged OAN hosts and guests made dozens of false claims about the company's role in the 2020 election. Personalities on the network repeatedly said Smartmatic software was used in voting machines 'in 30 states,' including battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. In reality, Smartmatic software was only used in one California county.\nOthers on OAN claimed that Smartmatic's software was 'used to switch votes from President Trump to Joe Biden,' and said the company was engaged in digital 'ballot-stuffing' to help Biden win. OAN personalities also stretched the truth about Smartmatic's past ties to Venezuela to weave a baseless narrative that, 'Maduro allies were meddling in the latest US election through a company called Smartmatic.'\nThe case was still in the discovery phase when the settlement was reached.\nDepositions were scheduled to take place Tuesday, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The person said depositions were scheduled soon for OAN owner Robert Herring, a wealthy California businessman, and his son Charles Herring, the network's president \u2014 but those won't happen now that the case has concluded.\nBoth Herrings were also entangled in a scandal within the lawsuit. Smartmatic claimed in court filings that the pair may have 'engaged in criminal activities' by obtaining and sharing internal passwords of Smartmatic employees. OAN denied the allegations, and there was never a judicial finding of wrongdoing against the Herrings.\nWhile the Smartmatic case is over, OAN still faces a separate defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion over its promotion of 2020 election lies.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Oliver Darcy,Marshall Cohen","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1228712427.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":4.2880545,"_id":"d566f7f8cf3ffc095831a806ca7fba51"},{"title":"Boeing defends its planes' safety ahead of whistleblower hearing","author":"Chris Isidore","published_date":"2024-04-15 22:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/15/business/boeing-defends-planes-safety/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Boeing on Monday scrambled to address safety and quality concerns about its planes ahead of a whistleblower hearing in the Senate on Wednesday.","summary":"Boeing on Monday scrambled to address safety and quality concerns about its planes ahead of a whistleblower hearing in the Senate on Wednesday.\nA briefing for journalists came in the wake of reports last week that the Federal Aviation Administration is looking into allegations raised by Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour that Boeing took shortcuts when manufacturing its 777 and 787 Dreamliner jets and that risk of catastrophic failure will increase as the planes age.\nSalehpour is set to be the key witness at a Wednesday hearing of the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations. Boeing, which has seen its once pristine reputation for safety and engineering quality badly diminished recently, held the briefing Monday to try to pre-emptively answer Salehpour, although the executives said they wouldn't comment directly on his allegations.\nBoeing has faced more than five years of questions about the safety and quality of its commercial jets following two fatal crashes of a different model, the 737 Max, in 2018 and 2019. Those crashes killed 346 people and led to a 20-month grounding of that jet.\nIt came under renewed scrutiny earlier this year after a door plug blew out on an 737 Max flight by Alaska Airlines on January 5, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet. That has sparked investigations and allegations that some Boeing employees felt reluctant to raise questions about the safety of the planes they are building or inspecting for fear of retaliation.\nWhile Salehpour charged last week that Boeing employees are scared to speak up about problems at factories, Boeing says the number of employee tips about quality and safety issues \u2014 as well as improvement ideas \u2014 has 'exploded' since the Alaska Air incident. January and February submissions already equal the number of submissions for all of 2023, according to the company.\n'We're continually encouraging it,' said Lisa Fahl, Boeing's vice president of engineering for Airplane Programs at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, during Monday's briefing.\nFahl and Steve Chisholm, Boeing's vice president and chief engineer for mechanical and structural engineering, told media members Monday that Boeing's planes face stress tests designed to replicate far more flights taking place than they ever will in the real world. The average 787 does 600 flights a year, according to Chisholm, and the tests Boeing put the planes through simulated 165,000 flights.\nAnd they said real world inspections on the planes now in service show even after as many as 16 years of use, no evidence of fatigue in parts of the plane now facing questions. Chisholm said the planes were designed to pass tests replicating far more stress over many more flights than they are subjected to in the real world.\n'Frankly we're not surprised by lack of fatigue findings,' he said.\nSalehpour's complaint alleges crews assembling the plane failed to properly fill tiny gaps when joining separately manufactured parts of the fuselage. That puts more wear on the plane, shortening its lifespan and risking 'catastrophic' failure, Salehpour's attorneys alleged.\nBoeing and the Federal Aviation Administration have admitted that some of the planes did have problems with the gaps between parts of the fuselages that were wider than the standards set by Boeing. The delivered planes were allowed to continue to fly, but the non-conformance with Boeing's standards led to long periods in recent years during which the aircraft maker had to halt deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner.\nBut Chisholm said the inspections done after those questions were raised have shown no problems in actual operations of the planes. He said some of the standards for the size of the gaps were changed in the wake of the inspections.\nFahl described the original standards of a gap of only 5/1000th of an inch, as equal to the width of a human hair or two pieces of paper. Chisholm said the original standards were 'hyper-conservative' ones set by Boeing, not by regulators.\n'It was very difficult to meet that standard. There are areas where we've increased what is allowable. We're [still] talking about very tight alignments,' he said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"business","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Pete Muntean,CNN,Chris Isidore","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap22167025314973.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":4.2880545,"_id":"ec293f42cacdbb66e47ee62678c909b8"},{"title":"Salman Rushdie says he had a \u2018premonition' of being attacked just days before the stabbing that left him blind in one eye","author":"Issy Ronald","published_date":"2024-04-15 14:10:40","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/15/style/salman-rushdie-interview-knife-attack-intl-scli","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Renowned author Salman Rushdie has revealed more details about the knife attack that left him blind in one eye, telling CBS' '60 Minutes' on Sunday that he had a 'premonition' of the event just days\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Renowned author Salman Rushdie has revealed more details about the knife attack that left him blind in one eye, telling CBS' '60 Minutes' on Sunday that he had a 'premonition' of the event just days beforehand.\nGiving his first television interview since he was stabbed several times on stage shortly before he was due to deliver a lecture at the Chautauqua Institution in New York in August 2022, the Indian-born novelist told Anderson Cooper he had 'dreams of being attacked in an amphitheater' before going there.\n'I said to my wife, Eliza, \u2018I don't want to go' because of the dream.

'It's easy looking back but nothing like this had ever happened to anybody and of course almost all the people who attacked the book did so without reading it.'\nRushdie has now written about the 2022 attack and his recovery from it in a memoir which, he said, he at first resisted writing, before realizing that he 'couldn't write anything else.' The memoir, titled 'Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder,' will be published Tuesday.\nHadi Matar, the man accused of stabbing Rushdie and another person on stage, pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree attempted murder and second-degree assault.\nMatar's trial was initially scheduled for January 8 but the court granted a request for its delay earlier that month, his attorney Nathaniel Barone told CNN at the time.\nBarone said Rushdie's upcoming memoir was not the reason for the delay in the trial, but he went on to say that 'pursuant to the New York State Criminal Procedure Law the Defense is entitled to any and all information associated with the drafting and publication of the book.'\nOn Sunday, Rushdie told '60 Minutes' that as he saw the attacker running toward the stage just before the attack, 'it felt like something coming out of the distant past and trying to drag me back in time, if you like, back into that distant past, in order to kill me.'\nThe Booker Prize-winning author was stabbed 15 times in 27 seconds by his attacker, who only stopped when audience members pulled him away, he said.\n'I was watching (blood) spread and then thinking I was probably dying,' Rushdie added. 'It was quite matter of fact. It wasn't like I was terrified or anything, no heavenly choirs, no pearly gates \u2026 I believe that death comes as the end, there was nothing that happened that made me change my mind about that.'\nSince surviving the attack, he said he isn't 'very different' but that it 'has left a shadow.'\n'Some days it's dark and some days it's not. I feel more the presence of death.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"beauty","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Issy Ronald","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2023-10-20t081925z-256824716-rc28w3ak0jhr-rtrmadp-3-germany-bookfair-rushdie.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNstyle","_score":4.2851114,"_id":"3f15018c690b835092477b6da3ae62a9"},{"title":"Revolt against Johnson opens up fresh talk over House GOP leadership's future","author":"Melanie Zanona","published_date":"2024-04-16 22:07:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/mike-johnson-revolt-house-gop-leadership","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Speaker Mike Johnson's weakened position inside the House GOP conference has sparked delicate internal discussions about who could potentially replace him if he can't hang on to the job \u2013 whether it's\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Speaker Mike Johnson's weakened position inside the House GOP conference has sparked delicate internal discussions about who could potentially replace him if he can't hang on to the job \u2013 whether it's in this Congress or the next one, according to interviews with over a dozen Republican lawmakers and aides.\nWhile no one is looking to challenge the Louisiana Republican outright and few are even interested in taking the reins of the chaotic and razor-thin majority, there's a widespread belief that there could be another leadership shakeup in the future \u2013 and some Republicans are quietly positioning themselves for such a scenario.\nAmong the GOP lawmakers whose moves are being watched closely: House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, who unsuccessfully ran for the speakership in October.\nEmmer, the No. 3 Republican, has taken steps to not only repair his relationship with Donald Trump \u2013 who helped to quickly derail his speakership bid last year \u2013 but also to work behind the scenes to win over House Republicans once skeptical of the Minnesota Republican, sources said. That includes voting last week for a House Freedom Caucus-backed amendment to a foreign surveillance law. Emmer was the only member of GOP leadership to support the provision, which ultimately failed. And Emmer also traveled to Pennsylvania over the weekend to attend a roundtable and reception with Trump ahead of his rally in the state, multiple sources told CNN.\n'Tom was very well praised by the president. \u2026 He was very pleased to see the whip there,' Rep. Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania, who was also in attendance, told CNN. 'A lot of people were happy to see the whip there.'\nAsked about Trump burying the hatchet with Emmer and recently endorsing him, Meuser said: 'I handed it to Trump for doing that.'\nIn recent days, proxies close to Emmer have also reached out to some Republicans to gauge his standing inside the conference, according to three sources, including a GOP leadership aide. Neither Emmer nor his office have been making any calls on his behalf, and Emmer has made clear he is firmly against a motion to vacate the speaker's chair. Still, sources believe Emmer is working to improve his stock inside both the House GOP and MAGA world, and keeping his options open for the future.\n'They're testing the waters,' the GOP leadership aide told CNN.\nAnother potential contender who sources believe could run for the top job in the next Congress: House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, who also mounted an unsuccessful bid for speaker last year. Jordan has publicly backed Johnson and wants him to keep his job. But the Ohio Republican is still beloved by conservatives, and sources believe he could have a strong case to lead the conference next year \u2013 especially if Trump is back in the White House.\nOthers who could be waiting in the wings: House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who also previously ran for speaker, and House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, a top Trump ally.\nBut working to Johnson's advantage, at least in this Congress: the GOP's inability to get behind a successor, as well as Democrats signaling they'd be willing to save him if a motion to vacate were to come to the floor.\nStill, the quiet maneuvering inside the House GOP conference shows a level of uncertainty among Republicans about the long-term political future of Johnson, who unexpectedly came into the job after the unprecedented ouster of their last speaker, Kevin McCarthy.\nAnd those conversations could soon intensify, particularly after GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky announced Tuesday he was signing on to the motion to vacate led by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia \u2013 a precarious development for Johnson in a shrinking majority. The speaker will not be able to lose more than one Republican on party-line votes.\n'It keeps bubbling around,' one GOP lawmaker said of the quiet discussions about a potential Johnson successor.\nSome Republicans are now privately \u2013 and in some cases, publicly \u2013 questioning whether Johnson will be able to hang on to his post next Congress, especially if he needs Democrats to bail him out this year. There's ample uncertainty about what the mood will be next year, which could depend on the election results in November.\n'He's definitely not going to be speaker next Congress if we're lucky enough to have a majority. I think that is a widely held belief throughout the Congress,' Greene told CNN.\nBut in terms of what happens during the remainder of this session, Greene was less definitive: 'That is to be determined.'\nFor his part, Johnson insisted he would not need Democratic support to hold onto his gavel, telling reporters they would 'work this out.'\nBut he also referred to himself as a 'wartime speaker' \u2013 a recognition of the embattled role he finds himself in \u2013 and warned Republicans that a motion to vacate 'is not helpful to the cause.'\n'I am not resigning. And it is in my view an absurd notion that someone would bring a vacate motion when we are simply here trying to do our jobs,' he told reporters Tuesday. 'We need steady leadership. We need steady hands on the wheel.'\nAfter Emmer's speakership bid was derailed at the hands of Trump in just hours \u2013 with the former president slamming Emmer as a 'RINO,' an acronym for 'Republican in name only' \u2013 the Minnesota Republican recognized he needed to repair their frayed relationship to preserve his political future, according to sources close to him.\nAs part of his effort to curry favor with the former president, Emmer endorsed Trump ahead of the Iowa caucuses in January, which sources say Trump relished in and marked a key turning point in their relationship.\nwhich sources say Trump relished in and marked a key turning point in their relationship. Trump soon returned the favor, endorsing Emmer for reelection in April and calling the congressman 'fantastic.' One month earlier, Emmer hosted a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago, where sources say Trump praised his leadership. Trump also tapped Emmer to serve as Minnesota state chair of his 2024 campaign, in another sign of their improved ties.\nSources say Emmer has also been attempting to make inroads with key conservative hardliners in the House, talking to members of the House Freedom Caucus constantly on the floor and showing support for issues they care deeply about.\nAnd Emmer has also ramped up his fundraising, which could be another selling point for any future leadership bid. Emmer's team touted that he raised $7.2 million for GOP candidates and incumbents in the first quarter of the year \u2013 a record for the Minnesota Republican.\nFor his part, Emmer has expressed support for Johnson amid threats to his speakership, even as he has shown some distance from all the drama. When asked Tuesday if he was frustrated by the threats, Emmer said: 'My job is to count votes, make sure our people are getting the information they need, we are going to get stuff done.'\nPressed on why it's important for Johnson to keep his job, Emmer said: 'Again, we are going to be focused on the things we have in front of us this week, we have some great bills on the floor tonight and tomorrow, we are waiting to see text on the supplemental.'\nMeanwhile, Johnson has been making his own moves to shore up support from Trump to counter Greene, one of Trump's most vocal congressional allies.\nJohnson has been making his own moves to shore up support from Trump to counter Greene, one of Trump's most vocal congressional allies. Johnson trekked down to Mar-a-Lago last week to deliver a joint press conference on so-called 'election integrity,' which was Johnson's idea, as CNN previously reported. And as the Louisiana Republican pitches his conference on foreign aid legislation, he also has been working to keep Trump in the loop on his plans, sources said.\nDuring the press conference, Johnson got some key backup from the former president.\n'I stand with the speaker,' said Trump, who also called the continued threat of a motion to vacate 'unfortunate.'\nAsked Tuesday if he would protect Johnson, Trump said, 'Well, we'll see what happens with that,' adding, 'I think he's a very good person.'\nSources say Trump is not interested in another messy speaker fight, worried it could undermine Republicans ahead of November. And a large swath of the House GOP conference agrees.\nRepublicans descended into a round of angry finger pointing Tuesday after Greene's effort to oust Johnson grew by one.\nRep. Marc Molinaro, a swing district New York Republican, told CNN that the push to vacate Johnson was an 'absolutely ridiculous concept,' adding, 'The concept of another motion to vacate is an utter waste of time, and frankly a distraction from really important business. It hopefully has no ability to move forward.'\nAnother GOP lawmaker told CNN that Republicans should accept the hand they have been dealt: 'We have Johnson and we did it to ourselves. Every decision we as a conference make should be in the best interest of getting the White House back in 2024. Period!'\nAnd the scars still run deep from the protracted speakership fight following McCarthy's ousting, which exposed internal divisions and left the House paralyzed for three weeks.\nLouisiana GOP Rep. Garret Graves warned against the idea of ousting Johnson without another speaker candidate waiting in the wings.\n'I don't think that the threat is really real at this point, just because you don't have an alternative. We saw what happened last fall, whenever this all went down. There's not an alternative,' Graves said. 'I don't think that folks are going to go through it at this point.'\nJordan also insisted that Republicans needed to fall in line behind Johnson, telling CNN of threats to oust the speaker, 'We don't need that. No way, no way. We don't want that. We shouldn't go through that again.'\nMorgan Rimmer and Haley Talbot contributed to this report.\nMorgan Rimmer and Haley Talbot contributed to this report.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Annie Grayer,Manu Raju,Melanie Zanona","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2148848516.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":4.1418433,"_id":"5910044fa1ecbdd408c0895c4d51d020"},{"title":"A piece of space station garbage hit a house in Florida, NASA confirms","author":"Jackie Wattles","published_date":"2024-04-16 19:48:50","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/world/space-junk-florida-home-crash-scn/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"A piece of trash intentionally jettisoned from the International Space Station struck a home in Naples, Florida, according to the federal agency.","summary":"Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter.

While some of Trump's plans are lacking in detail, here are some of the policies he says he would enact if elected for a second term. Trump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal last month and making a trip to the southern border on February 29, where he touted his previous hard-line immigration policies. In a Des Moines Register op-ed published roughly a week before winning the Iowa caucuses in January, Trump vowed to use the 'Alien Enemies Act to remove known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States.' 'We will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement \u2014 including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS,' he wrote. In a video posted on Truth Social in late February before his border visit, Trump also promised to 'carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.' After the Israel-Hamas war began last October, Trump also promised to terminate the visas of 'Hamas' sympathizers.' 'We'll get them off our college campuses, out of our cities and get them the hell out of our country, if that's OK with you,' he added. Trump announced plans in a September 2023 campaign video to close the Department of Education and send 'all education and education work and needs back to the states.' 'We want them to run the education of our children, because they'll do a much better job of it,' he added. The former president has also promised to 'put parents back in charge and give them the final say' in education. In a January 2023 campaign video, the former president said he would give funding preferences and 'favorable treatment' to schools that allow parents to elect principals, abolish teacher tenure for K-12 teachers, use merit pay to incentivize quality teaching and cut the number of school administrators, such as those overseeing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Trump also said in that campaign video that he would cut funding for schools that teach critical race theory and gender ideology. In a later speech, Trump said he would bring back the 1776 Commission, which was launched in his previous administration to 'teach our values and promote our history and our traditions to our children.' The former president said he would charge the Department of Justice and the Department of Education with investigating civil rights violations of race-based discrimination in schools while also removing 'Marxists' from the Department of Education. A second Trump administration would pursue violations in schools of both the Constitution's Establishment and Free Exercise clauses, which prohibit the government establishment of religion and protect a citizen's right to practice their own religion, he said. Last November, Trump promised to replace the Affordable Care Act, known colloquially as Obamacare, in a series of posts on Truth Social. A Trump-backed effort to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in 2017 after three Republicans senators joined with Democrats to vote against the bill. 'Getting much better Healthcare than Obamacare for the American people will be a priority of the Trump Administration,' he said. 'It is not a matter of cost, it is a matter of HEALTH. America will have one of the best Healthcare Plans anywhere in the world. Right now it has one of the WORST!,' he continued. He also doubled down on his vow during a speech in early January. Trump also vowed in a June 2023 campaign video to reinstate his previous executive order so that the US government would pay the same price for pharmaceuticals as other developed countries. Some of the former president's pharmaceutical policies were overturned by Biden. Trump has promised to use the Department of Justice to attack critics and former allies. In several videos and speeches, the former president also laid out plans to gut the current justice system by firing 'radical Marxist prosecutors that are destroying America.' 'I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,' Trump said in June 2023 remarks. 'I will totally obliterate the Deep State.' Trump said in a campaign video last year that he would reinstate a 2020 executive order to remove 'rogue' bureaucrats and propose a constitutional amendment for term limits on members of Congress. To address what he labeled the 'disturbing' relationship between technology platforms and the government, the former president said in a January 2023 video that he would enact a seven-year cooling off period before employees at agencies such as the FBI or CIA can work for platforms that oversee mass user data. Trump added in multiple campaign releases that he would task the Justice Department with investigating online censorship, ban federal agencies from 'colluding' to censor citizens and suspend federal money to universities participating in 'censorship-supporting activities.' In a September 2023 speech at the Family Research Council's Pray Vote Stand Summit in Washington, DC, Trump also touted plans to continue appointing conservative judges. 'I will once again appoint rock-solid conservative judges to do what they have to do in the mold of Justices Antonin Scalia; Samuel Alito, a great gentleman; and another great gentleman, Clarence Thomas,' he said. Trump has also pledged to 'appoint U.S. Attorneys who will be the polar opposite of the Soros District Attorneys and others that are being appointed throughout the United States.' In a September 2023 speech in Washington, DC, Trump also announced that he would appoint a task force to review the cases of people he claimed had been 'unjustly persecuted by the Biden administration.' Trump noted that he wanted to 'study the situation very quickly, and sign their pardons or commutations on day one.' It's a move that could lead to potential pardons of many rioters from the January 6, 2021, insurrection \u2013 which he suggested he would do at a CNN town hall in May 2023. * Only promises on judge appointments and congressional term limits are similar to prior campaigns Trump said in two February 2023 campaign videos that if 'Marxist' prosecutors refuse to charge crimes and surrender 'our cities to violent criminals,' he 'will not hesitate to send in federal law enforcement to restore peace and public safety.' Trump added that he would instruct the Department of Justice to open civil rights investigations into 'radical left' prosecutors' offices that engaged in racial enforcement of the law, encourage Congress to use their legal authority over Washington, DC, to restore 'law and order' and overhaul federal standards of disciplining minors to address rising crimes like carjackings. Addressing policies made in what Trump calls the 'Democrats' war on police,' the former president vowed in a campaign video that he would pass a 'record investment' to hire and retrain police, strengthen protections like qualified immunity, increase penalties for assaulting law enforcement officers and deploy the National Guard when local law enforcement 'refuses to act.' The former president added that he would require law enforcement agencies that receive money from his funding investment or the Department of Justice to use 'proven common sense' measures such as stop-and-frisk. Trump has continued his attacks against member countries of NATO, a European and North American defense alliance. At a South Carolina rally last month, Trump said he would not abide by the alliance's collective-defense clause and would encourage Russia to do 'whatever the hell they want' if a member country didn't meet spending guidelines. 'NATO was busted until I came along,' Trump said. 'I said, \u2018Everybody's gonna pay.' They said, \u2018Well, if we don't pay, are you still going to protect us?' I said, \u2018Absolutely not.' They couldn't believe the answer.' The former president has also previously pledged to end the war in Ukraine, though he's offered no details on how he would do so. 'Shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,' Trump said at a New Hampshire campaign event last year, adding in another speech that it would take him 'no longer than one day' to settle the war if elected. Trump further addressed his strategy of stopping the 'never-ending wars' by vowing to remove 'warmongers,' 'frauds' and 'failures in the senior ranks of our government,' and replace them with national security officials who would defend America's interests. The former president added in a campaign video that he would stop lobbyists and government contractors from pushing senior military officials toward war. In addition, Trump has said he would restore his 'wonderful' travel ban on individuals from several majority-Muslim countries to 'keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country' after Biden overturned the ban in 2021. Trump said in multiple campaign videos that he would spearhead an effort to build so-called 'Freedom Cities' to 'reopen the frontier, reignite American imagination, and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people, all hardworking families, a new shot at home ownership and in fact, the American Dream.' In his plan, the federal government would charter 10 new cities on federal land, awarding them to areas with the best development proposals. The former president said in a campaign video that the Freedom Cities would bring the return of US manufacturing, economic opportunity, new industries and affordable living. In the March 2023 video, Trump added that the US under a second Trump administration would lead in efforts to 'develop vertical-takeoff-and-landing vehicles for families and individuals,' not letting China lead 'this revolution in air mobility.' The former president said these airborne vehicles would change commerce and bring wealth into rural communities. At the same rally in South Carolina, Trump pledged to impose 'stiff penalties on China and other trade abusers.' 'It's called you screw us, and we screw you,' Trump said. Under his proposed 'Trump Reciprocal Trade Act,' the former president said if other countries impose tariffs on the US, the country would impose 'a reciprocal, identical' tariff right back. It was the same pledge Trump made in a campaign video in 2023: to impose the same tariffs that other countries may impose on the US on those countries. The goal, the former president said then, is to get other countries to drop their tariffs. As part of a larger strategy to bring jobs back into the US, Trump also said he would implement his so-called 'America First' trade agenda if elected. By setting universal baseline tariffs on a majority of foreign goods, the former president said Americans would see taxes decrease as tariffs increase. His proposal also includes a four-year plan to phase out all Chinese imports of essential goods, as well as stopping China from buying up America and stopping the investment of US companies in China. Trump also said in February that he would consider imposing a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports if he's reelected. The former president has particularly focused on China, vowing in a January 2023 campaign video to restrict Chinese ownership of US infrastructure such as energy, technology, telecommunications and natural resources. Trump also said he would force the Chinese to sell current holdings that may put national security at risk. 'Economic security is national security,' he said. ``\nFormer President Donald Trump, now the presumptive Republican nominee, has made a number of promises on the campaign trail, including rolling back car pollution rules, building 10 new cities and appointing a special prosecutor to investigate President Joe Biden and his family.\nWhile some of Trump's plans are lacking in detail, here are some of the policies he says he would enact if elected for a second term.\nTrump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal last month and making a trip to the southern border on February 29, where he touted his previous hard-line immigration policies.\nIn a Des Moines Register op-ed published roughly a week before winning the Iowa caucuses in January, Trump vowed to use the 'Alien Enemies Act to remove known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States.'\n'We will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement \u2014 including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS,' he wrote.\nIn a video posted on Truth Social in late February before his border visit, Trump also promised to 'carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.'\nAfter the Israel-Hamas war began last October, Trump also promised to terminate the visas of 'Hamas' sympathizers.'\n'We'll get them off our college campuses, out of our cities and get them the hell out of our country, if that's OK with you,' he added.\nTrump announced plans in a September 2023 campaign video to close the Department of Education and send 'all education and education work and needs back to the states.'\n'We want them to run the education of our children, because they'll do a much better job of it,' he added.\nThe former president has also promised to 'put parents back in charge and give them the final say' in education.

Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. New York CNN \u2014\nNew York CNN \u2014 America's right-wing forces would have you believe that they are the courageous entities standing up for free speech.\nBut, as they try to claim that mantle, many of those same forces in media and politics are behind a disturbing wave of book bans sweeping the nation.\nPEN America, a non-profit organization committed to protecting free expression, published an alarming report Tuesday indicating that the 'book ban crisis' is only getting worse. The bans are 'speeding up,' the organization warned in its report, a troublesome trend that is impacting public school systems from coast-to-coast.\n'There were over 4,000 instances of book bans in the first half of this school year\u2014more than all of last school year as a whole. This is a marked increase in comparison to the last spring semester, in which PEN America recorded 1,841 book bans,' the group said in the report, aptly titled 'Banned in the USA.'\nThe bans started in haste in early 2021, birthed in the backlash to Nikole Hannah-Jones's 1619 Project at The New York Times. At the time, the concern among conservatives was that schools were using books to supposedly indoctrinate young students with critical race theory, an academic concept that became a culture war flashpoint and sparked hysteria in right-wing circles. Over time, the bans have grown to encompass other topics, notably gender ideology.\nThe censorship has been fueled by the right-wing media machine (which again, purports to be pro-free speech), with entities such as 'Libs of TikTok' targeting specific school systems and effectively waging pressure campaigns against administrators to take certain works off the library shelves.\nSome of the books removed from schools across the country include Margaret Atwood's acclaimed dystopian-novel - turned-Hulu-adaptation 'The Handmaid's Tale,' Amy Reed's novel 'The Nowhere Girls,' Rupi Kaur's NYT bestseller 'Milk and Honey,' Ta-Nehisi Coates's memoir 'Between the World and Me' and others.\n-turned-Hulu-adaptation 'The Handmaid's Tale,' Amy Reed's novel 'The Nowhere Girls,' Rupi Kaur's NYT bestseller 'Milk and Honey,' Ta-Nehisi Coates's memoir 'Between the World and Me' and others. 'Those who want to ban books are attempting to use obscenity law and hyperbolic rhetoric about \u2018porn in schools' to justify banning books about sexual violence and LGBTQ+ topics (and in particular, trans identities). In doing so, they have also disproportionately targeted books by women and nonbinary authors,' PEN America said. 'The movement to ban books also continues to focus on themes of race and racism by advancing rhetoric disparaging \u2018critical race theory,' \u2018woke ideology,' and efforts to ensure library collections are diverse and inclusive.'\nSuch brazen book bans \u2014 unprecedented in modern American history \u2014 is at its worst in the red states of Florida and Texas. In Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a law last year that led to the removal of books from public school shelves, more than 5,100 books were banned between July 2021 and December 2023, according to PEN America. In Texas, the number was more than 1,500, the group said.\nThe bans have also led to harassment against the authors who suddenly find themselves hurled into the information wars. Abdi Nazemian, a gay Iranian-American author, said during a press call organized by PEN America on Tuesday that 'nothing could have prepared' him for 'the experience of having my book banned.'\n'First and foremost, a heartbreak over the message it sends to young queer kids who deserve love and support. But also just the fear over all the online threats I've received,' Nazemian said. 'I've been called a pedophile and a groomer. I've been called filthy, indecent, profane, shady, slimy.'\nPEN America said Tuesday that there is one glimmer of hope: growing resistance to the bans. Every major publisher is now actively supporting a legal case to halt book banning in Iowa. And, across the country, ordinary people are getting involved to put an end to the trend.\nactively supporting a legal case to halt book banning in Iowa. And, across the country, ordinary people are getting involved to put an end to the trend. 'We see students at the forefront, leading protests, read-ins, marching to oppose censorship and educational censorship in particular happening and plaguing their schools and school libraries,' Kasey Meehan, the program director of PEN America's Freedom to Read, said Tuesday. 'And, of course, we're joined by incredible voices of authors and parents and other advocates that are leading efforts to be as coordinated, as well resourced, and as organized as those efforts to remove books in the first place.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Oliver Darcy","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap22190839242796.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":4.086073,"_id":"825f6fedacd387a4f265b7cd1c275d36"},{"title":"Camels evolved from a cold-weather ancestor.

Armadillos, giraffes and humpback whales are the current top three, but when picking a name for his tee-ball team, he suggested the Brooklyn Cockatoos.\nWhile I can't yet bring myself to tell him how many of his favorites are endangered \u2014 or how his worried dad has been collecting practical ways to survive and thrive amid so much loss and change \u2014 I can at least update his animal fables to fit the times.\n'Once upon a time, there was a camel,' I begin, after settling into the night-night chair and flipping to a picture of his old man after a ride around the Great Pyramids of Giza. I point out the splayed toes perfect for walking on sand, and eyelids seemingly custom-made to see through a sandstorm. 'It looks like they were born to live in hot places, doesn't it?'\nRiver nods.\n'Wrong!' I blurt with the zeal of discovery. 'The camel is actually from Canada! Like your mom!'\nI explain how fossils now show that for 40 million years, the so-called 'ships of the desert' were ambling over beaver dams, nibbling through boreal forests and dodging bears across North America, until a train of dromedaries wandered west over the Bering land bridge around 17,000 years ago. Somewhere along the genetic line, camels' ancestors discovered a big hump of fat used to get through cold winters can also help cross big, hot deserts.\nCamel fur turns out to be a decent sunscreen that helps with thermal regulation, those snowshoe feet perform well in sand while triple eyelids evolved in countless blizzards also work in Sudanese haboobs.\nBut these accidental advantages were just the beginning. Camels got better at closing their noses to keep out sand and lock in moisture. They learned to drink saltwater, eat toxic plants and position their bodies in the coolest possible angles to the sun.\nCamels changed everything \u2014 anatomy, physiology and behavior \u2014 to fit into their hot new climate.\nBut while they had eons to adjust, one generational tweak at a time, record-shattering heat is sending millions of species of plants and animals in search of more comfortable latitudes and elevations, some at speeds fast enough to challenge the definition of 'invasive species.'\nAnd to get my most poignant lesson in heat adaptation, I had to trade desert gear for a snowsuit, sail to the bottom of the world and hang out with penguins.\n'They were everywhere ,' I told River after returning from a reporting trip to the Antarctic Peninsula. He is happiest with nose pressed to the penguin house glass at the Central Park Zoo, so the kid sat rapt as I showed him my pics of a gentoo father diligently building a nest with his beak, one rock at a time.\neverywhere ,' I told River after returning from a reporting trip to the Antarctic Peninsula. He is happiest with nose pressed to the penguin house glass at the Central Park Zoo, so the kid sat rapt as I showed him my pics of a gentoo father diligently building a nest with his beak, one rock at a time. But then I had to figure out a way to tell him none of these babies would survive.\nPenguins need relatively dry, bare rock to nest, and after a warmer, wetter Antarctic summer dumped enough rain and snow to delay nesting season by a month, the new gentoos I'd met simply wouldn't have enough time to grow the feathers and fat needed to swim and fish the Southern Ocean over winter.\ndumped enough rain and snow to delay nesting season by a month, the new gentoos I'd met simply wouldn't have enough time to grow the feathers and fat needed to swim and fish the Southern Ocean over winter. But before I could mourn them for long, I learned the birds gathering rocks for worthless nests are the one species that happen to be surprisingly crushing Darwin's survival-of-the-fittest test.\n'Gentoo penguins are big climate change winners in the Antarctic,' Heather Lynch told me. As the endowed chair for ecology and evolution at Stony Brook University, her team had spent recent years watching as chinstrap and Ade\u0301lie penguins remained committed to ancient nesting spots, fruitlessly trying to hatch eggs in standing water with populations crashing as a result.\nConversely, the more flexible gentoo penguins keep moving farther and farther south, chasing new prey, and even abandoning nests to increase the odds of long-term survival. As a result, gentoo population numbers have exploded by as much as 30,000% in just a few years.\n'I think there's a lesson in here for us as well,' Heather Lynch said. 'If we just stick to what we've always done, it's not going to turn out well for us. Just because Manhattan has always been where it is, does it make sense that it will be there in two hundred or three hundred years? I don't know. But I think we would benefit from being flexible and adaptive. And I think that's kind of what the gentoos are telling us.'\nHere lieth the lesson of the camel and the gentoo: Heat will move us, one way or another. An overheated atmosphere and the resulting flood, drought, and storm will rearrange life on Earth, and those who can't move like the gentoo will have to adapt like the camel.\nAs northern climates way up on the 50 th parallel now experience the kind of temperatures once reserved for the tropics, folks from British Columbia to Yorkshire, England, suddenly understand why smart Arizonans keep oven mitts in the car. And those in already-scorching places like Phoenix will have to start thinking about temperature management and water conservation like the Fremen of Dune .\nth parallel now experience the kind of temperatures once reserved for the tropics, folks from British Columbia to Yorkshire, England, suddenly understand why smart Arizonans keep oven mitts in the car. And those in already-scorching places like Phoenix will have to start thinking about temperature management and water conservation like the Fremen of Dune . Sales of air-conditioned shirts and day- or weeklong heatstroke insurance policies are booming in Japan. Seville, Spain, became the first city to start naming heat waves like hurricanes, and after they appointed a chief heat officer, Miami, Los Angeles and Phoenix soon followed suit.\nAs our kids get older, our cities will get brighter.\nWhile locals in places like Mykonos have been painting houses white for centuries, Los Angeles painted a million square feet of its heat-trapping asphalt with reflective paint. And Purdue professor Xiulin Ruan and his students supercharged the idea and discovered ways to make a white so brilliant, it can reflect up to 98 percent of sunlight back into deep space and keep a surface up to 19 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than its surroundings.\nSeville is also reviving the use of qanats and windcatchers, 1,000-year-old Persian inventions that vent enough cool air from underground canals to lower the temperature of baking streets by 10 to 15 degrees. This $5 million investment, along with a 'policy of shade' to extend awnings, tree plantings and drop-in cooling centers, is part of a specific campaign to save the cultural treasure known as charla al fresco \u2014 that delicious moment after sunset when grandmothers can pull their chairs together in courtyards for a 'cool chat.'\ncharla al fresco \u2014 that delicious moment after sunset when grandmothers can pull their chairs together in courtyards for a 'cool chat.'

In 2018, the International Energy Agency found fans and air conditioners make up 20% of the total electricity used by buildings around the world, but not a single nation places minimum energy performance standards on cooling equipment that beat the efficiency of today's readily available technology.\n'Don't let the cold out!' my dad would bellow as I left the door wide open in an urgent need to play, but both of us were clueless that our dumb energy hog was already working harder because most American air conditioners lacked a common part with the unsexy name of 'inverter.' We could control the fan speed on window units, swamp coolers, and split systems back in the day, but the cooling compressor had only two settings\u2014on and off. An inverter AC adjusts compressor speeds according to temperature and humidity, making the machine quieter and faster to cool while using 30\u201350% less juice.\nand humidity, making the machine quieter and faster to cool while using 30\u201350% less juice. While 90% of Americans enjoy air conditioning, they are outnumbered seven-to-one by people in the Global South who do not. But much the way they leapfrogged landlines with cell phones, the smartest developing markets are leaving the past in the past. The market share of inverter ACs in China exploded from 9% to 65% in a decade, thanks to government incentives and public affection, while in India, inverters were in 85% of the machines sold in 2022.\nAnd then there is the heat pump.\nThey've been around since the 1850s, but if you had quizzed me for a definition over most of my life, I would have guessed it is a dance from the seventies. Who would ever consider such a thing when in sweaty need of home cooling? But it turns out that an air conditioner is \u2014 get this \u2014 a heat pump! It just pumps it in one direction, from inside to out, the same way our refrigerator pulls the heat away from our groceries. But a heat pump goes both ways and even in subzero extremes can find enough warm air outside to keep things toasty inside at up to five times the efficiency of an electric radiator.\nIn 2023, only 16% of US homes had heat pumps, but with state and federal incentives helping cover the upfront costs, Maine blew past a goal to install 100,000 of them by 2025 two years early and are now shooting for another 175,000 by 2027.

'Here I am, just trying to be healthy, I was a new mom and just trying to be me. It was a great moment. I didn't know it would cause such a stir.'\nWilliams was banned from wearing the catsuit at future French Open tournaments after French Tennis Federation President Bernard Giudicelli said that Roland Garros would be introducing a dress code.\n'It will no longer be accepted,' Giudicelli said of the catsuit at the time. 'One must respect the game and the place.'\nThe decision and Giudicelli's comments drew widespread criticism, particularly from tennis great Billie Jean King, who posted on social media that the 'policing of women's bodies must end.'\nThe skintight outfit also served a serious purpose, Williams said at the time, helping the 23-time grand slam singles champion's blood circulation after a difficult childbirth.\nWilliams, however, said that she had no issue with the decision and comments made by Giudicelli.\nThe black outfit had a red band that ran around the waist, but Williams revealed the original design wasn't supposed to look that way.\n'When I first put it on, it was in a fitting, and in the fitting, it had this red line and that was just a mark because they were going to change it to either dark silver or black, so it was meant to be all black,' says Williams.\n'And I was like: \u2018No, we gotta keep this red. We gotta keep this red.' It was so cool. I know it's a \u2018sample,' but we've got to make them and they have to be this color. And I felt so comfortable.'\n'Oh my God, now I'm getting sad memories because I miss it,' she adds wistfully. 'Oh no, now I'm like: \u2018I want to go home and put it on, and of course, I want to play and slide around on some clay. Oh, such good memories.'\nWilliams, who has not played competitively since the 2022 US Open, says she hasn't worn the outfit since that year. 'But I need to,' she adds.\nThe 14-time grand slam doubles champion \u2013 widely considered the greatest women's tennis player of all time \u2013 said she was 'obsessed' with the catsuit when she first wore it because it was 'so different' to anything any player had ever worn in tennis, sometimes considered a traditional, conservative sport.\nAt the time, Williams said she felt like a 'warrior' in the suit or 'a queen from Wakanda,' referencing the fictional nation in the Marvel movie 'Black Panther.'\nWhile much of the initial discourse around the outfit was about fashion and what was considered acceptable for tennis, there was little talk about how the catsuit was designed to help Williams physically.\nIn an opinion piece for CNN in 2018, Williams described how she almost died while giving birth to her daughter, Olympia, due to issues with blood clots.\nThe 42-year-old says she wishes the practical element of the catsuit's design was taken into consideration more at the time.\n'I love wearing skirts,' she says. 'Don't get me wrong, they're like my favorite thing to wear, my tennis dresses, but I wanted to make sure that my blood was always circulating and I had been in a near-death experience.\n'So I think there should have been and could have been \u2013 and whether there was or not, I was in it and I wasn't getting out of it \u2013 understanding around that whole outfit.'\nShe credits Nike, her kit manufacturer, for knowing 'how to spark a conversation' and praises them for being able to 'really understand the athlete.'\n'I think in that moment, I really needed to be understood,' she says. 'I'd just had a kid. I think my baby was just a few months old at that time \u2013 why I was even playing, I don't know \u2013 and obviously, I had so many issues with my blood clots.\n'They understood that what I was needing at that time, and it was great. So just hearing my voice and listening to my voice and then hearing the conversation around everything that happened after that, after the catsuit, it was really incredible \u2013 and shocking, too.'\nNearly six years since stepping onto the Parisian clay in the catsuit, Williams says being a mother has taught her to be 'more kind to myself.'\nShe says she has always instilled that kindness in her daughter, too, teaching her that what she says to herself \u2013 and others \u2013 really matters.\n'I'm more kind about body image, I'm more forgiving,' she says of herself. 'And then it's not only that, it's how I also talk to my daughter. I always tell her: \u2018Say something nice. Is there something nice you can think of about this girl?'\n'Because I just want her to always think positive about other people as well. Because that cattiness and that mental health is really not healthy.\n'So I think it just starts at such a young age of just encouraging positive views and positive feedback and positive words that are coming out of your mouth.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Matias Grez,Amanda Davies,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-966865822.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNSport","_score":3.9380746,"_id":"6dd381e5dcc4ff535d474ba616ccb7ab"},{"title":"Opinion: In a two-issue election, Biden should act\u00a0now\u00a0on immigration","author":"Fareed Zakaria","published_date":"2024-04-19 14:27:21","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/opinions/opinion-biden-should-act-now-on-immigration-zakaria","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Staving off right-wing populism requires more aggressive action on the southern border, Fareed Zakaria argues.","summary":"Editor's Note: Fareed Zakaria is the host of Fareed Zakaria GPS, airing at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET Sundays on CNN .

Read more CNN Opinion . CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Bill Maher recently said on his show that the 2024 election was going to be fought over two issues: immigration and abortion. The party that best navigates these cultural battlefields is likely to prevail in November.\nEach party has an advantage, the Democrats on abortion and the Republicans on immigration. Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, energized generations of conservative voters who felt deeply on the issue but were also outraged that courts had taken the question out of the democratic process.\nNow, it's abortion rights voters who are energized, fueled by states like Arizona that are putting in place draconian restrictions on abortion. With the margins small in many swing states, abortion could be the issue that brings out suburban women, who could tilt those states blue in November.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook On the other hand, the Republican Party is now led by former President Donald Trump, who \u2014 on this issue as on many others \u2014 is supremely opportunistic. Trump, of course, proudly supported abortion rights for years until he started flirting with a political career within the Republican Party, at which point he reversed course fully.\nNow that he sees it is politically problematic, he is shifting his stance once again. He has criticized Arizona's abortion ban and has pledged not to sign a national abortion ban if re-elected.\nIt might seem hard for him to backtrack; he has loudly taken credit for the repeal of Roe v. Wade and touted his anti-abortion credentials. But Trump seems able to say anything, and even do anything, without losing the cult-like following he has with Republican voters. He can appeal to the middle ground, certain that his base will stay with him.\nPresident Joe Biden, on the other hand, does not have the fanatical following that Trump does. He has constructed a coalition carefully appealing to different groups with specific policies. If he loses one of those groups, his team fears that the math will not add up come Election Day.\nBut he needs to risk it and get tougher on immigration. It has become a proxy for all kinds of issues where people feel that elites simply don't get the concerns of average people. And the concern is rooted in real facts on the ground.\nThe US has taken in huge numbers of immigrants over the last five decades. In 1970, foreign-born people made up 5.7% of the country. As of 2020, that number was 15.3%. And it's not just America. In Sweden, that number went from 6.6% in 1970 to 19.8% in 2020; in the UK, from 5.3% to 13.8%. As I note in my new book, 'Age of Revolutions,' the Western world has seen a wave of unprecedented migration. Considering the numbers and the cultural diversity of the immigrants, people have been remarkably tolerant.\nIn both the EU and the United States, gangs and cartels have recognized that they can game the asylum system by bringing in migrants who are moving for economic reasons but who apply for asylum, claiming that they are being persecuted at home \u2014 and thus get the right to stay, have legal hearings and eventually work. Last fiscal year, nearly a million people applied for asylum in the US. In the EU last year, that number was more than 1.1 million.\nThe waves of recent migrants have produced problems as anyone on the ground can confirm, from New York City to El Paso to Stockholm. Sweden today is home to one of the highest gun crime death rates in Europe. And it is not a coincidence that its second largest political party is one that traces its roots to World War II-era fascism.\nThe Biden administration has made the case that it has put in place a set of well-crafted policies to limit asylum-seekers, that it needs Congressional action to do more and that Republicans want this problem to fester so that they can reap its electoral benefits. (They even tried to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on utterly bogus charges. The Democratic-majority Senate quickly put a stop to that effort.) All true.\nBut Biden must show he can fight. He should declare a national security emergency, send the National Guard to the border, work with Congress to suspend the asylum process and propose a new one that basically makes it impossible to get asylum if you just show up at the border. Many will scream, and it will all be challenged in court. But it will signal that Biden is taking the problem seriously.\nBill Clinton often says that the American people don't always need you to succeed, but they want to catch you trying. Joe Biden needs to be caught trying to solve the immigration crisis.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Fareed Zakaria","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2147862639-20240419041936989.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":3.9380746,"_id":"33be269bd1502c81ff09c7985ae297d6"},{"title":"Boeing whistleblower: \u2018They are putting out defective airplanes'","author":"Chris Isidore","published_date":"2024-04-17 17:51:24","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/17/business/boeing-whistleblower-safety-hearing","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Boeing's already battered reputation took another hit at two Senate committee hearings Wednesday on Capitol Hill, with witnesses questioning how the company builds airplanes and the safety of those planes.","summary":"Washington DC CNN \u2014\nWashington DC\nCNN\n\u2014\nBoeing's already battered reputation took another hit at two Senate committee hearings Wednesday on Capitol Hill, with witnesses questioning how the company builds airplanes and the safety of those planes.\nOne of the key witnesses was Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour, a whistleblower who said he's been threatened for bringing safety concerns to his managers over several years, but that he was testifying due to his belief that 'they are putting out defective airplanes.'\n'I have serious concerns about the safety of the 787 and 777 aircraft and I'm willing to take on professional risk to talk about them,' he said in his opening statement. He said when he raised concerns, 'I was ignored. I was told not to create delays. I was told, frankly, to shut up.'\nHe said that Boeing used 'unmeasured and unlimited' amount of force \u2013 including people jumping on pieces of the airplane \u2013 to correct misalignment between sections of jets, and that the gap ended up being much more than the 5/1000th of an inch allowed by Boeing's own standards.\nBoeing did not have any witnesses at either hearing Wednesday, but at a briefing earlier this week it defended the standards used to build planes. It said the 5/1000th of a inch gap is only the width of a human hair or two pieces of paper, and was a 'hyper-conservative' standard. It said even when the gap is wider than what was originally proscribed, inspections of the jets showed no signs of fatigue or other problems even after years in service.\nBut Salehpour said that Boeing's assurances are invalid.\n'When operating at 35,000 feet, the size of a human hair can be a matter of life and death,' he said.\n'I have a very negative attitude toward the safety culture,' he said later in the hearing.

When a quality manager says don't send to a subject matter to an expert\u2026 that's concerning.'\nAnother witness, Ed Pierson, a former Boeing manager and the executive director of The Foundation for Aviation Safety, said the lack of paperwork that has been provided to National Transportation Safety Board investigators after a door plug blew out of a Boeing 737 Max flight by Alaska Airlines in January amounted to 'a criminal cover-up.'\n'Records do exist documenting in detail the hectic work done on the Alaska Airlines airplane and Boeing's corporate leaders know it too, because they fought to withhold these same damning records after the two Max crashes,' he said in his opening comments.\nBut Boeing has yet to provide documentation to federal investigators of which employees worked on the door plug that blew off the Alaska Air flight due to it missing four bolts needed to hold the plug in place. Boeing recently said it has searched for records but believes its employees did not document the work.\nSenators on both sides of the aisle expressed concerns about the testimony.\n'This story is serious, even shocking,' said Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, the chairman of the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations. 'There are mounting, serious allegations that Boeing has a broken safety culture, and a set of practices that are unacceptable.'\nBoeing Quality Engineer Sam Salehpour prepares to testify during the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Investigations hearing to examine Boeing's broken safety culture in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Wednesday, April 17, 2024.\nBoeing Quality Engineer Sam Salehpour prepares to testify during the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Investigations hearing to examine Boeing's broken safety culture in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Wednesday, April 17, 2024.\nBill Clark/CQ Roll Call/Sipa\nHe said that since the hearing was announced, his committee has heard from other whistleblowers inside of Boeing. He said one mechanic from its nonunion South Carolina factory wrote that when he brought concerns, he was 'told that hundreds of others were waiting outside the gates for our jobs.'\n'Boeing is at a moment of reckoning,' Blumenthal said. 'It's a moment many years in the making. It's a moment that results not from one incident or one flight or one plane.'\nAt its briefing on Monday ahead of the hearing Boeing said it has encouraged employees to bring forward safety concerns and since the Alaska air incident they have been doing so in much greater numbers.\nBut ranking committee member Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said that while 'we all want Boeing to succeed,' he said it is also important to hear from whistleblowers.\n'What I don't want this committee to do is to scare the you-know-what out of the American public,' he said.

If you organize a protest and a participant, counter-protester or random yahoo shows up and commits an act of violence, can you be legally on the hook? In Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi the answer right now is yes \u2013 and the US Supreme Court just let that terrible ruling stand.\nOn Monday, the court declined to hear Mckesson v. Doe, a case in which Black Lives Matter organizer DeRay Mckesson was sued after someone at a protest he organized in Baton Rouge, Louisiana \u2013 importantly, not Mckesson himself \u2013 threw a rock at a police officer, seriously injuring the officer in the face.\nThat assault was horrible, tragic and criminal. But it's not the actual perpetrator \u2014 who remains unidentified \u2014 who was held accountable. It was Mckesson. That's who the anonymous Officer Doe sued under the theory that Mckesson knew or should have known that violence at the protests would occur, and should therefore be held liable for his negligence.\nThe Fifth Circuit, in part, agreed: Mckesson or any other protest organizer, they ruled, could be held liable under a negligence theory for the actions of third parties at their protests, even if those third parties did not act at their direction and even if they had no intention of fomenting violence. Mckesson, the Fifth Circuit ruled, can be held liable even though he did not intend for violence to occur, did not instigate or promote violence and by no account behaved violently himself.\nThe Fifth Circuit's ruling has tremendous First Amendment implications. After all, Americans have a constitutionally protected right to protest. But that right becomes pretty meaningless if anyone who organizes a protest can be sued into financial ruin for the bad behavior of anyone else who might show up. As Ian Milhiser pointed out in Vox, 'under the Fifth Circuit's rule, a Ku Klux Klansman could sabotage the Black Lives Matter movement simply by showing up at its protests and throwing stones.'\nCommenting on the court's refusal to hear the case, Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted that the court had already weighed in on the first Amendment question in a recent decision, Counterman v. Colorado, which was issued less than two weeks after the Fifth Circuit decided Mckesson. Sotomayor wrote: 'In Counterman, the Court made clear that the First Amendment bars the use of \u2018an objective standard' like negligence for punishing speech.' She included a quote from Counterman, brackets hers: 'the First Amendment precludes punishment [for incitement], whether civil or criminal, unless the speaker's words were \u2018intended' (not just likely) to produce imminent disorder.' Using a negligence standard for liability, she wrote, 'would violate the First Amendment.'\nThe Fifth Circuit used a negligence standard to allow Mckesson to be held liable for the actions of another protester. Sotomayor seems to be clearly saying this was incorrect. 'Because this Court may deny certiorari for many reasons, including that the law is not in need of further clarification, its denial today expresses no view about the merits of Mckesson's claim,' her opinion states. The Fifth Circuit didn't have the Counterman decision to rely on when it issued its ruling in Mckesson; now that Counterman is out in the world, Sotomayor wrote, she expects lower courts 'to give full and fair consideration to arguments regarding Counterman's impact in any future proceedings in this case.'\nIn other words, the Fifth Circuit's Mckesson decision is wrong. A lower court hearing the Mckesson case could and should choose to appropriately apply the law. The Fifth Circuit could eventually get on board. But the Supreme Court declined to actually overturn the Fifth Circuit's decision \u2014 which means that people in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi are, for now, still bound by it.\nThat is very bad news for any activist, or frankly anyone who wants their voices heard in a public forum. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has long been hostile to the Black Lives Matter movement, and Mckesson specifically. Some conservatives may be cheering at this moment of perceived comeuppance. But those same people should ask if they want their movement leaders held responsible if, say, violence breaks out at an anti-abortion march or a pro-Trump 'stop the steal' rally. After all, both of these movements have been rife with violence for years. Does that make anyone who organizes a protest in their name potentially negligent for any harm any attendee causes?\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook Freedom of speech, expression and assembly is a foundational value in the United States, a protection so crucial it is enshrined in the first of the constitutional amendments. Those of us who want those rights protected must stand by them, regardless of content \u2013 that is, whether or not we support the Black Lives Matter movement (for the record, I do) or the MAGA or anti-abortion movements (for the record, I do not). Allowing leaders to be sued if a single bad actor acts badly at a protest imposes far too high a potential cost on organizers; it functionally shuts down speech and, as the Supreme Court has held, is constitutionally impermissible.\nBut it's also currently the law of the land in three American states. And every American, regardless of ideology, should be up in arms and demand that change: People in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi have as much a right to protest as all the rest of us.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jill Filipovic,Opinion Jill Filipovic","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap22084684207675.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":3.7910888,"_id":"26a72aaa8341fd2092b48051ed2a550c"},{"title":"Jane Goodall is world-famous for her work with chimpanzees.

In video from WCBS, pro-Palestinian protesters could be seen clashing with police and some had lit small fires. One woman could be seen being led away in handcuffs.\nFour people were arrested overnight during protests at Columbia, the NYPD said. Police did not specify what charges were filed and gave no additional details about the arrests.\nDuring Wednesday's protests, Columbia closed the gates to campus, only allowing individuals with Columbia IDs to enter. Many of the pro-Palestinian protesters affiliated with Columbia camped on the campus overnight.\nShafik wrote a letter to the NYPD on Thursday asking for the department's help to 'remove these individuals.'\n'The actions of these individuals are in violation of University rules and policies,' the president wrote. 'The University provided multiple notices and warnings and informed the encampment participants that they must disperse or face immediate discipline.'\nThe president told students she authorized the NYPD to break up the encampment, according to an email obtained by CNN. Shafik wrote she authorized the move 'out of an abundance of concern for the safety of Columbia's campus.'\n'I took this extraordinary step because these are extraordinary circumstances,' Shafik wrote. 'The individuals who established the encampment violated a long list of rules and policies.'\nNYPD officers used bullhorns to tell protesters they would be arrested unless they dispersed immediately. Large crowds of Columbia students on the perimeter chanted, 'Shame on you' and, 'The students united will never be defeated.'\nShortly after 2 p.m., a group of at least 200 protesters moved to an area about two blocks away from the school campus near the NYPD staging site and police said they would soon disperse the crowd, CNN witnessed. Officers in helmets, carrying batons, were seen lining up in the street surrounding the group.\nIn the past, the office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has declined to prosecute or deferred prosecution cases where large numbers of people were arrested as part of civil disobedience.\nVideo footage online appears to show NYPD officers clashing with protesters outside the university on Thursday morning. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority Thursday posted a message on social media warning riders buses in the area are delayed because of a protest at the university.\nIsra Hirsi, the daughter of Rep. Ilhan Omar, was among those arrested Thursday, a police official told CNN. The official said Hirsi is being processed and will likely receive a summons for a criminal trespass charge then be released from custody.\nHirsi, an organizer with Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine, said earlier Thursday she and two other students at Barnard College \u2013 located across the street from Columbia University \u2013 were suspended for participating in pro-Palestinian protests.\nIn a statement on X, Hirsi said she has 'never been reprimanded or received any disciplinary warnings' in her three years at the college.\n'I just received notice that I am 1 of 3 students suspended for standing in solidarity with Palestinians facing a genocide,' Hirsi said.\nBarnard is an official college of Columbia University, but also an independently incorporated educational institution.\nWhen asked about the suspensions, a Barnard College spokesperson said the college 'does not provide information about confidential student conduct proceedings,' and referred CNN to a message sent to the college community.\nShafik and the university have been criticized for how their officials have handled antisemitic, Islamophobic and anti-Arab harassment incidents on campus.\nDuring the the House Committee on Education and the Workforce hearing, Shafik said the core of the university's mission is to 'ensure that all members of our community may engage in our cherished traditions of free expression and open debate,' quoting from the school's rules of university conduct.\n'We believe that Columbia's role is not to shield individuals from positions that they find unwelcome, but instead to create an environment where different viewpoints can be tested and challenged,' Shafik added. However, she acknowledged that freedom of speech has been used to justify chants and language that has made students feel unsafe.\nLast fall, a Columbia student who was hanging posters on campus in support of Israel was assaulted. Days later, a mobile 'doxxing' billboard drove outside the entrance of Columbia displaying the names and faces of students who a conservative nonprofit said were linked to a statement blaming Israel for the Hamas terror attack.\nUniversity leaders had issued a statement condemning 'disturbing antisemitic and Islamophobic acts, including intimidation and outright violence.'\nThe university has also faced criticism for hiring a professor who allegedly expressed support for Hamas on social media following the October 7 terror attack on Israel. That professor has been fired, Shafik said Wednesday.\nColumbia did not immediately respond to a request for comment on when the professor's termination takes effect.\nCNN's Matt Egan and Ramishah Maruf contributed to this report.\nCNN's Matt Egan and Ramishah Maruf contributed to this report.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Shimon Prokupecz,John Miller,Emma Tucker","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/h-16195341.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":3.7888389,"_id":"ac41b3f1abb700137a5bd29b5e8e5566"},{"title":"Johnson announces he is moving forward with Ukraine aid bill amid pressure from hardliners","author":"Lauren Fox","published_date":"2024-04-17 15:15:46","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/17/politics/mike-johnson-ukraine-aid","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Speaker Mike Johnson announced Wednesday he is sticking with his plan to put a series of foreign aid bills on the floor including funding for Ukraine after facing significant pressure from hardliners.","summary":"Washington CNN \u2014\nWashington CNN \u2014 Speaker Mike Johnson announced Wednesday he is sticking with his plan to put a series of foreign aid bills on the floor, including funding for Ukraine, after facing significant pressure from hardliners.\nJohnson said in a note to members that they will vote on these Saturday evening.\n'After significant Member feedback and discussion, the House Rules Committee will be posting soon today the text of three bills that will fund America's national security interests and allies in Israel, the Indo-Pacific, and Ukraine, including a loan structure for aid, and enhanced strategy and accountability,' Johnson said in the note.\nThe loan structure around aid comes after a meeting and news conference with Johnson and former President Donald Trump, who said in February that the US should stop providing foreign aid unless it is structured as a loan. That weekend, Johnson earned full-throated support from Trump at a perilous time in his speakership.\nJohnson had announced Monday evening the House will take up separate bills this week to provide aid for Israel and Ukraine, heeding demands from the far right to keep the issues separate. But he also had left open the possibility that the bills could ultimately be packaged together, and Republican leaders could still take procedural steps to send all those pieces as one package to the Senate, which could enrage the right wing of the House GOP conference.\nThe speaker has been facing mounting pressure to make tweaks to the foreign aid package proposed earlier this week \u2013 and not just from his most right-wing members. While conservative House Freedom caucus members have been sounding the alarm on border security and the foreign aid bills since Tuesday's caucus meeting, the shouts have now spilled into the rank and file.\nModerate New York Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis on Wednesday told the speaker 'go back to Biden & Schumer and tell them he needs a border security measure to pass foreign aid.' Johnson said in his letter to members that he will bring forward an immigration bill that looks like the House's HR 2.\nA number of far-right House Republicans have been quick to shoot down the border bill that Johnson announced would be included with the foreign aid bills expected to be voted on Saturday, dispelling any hope that the border provisions would placate the speaker's right flank.\nThe border bill, which includes the core provisions of another House passed border package that remains dead in the Senate, was seen as a messaging exercise by Johnson in attempt to placate his colleagues demands on the border and it clearly does not appear to be working.\nGOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is leading the effort to oust Johnson, said on X: 'You are seriously out of step with Republicans by continuing to pass bills dependent on Democrats. Everyone sees through this.'\nIt all adds up to the most intense pressure that Johnson has faced over his future in his short time as speaker. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky on Tuesday said he would co-sponsor Greene's motion to vacate, which would boot Johnson from the speakership if it passed, leading the speaker to defiantly tell reporters that he would not be resigning.\nConservative hardliners were quickly fuming at Johnson for his decision to move ahead with billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine and loudly warning him it could cost him his job.\nAn angry Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said he is 'very disappointed' in the speaker, and he is 'past the point of giving grace.'\n'I need a little bit more time today, but it is not good,' Roy said when asked by CNN if it is time for him to get out of office.\nFirebrand Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz called Johnson's decision to move ahead with the foreign aid bills as tantamount to 'surrender,' vowing to vote against the package and work hard to pressure others to not support the move. Other Republicans also expressed anger and wouldn't rule out voting against Johnson on procedural motions that could upend the bill.\nWith Republicans only controlling the House by a razor-thin margin, Johnson will likely need Democrats to pass the foreign aid bills \u2013 and save his job should the motion to vacate come to the floor.\nHouse Democrats are waiting to weigh in on precisely how much they will help with procedural votes on the aid package until they see if it includes a must-have item for them: $9 billion in humanitarian aid to Gaza and other conflict zones around the globe. The billions in humanitarian aid includes not just money for Gaza but for Sudan, Haiti and other areas that Democrats have been quick to point out.\nDuring a caucus meeting on Tuesday, Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries told his caucus they would not accept 'one penny' less of humanitarian aid.\nHowever, House Democrats are divided over whether they would try and save Johnson if an effort to oust him gets underway in the chamber, with institutionalists insisting that voting against a motion to vacate could protect the body from devolving into chaos mere months before a presidential election. Progressive members, meanwhile, warn that helping Johnson now could ultimately undermine the party with its base, which already may be less than enthusiastic about showing up at the polls in November.\nDemocratic Reps. Tom Suozzi and Jared Moskowitz have said publicly they would not support an attempt to oust Johnson, but other Democrats \u2013 including one who held the same job as Johnson \u2013 aren't ready to make that kind of commitment.\n'Let's just hope that that does not happen, and that we can do our responsibilities, protect and defend our own democracy as we protect theirs,' former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.\nIf Johnson is indeed ousted, it could plunge the House into chaos once again, with zero legislation getting on the floor until a new speaker is elected.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Wednesday.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Wednesday.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lauren Fox,Michelle Shen,Melanie Zanona,Haley Talbot","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/e2406ad3-0f4a-4d2f-be76-bc512d6cfdd5.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":3.7807293,"_id":"3fbe01007b9329c790059b9406ba7251"},{"title":"Why Biden and Democrats are talking so much about freedom","author":"Ronald Brownstein","published_date":"2024-04-17 04:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/abortion-democrats-freedom-messaging/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration:\u2026","summary":"When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration: 'This fight is about freedom, and the freedom that is fundamental to the promise of America.'\nIn a new abortion-focused ad that the Biden campaign aired in Arizona last week, President Joe Biden somberly asks: 'If Donald Trump gets back in power, what freedom will you lose next?'\nFor Biden, Harris and other Democrats to lean so heavily on the word 'freedom' in this campaign is a historic reversal of roles. At least since the New Deal 90 years ago, Republicans have been the party most likely to frame their agenda as advancing 'freedom' and 'liberty' while Democrats have more often emphasized ideas such as 'equality' and 'justice.'\nRepublicans haven't abandoned their rhetorical efforts to claim the terrain of freedom. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for instance, used the word almost as a mantra the past few years to denounce the restrictions many states imposed to fight the spread of Covid-19 and to attack what he calls the left's effort to impose 'woke ideology.' And Trump disparages Biden's agenda to promote the deployment of electric vehicles as an attempt to deny Americans' freedom to continue purchasing gas-powered cars and trucks.\nBut the GOP push at every level of government to roll back the 'rights revolution' of the past six decades \u2013 symbolized by the proliferation of red-state laws limiting access to abortion and potentially other reproductive health care such as IVF \u2013 has provided Democrats a historic opportunity to reverse the direction of this long-running debate, many analysts agree.\n'Historically, Republicans have rooted their philosophical world view in liberty: for them it's about freedom to own guns, to practice religion as they see fit' or reducing government taxes, spending and regulation, said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute, which studies the intersection of culture and politics. 'What's new is Democrats are using the term in ways to reimagine what freedom really means.'\nTransforming the debate over freedom may be especially crucial for Biden because polls consistently show Trump with a double-digit lead when voters are asked who they trust more to handle the economy. That means that to win the election Biden will need to convince a substantial number of voters who believe Trump is better for their bottom line to vote against him anyway. The interrelated issues revolving around rights, values and democracy likely offer the president his best chance to do so. 'If any issue' is going to flip voters who express more confidence in Trump on the economy, 'it is going to be social issues like abortion,' said Deckman.\nBiden signaled the central role freedom would play in his campaign messaging from the outset, in the video he released last year announcing his plan to seek reelection. As an ominous piano key trills behind images of the January 6, 2021, insurrection, abortion rights protesters and the White House, Biden opens the video with a stark declaration: 'Freedom. Personal freedom is fundamental to who we are as Americans. There's nothing more important. Nothing more sacred.' Later he says: 'The question we're facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer. I know what I want the answer to be, and I think you do too.'\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security.\nRoe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security. Harris, who has been the administration's point person in delivering the freedom message, has likewise cast an expansive net. When Harris delivered a Martin Luther King Day speech to the NAACP this year that summarized the administration's case for another term, she cited all the issues Biden did in the video and others, such as the restrictions several red states have imposed on the teaching of the nation's racial history and the right 'to live free from the horror of gun violence.'\nWay to Win, a liberal group that funds organizations and campaigns focusing on voters of color, has been pushing the party for several years to emphasize the freedom argument. Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, the group's vice president and chief strategy officer, says linking all these other issues to abortion is key to portraying Trump and his allies as a threat to freedom.\n'If [abortion] was the only thing, it would feel different than if you are able to tick off all these other things that they are doing and that they will do,' she said. 'We can even say it with other kinds of repro [rights]: We can say it with IVF, or now they are going to come for your contraception. Abortion is an entry point: because it is so visceral for people, it is a way to connect to a larger story about rights and freedoms.'\nLauren Hitt, a senior spokesperson for the Biden campaign, argued freedom will be a powerful message for the president because it resonates with a broad range of voters. 'It \u2026 speaks to the values of traditional Republican voters, [Nikki] Haley primary voters, and suburban voters \u2013 as well as to our base who believe deeply that the government shouldn't be making personal decisions for people,' she said. 'It's a uniquely powerful idea grounded in traditional democratic values that will be critical in winning the swing voters we need to win in November.'\nThe Trump campaign pushed back on Biden's ad asking which freedom Trump would take away next. 'Under Joe Biden, Americans are less free, less safe, and less prosperous,' Karoline Leavitt, the campaign's national spokesperson, said in a statement.\nDaniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that broad changes in societal attitudes have encouraged both parties to emphasize their commitments to personal freedom. 'Each side recognizes this is something people care about,' Cox said. 'It's effective language at a time when we are increasingly individualistic. We are not as inclined to be communitarian and oriented toward the concerns of others. So I think it's not a surprise that we're seeing both political parties try to employ this language to their advantage.'\nEven with all the increased Democratic emphasis on protecting rights, Cox said, the issue remains 'contested ground' that can favor either party depending on how it is framed. While Republicans have been 'on their heels' defending abortion restrictions such as last week's Arizona ruling, he said, the party has benefited in other races from positioning itself as defending 'parent's rights,' as Republican Glenn Youngkin did while winning the Virginia governorship in 2021. (It's notable that when abortion rights and parental rights collided in the 2023 Virginia state legislative elections, Democrats stressing the former won control of both chambers over Republicans emphasizing the latter.)\nPolling suggests the public remains split over which party it trusts to defend basic rights and freedoms. To begin with, Democrats and Republicans hold very different priorities over which rights are most important to protect, PRRI found in unpublished national polling shared exclusively with CNN. In that survey, conducted late last year, Republicans were most likely to say their freedom to own guns, to practice their religion and to speak their mind was growing more restricted; Democrats were most likely to say that they were losing the freedom to control their own body. 'The parties are talking past each other,' Deckman said. 'Freedom is a word that is quintessentially American, but it depends on what freedoms you are referring to in the first place.'\nThe public returned a similar split verdict last fall in an NBC poll that asked voters which party they trusted more to handle different issues. In the poll, Democrats held a commanding 18 percentage point advantage on dealing with abortion. But when asked which party they trusted more on 'protecting our constitutional rights,' voters preferred Republicans by a margin of 43% to 35%. Even White women, who strongly preferred Democrats on abortion, split evenly over which party they trusted on the broader question of preserving core constitutional rights.\nThat GOP advantage may reflect the traditional political dynamic that conservative voters have been more likely than liberals to believe their rights are under siege and to view government actions as a threat to their liberty. In 2022 polling by Penn State University's McCourtney Institute for Democracy, Republicans were twice as likely as Democrats to say that they had lost rights and freedoms over the past decade. Republicans were also considerably more likely, though not by as lopsided a margin, to predict that they would lose more rights than they gain over the next decade.\nThe real-world consequence of that imbalance was on display in the 2016 presidential campaign, when Democratic-leaning voters largely shrugged about Hillary Clinton's warnings that a Trump victory would allow him to move the Supreme Court to the right in a way that would threaten basic rights, like abortion.\nChris Wilson, a GOP pollster who worked for the super PAC supporting DeSantis in the 2024 campaign, said the Penn State polling suggests that Biden still will face difficulty mobilizing key elements of the Democratic coalition with a message about rights and freedoms. He noted that such groups as Generation Z, Blacks and Latinos were much less likely than college-educated Whites or Republicans to express fears in the poll that they would lose rights in the decade ahead.\n'To whatever extent the Democrats are trying to make a rights argument, it's not as worrying to the youth and to minorities as it is to Whites, people with college degrees, and Boomers,' Wilson said. 'Biden's \u2018rights' argument might be a big hit with his peers, but might be the wrong note to strike if he wants to hold onto the parts of the Democratic coalition that are starting to look shaky.'\nBut the Penn State polling was conducted before the Dobbs decision ended the nationwide right to abortion. And many analysts believe that seismic shift has increased the relevance of questions revolving around rights and freedoms to key groups that Democrats rely on \u2013 with younger women especially focused on these threats. While Republicans traditionally responded more to these arguments, Deckman said, 'These times certainly have made freedom a more accessible, even an existential, issue for people on the left.'\nFernandez Ancona agrees to an extent with both Wilson and Deckman. The 2022 elections, she said, demonstrated how strongly many people react to the risk of losing rights they believed had been settled. 'When these things you take for granted are taken away in this very stark way, it's incredibly motivating,' she said. But she also believes that Democrats need to tie their case about defending personal freedom into a broader message that portrays the 2024 election less as a personal choice between Trump and Biden than as a fundamental crossroads over America's future priorities that will shape not only personal liberties but also economic opportunity.\n'We have to get people to shift their thinking about how this is a choice between two different futures,' she said. 'It can get people out of this one-to-one candidate-to- candidate [comparison] and asking, \u2018what I like, what I don't like' about Trump or Biden.'\nFor libertarians, the escalating struggle between Biden and Republicans over the idea of freedom is a source of both bemusement and frustration. Libertarians take a purist position that advocates for minimal government intervention in both personal behavior and the economy; they usually find Republicans deficient on the first count, and Democrats on the second.\nDavid Boaz, a distinguished senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, sees those flaws in both Biden and Trump. The Biden administration, Boaz said, is 'very big on reproductive freedom, and very big on a lot of aspects of LGBTQ freedom, but beyond those things, where's the freedom in the Biden-Harris plan?' And while Trump talks about promoting economic freedom by cutting taxes and regulation, Boaz continued, Republicans have also undermined such freedom by promoting high tariffs and using government policy to punish companies they disfavor, as DeSantis did with Disney in Florida.\nBut while Boaz believes both Biden and Trump have imperfect records when it comes to promoting freedom, he thinks one issue breaks the tie between them: Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election. \ufeff'I have friends who say Biden is the biggest spender ever and he's regulating and he's woke and how can anyone consider voting for him over Trump?' Boaz said.\n'And I'll say that one reason is that Biden has not tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power. That's a very fundamental issue. You can add up all these [other] issues and weigh them. But the big freedom issue that Biden has over Trump,' Boaaz added, 'is that Trump tried to steal an election.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ronald Brownstein,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bc56ff7a-5e96-468d-93c1-418068e7e891.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":3.6904163,"_id":"29d5ef176fd69a8b984c85be46f5d200"},{"title":"Forget sharks and bears \u2013 it's deer that you should worry about hurting you","author":"Forrest Brown","published_date":"2024-04-21 13:00:26","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/travel/deer-deadly-vehicles-collision","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Deer-vehicle collisions are surprisingly common in the United States, with 2.1 million occuring each year, accounting for 59,000 human injuries and 440 human deaths.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Retired public relations professional Bonnie Sashin and her husband had just spent a nice Thanksgiving visit and meal with family at her stepson's suburban home in the Connecticut city of Fairfield, a charming burg of about 61,000 on Long Island Sound.\nprofessional Bonnie Sashin and her husband had just spent a nice Thanksgiving visit and meal with family at her stepson's suburban home in the Connecticut city of Fairfield, a charming burg of about 61,000 on Long Island Sound. By the time they departed the 2022 family gathering, the sun had already set, Sashin recalls.\nThey cranked up her fairly new Subaru Forester SUV to head to a nearby hotel, where they were staying the night rather than make the two-and-a-half hour drive back to Brookline, Massachusetts, on full stomachs and in full darkness.\n'And just as we turned the corner, practically out of the subdivision where my stepson lives \u2026 I can feel something hit the car. You know, it's dark, and I had no idea what could it be. And I was just very alarmed,' Sashin said.\n'My husband thought it was some kind of animal, and we of course stopped and fortunately a nice, civic-minded woman in front of us stopped. \u2026 She got out of the car. She saw me. She was really nice. She said, \u2018Oh, that was a deer.' And she said, \u2018It happens all the time around here.''\nIt turns out that deer-vehicle collisions are far more than a southern Connecticut problem. They're a problem across much of the United States and in other nations. It also turns out Sashin was fortunate not to have been injured or even killed in the incident.\nEven people who realize how common deer-vehicle collisions are might be surprised at these startling stats for the United States from this November 2022 study in the journal Cell Biology:\n\u2022 Around 2.1 million deer-vehicle collisions occur annually.\n\u2022 The collisions cause more than $10 billion in economic losses annually.\n\u2022 Each year, they account for some 59,000 human injuries and 440 human deaths.\nKip Adams, chief conservation officer with the National Deer Association, notes that deer are much more deadly to Americans each year than those scary movie and TV threats \u2013 sharks, alligators, bears and venomous snakes \u2013 combined. (For instance, there were just two deaths in the United States by shark attack in 2023.)\nLooks like we should be much more wary of Bambi than of Jaws .\n. And the United States is not alone in having a deer problem. For instance, a 2023 study from Scotland's nature agency, NatureScot, estimated that 700 people are injured or killed in deer-vehicle collisions in the United Kingdom annually.\nThey grapple with the deer problem in such far-flung places as British Columbia, Japan, Australia and Germany, too.\nSo what can drivers do to protect themselves from unwanted encounters with these herbivores?\nAdams says your best shield against a deer collision isn't a fancy gadget but knowledge.\n'The first step in helping to minimize hitting one is to be aware of when they are most active,' he told CNN Travel in a phone interview. 'Two things that play into that. \u2026 One is when they're most active daily and then also when they are most active annually.'\nAs for the daily factor, sunrise and sunset should be high-alert times for drivers, Adams said. Why is that?\n'Deer are what's known as crepuscular \u2013 crepuscular means most active at dawn and dusk,' Adams said. 'The way their eyes are built, they can do the best job avoiding predators and collecting what they need when they move in low-light situations \u2013 that being dusk and that being dawn.'\nBut 'that's not our peak vision time. So those two things together \u2013 more activity at a time when we can't see as good \u2013 really play into increased deer-vehicle collisions at those times,' Adams said.\nChad Stewart, a deer, elk and moose management specialist with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, concurs.\n'I would say the hour on either side of both sunrise and sunset are the greatest times when a collision can occur,' he said in an email interview with CNN Travel. 'This is partly due to deer's activity around that time, but also because of heavy traffic patterns during those hours.'\nBut collisions can occur anytime around the clock, Adams cautions.\nRelated article How to survive rip currents and other drowning hazards\nRelated article How to survive rip currents and other drowning hazards Collisions can also happen any time of year \u2013 after all, deer don't hibernate, Adams points out. But two times of year are typically more high risk.\nAdams said the first one is spring. That's fawning time, and 'deer are way more active around roads,' he said.\n'When a doe is having her fawn, the does become extremely territorial of those areas. \u2026 What happens is deer get spread out a lot more on the landscape, which means that they're more apt to, you know, be near a road.'\nBut autumn is the season most fraught with danger, Adams said, 'and the majority of that occurs in November. During that time, deer greatly increase their daily movement patterns,' he said, especially the bucks.\nResearch from State Farm insurance company also highlights November as the most likely month of the year to have a collision with an animal.\nAs Bonnie Sashin's collision in a Connecticut suburb illustrates, you don't have to be out in wilderness to collide with a deer.\n'Typically, suburban areas can hold higher densities of deer, and with more miles driven by vehicles occurring in these areas compared to rural areas, total number of collisions tends to be highest in these areas,' Stewart cautioned.\n'But with that being said, any place has the potential for a collision. Especially where habitat transitions occur (e.g. forest to field), which are commonly used locations for deer.'\nAdams said be on extra guard where the woods come out close to the road, where 'we have very little opportunity of seeing those deer prior to them being in front of a vehicle.'\nThe suburbs are also a big problem, he said, 'because it's extremely difficult to manage deer populations in those areas. We can't go in there in most cases and hunt like we do in more rural areas.'\nSome US states have a bigger problem with deer-vehicle collisions than others.\nState Farm compiles annual statistics assessing the risk in each state. While the insurance company's statistics cover all animal-vehicle collisions, deer account for the majority of them.\nSeventeen states are considered 'high risk' for an animal-vehicle collision, according to the latest State Farm report for 2023-24.\nTopping the list is West Virginia, where drivers have a 1 in 38 annual risk of being in an animal-involved claim, State Farm says.\nThat's not surprising to Adams. The Mountain State is filled with forests, has a high deer population and lacks much in the way of dense urban areas.\n'They have a lot of winding roads through wooded areas which further reduces the visibility. A lot of factors play together there that definitely put West Virginia at the top,' Adams said.\nRounding out the top 5 states are:\nNo. 2: Montana (1 in 53 chance)\nNo. 3: Pennsylvania (1 in 59 chance)\nNo. 4: Michigan (1 in 60 chance)\nNo. 5: Wisconsin (1 in 60 chance)\nNo. 2: Montana (1 in 53 chance)\nNo. 3: Pennsylvania (1 in 59 chance)\nNo. 4: Michigan (1 in 60 chance)\nNo. 5: Wisconsin (1 in 60 chance) Your best bets to avoid colliding with an animal: Nevada, where State Farm says the chance is just 1 in 770, and Hawaii (1 in 710 chance).\nOnce you're better aware of when and where the collision risk is highest, then it's time to put driving strategies into place.\n'Basic safe driving principles apply to reduce your chance at a collision. First and foremost, avoid distracted driving,' Stewart said. Also, slow down in areas known to have high deer numbers so you can 'have better reaction should one jump out in front of your vehicle.'\nAdams said use your high beams whenever possible in deer territory \u2013 but don't blind oncoming traffic.\nStewart's not sold on gadget remedies.\n'Using things like car mounted whistles are not proven to reduce or prevent collisions from occurring, so saving your money and not falling into a false sense of security with these items is advisable.'\nHowever, do make good use of your car horn, advises the National Deer Association in this YouTube video.\nSome other tips from the Michigan State Police:\n\u2022 Deer typically follow one another in single file, so if you see one deer, there are likely more nearby.\u2022 Look for the reflection of headlights in a deer's eyes and deer silhouettes on the shoulder of the road.\n\u2022 Scan the roadside while driving, especially around wooded lots, fencerows, field edges and areas near water.\nUnfortunately, some drivers despite all their caution are going to have to make a split-second decision \u2013 and fight a natural impulse \u2013 when there's a deer ahead in the road.\n'We have a campaign in Michigan called \u2018Don't veer for deer.' The reason this phrase is used is because while nobody wants to hit a deer, there can be far worse consequences by swerving to avoid a deer and hitting something else, like a telephone pole or another car,' Stewart said.\n'Sometimes, collisions with deer simply can't be avoided. But the important thing is to not make it worse for you or somebody else by abruptly and erratically leaving your lane.'\nAdams dispenses the same advice with a fatherly touch.\n'I have a 17-year-old daughter. I talk to her about this all the time. Try to avoid the deer but do not swerve because your chances of having a bad accident are much higher,' he said.\n'It's way better to hit a deer with the front of your car going straight where that car is built to withstand an impact than it is to swerve and go off the road' and possibly hit a tree or another vehicle, Adams said.\nCollisions account for the vast majority of interactions that result in injuries or deaths to people, Adams said, but they aren't the only ways people can be hurt by these generally docile grazers.\nThough incidents are very rare, he said deer that have been raised in captivity and have lost their fear of humans can end up hurting the hands that fed them.\n'You can find accounts where \u2026 somebody got attacked by a deer, like literally attacked. In almost every case, that was a captive animal that had been hand reared.'\nSeveral years ago, a Colorado woman was cited for illegally raising a young deer that attacked and gored one of her neighbors, according to state wildlife officials.\na Colorado woman was cited for illegally raising a young deer that attacked and gored one of her neighbors, according to state wildlife officials. In 2023, a Florida man's pet deer was euthanized on the scene by officials after the animal attacked one of his neighbors.\nAlso in 2023, a man on vacation in Greece approached too closely to a deer for a selfie. The deer rammed him and broke some of his ribs.\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission warns people not to feed deer and to treat them with the respect wild creatures deserve.\nHunting is the other time where human-deer interactions can go wrong.\nIn 2019, an experienced Arkansas hunter was found severely injured in the woods, his body riddled with antler puncture wounds from a deer he had shot but had not killed. He later died. Experts say hunters should wait 15 to 30 minutes before approaching a shot deer to make sure it is dead.\nHowever, the biggest danger in deer hunting is other people, Adams said.\n'Hunting is very safe, and it has gotten way safer over the past couple of decades with hunter safety programs, but accidents still do happen. And it's very clear that the most dangerous person in the woods to you, if you're hunting, is the person you walked in the woods with.'\nAgain, awareness is key, Adams said.\n'I have a family camp in northern Pennsylvania. We have a lot of friends and family that hunt that we share our land with. \u2026 If we are going out as a group to hunt deer, bear, whatever \u2026 I have a little safety talk and tell everybody, \u2018Hey, let's be careful today.' '\nBonnie Sashin's Thanksgiving night collision with a deer happened in a flash. But the repercussions took a while to sort out. The Good Samaritan who stopped in front of her was quite helpful, she said.\n'First thing she said to me \u2013 which was the best piece of advice for us because no one was hurt \u2013 was call the police \u2026 because you're gonna want a record for your insurance company.'\nSashin said she later learned about a friend who collided with a deer and didn't call the police right away \u2013 and the adjuster gave her a hard time.\nThe front fender of Sashin's new car was bashed in, but she and her husband were able to drive her SUV back to Massachusetts, where they learned the vehicle could be repaired vs. being totaled.\n'I went in to my body shop where I know the guy, his name is Paul. \u2026 He said, \u2018Bonnie, get in line. You know how many cars I have that have been hit by deer in the last week?' ' There were five or six ahead of hers, he told her.\n'The pain in the butt part is that you gotta wait a long time these days with a body shop. \u2026 It's very hard to get parts.' She had to wait until February to get her SUV repaired.\nSashin and her husband continue to drive to family trips in the Northeast, but they try to be off the road before dark these days.\nDespite everything, she's grateful they weren't hurt or the vehicle totaled.

At least since the New Deal 90 years ago, Republicans have been the party most likely to frame their agenda as advancing 'freedom' and 'liberty' while Democrats have more often emphasized ideas such as 'equality' and 'justice.'\nRepublicans haven't abandoned their rhetorical efforts to claim the terrain of freedom. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for instance, used the word almost as a mantra the past few years to denounce the restrictions many states imposed to fight the spread of Covid-19 and to attack what he calls the left's effort to impose 'woke ideology.' And Trump disparages Biden's agenda to promote the deployment of electric vehicles as an attempt to deny Americans' freedom to continue purchasing gas-powered cars and trucks.\nBut the GOP push at every level of government to roll back the 'rights revolution' of the past six decades \u2013 symbolized by the proliferation of red-state laws limiting access to abortion and potentially other reproductive health care such as IVF \u2013 has provided Democrats a historic opportunity to reverse the direction of this long-running debate, many analysts agree.\n'Historically, Republicans have rooted their philosophical world view in liberty: for them it's about freedom to own guns, to practice religion as they see fit' or reducing government taxes, spending and regulation, said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute, which studies the intersection of culture and politics. 'What's new is Democrats are using the term in ways to reimagine what freedom really means.'\nTransforming the debate over freedom may be especially crucial for Biden because polls consistently show Trump with a double-digit lead when voters are asked who they trust more to handle the economy. That means that to win the election Biden will need to convince a substantial number of voters who believe Trump is better for their bottom line to vote against him anyway. The interrelated issues revolving around rights, values and democracy likely offer the president his best chance to do so. 'If any issue' is going to flip voters who express more confidence in Trump on the economy, 'it is going to be social issues like abortion,' said Deckman.\nBiden signaled the central role freedom would play in his campaign messaging from the outset, in the video he released last year announcing his plan to seek reelection. As an ominous piano key trills behind images of the January 6, 2021, insurrection, abortion rights protesters and the White House, Biden opens the video with a stark declaration: 'Freedom. Personal freedom is fundamental to who we are as Americans. There's nothing more important. Nothing more sacred.' Later he says: 'The question we're facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer. I know what I want the answer to be, and I think you do too.'\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security.\nRoe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security. Harris, who has been the administration's point person in delivering the freedom message, has likewise cast an expansive net. When Harris delivered a Martin Luther King Day speech to the NAACP this year that summarized the administration's case for another term, she cited all the issues Biden did in the video and others, such as the restrictions several red states have imposed on the teaching of the nation's racial history and the right 'to live free from the horror of gun violence.'\nWay to Win, a liberal group that funds organizations and campaigns focusing on voters of color, has been pushing the party for several years to emphasize the freedom argument. Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, the group's vice president and chief strategy officer, says linking all these other issues to abortion is key to portraying Trump and his allies as a threat to freedom.\n'If [abortion] was the only thing, it would feel different than if you are able to tick off all these other things that they are doing and that they will do,' she said. 'We can even say it with other kinds of repro [rights]: We can say it with IVF, or now they are going to come for your contraception. Abortion is an entry point: because it is so visceral for people, it is a way to connect to a larger story about rights and freedoms.'\nLauren Hitt, a senior spokesperson for the Biden campaign, argued freedom will be a powerful message for the president because it resonates with a broad range of voters. 'It \u2026 speaks to the values of traditional Republican voters, [Nikki] Haley primary voters, and suburban voters \u2013 as well as to our base who believe deeply that the government shouldn't be making personal decisions for people,' she said. 'It's a uniquely powerful idea grounded in traditional democratic values that will be critical in winning the swing voters we need to win in November.'\nThe Trump campaign pushed back on Biden's ad asking which freedom Trump would take away next. 'Under Joe Biden, Americans are less free, less safe, and less prosperous,' Karoline Leavitt, the campaign's national spokesperson, said in a statement.\nDaniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that broad changes in societal attitudes have encouraged both parties to emphasize their commitments to personal freedom. 'Each side recognizes this is something people care about,' Cox said. 'It's effective language at a time when we are increasingly individualistic. We are not as inclined to be communitarian and oriented toward the concerns of others. So I think it's not a surprise that we're seeing both political parties try to employ this language to their advantage.'\nEven with all the increased Democratic emphasis on protecting rights, Cox said, the issue remains 'contested ground' that can favor either party depending on how it is framed. While Republicans have been 'on their heels' defending abortion restrictions such as last week's Arizona ruling, he said, the party has benefited in other races from positioning itself as defending 'parent's rights,' as Republican Glenn Youngkin did while winning the Virginia governorship in 2021. (It's notable that when abortion rights and parental rights collided in the 2023 Virginia state legislative elections, Democrats stressing the former won control of both chambers over Republicans emphasizing the latter.)\nPolling suggests the public remains split over which party it trusts to defend basic rights and freedoms. To begin with, Democrats and Republicans hold very different priorities over which rights are most important to protect, PRRI found in unpublished national polling shared exclusively with CNN. In that survey, conducted late last year, Republicans were most likely to say their freedom to own guns, to practice their religion and to speak their mind was growing more restricted; Democrats were most likely to say that they were losing the freedom to control their own body. 'The parties are talking past each other,' Deckman said. 'Freedom is a word that is quintessentially American, but it depends on what freedoms you are referring to in the first place.'\nThe public returned a similar split verdict last fall in an NBC poll that asked voters which party they trusted more to handle different issues. In the poll, Democrats held a commanding 18 percentage point advantage on dealing with abortion. But when asked which party they trusted more on 'protecting our constitutional rights,' voters preferred Republicans by a margin of 43% to 35%. Even White women, who strongly preferred Democrats on abortion, split evenly over which party they trusted on the broader question of preserving core constitutional rights.\nThat GOP advantage may reflect the traditional political dynamic that conservative voters have been more likely than liberals to believe their rights are under siege and to view government actions as a threat to their liberty. In 2022 polling by Penn State University's McCourtney Institute for Democracy, Republicans were twice as likely as Democrats to say that they had lost rights and freedoms over the past decade. Republicans were also considerably more likely, though not by as lopsided a margin, to predict that they would lose more rights than they gain over the next decade.\nThe real-world consequence of that imbalance was on display in the 2016 presidential campaign, when Democratic-leaning voters largely shrugged about Hillary Clinton's warnings that a Trump victory would allow him to move the Supreme Court to the right in a way that would threaten basic rights, like abortion.\nChris Wilson, a GOP pollster who worked for the super PAC supporting DeSantis in the 2024 campaign, said the Penn State polling suggests that Biden still will face difficulty mobilizing key elements of the Democratic coalition with a message about rights and freedoms. He noted that such groups as Generation Z, Blacks and Latinos were much less likely than college-educated Whites or Republicans to express fears in the poll that they would lose rights in the decade ahead.\n'To whatever extent the Democrats are trying to make a rights argument, it's not as worrying to the youth and to minorities as it is to Whites, people with college degrees, and Boomers,' Wilson said. 'Biden's \u2018rights' argument might be a big hit with his peers, but might be the wrong note to strike if he wants to hold onto the parts of the Democratic coalition that are starting to look shaky.'\nBut the Penn State polling was conducted before the Dobbs decision ended the nationwide right to abortion. And many analysts believe that seismic shift has increased the relevance of questions revolving around rights and freedoms to key groups that Democrats rely on \u2013 with younger women especially focused on these threats. While Republicans traditionally responded more to these arguments, Deckman said, 'These times certainly have made freedom a more accessible, even an existential, issue for people on the left.'\nFernandez Ancona agrees to an extent with both Wilson and Deckman. The 2022 elections, she said, demonstrated how strongly many people react to the risk of losing rights they believed had been settled. 'When these things you take for granted are taken away in this very stark way, it's incredibly motivating,' she said. But she also believes that Democrats need to tie their case about defending personal freedom into a broader message that portrays the 2024 election less as a personal choice between Trump and Biden than as a fundamental crossroads over America's future priorities that will shape not only personal liberties but also economic opportunity.\n'We have to get people to shift their thinking about how this is a choice between two different futures,' she said. 'It can get people out of this one-to-one candidate-to- candidate [comparison] and asking, \u2018what I like, what I don't like' about Trump or Biden.'\nFor libertarians, the escalating struggle between Biden and Republicans over the idea of freedom is a source of both bemusement and frustration. Libertarians take a purist position that advocates for minimal government intervention in both personal behavior and the economy; they usually find Republicans deficient on the first count, and Democrats on the second.\nDavid Boaz, a distinguished senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, sees those flaws in both Biden and Trump. The Biden administration, Boaz said, is 'very big on reproductive freedom, and very big on a lot of aspects of LGBTQ freedom, but beyond those things, where's the freedom in the Biden-Harris plan?' And while Trump talks about promoting economic freedom by cutting taxes and regulation, Boaz continued, Republicans have also undermined such freedom by promoting high tariffs and using government policy to punish companies they disfavor, as DeSantis did with Disney in Florida.\nBut while Boaz believes both Biden and Trump have imperfect records when it comes to promoting freedom, he thinks one issue breaks the tie between them: Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election. \ufeff'I have friends who say Biden is the biggest spender ever and he's regulating and he's woke and how can anyone consider voting for him over Trump?' Boaz said.\n'And I'll say that one reason is that Biden has not tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power. That's a very fundamental issue. You can add up all these [other] issues and weigh them. But the big freedom issue that Biden has over Trump,' Boaaz added, 'is that Trump tried to steal an election.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Ronald Brownstein","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bc56ff7a-5e96-468d-93c1-418068e7e891.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":3.6818223,"_id":"81dbae72a82253d6374c4fc6129317ab"},{"title":"Version of Churchill's hated portrait immortalized in \u2018The Crown' goes up for auction","author":"Caitlin Chatterton","published_date":"2024-04-19 08:44:18","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/style/graham-sutherland-winston-churchill-portrait","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Commissioned for the-then Prime Minister's 80th birthday, the much-maligned and ultimately destroyed painting has another, earlier version set to go under the hammer.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 'That is not a painting, it's a humiliation!' Winston Churchill (played by John Lithgow) angrily tells the renowned painter Graham Sutherland (actor Stephen Dillane) in the first season of 'The Crown,' Netflix's six-series dramatization about the English monarchy. Churchill is talking about his own portrait, commissioned to celebrate his 80th birthday, as it is unveiled in London's Westminster Hall in November 1954.\nChurchill goes on to describe his appearance in the painting as 'a broken, sagging, pitiful creature,' Sutherland as 'a Judas wielding his murderous brush,' and concludes the whole work is 'a betrayal of friendship, and an unpatriotic, treacherous, cowardly assault by the individualistic left!'\nThe episode ends with Churchill's wife Clementine (played by Harriet Walter) watching it burn on a bonfire outside their home.\nEvidently, he was not a fan.\nWhile 'The Crown' is not a documentary, it is true that the 80th birthday portrait \u2014described by Churchill as 'filthy and malignant' in a letter to his personal doctor \u2014 was burned.\n'I think he was quite vain about his image,' Andre Zlattinger, Deputy Chairman UK and Head of Modern British & Irish Art at Sotheby's, explained during a press briefing. 'He'd had a stroke in 1953 so for him (how he was perceived) was important at that time. He'd won the election in 1951 by a narrow margin, and there was quite a lot of debate about him and his leadership.'\nWhile the painting itself was destroyed, a painted study of Churchill \u2014 created by Sutherland in preparation for the infamous birthday portrait \u2014 is now on display at the UK's Blenheim Palace until April 21, in the room where Churchill was born 150 years ago. Sutherland gave the study to his friend Alfred Hecht, who kept it for the rest of his life before gifting it to the current owner. After its stint at the palace, it is headed for Sotheby's New York and London, before being auctioned for the first time on June 6 \u2014 where it is estimated fetch as much as \u00a3800,000 ($997,000).\n'(Sutherland) caught him in a much more relaxed, intimate way,' Zlattinger said of the study, a small canvas painted in oils. 'It's a very different depiction to the (later) painting which obviously Churchill didn't like and was later destroyed.'\nChurchill was far from the only leader to micromanage his image, though; rulers have been controlling and falsifying their images for centuries. Sculptures of Ancient Egyptian pharaohs were stylized in ways to demonstrate their power. The female pharaoh Hatshepsut of the Eighteenth Dynasty diverted from reality completely by having herself depicted with a male torso.\nIn the UK, Queen Elizabeth I is perhaps the most obvious example of a ruler distorting their image. Robert Blyth, Senior Curator of World and Maritime History at Royal Museums Greenwich, told CNN that after her 40s Elizabeth 'simply didn't age'. In The Rainbow Portrait, one of her most famous paintings, any wrinkles a woman in her 60s might have had are carefully smoothed over.\nQueen Victoria, crowned more than 250 years after Elizabeth, also used painting to disguise her age, though the academic Ira B. Nadel wrote that her interest in photography eventually made her 'intolerant of idealized or inaccurate portraits.'\nBlyth explains that, like Churchill, 'a touch of vanity' drove monarchs' tightly controlled image; 'Who would want to have their portrait painted and look exactly as they do?', he joked. However, leaders also needed to provide political stability. Elizabeth I was 'the end of the Tudor line', Blyth noted. 'The idea of her image reflecting any frailty would have caused suspicion.'\nvideo\nvideo Related video How do art auctions really work?\nRelated video How do art auctions really work? Dr Caroline Rae, an associate lecturer in History of Art at University College London, agreed. 'It was a period of big changes, people being beheaded,' she told CNN. 'Mortality is something which causes instability. (Elizabeth) knows things are maybe not as stable as one might think. She's in a precarious position.'\nChurchill himself faced political precarity. An already tumultuous career landed him in Downing Street during the Second World War, but he was voted out almost as soon as it was over. He did become Prime Minister for a second time in 1951, but his Conservative Party only had a 17-seat majority and, in April 1955, six months after the birthday portrait debacle, Churchill resigned over ill health.\n'There was the Suez crisis happening, and Stalin had died in 1953, so there was a lot of stuff going on,' Zlattinger said.\n'His health and political position at that time contributed to him being particularly controlling about how that portrait was created and perceived,' Bryn Sayles, Head of Sale, Modern & Post-War British Art at Sotheby's, told CNN. 'But even on earlier commissions, Churchill was quite famously a very tricky sitter and wanted to be depicted in a particular way. For instance, he made sculptor Jacob Epstein take out a bit of flab from underneath his chin (in a work), so from the beginning, Churchill understood the importance of his image as a politician and was very clear about how he felt that image should be presented to the public.'\nHistoric photographs of the UK's royal family were also regularly altered, however, not everyone was happy about it. Swiss historian Alexis Schwarzenbach reported that Queen Elizabeth, wife of King George VI and mother of Queen Elizabeth II, returned her 50th birthday photo to photographer Cecil Beaton in 1950, with instructions to reduce the amount of retouching done to her lips and chin. Just four years later, Churchill's very different reaction to his own \u2018imperfections' led to the scene now immortalized in 'The Crown' \u2014 a factor which Sayles explains has ironically piqued buyers' interests in owning his portraits.\n'After 'The Crown' episode and Gary Oldman's portrayal of Churchill in the 'Darkest Hour' movie, we literally had new collectors coming in the market looking for Churchill paintings because there was a renewed interest in him.'\nWhile Churchill certainly would not have appreciated fresh attention on his hated portrait, the study is proof that interest in one of the UK's most famous prime ministers is far from dying down yet.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"beauty","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Caitlin Chatterton","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/thecrown-109-0810r.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNstyle","_score":3.6538706,"_id":"de2e820945085b52c0e06f27360eec94"},{"title":"6 surprises from a major news week","author":"Zachary B.

Currently, any single member can force a floor vote on the motion to vacate \u2014 part of the deal Kevin McCarthy made to become speaker last year.\nThe suggestion set off another round of fury amid conservative lawmakers who are unhappy with the speaker over his proposed package of bills to send aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan among other priorities. An effort has been brewing for weeks to potentially oust Johnson, led by Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, and the proposal to change the rules around ousting the speaker has ignited intense speculation over Johnson's future.\nIt's unclear what Johnson will do, but members believe he is considering the change to the process known as the motion to vacate the chair, which would be a significant move by Johnson.\nIn recent days, rank-and-file House Republicans have privately encouraged Johnson to insert language into the text of a rule for the foreign aid bills to alter the motion to vacate and make it harder for any single member to use.\nThe House is finished with floor action for the day, which means that the earliest that Greene could make a motion to oust Johnson would be on Friday. If Greene takes that consequential step, the House will have to consider it within two legislative days. A floor vote to oust Johnson would require a majority to succeed.\nHouse leadership will have to decide how to handle the issue. A motion to table \u2013 or kill \u2013 the resolution could be offered and voted on first. That would also only require a simple majority to succeed.\nNews that Johnson was being lobbied to raise the threshold was first reported by Punchbowl News.\nTensions were running high in the House on Thursday morning. At one point, Johnson was surrounded on the House floor by a number of far-right lawmakers in a heated discussion. Johnson was essentially pinned against the back wall of the House floor with members on all sides of him, with the speaker constantly pivoting his head as he responded to members speaking to him.\nThe group implored Johnson to give them assurances that he would not raise the threshold on the motion to vacate, and the speaker would not commit, leaving many of the lawmakers fuming and some even saying this was their red line that could propel the motion to oust him forward.\n\ufeff'We notified him that any effort to change the threshold of motion to vacate would likely induce the motion to vacate,' GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, who participated in the conversation, told CNN.\nGOP Rep. Derrick Van Orden entered the 20-minute heated floor conversation as it was ongoing and dared his right-wing colleagues to move on the motion to oust Johnson, even calling Gaetz 'tubby.'\nOne GOP lawmaker who participated in the conversation with Johnson, who was granted the anonymity to speak freely, said Van Orden started 'threatening everyone to go ahead with a motion to vacate.'\nThe GOP lawmaker described Johnson as 'very frustrated.'\nGreene warned the speaker against trying to change the threshold and refused to rule out moving to remove him on Thursday.\n'Mike Johnson owes our entire conference a meeting, and if he wants to change the motion to vacate, he needs to come before the Republican conference that elected him and tell us of his intentions, and tell us what this rule change to the motion to vacate is going to be,' Greene told CNN's Manu Raju.\n'It's unprecedented. This has never happened in history, and it's completely wrong. He owes our conference the truth, and he owes Republicans answers,' she added.\nOn top of discussing motion to vacate on the floor, lawmakers said they tried to persuade Johnson to change his course on the foreign aid bills, but the speaker was not receptive.\nConservative Rep. Anna Paulina Luna said she suggested to Johnson on Wednesday night that he take a step back as he tries to push through the supplemental package against hardliners' wishes. Luna said there is concern supporting the motion to vacate could potentially cost Republicans the majority.\n'I think a bigger issue at hand, though, right now is why is it that we have messaging coming from the speaker that's contradictory to what happened with few months back,' she said.\nThe House Rules Committee is meeting Thursday morning to begin considering the foreign aid bills. Text of the rule will be unveiled after the committee approves it, which is expected later in the day.\nDemocrats will be needed in that committee vote and on the floor to advance the rule, as the House Democratic Caucus is still weighing how to proceed as Johnson's job is on the line and as the critical three-part supplemental aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan hangs in the balance.\nDemocrats are still divided on the question, with some arguing it's imperative the party overcomes the bitter partisanship that has been a hallmark of this Congress to deliver critical aid to Ukraine and others arguing it's up to Republicans to pass their own rules.\n'I mean, it's just another layer for sure,' Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat told CNN, adding, 'It's a ridiculous rule, which, you know, whether or not it's doing the right thing in this moment where we have a global security challenge, we ought to be trying to bail them out of their politics is another question.'\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat, said she wouldn't support a Republican rule regardless of whether it included changes to the motion to vacate.\n'I mean, I think they need to pass the rule on their own, but I've thought from the beginning that Kevin McCarthy never should have agreed to that,' Jayapal said. 'He sold his soul early on and he thought he could control everybody.'\nDemocratic Rep. Mike Quigley said he was inclined to back the rule and would think about even supporting it if it included a change to how the motion to vacate functioned.\n'I think dysfunction is everybody's problem. And I'd be open to whatever it takes so that we can function appropriately,' Quigley said.\nDemocratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said leadership needed to weigh in before he decided whether to support such a change.\nOne thing that is hanging over discussions is that many Democrats view Johnson as a more honest broker than McCarthy. Despite the fact they don't agree with him on many issues, they also believe that he's been a fair partner at a critical moment to pass government funding and now this aid to Ukraine.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.

Here are some of the policies Biden says he would enact if elected for a second term.","summary":"President Joe Biden's main pitch to voters ahead of November is simple: They should vote for him because he is not Donald Trump. In speeches and political events since his reelection campaign began in earnest earlier this year, Biden had said that his second term would essentially be a continuation of his first: 'Let's finish this job,' Biden said in a video announcing his reelection campaign last year. In making his case to voters, Biden has contrasted his own ideas of governance with Trump's stated plans to drastically alter how the federal government works, how executive power would be used and how America's role on the world stage will change if the former president wins a second term. Biden, meanwhile, has promised to protect American democracy, pass a federal law to codify the right to an abortion into law, preserve the country's international alliances and agreements and deliver on climate benchmarks. His ability to deliver on these promises even if he wins a second term, though, is not a certainty. Many of his more lofty ambitions would require congressional approval and action. In some of his most significant and enduring acts as president, Trump appointed three conservative nominees to the Supreme Court. The ensuing right-wing supermajority paved the way for the court's 2022 decision that overturned Roe. V Wade, which had enshrined the right to an abortion in federal law for nearly half a century. Biden has made the court's decision, and Trump's repeated promises to go further in restricting abortion access if he were to win in November, a centerpiece of his reelection campaign. 'Like most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right,' Biden said during his State of the Union address on March 7. '\u2026 But my predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. He's the reason it was overturned \u2014 in fact, he brags about it.' 'Look at the chaos that has resulted,' Biden added. During the speech, Biden promised to codify the abortion-related protections enshrined in Roe v. Wade into federal law if he wins a second term, but he acknowledged that would require the cooperation of a Democratic-controlled Congress. 'If Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again,' Biden said. Biden called for codifying Roe into law when he was running for president in 2020. While seeking office in 2020, Biden made ambitious climate-related promises, warning that climate change presents an existential threat to humanity. Some of those promises panned out: Biden's landmark legislative achievements, the bipartisan infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act, include hundreds of billions of dollars to encourage clean energy production and the manufacturing of electric vehicles. Pollution-falling emissions fell by 2% in the United States last year. Activists on Biden's left flank still think the president has not done enough \u2014 they want Biden to declare a climate emergency that would free up federal resources to confront climate change. Biden will need more time to fulfill some of his other pledges, including cutting emissions in half by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, and having a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. Biden said the 2020 race was a 'battle for the soul of the nation.' Now, he has made preserving democracy the focal point of his 2024 campaign \u2014 saying the value Americans place on a free and democratic society is the most important question of our country's time. He lays out the stakes in stark terms: If Trump wins a second term, the United States will face a crisis that could lead to the erosion of democratic norms. 'Not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault here at home as they are today,' Biden said during his State of the Union address last month. Today, he warned, there are 'forces taking us back in time.' Biden urged Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. The acts, which would have made Election Day a federal holiday, bolstered voting-related security measures, allowed all voters to request mail-in ballots and updated parts of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, were blocked by Senate Republicans in 2021. 'Pass and send me the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act,' Biden told Congress during his address, 'and stop denying another core value of America \u2014 our diversity across American life.' Biden has criticized Republican-led drives to ban certain books from public schools. 'Banning books \u2013 it's wrong,' he said in his State of the Union address. The United States, he said, shouldn't be erasing history. In the same speech, Biden also called for expanded pre-kindergarten for 3- and 4-year-olds, along with raises for teachers in public schools. He said he wants to continue making college more affordable by expanding access to Pell grants for working-class families, renewing a 2020 promise he made to double the grants' value. 'To remain the strongest economy in the world,' Biden said, 'we need the best education system in the world.' In some of his first actions as president, Biden worked to return the United States to the presence it held on the world stage before Trump became president. As president, Trump denigrated alliances like NATO and withdrew the United States from crucial international agreements, including the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accords. While running in 2020, Biden promised to undo damage wreaked by Trump on America's international partnerships. Biden has said he will continue to repair relationships that have faltered under Trump's control \u2014 and uphold American commitments to NATO and Ukraine. Trump, meanwhile, has said he would encourage Russia to do 'whatever the hell they want' to NATO-member countries who don't fulfill certain funding obligations. Biden frequently refers to those comments while speaking with supporters. 'The rest of the world is wondering what in the hell is happening to us,' Biden said at a campaign event in New York last month. 'And they're relieved, not because I'm so special but that I'm not Trump.' In an earlier Dallas fundraiser, Biden said the United States' international reputation was 'crushed when (Trump) was president.' 'Imagine what will happen if he's reelected,' Biden said. In 2022, Biden signed the most comprehensive gun-reform legislation in nearly 30 years. The law, passed shortly after a White supremacist massacred 10 people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket, allocated more than $750 million to help states implement crisis-intervention programs, closed certain loopholes in existing gun-control legislation and required more thorough reviews for people aged 18 to 21 who wanted to buy firearms. Biden has said he wants to go further. 'I'm demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,' Biden said at his State of the Union address. 'Pass universal background checks. None of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners.' He made a similar promise while running in 2020 but has not been able to get Congress' support. Biden has homed in on Trump's statements suggesting he would be open to cutting programs like Social Security and Medicare. In an interview with CNBC last month, Trump said: 'There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements,' Trump said on CNBC. Biden responded on X: 'Not on my watch.' He reiterated his vow to protect Social Security during his State of the Union address. 'Many of my Republican friends want to put Social Security on the chopping block,' Biden said 'If anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age I will stop them.' 'I will protect and strengthen Social Security and make the wealthy pay their fair share,' he added. ``\nPresident Joe Biden's main pitch to voters ahead of November is simple: They should vote for him because he is not Donald Trump.\nIn speeches and political events since his reelection campaign began in earnest earlier this year, Biden had said that his second term would essentially be a continuation of his first: 'Let's finish this job,' Biden said in a video announcing his reelection campaign last year.\nIn making his case to voters, Biden has contrasted his own ideas of governance with Trump's stated plans to drastically alter how the federal government works, how executive power would be used and how America's role on the world stage will change if the former president wins a second term.\nBiden, meanwhile, has promised to protect American democracy, pass a federal law to codify the right to an abortion into law, preserve the country's international alliances and agreements and deliver on climate benchmarks.\nHis ability to deliver on these promises even if he wins a second term, though, is not a certainty. Many of his more lofty ambitions would require congressional approval and action.\nIn some of his most significant and enduring acts as president, Trump appointed three conservative nominees to the Supreme Court. The ensuing right-wing supermajority paved the way for the court's 2022 decision that overturned Roe. V Wade, which had enshrined the right to an abortion in federal law for nearly half a century.\nBiden has made the court's decision, and Trump's repeated promises to go further in restricting abortion access if he were to win in November, a centerpiece of his reelection campaign.\n'Like most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right,' Biden said during his State of the Union address on March 7. '\u2026 But my predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. He's the reason it was overturned \u2014 in fact, he brags about it.'\n'Look at the chaos that has resulted,' Biden added.\nDuring the speech, Biden promised to codify the abortion-related protections enshrined in Roe v.

While I understand the importance of that idea, any rule change requires a majority of the full House, which we do not have. We will continue to govern under the existing rules.'\nCNN and other outlets reported Thursday morning that, according to multiple GOP sources, Johnson was being lobbied by his members to raise the threshold required to trigger the procedure to oust the speaker \u2013 a move that would help ensure the Louisiana Republican can pass foreign aid bills and still keep his job without needing to rely on Democrats to bail him out. Currently, any single member can force a floor vote on the motion to vacate \u2014 part of the deal Kevin McCarthy made to become speaker last year.\nThe suggestion set off another round of fury amid conservative lawmakers who are unhappy with the speaker over his proposed package of bills to send aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan among other priorities. An effort has been brewing for weeks to potentially oust Johnson, led by Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, and the proposal to change the rules around ousting the speaker has ignited intense speculation over Johnson's future.\nIn recent days, rank-and-file House Republicans had privately encouraged Johnson to insert language into the text of a rule for the foreign aid bills to alter the motion to vacate and make it harder for any single member to use.\nThe House is finished with floor action for the day, which means that the earliest that Greene could make a motion to oust Johnson would be on Friday. If Greene takes that consequential step, the House will have to consider it within two legislative days. A floor vote to oust Johnson would require a majority to succeed.\nHouse leadership will have to decide how to handle the issue. A motion to table \u2013 or kill \u2013 the resolution could be offered and voted on first. That would also only require a simple majority to succeed.\nNews that Johnson was being lobbied to raise the threshold was first reported by Punchbowl News.\nTensions were running high in the House on Thursday morning. At one point, Johnson was surrounded on the House floor by a number of far-right lawmakers in a heated discussion. Johnson was essentially pinned against the back wall of the House floor with members on all sides of him, with the speaker constantly pivoting his head as he responded to members speaking to him.\nThe group implored Johnson to give them assurances that he would not raise the threshold on the motion to vacate, and the speaker would not commit, leaving many of the lawmakers fuming and some even saying this was their red line that could propel the motion to oust him forward.\n\ufeff'We notified him that any effort to change the threshold of motion to vacate would likely induce the motion to vacate,' GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, who participated in the conversation, told CNN.\nGOP Rep. Derrick Van Orden entered the 20-minute heated floor conversation as it was ongoing and dared his right-wing colleagues to move on the motion to oust Johnson, even calling Gaetz 'tubby.'\nOne GOP lawmaker who participated in the conversation with Johnson, who was granted the anonymity to speak freely, said Van Orden started 'threatening everyone to go ahead with a motion to vacate.'\nThe GOP lawmaker described Johnson as 'very frustrated.'\nGreene warned the speaker against trying to change the threshold and refused to rule out moving to remove him on Thursday.\n'Mike Johnson owes our entire conference a meeting, and if he wants to change the motion to vacate, he needs to come before the Republican conference that elected him and tell us of his intentions, and tell us what this rule change to the motion to vacate is going to be,' Greene told CNN's Manu Raju.\n'It's unprecedented. This has never happened in history, and it's completely wrong. He owes our conference the truth, and he owes Republicans answers,' she added.\nOn top of discussing motion to vacate on the floor, lawmakers said they tried to persuade Johnson to change his course on the foreign aid bills, but the speaker was not receptive.\nConservative Rep. Anna Paulina Luna said she suggested to Johnson on Wednesday night that he take a step back as he tries to push through the supplemental package against hardliners' wishes. Luna said there is concern supporting the motion to vacate could potentially cost Republicans the majority.\n'I think a bigger issue at hand, though, right now is why is it that we have messaging coming from the speaker that's contradictory to what happened with few months back,' she said.\nThe House Rules Committee is meeting Thursday morning to begin considering the foreign aid bills. Text of the rule will be unveiled after the committee approves it, which is expected later in the day.\nDemocrats will be needed in that committee vote and on the floor to advance the rule, as the House Democratic Caucus is still weighing how to proceed as Johnson's job is on the line and as the critical three-part supplemental aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan hangs in the balance.\nDemocrats are still divided on the question, with some arguing it's imperative the party overcomes the bitter partisanship that has been a hallmark of this Congress to deliver critical aid to Ukraine and others arguing it's up to Republicans to pass their own rules.\n'I mean, it's just another layer for sure,' Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat told CNN, adding, 'It's a ridiculous rule, which, you know, whether or not it's doing the right thing in this moment where we have a global security challenge, we ought to be trying to bail them out of their politics is another question.'\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat, said she wouldn't support a Republican rule regardless of whether it included changes to the motion to vacate.\n'I mean, I think they need to pass the rule on their own, but I've thought from the beginning that Kevin McCarthy never should have agreed to that,' Jayapal said. 'He sold his soul early on and he thought he could control everybody.'\nDemocratic Rep. Mike Quigley said he was inclined to back the rule and would think about even supporting it if it included a change to how the motion to vacate functioned.\n'I think dysfunction is everybody's problem. And I'd be open to whatever it takes so that we can function appropriately,' Quigley said.\nDemocratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said leadership needed to weigh in before he decided whether to support such a change.\nOne thing that is hanging over discussions is that many Democrats view Johnson as a more honest broker than McCarthy. Despite the fact they don't agree with him on many issues, they also believe that he's been a fair partner at a critical moment to pass government funding and now this aid to Ukraine.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.

Her book, 'From India with Love,' was published in 2015. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more CNN Opinion . When news broke of a stabbing, and mass killing, at a Sydney shopping mall in which a baby was attacked, right-wing commentators overseas were quick to falsely diagnose the motive.\n'Another day. Another terror attack by another Islamist terrorist. Six dead, others seriously injured, including a baby,' tweeted the British right-wing commentator Julia Hartley-Brewer.\nBut Hartley-Brewer was wrong. And she later acknowledged the post was incorrect.\nThe motive was not Islamist but an everyday threat for women: gendered violence.\nIt was 'obvious' said the New South Wales Police Commissioner Karen Webb, that now-deceased attacker Joel Cauchi, a diagnosed schizophrenic according to his family, had a specific kind of victim in mind when he entered the beach suburb of Bondi's busy Westfield shopping center on Saturday.\n'The videos (of the attack) speak for themselves don't they?' Webb told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).\n'It's obvious to me, it's obvious to detectives, that that seems to be an area of interest, that the offender had focussed on women and avoided the men.\n'Five of the (six) deceased are women and the majority of victims in hospital are also women,' she said.\nWebb added that police didn't know what was in the mind of Cauchi when he launched his attack.\nDetectives will certainly be trawling through his online activity to see if he belonged to any hate groups that operate in the darkest corners of the web.\nCauchi's father Andrew Cauchi \u2014 who appeared devastated \u2014 believes his 'monster' son may have deliberately set out to kill women, he told Australian media.\n'Because he wanted a girlfriend, and he has no social skills, and he was frustrated out of his brain,' added the visibly distraught father.\nLike Cauchi's father, the nation is also traumatised. Multiple people, including a new mother, slaughtered in daylight in an affluent suburb is something Australians read about in the news when it happens in other countries.\nRarely does it occur in their backyard. When it did in 1996 after the Port Arthur Massacre when a lone gunman killed 35 people, then-prime minister John Howard, a Conservative leader, acted - with bipartisan support that has remained rock solid ever since.\nHe enacted strict gun control laws and initated a massive buyback scheme. He had to stare down political opposition from his own supporters at the time, but his tough stance has been vindicated by the lack of mass shootings ever since.\nBut restricting public access to weapons with the capability of mass lethality cannot stop hateful ideologies mixing with other noxious ingredients including radicalisation and mental health issues.\nThis includes misogyny.\nAustralian women live with some of the most sexist attitudes in the world, according to research presented to the London-based Global Institute for Women's Leadership, chaired by Australia's former and only female prime minister, Julia Gillard.\nAccording to Our Watch, Australia's leading national violence prevention organisation which provided me with the following statistics, two in five women have experienced violence since the age of 15, but it is far more likely \u2014 35% versus 11% \u2014 to be at the hands of someone they know, rather than a complete stranger.\nThis is partly why the Bondi attack was so shocking.\nOur Watch CEO Patty Kinnersly told me that while the motivating factors in Saturday's attack were complex and still not determined, the case showed why addressing sexist attitudes was critical to women's safety.\nWhile we cannot speak directly about the causes or motives for this specific incident, we know that more broadly, evidence does not point to mental illness being a driver of violence against women.\nPatty Kinnersly\n'While we cannot speak directly about the causes or motives for this specific incident, we know that more broadly, evidence does not point to mental illness being a driver of violence against women,' she said.\n'The evidence consistently shows that the underlying causes of violence directed toward women are rigid gender stereotypes, sexism and disrespect.\n'The sad reality is that when men hold unequal and sexist views about women, women are not safe.'\nThe city was rocked again by a second and shockingly violent attack on Monday night, when a teenager stabbed worshippers, including Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel giving mass at the Assyrian Orthodox Christ The Good Shepherd Church.\nUnlike Cauchi's deadly rampage, the church attack was declared a terrorist act.\nRoman Quaedvlieg, who worked in Australian law enforcement for decades, including on counterterrorism, told me the motivations behind the types of attacks witnessed in Sydney in the space of just a few days were often driven by a complex set of factors.\n'These can be rooted in deep-seated emotional or psychological causes and are often accompanied by mental ill-health, and/or substance abuse,' he said.\n'Lone actor terrorists in non-conflict areas like Australia usually are young males with emotional or psychological vulnerabilities, who are often social misfits as a result of those vulnerabilities,' he added.\nQuaedvlieg said technology meant that the path to radicalisation was so swift, it could go unnoticed.\n'I do believe that the evolution of technology, online connectivity, and the proliferation of video images, particularly when they lionize violence, does inspire, embolden, normalise and instruct those who have a disposition to extremism and violence,' he said.\nHe added that the motivations for attacks didn't need to be the same for them to inspire other radicals.\n'Considering the attacks occurred in the same city, the short span of time between the attacks and the wide publicity dedicated to the Bondi Junction attack, it is possible that the Wakeley attacker was either motivated to seek similar notoriety, or the Bondi Junction attack gave him confidence to act on an intent he had previously harboured,' he said.\nBut one commonality between the two males was their history with knives.\nJoel Cauchi had a fixation with blades and kept a collection of them, his father told the newspaper The Australian.\nAnd the 16-year-old boy arrested for the church attack was charged with possessing a knife, in November last year, according to the ABC.\nThe ABC also reported that the boy used a switchblade, an illegal weapon in Australia. His attack inside the church did not kill anyone.\nImagine if they'd been obsessed with guns.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook If he had been living in the United States, might Cauchi have been able to slaughter many many more women because of that country's much easier access to assault rifle-style semi-automatic firearms?\nBecause of technology, the ability for self-radicalization \u2014 whatever the combination of motivating factors \u2014 is speedier now than in the days when Howard had the foresight to ban weapons capable of causing mass casualties in seconds.\nAustralia is rocked by the tragedy. Mums and Dads will be holding their children a little tighter this week.\nThe twin attacks are horrifying, distressing and shocking but partly why it is so especially shocking is that unlike the US where mass shootings sadly never feel out of the headlines for long, violence in Australia at the scale witnessed these past few days has been rare.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Opinion Latika Bourke,Latika Bourke","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-04-16t083403z-1909137027-rc2h77a1d4va-rtrmadp-3-australia-crime-2.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":3.4212217,"_id":"17e32d43676c6565f725dbaf63cb99c9"},{"title":"Senate kills the articles of impeachment against Alejandro Mayorkas","author":"Gregory Krieg","published_date":"2024-04-17 10:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/17/politics/senate-mayorkas-impeachment-articles/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The Senate made short work of the articles of impeachment against Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday, ending the historic trial before it began in earnest as the Democratic majority\u2026","summary":"The Senate made short work of the articles of impeachment against Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday, ending the historic trial before it began in earnest as the Democratic majority brushed aside GOP efforts to prolong the dead-end process.\nHouse Republicans voted to impeach Mayorkas on February 13 on their second attempt after failing at first to get the necessary votes. The Biden appointee became the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.\nThere was less drama in the upper chamber, where the proceedings ended a few hours after they began following votes, mostly along party lines, to declare unconstitutional the two articles of impeachment against Mayorkas \u2013 one for 'willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law' and another for 'breach of public trust.' Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski was the lone Republican holdout, voting present on the first article.\nThe blink-and-you-missed it Senate trial marked the culmination of a mostly failed political gambit hatched by House Republicans seeking to cast the limelight on the Biden administration's handling of the southern border ahead of the general election. But the merits of the case they hoped to bring to the Senate were widely seen as lacking substance and, to some, a distraction from other election year messaging. House GOP claims that Mayorkas, the first Latino and immigrant to hold the job, committed high crimes and misdemeanors never passed muster with constitutional experts, who said the evidence against him failed to clear that high bar.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer opened the proceedings by offering a time agreement to Republicans that would have allowed a certain amount of floor debate and votes on trial resolutions and points of order before an eventual vote to dismiss the case.\nBut Republican Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri objected, saying he would not agree to a proposal that would have concluded the matter with the 'unprecedented' step of ending an impeachment case without a trial. Many Republicans wanted an agreement because it would have allowed them to make floor speeches targeting Democrats over the process and the situation at the border. Absent that, speeches would only have been allowed to those who got unanimous consent from their colleagues \u2013 an unlikely scenario given the political stakes of the moment.\nSchumer then made a motion to table, or kill, the first impeachment article because 'it does not allege conduct that rises to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor' as required in the Constitution. After several rounds of procedural votes, the Senate passed that motion 51-48 with one voting present, killing the first article of impeachment.\nAfter several more procedural votes, Schumer's motion to table the second article was also approved, killing the second article of impeachment by a party line vote of 51-49.\nThe House transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate on Tuesday and senators were sworn in as jurors Wednesday. It was highly doubtful that the chamber would vote to convict, which would require a two-thirds majority vote \u2013 an exceedingly high bar to clear.\nDemocrats had slammed the impeachment as a political stunt, saying that Republicans had no valid basis for the move and that policy disagreements were not a justification for the rarely used constitutional impeachment of a Cabinet official.\n'We want to address this issue as expeditiously as possible,' Schumer said in floor remarks on Tuesday. 'Impeachment should never be used to settle a policy disagreement.'\nHe added, 'Talk about awful precedents. This would set an awful precedent for Congress. Every time there's a policy agreement in the House, they send it over here and tie the Senate in knots to do an impeachment trial? That's absurd. That's an abuse of the process. That is more chaos.'\nA number of congressional Republicans, however, criticized the prospect of a quick dismissal or move to table.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that senators had a 'rare' and 'solemn' responsibility to consider the impeachment articles and said he would oppose any effort to table the articles.\n'As befits such a solemn and rare responsibility as convening a court of impeachment, I intend to give these charges my full and undivided attention,' he said.\nThe Kentucky Republican added, 'It would be beneath the Senate's dignity to shrug off our clear responsibility and fail to give the charges we'll hear today the thorough consideration they deserve. I will strenuously oppose any effort to table the articles of impeachment and avoid looking the Biden administration's border crisis squarely in the face.'\nAdditionally, some hard-right Republican senators were trying to find a way to force a full trial, but their efforts did not get enough traction to pass as procedural vote after procedural vote failed along party lines.\nRepublicans targeted Mayorkas as soon as they took control of the House, blaming the high number of border crossings on the Homeland Security secretary as the party faced pressure from its base to go after the Biden administration on a key campaign issue.\nMayorkas has pushed back against criticism of his leadership, and DHS has called the impeachment effort against him a baseless political attack.\nThe White House, for its part, had worked to flip the script, citing Republicans blocking a bipartisan border deal in the Senate as evidence that the party isn't serious about border security.\nWhite House and Homeland Security officials were in frequent communication over the course of the impeachment inquiry into Mayorkas, gaming out strategy and response as they publicly cast the trial as a political stunt. Since Republicans launched their effort to oust the Homeland Security secretary, Biden administration officials have maintained that Mayorkas planned to stay in the post, dismissing the GOP impeachment inquiry into the DHS chief as 'meritless.'\nInstead, White House and Homeland Security officials deployed a split-screen strategy, like casting the House majority's proceedings as a waste of time while Mayorkas worked with senators to strike a border deal.\nAfter months of negotiations, Senate Republicans earlier this year blocked that major bipartisan border deal that would have marked a tough change to immigration law and would have given the president far-reaching powers to restrict illegal migrant crossings at the southern border.\nThe deal faced a torrent of attacks from former President Donald Trump and top House Republicans.\nThe Department of Homeland Security and White House praised Senate Democrats for killing the impeachment proceedings.\n'Once and for all, the Senate has rightly voted down this baseless impeachment that even conservative legal scholars said was unconstitutional,' said Ian Sams, White House spokesperson for oversight and investigations. 'President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas will continue doing their jobs to keep America safe and pursue actual solutions at the border, and Congressional Republicans should join them, instead of wasting time on baseless political stunts while killing real bipartisan border security reforms.'\n'As he has done throughout more than 20 years of dedicated public service, Secretary Mayorkas will continue working every day to enforce our laws and protect our country,' added Mia Ehrenberg, a spokesperson for DHS. 'It's time for Congressional Republicans to support the Department's vital mission instead of wasting time playing political games and standing in the way of commonsense, bipartisan border reforms.'\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.

This specific assistance is the kind of direct payment that helps Ukraine's government continue to function during a war.\nThose loans are through approximately $7.9 billion in economic assistance to Ukraine and another $1.6 billion in assistance for Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia, requiring the president to strike an agreement with Kyiv to repay the funding. The administration could cancel the debt if they choose to, according to a source familiar.\nThe fight over the bills \u2013 and the potential for right-wing members of the GOP to attempt to oust Johnson over it \u2013 adds up to the most intense pressure that the speaker has faced over his future in his short time in the role. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky on Tuesday said he would co-sponsor Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to vacate, which would boot Johnson from the speakership if it passed, leading the speaker to defiantly tell reporters that he would not be resigning.\nThe loan structure around aid comes after a meeting and news conference with Johnson and former President Donald Trump, who said in February that the US should stop providing foreign aid unless it is structured as a loan. That weekend, Johnson earned full-throated support from Trump at a perilous time in his speakership.\nJohnson had announced Monday evening the House will take up separate bills this week to provide aid for Israel and Ukraine, heeding demands from the far right to keep the issues separate. But the final product is expected to be lumped together as one big package that will be sent to the Senate, according to sources familiar. The House can do this though an arcane procedure, something that is enraging the right wing of the Republican party but it's what Democrats have been insisting on as a condition of their support.\nThe speaker has been facing mounting pressure to make tweaks to the foreign aid package proposed earlier this week \u2013 and not just from his most right-wing members. While conservative House Freedom caucus members have been sounding the alarm on border security and the foreign aid bills since Tuesday's caucus meeting, the shouts have now spilled into the rank and file.\nModerate New York Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis on Wednesday told the speaker 'go back to Biden & Schumer and tell them he needs a border security measure to pass foreign aid.' Johnson said in his letter to members that he will bring forward an immigration bill that looks like the House's HR 2.\nA number of far-right House Republicans have been quick to shoot down the border bill that Johnson announced would be included with the foreign aid bills expected to be voted on Saturday, dispelling any hope that the border provisions would placate the speaker's right flank.\nThe border bill, which includes the core provisions of another House passed border package that remains dead in the Senate, was seen as a messaging exercise by Johnson in attempt to placate his colleagues demands on the border and it clearly does not appear to be working.\nGreene, who is leading the effort to oust Johnson, said on X: 'You are seriously out of step with Republicans by continuing to pass bills dependent on Democrats. Everyone sees through this.'\nConservative hardliners were quickly fuming at Johnson for his decision to move ahead with billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine and loudly warning him it could cost him his job.\nAn angry Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said he is 'very disappointed' in the speaker, and he is 'past the point of giving grace.'\n'I need a little bit more time today, but it is not good,' Roy said when asked by CNN if it is time for him to get out of office.\nFirebrand Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz called Johnson's decision to move ahead with the foreign aid bills as tantamount to 'surrender,' vowing to vote against the package and work hard to pressure others to not support the move. Other Republicans also expressed anger and wouldn't rule out voting against Johnson on procedural motions that could upend the bill.\nWith Republicans only controlling the House by a razor-thin margin, Johnson will likely need Democrats to pass the foreign aid bills \u2013 and save his job should the motion to vacate come to the floor.\nHouse Democrats are waiting to weigh in on precisely how much they will help with procedural votes on the aid package until they see if it includes a must-have item for them: $9 billion in humanitarian aid to Gaza and other conflict zones around the globe. The billions in humanitarian aid includes not just money for Gaza but for Sudan, Haiti and other areas that Democrats have been quick to point out.\nDuring a caucus meeting on Tuesday, Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries told his caucus they would not accept 'one penny' less of humanitarian aid.\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday offered his first explicit endorsement of the plan offered up by House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n'I strongly support this package to get critical support to Israel and Ukraine, provide desperately needed humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza, and bolster security and stability in the Indo-Pacific. Israel is facing unprecedented attacks from Iran, and Ukraine is facing continued bombardment from Russia that has intensified dramatically in the last month,' Biden said in a statement.\nThe state of the battlefield in Ukraine is beginning to 'shift a bit \u2026 in Russia's favor,' Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers on Wednesday as he urged for passage of the supplemental aid package for Ukraine.\n'In terms of, you know, what happens going forward and how long Ukraine will be able to sustain its efforts, I think we're already seeing things on the battlefield begin to shift a bit in in terms of in Russia's favor,' Austin told the House Defense Appropriations subcommittee.\nHowever, House Democrats are divided over whether they would try and save Johnson if an effort to oust him gets underway in the chamber, with institutionalists insisting that voting against a motion to vacate could protect the body from devolving into chaos mere months before a presidential election. Progressive members, meanwhile, warn that helping Johnson now could ultimately undermine the party with its base, which already may be less than enthusiastic about showing up at the polls in November.\nDemocratic Reps. Tom Suozzi and Jared Moskowitz have said publicly they would not support an attempt to oust Johnson, but other Democrats \u2013 including one who held the same job as Johnson \u2013 aren't ready to make that kind of commitment.\n'Let's just hope that that does not happen, and that we can do our responsibilities, protect and defend our own democracy as we protect theirs,' former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.\nIf Johnson is indeed ousted, it could plunge the House into chaos once again, with zero legislation getting on the floor until a new speaker is elected.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Wednesday.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Wednesday.

Portable speakers have a place in cars, on bikes, at parties and can even be substituted as soundbars for your TV or computer. Sony just launched its newest portable Bluetooth speaker with the Ult Field 1, and this year, the company is bringing the bass.\n'Ult' stands for Sony's belief that this line of audio products \u2014 the Ult Tower 10, the Ult Field 7 and Field 1 and the Ult Wear headphones \u2014 is the ultimate step into its audio evolution. What Ult actually means on these products is more bass (and in the larger products, more dynamic pressure to project the sound).

The Ult branding is frankly refreshing \u2014 Field 1 is a lot easier to reference than a combination of alphanumeric characters that make sense to no one except product managers.\nIf it seems like I'm harping on this point, it's because I am. But I'm also curious as to what's going to happen next year. The Ult Field 2? Maybe Sony will take a page from its cameras and phones and go with Ult Field 1 Mark II. It remains to be seen, but for now, we can at least be happy that the naming scheme makes sense.\nCompact and very portable\nAdam Doud/CNN Underscored\nThe Sony Ult Field 1 is very compact \u2014 roughly about the size of two cans of soda stacked on top of each other. This actually makes it very convenient to carry, since it will fit in the cup holder on the side of a backpack. The design of the speaker is very slick. Rubberized ends protect the speakers from drops and allow the speaker to stand either on end or laying down on a table. The controls and the USB-C cover are also rubber and contribute to the speaker's IP rating.\nThe rest of the speaker is covered by a woven fabric which is nice to look at and hold. The Field 1 is designed as a 360 speaker, meaning it sounds good regardless of orientation. A paracord tether serves as a handle or lanyard. It really is designed to go anywhere.\nEverything-proof\nAdam Doud/CNN Underscored\nSony designed this speaker to not only be waterproof and dustproof, but also rust-proof. That last one isn't a measurable standard, so I asked Sony specifically about that rust-proofing. Sony representatives said they wanted their customers to use the speaker around salt water, in the kitchen and other adverse environments like that. So Sony proactively added an extra layer of protection to help in that regard.\nSony tested various speaker components in saltwater over the course of multiple days. Normally salt water will not do kind things to components like metals; these stood up to Sony's tests, which were essentially a shorter version of a five-year test. Should you go scuba diving with the speaker? No. But the speaker should hold up for a boat trip or three.\nWhat we didn't like about it\nEmphasis on bass is questionable\nOf course the core of any speaker is how good it sounds, and this speaker sounds good \u2014 as long as Ult is turned on. Sony approached the Ult series of audio devices with the intention of pumping out hardcore bass in each of its products. With the Field 1, however, the capacity of bass is going to be limited by size constraints.\nTo that end, it almost feels like Sony isn't so much emphasizing bass when Ult is turned on, so much as it's holding back the lower frequencies when Ult is turned off. The effect is, you can turn Ult on and go 'Whoa! Listen to the bass that definitely wasn't there before you turned Ult on!' The fact of the matter is, the sound is good with Ult turned on, but it feels empty when it's not.\nDon't get me wrong \u2014 physics can only accomplish so much in this regard. But, it feels like Sony could be a bit more honest in its approach. Of course, the plus side is, if you prefer listening to spoken-word content, like podcasts, the ability to turn Ult off is a benefit since human voices tend to not respond well on those lower frequencies.\nUSB-C charging is a missed opportunity\nAdam Doud/CNN Underscored\nThe USB-C port that you use to charge the speaker is not bi-directional. You can only charge the speaker through the port. This feels like a miss because many portable speakers can also charge your phone. Portable speakers have fairly large and long-lasting batteries. Indeed, Sony advertises the speaker's battery life at 12 hours, which seems conservative compared to my testing. I didn't have to plug in the speaker all that much during my weeks of use.\nSo the fact that the battery in this device cannot also charge another device like a phone or tablet feels like a miss. Granted, drawing juice out to power up a phone may not seem like the most efficient use for a portable speaker, but I think it's best to let the consumer decide that, not the speaker maker.\nBottom line\nAdam Doud/CNN Underscored\nThis is a nice little speaker that is very portable and produces really solid sound, assuming Ult is turned on. It comes in four different colors \u2014 Black, White, Forest Gray and Orange, the latter of which I reviewed. The orange in particular is striking, and has more of an outdoorsy vibe than the black and white. I particularly like the adjustable paracord strap which makes the speaker really portable and gives you options for carrying and attaching the speaker if you need to.\nI also like the fact that the speaker is capable of 360-degree sound, and sounds just as good standing on end as it does laying down. I really appreciate that versatility, and it makes it feel like you can drop this speaker in the sand at the beach and it'll still sound good.\nAt $129, the speaker is very reasonably priced as well. On paper, it doesn't really measure up all that favorably to our pick for the best portable Bluetooth speaker \u2014 the UE Boom 3. That speaker costs $20 more, but it comes with neat features like light-shifting fabric and wireless charging while retaining all the features I enjoyed in the Ult Field 1.\nAlso, I would have liked to see Sony be a bit more honest about the bass emphasis. Heavy bass is supposed to be Ult's 'thing,' and in the other products that Sony debuted, including a stand-up party speaker and a larger portable speaker and a set of headphones, bass boost is very possible. But when it comes to something like a handheld portable speaker, size matters. A speaker the size of the Ult Field 1 will only produce so much bass before science steps in and takes over.\nBut at the end of the day, Sony gets there. Just turn on Ult mode and this speaker sounds as good as it should. But that means this particular entry into the Ult line (and its accompanying bass-first philosophy) just feels a little off.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Adam Doud","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/sony-ult-filed-1-cnnu-1.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNUnderscored","_score":3.3200707,"_id":"554d5e18b87f7654779f3b70ca514c55"},{"title":"5 things to know for April 16: Trump trial, Funding fight, Baltimore bridge, \u2018Rust' sentencing, Tesla","author":"Alexandra Banner","published_date":"2024-04-16 10:29:19","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/us/5-things-to-know-for-april-16-trump-trial-funding-fight-baltimore-bridge-rust-sentencing-tesla/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"CNN's 5 Things brings you the news you need to know every morning.CNN's 5 Things brings you the news you need to know every morning.","summary":"Due to budget constraints, NASA is rethinking its original plan to return rare samples from Mars to Earth.

Now, the space agency is soliciting proposals for a sample-return mission with less complexity, cost and risk.\nHere's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day .\nGet Up to Speed and On with Your Day. Former President Donald Trump is set to return to a New York City courtroom for a second day as jury selection continues in his criminal hush money trial. A total of 96 New Yorkers were brought in Monday as prospective jurors but 50 were immediately dismissed when they said they couldn't be fair and impartial. The swift dismissal of the prospective jury pool underscores the difficulty in finding a jury when the defendant is a former president who elicits strong feelings on both sides of the aisle. A panel of 12 people and six alternates will ultimately be selected for a trial that could last six to eight weeks. The case stems from state charges related to a hush money payment to an adult film star in 2016. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied all wrongdoing.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson announced Monday evening that the House will take up separate bills this week to provide aid for Israel and Ukraine, heeding demands from the far right to keep the issues separate as the threat of a vote to oust him from the speakership looms. In the wake of Iran's unprecedented retaliatory strikes on Israel, Democrats have called on Johnson to bring up a Senate-passed foreign aid package that includes aid to Israel and Ukraine, but hardline conservatives have urged the Louisiana Republican against attaching Ukraine funding to any Israel aid package. Johnson predicted the House will vote Friday evening on the separate bills. But Republican leaders could still take procedural steps to send all those pieces as one package to the Senate, which could enrage the right-wing of the House GOP conference.\nFederal authorities have launched a criminal investigation into last month's ship crash that destroyed Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge and killed six people, according to a US official familiar with the matter. The bridge collapsed on March 26 after a massive cargo ship lost power, veered off course and struck the bridge. The ship's owner and manager have since filed a court document in an attempt to limit their financial liability. The FBI and the US Coast Guard are leading the probe to determine whether the crew failed to report an earlier issue with the ship that delayed its departure, the official said. Also on Monday, authorities confirmed the body of a fourth victim had been recovered from the collapse. Officials have not released the victim's identity, at the request of his family.\nHannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer of the film 'Rust' was sentenced to 18 months in prison Monday, the maximum possible punishment. She was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter last month for the 2021 on-set fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The verdict comes more than two years after Hutchins, 42, was killed by a live round of ammunition fired from a prop gun held by actor Alec Baldwin. The film's director was also injured in the shooting. During the trial, prosecutors argued Gutierrez Reed, 26, repeatedly violated safety protocols and acted without caution in performing her duties, leading to Hutchins' death. Baldwin has also been charged with involuntary manslaughter and is expected to stand trial in July.\nTesla is set to cut more than 10% of its global staff of 140,000, CEO Elon Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees. Musk attributed the planned job cuts to the need for 'cost reductions and increasing productivity,' according to reports.

One morning, they were called to the scene of a death.\nSarath Wijesinghe, a 51-year-old civil defense force officer, had gone out to turn off the electric fence surrounding his village. The fences, intended to prevent elephants from raiding homes for food, are activated during the night and turned off during the day to allow farmers to come and go from the village.

'This is probably the saddest thing I saw,' Borella said of his time in Sri Lanka, much of which was spent photographing people who had survived encounters with elephants and efforts to mitigate attacks. In Wijesinghe's death, 'I saw the issue directly.'\nWijesinghe is just one of many who lost their lives to elephants last year. Elephants in Sri Lanka killed at least 169 people in 2023, according to the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society, a conservation organization in the country. In that same period, humans killed 476 elephants.\nThe deadly conflict is driven by human encroachment.

A lot of attacks on humans come from elephants breaking into homes in search of food, Borella said.

Using their massive size, elephants can collapse walls onto sleeping families, destroying entire homes to get at the food inside.\nThis is almost exactly what happened to W.M.

House Republicans released the text of three bills Wednesday that would provide aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, with the latter intended to protect US allies in the region from Chinese aggression. Despite opposition from hardline conservatives, House Speaker Mike Johnson advanced the foreign aid plan that, taken together, adds up to about $95 billion in aid. The House is expected to vote on the bills Saturday. Meanwhile, in the Senate, Democrats were quick to dismiss articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday as the historic trial barely got underway. House Republicans had voted to impeach Mayorkas in February over his handling of the southern border by a narrow margin.\nBoeing's battered reputation took another hit at two Senate committee hearings Wednesday, with witnesses questioning how the company builds its airplanes and the safety of those planes. A former Boeing engineer said he's been threatened for bringing safety concerns to his managers over several years, but that he was testifying due to his belief that 'they are putting out defective airplanes.' Boeing did not have any witnesses at the hearings Wednesday, but defended its company standards earlier this week, saying that the 787 fleet has safely transported more than 850 million passengers in the last 13 years of service.\nThe Republican-controlled Arizona House of Representatives once again failed to advance a repeal of the state's 160-year-old abortion ban. The vote on Wednesday came just days after Arizona lawmakers revived a controversial Civil War-era law that almost completely halts access to the procedure. The vote is a blow to reproductive rights as well as to GOP candidates in competitive races who have been scrambling to distance themselves from the court's decision.

A similar law that could put guns in the hands of teachers has been approved by lawmakers in Iowa, and presumably other states could choose to follow suit.\nIt's the latest proof that \u2014 a full year after the devastating mass shooting at The Covenant High School in Nashville that killed six people \u2014 our state's political leaders are no closer to providing meaningful, viable solutions to address our state's tragic gun violence problem.\nThe Covenant High School in Nashville that killed six people \u2014 our state's political leaders are no closer to providing meaningful, viable solutions to address our state's tragic gun violence problem. Guns are still the leading cause of death in children and teens in America, and Tennessee continues to be plagued by one of the highest rates of violence perpetrated with firearms in the country. The Republican supermajority that controls our state's General Assembly, tragically, have reneged on their responsibility to pass meaningful gun safety legislation.\nIf Republicans have failed to make inroads in combating senseless gun violence, it cannot be because they are unaware of the seriousness of the problem. The magnitude of our gun violence problem was made clear to residents of Tennessee and the entire nation last March after a shooter armed with a weapon of war carried out the massacre at The Covenant School. Among the dead were three children, 9-year-olds Hallie Scruggs, Evelyn Dieckhaus and William Kinney.\nHere's what Republican lawmakers could do instead of passing measures that would introduce even more guns into our public spaces, and now potentially our classrooms: They could listen to some of the parents who have been appalled at the idea that the adults to whom they have entrusted their children's care at school every day might be carrying loaded guns.\nOne such mom, Beth Gebhard, whose son attended The Covenant School told me after the shooting that quick action by her son's teacher might have saved his life that day, as well as the lives of all of the other children in the class. But it's not because the teacher confronted the shooter with a gun. Far from it.\n'My son was in a second-grade classroom close to where the children were slain. The children heard the intensely loud, repeated shots,' Beth told me.\n'I know the primary reason he's still alive is that his teacher \u2014 under extreme duress \u2014 was able to follow her training to lock the classroom door, pull down the shades, shepherd the children to the safe corner of the room and be there with them, helping them to follow her breathing and to stay silent so the Nashville police officers could do their work.'\nBeth knows that guns belong in the hands of trained professionals who are best equipped to meet the threat posed by a gunman. Putting firearms into the hands of classroom teachers and administrators every day is simply asking for more heartache and tragedy.\nHere's some more wisdom that Tennessee lawmakers could glean from parents: Immediately following The Covenant School massacre, grieving parents lined the streets and the entrance to the Tennessee State House, demanding common sense gun safety laws. Students walked out of schools across Nashville and Memphis making similar demands. We've seen a groundswell of similar protests in recent days, as parents and students raise their voices in opposition to the measure being considered in the House that could put guns in the hands of their teachers.\nRelated article Van Jones: Going home, I encountered a huge problem\nRelated article Van Jones: Going home, I encountered a huge problem Their sentiments are echoed across the country. A strong majority of Americans favor stricter gun safety laws in the US, according to a Gallup poll, and a similar majority of teachers believe arming them would make schools less safe, according to research by the Rand Corporation. In Tennessee, a wide majority \u2014 about three-quarters of registered voters \u2014 want red flag laws, according to polling last year from Vanderbilt University.\nThere is one more group that Tennessee lawmakers should consult with before passing a measure that could make our gun violence problem even worse: The members of the law enforcement community who are directly tasked with keeping schools safe.\nThe National Association of School Resource Officers (NASRO) also opposes arming teachers, and their research data aligns with the fears of teachers and school staff. Among other warnings, NASRO reports that a law enforcement officer could mistake an armed teacher for an assailant and that discharging weapons in a school is an 'extremely risky action' that could result in wounding or killing innocent children and staff.\nTheir data also indicate that an armed teacher is more likely to interfere with first responders' actions than to stop a school shooter. Besides all of the data indicating the dangers of arming teachers, the training outlined in the proposed bill is insufficient to prepare teachers to safely carry and operate a weapon in the event of a mass shooting.\nUnfortunately, rather than heeding wise counsel on the subject of reducing gun violence, our legislature has frequently resorted to reactive and even anti-democratic tactics.\nTennessee state Rep. Justin Jones, Rep. Gloria Johnson and I responded to the pleas of our constituents and the mourners outside and inside the State House last year, joining them in peaceful protest against a conservative majority that refused to listen.\nHowever, on that day and every day since, the majority party lawmakers appear to answer to a different constituency \u2014 the Tennessee Firearms Association and the National Rifle Association. And they responded to our efforts to represent the grieving people of Tennessee by expelling Jones and me \u2014 two Black men \u2014 from our duly elected offices.\nAlthough our municipal governments promptly reinstated us and our constituents voted us back into office, the supermajority in the Tennessee State House is still trying to silence us. Despite the retribution politics that dominate the Republican agenda, we refuse to be silent. We will not sit still and be quiet while our children and communities are ravaged by gun violence.\nArming teachers increases the likelihood of shootings in schools, increases the chance that students will have access to guns and erodes trust in educators. A teacher with a handgun is unable to stop a shooter with a military-style weapon, and teachers aren't able to respond in the ways trained law enforcement agents can. Adverse impacts \u2014 including fatal outcomes \u2014 will disproportionately fall on already marginalized populations such as disabled and Black students.\nAccording to the national teachers' union the American Federation of Teachers, more than three in four teachers oppose putting guns in the hands of educators and school staff, stating that schools would be more dangerous if staff were armed. Most parents, as well as students, oppose arming teachers.\n'Arming teachers is not the answer to school shootings \u2014 it's a dangerous next step in the gun lobby's \u2018guns everywhere' agenda. We need to vote these reckless politicians out and elect lawmakers who will fight for the common sense, research-backed gun safety laws that Tennesseans deserve,' says Angela Ferrell-Zabala, executive director of Moms Demand Action, the anti-gun violence group founded after another horrific school mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in December 2012.\nAs parents tell me time and again, guns in classrooms simply are not the answer. 'Can you imagine what would have happened if my son's teacher left the classroom with a handgun to confront the shooter with military-grade weapons?' Beth asked me. 'Not only would she have been killed, but she would have left terrified 8-year-olds alone \u2014 many likely crying and some following her \u2014 alerting the shooter to their presence. I have no doubt my son wouldn't have survived.'\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook This moment requires our highest reasoning and the best of our efforts.

But the bill that passed the Tennessee Senate last week and is under consideration in the House is a red herring that not only prevents us from dealing with the problem of gun safety and fear in schools, but also puts our kids and teachers in more danger.\nArming teachers does not create the school environment we want or need. Students deserve better. They deserve nurturing and care in a trusting and productive educational environment where they can thrive.\nWe need what a vast majority of Tennessee voters and voters nationwide want: common sense gun legislation.

But the surprisingly snappy pace of the process confounded initial expectations that putting on trial possibly the most famous man on Earth would be a laborious and prolonged process. While there were occasional moments of levity in the court and reminders that Trump's status make him a defendant like none other, conversations that members of the jury pool had with the judge and defense lawyers and prosecutors hinted at the gravity of what will unfold in the coming weeks. One potential juror, for instance, noted: 'This is real. This man's life is on the line, the country's on the line, this is serious.'\nAs Trump's hush money trial quickened on its second, compelling day \u2014 with seven jurors seated \u2014 Trump stepped up efforts to discredit the proceedings and the legal system itself. He bolstered the argument that is both his primary defense and his main campaign message \u2014 that he's a persecuted victim being prosecuted because he's on course to win back the White House in November. The former president's strategy encapsulates one of the most consequential challenges to the American courts system in modern memory \u2014 one that is likely to leave it tarnished in the eyes of tens of millions of his supporters whatever the jury decides. And it exemplifies the unprecedented circumstances of the first former president going on trial in the middle of an election campaign that is now running more through multiple court rooms than swing states.\nBut outside the courtroom, the former president raged, offering a skewed commentary on the good faith efforts inside.\nWhen the search for 12 jurors plus alternates paused for the day, Trump motorcaded to a bodega uptown, to highlight what he says is rising crime faced by the owners of small stores that are often open all night and especially serve immigrant communities. Trump was in his element, waving to a crowd that chanted 'Four more years' and 'We love Trump,' as he belted out quotes that dripped with falsehoods about foreign nations emptying their prisons and asylums to send a tide of migrants to American cities.\nIn a rowdy event in which he looked more like a mayoral candidate than a presumptive presidential nominee, he made two points. First that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg should be going after \u2018real' criminals and not him, and that his obligation to attend the trial was keeping him off the campaign trail, as his rival, President Joe Biden, sweeps this week through swing-state Pennsylvania.\n'It's Alvin Bragg's fault, he goes after people like Trump, who did nothing wrong,' the former president said standing under a sign for an ATM, in a scene the long-time master self-publicist seemed to be offering up for a front page in the New York Post. 'It makes me campaign locally and that's OK,' Trump said, wrapping up his spot of street politicking in the city that made his name and that will send forth 12 jurors with his legal destiny, and potentially even his liberty, in their hands.\nTrump is accused of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, an adult film star who alleged she had an affair with Trump before he became president. Bragg's theory of the case is that this alleged conduct resulted in Trump keeping vital information from voters ahead of the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies having a sexual relationship with Daniels. This is only one of four trials looming over Trump; the others focus on his attempts to overturn the 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents.\nThe current trial is not televised, meaning that Trump is deprived of a platform. But that restriction does allow him to mount a misleading daily commentary on what is taking place inside the courtroom that is likely to be the most that many viewers of conservative media learn about the case.\nIn line with the four-day-a-week schedule for the trial, proceedings will halt on Wednesday. Trump is expected to have dinner with Polish President Andrzej Duda, a nationalist who was one of the ex-president's favorite foreign leaders during his term. Criminal defendants don't generally take a break from their trials to sup with visiting presidents. The visit will be another reminder of the extraordinary circumstances of an election entangled with Trump's legal fate and may be seen as a highly symbolic endorsement by Duda of his friend during his hour of need.\nAs the trial reaches its first break, two things are already becoming clear.\nFirst, the conventions of the criminal trial \u2013 like those in thousands of courtrooms every day \u2013 mean this case will grind on relentlessly. There's little the former president can do to stop it, despite the pre-trial delaying tactics and complex litigation common to all his cases. This sense of order was reflected in the solid progress in seating jurors on Tuesday.\n'It is remarkable how normal it is in this situation,' Mimi Rocah, a former division chief at the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, told CNN's Erin Burnett. 'The criminal justice system, the jury system, is working the way it's supposed to work.'\nThe second major takeaway two days in is that Trump \u2013 who carved a public persona as a ruthless real estate shark, told victims 'You're fired' on 'The Apprentice,' sees himself as a strongman president and has his own Boeing that can take him where he wants, when he wants \u2013 must cede total control when court is in session. He can't act out and is being forced by a gag order not to attack witnesses or family members of officers of the court.\nWhen he was muttering in court on Tuesday, Merchan told the ex-president's lawyer, 'I will not have any jurors intimidated in the courtroom.' The incident was likely just a taste of clashes to come between Trump and the judge. In previous civil trials, Trump challenged the dignity of the rule of the court and feuded with other judges. The fact that his time is not his own is also highlighted by his complaints that he's unable to attend a US Supreme Court hearing arising from his federal election interference trial next week. And he's also complaining the judge won't let him attend his son Barron's high school graduation \u2013 even though Merchan is yet to rule on the issue.\nFor anyone wondering whether a former Republican president who alienates his opponents could get a free trial in New York, Tuesday's jury selection process might prove something of a relief. There is great debate among legal scholars and partisans on whether Bragg's case is a legal stretch and whether Trump is guilty of the alleged conduct. But potential jurors appeared to take their obligation deeply seriously. It was notable that a large group admitted that they couldn't honestly say they could judge Trump fairly \u2013 testimony to the extreme reactions that the former president evokes.\n'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I thought I could be,' said one man who was excused.\nBut other potential jurors said they'd be able to put any political feelings about Trump to one side and focus on the evidence and the law. 'I feel that politically, we have big disagreements, your client and myself,' one person said. 'There are certain things he's said that I don't care for. But lots of people say things I don't care for.' She added: 'But when I'm coming here, that can't count, that has to go away.'\nIn a sign of the times, the judge and lawyers spent hours combing through social media postings of potential jurors and family members, seeking evidence of bias. And in another revealing trend that hinted at the ex-president's political appeal, some potential jurors mentioned that they viewed his rhetorical eruptions as those of someone who speaks his mind, unlike conventional politicians.\nWhen one potential juror asked Merchan if attendance at her sister's wedding in September could be a reason not to serve, the judge sparked laughter in court by replying: 'If we were still here in September that would be a big problem.'\nJury consultant Robert Hirschhorn told CNN's Burnett that Trump should be happy with the process so far. 'It's a mixed group, that's exactly what you want.' He added: 'The former president caught himself some pretty good jurors today.'\nTrump has asked the Supreme Court to agree with his expansive claim of presidential immunity in a bid to derail his trials. But so far, his hush money trial suggests that despite the former president's undiluted craving for power, every American remains equal under the law.\nCourtroom artist Christine Cornell has sketched some of the most notorious defendants in modern history, including crime family boss John Gotti and financier Bernie Madoff, and has been drawing Trump for years. She conjured up Trump's new reality best when she told CNN Tuesday: 'It's just another human being.

Surging tensions at Columbia University have sparked condemnation from the White House as pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus stretch into their fifth day. 'In recent days, we've seen harassment and calls for violence against Jews. This blatant antisemitism is reprehensible and dangerous \u2014 and it has absolutely no place on college campuses, or anywhere in our country,' President Joe Biden said Sunday. A rabbi linked to the Ivy League school has recommended that Jewish students 'return home as soon as possible and remain home' amid the demonstrations. The atmosphere is so charged that school officials said students can attend classes virtually starting today \u2014 the first day of Passover, a major Jewish holiday.\nOpening statements are expected to begin today in former President Donald Trump's New York hush money criminal trial. A full 12-person jury and six alternate jurors were selected last week and could determine whether Trump is a convicted felon by Election Day. The trial is expected to feature several high-profile witnesses, including those who were in Trump's inner circle around the 2016 election, sources have told CNN. One central player is David Pecker, the former chairman of the National Enquirer's parent company, who was involved in numerous 'catch-and-kill' schemes involving the former president. Court filings show Pecker helped to orchestrate the alleged scheme to pay hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels to cover up her alleged affair with Trump ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\nFormer President Donald Trump's first criminal trial starts Monday\n03:03 - Source: CNN\n03:03 - Source: CNN The House passed a $95 billion package over the weekend providing foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific region. Some moderate Republicans commended Speaker Mike Johnson after he joined with Democrats to advance the measure to Saturday's vote, while others in the conservative flank voiced strong opposition. Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Sunday said Speaker Johnson 'betrayed' Republican voters and threatened to call a vote for his ouster if he doesn't resign. The legislation \u2014 which passed with the support of 210 Democrats and 101 Republicans \u2014 now heads to the Senate, which is expected to give final approval this week.\nThe high-stakes foreign aid package approved by the House on Saturday included a measure that could lead to a TikTok ban. By attaching the TikTok bill to funding for Ukrainian military equipment and Israeli missile defense, House Republicans put pressure on Senate lawmakers to consider the whole package in a single up-or-down vote. The current version of the bill would, if signed, give TikTok roughly nine months to separate from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, following national security concerns. The bill also states the deadline could be extended by President Biden by 90 days if he determines there's been progress toward a sale. Policy analysts expect the Senate to take up the aid package quickly, giving it high odds of passage.\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments today on whether ticketing homeless people is 'cruel and unusual' and violates the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. City and state officials are closely watching the case \u2014 which will decide whether the homeless have the right to camp in public places \u2014 as many communities struggle to respond to a surge in encampments that have cropped up under bridges and in city parks across the nation. It's also being followed by people who live in those encampments and are alarmed by efforts to criminalize the population rather than build shelters and affordable housing. This comes as the number of people experiencing homelessness increased by 12% from 2022 to 2023, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nGiving a hoot on Earth Day: How to protect owls in your own backyard\nIt can be tough to survive in a world altered by humans.

At the time, under Australia's policy of offshore detention, asylum seekers were sent to Nauru and Papua New Guinea, where they were held while their claims were processed. They were told they would never settle in Australia. Boochani was eventually able to escape after being flown to New Zealand for a literary festival to speak about an award-winning book he wrote during his time in detention; he was granted refugee status there.\nSuccessive Australian governments have defended their policy as necessary to deter traffickers who exploit desperate asylum seekers with promises of freedom for the cost of a boat trip. They claim it saves lives that otherwise might be lost at sea.\nMostafa Azimitabar \u2013 a human rights activist and Kurd -\u2013 fled Iran in 2013 and was also sent to PNG's Manus Island, where he spent six-and-a-half years. He was later medically evacuated to the Australian city of Melbourne, where he remained in detention in a hotel for another 18 months.\n'It was the most horrible place in the world. Everything was terrible. Unhygienic. Not safe at all inside a tiny island and around us, hundreds of officers, fences, chains, handcuffs,' Azimitabar said.\nNow free, these survivors of Australia's offshore processing system fear their experience could be replicated for refugees and asylum seekers trying to reach the United Kingdom, as its government seeks to push through a controversial policy to send some asylum seekers and refugees to be processed in Rwanda.\nThe UK's Safety of Rwanda Bill is due to be voted on again by lawmakers in the House of Commons on Monday before going back to the House of Lords, which has sought to make certain changes to safeguard asylum seekers' rights.\n'What I see right now is happening for refugees in England is exactly what happened to me,' Azimitabar told CNN.\n'It's heart-breaking how they are going to pass the law and exile a lot of innocent people who escaped from war and persecution,' he said.\nDespite criticism from human rights bodies, Australia has not stopped its offshore processing policy. Although the Manus Island detention center closed in October 2017, the center on Nauru remains operational. Data from Australia's Department of Home Affairs shows that as of 31 March 2024, 54 people are in immigration detention on the island.\nThe policy enjoys bipartisan political support in Australia, with both the coalition and Labor governments backing offshore detention. Refugee and asylum seeker issues ranked last in a list of important issues in the 2022 federal election, according to a post-vote survey cited by the Refugee Council of Australia.\nPitching the Conservative government's bill to the British public in 2023, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared his government would 'stop the boats' \u2013 meaning it would deter people from crossing the English Channel illegally in small boats, largely run by criminal trafficking gangs, and claiming asylum once in Britain.\nThe three-word slogan was the same one touted during Australia's 2013 election campaign by Tony Abbott, ultimately credited with helping him win the battle to be prime minister.\nAnd on face value, the UK's proposed offshore detention policy follows a similar model to that of Australia.\nUnder the Rwanda bill, migrants who arrive in the UK by irregular means can be sent to the east African nation, where they will remain while their asylum claims are processed. If they are successful, they will be given refugee status in Rwanda. If they are unsuccessful, they will be able to apply for leave to stay in Rwanda on other grounds or seek asylum in a 'safe country' elsewhere.\nThe UK plan was first announced in April 2022, but has suffered numerous legal and legislative setbacks; to date, no asylum seeker has been sent from Britain to Rwanda. Australia's own offshore detention policy has been heavily criticized and fraught with controversy \u2013 but still seems to exert considerable appeal for some UK politicians.\nAlexander Downer, a former Australian foreign minister who has publicly advocated for offshore processing centers, was asked by the British government to review the UK Border Force in 2022 and subsequently appointed to a panel set up to oversee the UK's plan to send migrants to Rwanda. Downer served as foreign minister in Australia during its first iteration of the 'Pacific Solution,' when the government started deporting refugees to islands.\nBut emulating Australia's 'Stop the Boats' policy will not be as easy as copying the three-word slogan, policy experts warn.\nTamara Tubakovic, a lecturer in public policy at the University of Melbourne, told CNN that an increased Australian naval presence, and better regional cooperation with neighbouring countries, appeared to have stopped people from reaching the nation's shores, with the actual deterrent effect of the offshore policy less clear. The UK, she said, lacks the same regional support.\n'It's not necessarily the actual offshore system that was the key mechanism that worked in this case, but rather having that presence and having partners and interlocutors in Indonesia that were able to assist the Australian government to prevent people from arriving,' she said.\nAnother difference is one of scale. In 2001, before Australia implemented offshore processing, 5,516 refugees reached Australia's shores by boat.\nComparatively, the UK government says 44,460 people were detected arriving by small boats between June 2022 and June 2023 alone, representing 85% of irregular arrivals. In 2018, the number of people detected crossing the English Channel in small boats was only 299, according to Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, but since 2020 the number has climbed sharply.\nThe UK government insists its Rwanda plan is aimed at disrupting people-smuggling networks and deterring migrants from making the dangerous sea journey across the busy Channel from France.\nAnother difference between two nations stems from the fact Australia does not have a human rights charter, Tubakovic said. She notes that the UK is still bound by human rights obligations, particularly as a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights.\nIn June 2022, a last-minute injunction from the European Court of Human Rights stopped a plane carrying asylum seekers and refugees from taking off for Rwanda due to potential breaches of human rights.\nIn November 2023, the UK Supreme Court found that the policy of removing individuals who enter the UK without authorization to Rwanda was unlawful, finding that it was not a safe destination and people who are removed from the UK 'might be sent on to face persecution or human rights abuses in another country.'\nAll these factors come before considering the human impact of forced relocation on people already fleeing persecution.\nAustralia has faced strong international criticism over its offshore processing policy.\nBetween 2013 and 2017, refugees held in its offshore centers reported violence, abuse and a lack of access to medical care. In 2015, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture found Australia violated the rights of asylum seekers \u2013 including children \u2013 to be free from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment due to the conditions they were exposed to.\nA UN rights expert said in 2016 that the abuses uncovered in Australia's offshore detention centers had damaged the country's reputation on human rights. The UK government has been warned it could face the same fate if the bill is passed.\nA parliamentary joint committee on human rights found 'the Bill would effectively grant public authorities statutory permission to act in a manner that is incompatible with human rights standards.'\n'The best thing for me to say is that Rwandans are actually seen as refugees in a lot of countries. They're deemed as having refugee status because of the human rights abuses in their country. So, you're essentially sending people to a country whose own people are refugees in other countries,' Tubakovic says.\nFor their part, both Boochani and Azimitabar have a clear message for the UK \u2013 learn from Australia's mistakes.\n'I was tortured for eight years. Mentally and physically\u2026 Of course, they (the UK government) don't care. They are following the same politicians that hurt me. But my message to people in England is please read the story of what happened to refugees in Manus and Nauru,' Azimitabar said.\nFor Boochani, 'many people should be aware of it. What's happened there and how they established that system. I think the biggest thing about Manus and Nauru that people always forget is banishment itself \u2013 when you feel as a person, as a human being \u2013 when you feel that you are banished \u2013 I think that is a huge and deep violence itself.\n'This policy really damaged people,' he said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Antoinette Radford,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1830150791.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":3.0415964,"_id":"7a698c519e9acb32b83b866938e33fbb"},{"title":"A lawmaker proposed a bill that would ban DEI in medical schools.

'Black moms, Indigenous moms and their babies have better outcomes when they have someone on their medical team that looks like them or shares their race or ethnicity,' Blake said. 'This is really a detrimental bill to the medical system trying to have a workforce that reflects the patient population.'\nPleasant, meanwhile, said she is concerned that removing DEI from medical schools will mean doctors aren't prepared to fully assess and treat patients of all racial and gender identities.\n'We are doing our medical students an incredible disservice by eliminating DEI in the curriculum,' Pleasant said. If the bill is passed, 'our future health care workforce will not have adequate tools to combat racism and bias in medicine.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Nicquel Terry Ellis","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1334856826.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":2.9792776,"_id":"26b40e3c525ea61942c4df516ee521c9"},{"title":"Analysis: Trump's first criminal trial is a historic and solemn moment for America","author":"Stephen Collinson","published_date":"2024-04-15 04:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/14/politics/trump-first-criminal-trial-analysis","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The United States will cross a historic threshold on Monday when for the first time a former president goes on criminal trial in a case laced with fateful significance because Donald Trump could be\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 The United States will cross a historic threshold on Monday when for the first time a former president goes on criminal trial in a case laced with fateful significance because Donald Trump could be back in the Oval Office next year.\nWhen the presumptive GOP nominee walks into court for the start of jury selection, he and the country will enter a new state of reality as legal and political worlds collide in a trial almost guaranteed to deepen Americans' bitter ideological estrangement.\nThe trial, related to hush money payments to an adult film actress before the 2016 election, will mark yet another extraordinary twist in the story of Trump, whose incessant testing of the limits of presidential decorum and the law has caused nearly nine years of political tumult and may still have years left to run. It raises the possibility that, depending on the jury's verdict, the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election could be a convicted felon. And given the case's subject matter \u2014 details about a payment to a woman who alleged that she had a sexual relationship with Trump, which he denies \u2014 it could reflect poorly on Trump's character and ethics as voters weigh their decisions in November.\nHush money payments are not illegal. Trump is accused of falsifying business records to keep unflattering information that could have hurt his campaign from the voters in an alleged early example of election interference. The fact that this case stems from alleged personal conduct means that it could have a lesser political impact than Trump's three other looming trials, which are rooted in greater constitutional and legal concerns pertinent to the powers of the presidency.\nThe fact that this case stems from alleged personal conduct means that it could have a lesser political impact than Trump's three other looming trials, which are rooted in greater constitutional and legal concerns pertinent to the powers of the presidency. But the success of the ex-president's legal delaying tactics in the other cases \u2014 related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election and hoarding of classified documents \u2014 means the hush money trial may be the only one to take place before the election. And Trump \u2014 though he is entitled to the presumption of innocence and the airing of evidence like any other defendant \u2014 is showing signs of increasing agitation at the prospect of the trial and the indignity it represents for someone who used to be the most powerful man in the world.\nStill, if he had to choose only one of the quartet of cases to reach a conclusion before the election, it would be this one.\nRelated article Your questions about Trump's trial, answered\nRelated article Your questions about Trump's trial, answered The United States, unlike democracies that have been historically less stable, is not a nation accustomed to seeing its former heads of state on trial. While the circumstances of this case and Trump's broader legal troubles are unique, this new precedent does open the possibility that it will be less of a leap for future presidents to be pursued by legal investigations. Indeed, Trump has already warned that if he wins in November, he will dedicate his second presidency to 'retribution' and will use the powers of the presidency to go after his foes, including the Biden family.\nNone of this is remotely normal. But it is all part of the extreme political, legal and constitutional challenges that Trump constantly poses to US institutions and that he is signaling would intensify if he wins a second term. The incessant cacophony stirred by his volcanic personality is by design \u2014 it makes it hard for Americans to process each distinct Rubicon that is crossed.\nThe former president has made fervent attempts to delegitimize the case, the judge and the legal system itself \u2014 partly to hedge against any future guilty verdicts. He has blasted Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat who is leading the prosecution, as politically biased. And Judge Juan Merchan expanded a gag order after Trump named his daughter, who has done work for Democrats, on social media.\nWhile the trial will not be televised, it is bound to be a national spectacle over the period of six weeks to two months that it is expected to last. In his previous civil trials, including a massive fraud case that went against him, Trump has used court breaks to stage free rolling and often angry televised news conferences, seeking to attack the probity of the court and to air issues in the case. He has often been an obstreperous defendant, infringing the behavioral codes of the courtroom and infuriating judges. At one point during the civil fraud trial, Judge Arthur Engoron admonished Trump for turning the courtroom into the campaign trail, and asked his attorney, 'Can you control your client?'\nFor all of Trump's claims of unfair treatment by the legal system, many other defendants would likely have faced far harsher treatment for their attacks on trials, prosecutors and court officers.\nWhile the Manhattan trial is in session four days a week, the ex-president will be required to attend \u2014 at a time when President Joe Biden will be free to blitz swing states. This is one reason why Trump's 2024 campaign is running as much through the courtrooms as according to the traditional rhythms of a White House bid.\nThe moment Trump shows up in the courtroom on Monday will be one of unfathomable drama and a test for members of the pool of citizens who will be vetted for service on a jury like none other in American history. 'He's the most famous person in the world. And when you've come face-to-face with somebody that's got that kind of charisma, that kind of power, it tends to be intimidating, it tends to be shocking, it tends to be exciting,' Robert Hirschhorn, a jury and trial consultant, said on CNN on Friday.\nThe task of finding jurors who lack strong opinions and prejudices against a defendant and the legal system , who can serve for a prolonged period and will make judgements solely based on the law and the evidence, is complex in any case. Because the accused is Trump, legal experts are predicting that jury selection could take as long as a week or more, which must conclude before prosecutors lay out their opening arguments against the former president.\n, who can serve for a prolonged period and will make judgements solely based on the law and the evidence, is complex in any case. Because the accused is Trump, legal experts are predicting that jury selection could take as long as a week or more, which must conclude before prosecutors lay out their opening arguments against the former president. But as he contemplates the beginning of his trial, Trump appears to be gleaning an understanding that his fate is now out of his hands and will be soon in those of 12 anonymous citizens whom he will not be allowed to bully, persuade or politicize. 'Jury selection is largely luck. It depends who you get. It's very unfair that I'm having a trial there,' Trump said on Friday, alluding to New York City's liberal lean.\nTrump is already seeking to turn the trial into a circus to further his merged legal defense and chief campaign argument that he's being persecuted by 'deranged prosecutors' trying to bar his return to the Oval Office. He branded himself as a 'proud political dissident' at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February and has compared himself to South African anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela and dead Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. On Saturday night in the swing state of Pennsylvania, Trump promised, 'I will be fighting for the freedom of 325 million Americans,' as he embarked on an unprecedented shuttle between a criminal trial and the campaign trail. On Sunday, he used his Truth Social network to blast 'a blatant and unprecedented attack' against his campaign and claimed that Biden coordinated with Bragg. There is no evidence that this is true.\nTrump's arguments are convincing to many Republican voters who embraced his narrative of persecution and made him their nominee in quick time this year. But will he be able to convince undecided general election voters that he's a victim, or will his first trial thicken a cloud of criminality that could doom his White House hopes and improve Biden's chances of landing a second term? Some polls have shown that a minority of Republican voters might have pause about voting for the ex-president if he is found guilty after a trial. But the circumstances are so unusual that it is impossible to predict how the politics of a conviction or an acquittal could play out.\nPolitical uncertainty over the case is being exacerbated by the charged backdrop. There is no clear leader in national polling in the race between Biden and Trump, which is likely to be decided by thousands of votes in a handful of battleground states. The president's prospects are being challenged by high interest rates and elevated prices that are causing pain for millions of Americans. Biden spent the weekend presiding over a successful defense of Israel after Iran sent hundreds of missiles and drones toward the Jewish state as fears of a wider Middle East war spiked. The deteriorating situation could bolster Trump's claims the world is spinning out of control under his successor's watch. That means that this and any future Trump trials \u2014 while a never-before-seen interruption to a presidential election campaign \u2014 may be only one factor that decides the destiny of the White House in November.\nTrump is charged in Manhattan with falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in what prosecutors said was an attempt to interfere in the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and has denied having an affair with Daniels.\n'Manhattan is home to the country's most significant business market. We cannot allow New York businesses to manipulate their records to cover up criminal conduct,' Bragg wrote as he unveiled the indictment \u2014 Trump's first \u2014 in April 2023. 'The trail of money and lies exposes a pattern that, the People allege, violates one of New York's basic and fundamental business laws.'\nTrump's supporters claim that he's a victim of selective and politicized justice because he is being prosecuted over what they contend is a novel legal theory in a case stemming from personal embarrassments and campaign finance infringements. But Bragg's framing of the case identifies a common theme with Trump's other indictments: Is a president accountable to the same laws as every other citizen, or he is above the law?\n'This payment was made to deprive voters of essential information, which in turn was covered up with the intent to affect an election. \u2026 That's the allegation \u2013 deceiving voters to grasp power,' said Norm Eisen, a CNN legal analyst and author of the new book 'Trying Trump: A Guide to His First Election Interference Criminal Trial. '\n' Eisen added: ' Now , Alvin Bragg might not prove it \u2014 but that is why this is an alleged election interference case.'\n' Now , Alvin Bragg might not prove it \u2014 but that is why this is an alleged election interference case.' Trump's attorneys have argued that this trial should be delayed until the Supreme Court rules on his sweeping claims of presidential immunity arising from the federal election interference case brought by special counsel Jack Smith. While the initial conduct at issue in this case took place before Trump was president, prosecutors argue that he signed off on the alleged cover-up to reimburse his lawyer Michael Cohen for phony legal services while president.\nAs part of a desperate flurry of filings designed to postpone accountability in the hush money case, the former president has also been claiming that he cannot get a fair trial in New York \u2014 the city where he made his name but that has overwhelmingly voted against him. Merchan has declined efforts by the president's attorneys to get the trial relocated to a jurisdiction where voters may be more favorable to Trump.\nThe former president is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. If convicted, he could face probation or a maximum sentence of 1 1/3 to 4 years on each count in state prison. Many legal experts believe that, as a first offender, Trump would not face jail time, or that if he did, any custodial sentences would run concurrently.\nTrump's attorneys have not tipped their hand over possible defenses. But it's almost certain they will attack the credibility and personal testimony of both Cohen and Daniels. Cohen will face criticism for being an unreliable witness after spending time in prison after being convicted of tax offenses, of lying to Congress and other offenses.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Stephen Collinson","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap24095480999035.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":2.8526773,"_id":"043f15ef41c735d3e099140e61125dce"},{"title":"Start your week smart: Foreign aid package, surveillance bill, Memphis shooting, VW union vote, USC graduation drama","author":"Andrew Torgan","published_date":"2024-04-21 13:01:11","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/21/us/5-things-april-21-trnd","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"CNN's 5 Things brings you all the news you need to start your week smart.","summary":"The pandas are coming!

Israel had carried out a strike on Iran hours earlier, a US official told CNN. The Israeli military has not commented and Iran has not identified the source of the attack. Air defenses intercepted three drones, an Iranian official said. And air defenses caused blasts near an army base in Isfahan province, according to Iranian media. Iranian media showed residents walking near Isfahan landmarks such as the Naqsh-e Jahan square and along the Zayandeh Rud river, while normal traffic was reported in the city, according to semi-official news outlet ISNA.

Israel targeted Syria's \"air defense sites in the southern region. The aggression led to material losses,\" SANA reported.

Since a suspected Israeli attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria earlier this month, people in Iran have mostly stood behind their government's airstrikes against Israel on Saturday, he said. It is \"a matter of national pride\" for many Iranians. \"Whether they are reformist or conservatives, critical or supportive of the government, because it's an issue of security they have been mostly supportive of Iran's action against Israel,\" Aslani said. 4 hr 44 min ago From CNN's Adam Pourahmadi and Irene Nasser There has been no damage to Iran's nuclear sites after an aerial attack in Isfahan province on Friday, the United Nations nuclear watchdog said, as it called for restraint in the region. The International Atomic Energy Agency said its chief, Rafael Grossi, \"continues to call for extreme restraint from everybody and reiterates that nuclear facilities should never be a target in military conflicts.\" \"IAEA can confirm that there is no damage to Iran's nuclear sites ... [and] is monitoring the situation very closely,\" it said. Earlier, an Iranian official said air defenses intercepted three drones. Multiple Iranian state-aligned news agencies reported that sites associated with the country's nuclear program were 'completely secure' and the attack appeared to be limited in scope. Some context: A US official told CNN that Israel carried out a strike inside Iran. The target was not nuclear, the official added.

IRGC Israel has carried out a strike inside Iran, a US official told CNN on Friday, in a move that threatens to further escalate conflict in the Middle East. Iran's air defense systems were activated in several locations after explosions were heard close to the airport and an army base in the province of Isfahan, state media reported early Friday morning. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attack. Here's what we know: What Iranian reports say: Three blasts were heard near a military base where fighter jets are located in northwest Isfahan, Iran's semi-official FARS news agency reported. Following the strike, Iranian media reported that all facilities around Isfahan are secure, including significant nuclear facilities in the area.

Israel carried out Friday's attack, a US official told CNN. The Israeli military has not commented, and Iran has not identified the source of the attack. A \"diplomatic effort\" from EU and G7 members is already underway to quell tensions in the region after the strike, Tajani told reporters on the sidelines of a G7 foreign ministers summit in Italy. 'We call on everyone to be prudent to avoid an escalation in the area,' he said, reiterating Italy's call for a ceasefire in Gaza.

He added: 'If the Israeli regime commits the grave error once again our response will be decisive, definitive and regretful for them.' 1 hr 32 min ago From CNN's Elizabeth Wolfe\nThe attack on Iran early Friday was likely intended as both a retaliatory measure and a cautionary message, a retired US Army Major General told CNN's Michael Holmes.\nFor days, Israel has been weighing its response to unprecedented weekend strikes from Iran, which were launched in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on its embassy compound in Syria earlier this month.\nA US official told CNN that Friday's attack was an Israeli strike. Israel has declined to comment on it.\n'Israel must maintain its vigilance' in case Iran decides to respond with another show of force, retired Major General Mark MacCarley said.\nBy targeting the Iranian province of Isfahan \u2014 the site of significant nuclear facilities \u2014Israel was likely warning that it could easily overwhelm Iran's defenses, MacCarley said.\n'I think that there was a very deliberate thought process on the part of the Israeli war cabinet,\" he said.\n\"Israelis had to retaliate, but at the same time, within that retaliation was a message, and that is, 'Yes, we can get through.

But this time, senators will provide as jurors in the least legitimate, least substantive and most politicized impeachment trial ever in the history of the United States,\" he said. Schumer went on to say that the charges brought against Mayorkas failed to meet standard of high crimes and misdemeanors. \"To validate this gross abuse by the House would be a grave mistake and could set a dangerous precedent for the future. For the sake of the Senate's integrity, and to protect impeachment for those rare cases we truly need it, senators should dismiss today's charges,\" he said. Before this speech, Schumer had not publicly said they would vote to dismiss the case, only saying they would deal with it \"expeditiously.\" Although a quick dismissal has been anticipated for weeks. In response, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said it would be a mistake for Senators not to carry out their constitutional duties and have a full trial. 14 min ago From CNN's Manu Raju and Haley Talbot Rep.

CNN's Lauren Fox contributed reporting to this post. 1 hr 46 min ago From CNN's Annie Grayer, Clare Foran and Kristin Wilson The House of Representatives, by an extremely narrow margin, voted on February 13 to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in almost 150 years. The result came one week after the stunning loss House Republicans suffered when they last tried to impeach Mayorkas and GOP defections and an absence sank the initial floor vote, a move Republicans had hoped to use to spotlight the Biden administration's handling of the southern border. The impeachment also came as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold President Joe Biden and his departments and agencies accountable over immigration and border security policies. House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar. Only one Cabinet official has previously been impeached in American history: Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876. The House impeachment vote was 214 to 213. Three Republicans \u2013 Ken Buck of Colorado, Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, and Tom McClintock of California \u2013 voted with Democrats against the measure. The Department of Homeland Security said that House Republicans 'will be remembered by history for trampling on the Constitution' following the vote to impeach.

J. Scott Applewhite/AP After facing significant pressure from GOP hardliners, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced this morning that he is sticking with his plan to put a series of foreign aid bills on the floor, including funding for Ukraine. The Republican from Louisiana said they will vote on these bills Saturday evening. Johnson also said he will bring forward an immigration bill. A number of far-right House Republicans were quick to shoot down the immigration legislation, dispelling any hope that the border provisions would placate Johnson's right flank. Here is the note Johnson sent to members moments ago: 'After significant Member feedback and discussion, the House Rules Committee will be posting soon today the text of three bills that will fund America's national security interests and allies in Israel, the Indo-Pacific, and Ukraine, including a loan structure for aid, and enhanced strategy and accountability.\nThese will be brought to the floor under a structured rule that will allow for an amendment process, alongside a fourth bill that includes the REPO Act, TikTok bill, sanctions and other measures to confront Russia, China, and Iran.\nThe Rules Committee will also be posting text on a border security bill that includes the core components of H.R.2, under a separate rule that will allow for amendments.\nText of the first three bills will be posted shortly, while the fourth bill under the same rule will be posted later today. The border security bill will also be posted later today.\nBy posting text of these bills as soon as they are completed, we will ensure time for a robust amendment process. We expect the vote on final passage on these bills to be on Saturday evening.\nThank you all for your feedback and support. I value every Member of this conference and look forward to continuing our work together.'

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell that senators have a unique responsibility to consider the impeachment articles and said he would oppose any effort to table the articles. \"As befits such a solemn and rare responsibility as convening a court of impeachment, I intend to give these charges my full and undivided attention,' he said Tuesday. The Kentucky Republican added: 'It would be beneath the Senate's dignity to shrug off our clear responsibility and fail to give the charges we'll hear today the thorough consideration they deserve. I will strenuously oppose any effort to table the articles of impeachment and avoid looking the Biden administration's border crisis squarely in the face.' Additionally, some hard-right Republican senators are trying to find a way to force a full trial, but their efforts are not expected to get enough traction to pass, according to senators and aides from both parties. CNN's Manu Raju contributed to this report. 1 hr 58 min ago From CNN's Priscilla Alvarez White House and Homeland Security officials have been in frequent communication over the course of the impeachment inquiry into Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. They are gaming out a strategy and response as they publicly cast the trial as a political stunt. Mayorkas emerged as a top target of Republicans over the Biden administration's border policies early on. Since Republicans launched their effort to oust the Homeland Security secretary, Biden administration officials have maintained that Mayorkas planned to stay in the post, dismissing the GOP impeachment inquiry into the DHS chief as 'meritless.' Instead, White House and Homeland Security officials deployed a split-screen strategy, including casting the House majority's proceedings as a waste of time while Mayorkas worked with senators to strike a border deal. \"This effort is a complete waste of time that constitutional and legal experts have said is \u2018unconstitutional' and that even Senate Republicans have made clear they don't want to focus on,\" Ian Sams, the spokesperson of the White House counsel's office, wrote in a memo in relation to the Mayorkas impeachment proceedings. What Mayorkas is doing today: As senators plot their next steps Wednesday, Mayorkas will be in New York City for a nationwide awareness campaign to combat online child exploitation and abuse. Mayorkas has maintained that his focus is on the department's work, including pointing to recent testimony on the Hill to shore up additional funds for DHS. 1 hr 39 min ago From CNN's Clare Foran, Ted Barrett, Annie Grayer and Morgan Rimmer House Republican impeachment managers walk to the Senate as they deliver the articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on Tuesday, April 16. J. Scott Applewhite/AP Republicans targeted Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas as soon as they took control of the House, blaming the high number of border crossings on the official as the party faced pressure from its base to go after the Biden administration on a key campaign issue. Multiple constitutional experts, however, have said the evidence Republicans have put forward for impeachment does not reach the high bar of high crimes and misdemeanors set by the US Constitution. Mayorkas has pushed back against criticism of his leadership, and the Department of Homeland Security has called the impeachment effort against him a baseless political attack. The White House, for its part, has worked to flip the script, citing Republicans blocking a bipartisan border deal in the Senate as evidence that the party isn't serious about border security. After months of negotiations, Senate Republicans blocked a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year that would have marked a tough change to immigration law and would have given the president far-reaching powers to restrict illegal migrant crossings at the southern border. The deal faced a torrent of attacks from former President Donald Trump and top House Republicans.

'As they work on impeachment, I work in advancing the mission of the Department of Homeland Security \u2013 that's what I've done throughout this process,' Mayorkas said on 'CBS Mornings.' 'We need Congress to pass the bipartisan legislation that a group of Senators worked on. That is the enduring solution.' 'We cannot resource ourselves \u2013 we need Congress to do so,' Mayorkas continued on Wednesday. 'We cannot change a broken immigration system, only Congress can do so.' Senate Republicans derailed a bipartisan border deal crafted in part by their colleague, Sen. James Lankford, in February, that would have expanded the powers of the federal government to address the influx of migrants entering the country. The White House has considered executive action to enact tougher border policies reminiscent of the toppled Senate legislation. Pushed by CBS's Tony Dokoupil on whether President Joe Biden would issue an executive order to taper the growing crisis at the southern border, Mayorkas affirmed, 'We explore options every single day \u2013 that's the responsibility of good government.'\nSenate showdown: Senators are expected to be sworn in as jurors Wednesday afternoon in the impeachment trial against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

After two months of inaction\u2026","summary":"Editor's Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\nCNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 'We are most deeply asleep at the switch,' wrote Annie Dillard, 'when we fancy we control any switches at all. We sleep to time's hurdy-gurdy; we wake, if we ever wake, to the silence of God.'\nDillard's line \u2014 from her short meditative book titled 'Holy the Firm,' published in 1977, two years after she won the Pulitzer Prize at the age of 29 \u2014 invoked the role of the switchman, whose alertness was crucial in making sure trains got routed on the right track before the advent of automated switches.\nIf America's political leaders control any switches at all, some have been asleep at the switch for a while. When the Senate voted to send new aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan two months ago, House Speaker Mike Johnson took no action. The House leadership also refused to act on a bipartisan bill to address the surge of migrants across the southern border.\nIn both cases, Republicans in Congress were partly heeding the wishes of former President Donald Trump, who opposed more aid for Ukraine and wanted to prevent President Joe Biden from scoring any more legislative victories.\nThat was weeks before Trump went on trial in a Manhattan courtroom, where the man who labeled Biden 'Sleepy Joe' appeared to doze off several times Monday and Tuesday while the court started the process of selecting jurors.\nAnd it was also well before Iran directly attacked Israel for the first time. Israel responded, and while those strikes appeared to cause only limited damage, it showed the potential for wars to spiral out of control and made it even less politically tenable for the House leadership to be seen stalling on military aid measures.\nWhen a defendant nods off, it doesn't stop a trial from going forward. When a nation naps in the middle of international crises, the consequences can be profoundly scary.\nLast week, Johnson finally acted, making clear he supports the foreign aid package, though he broke it up into four bills and added a fifth on border security. With the help of Democrats, the House approved aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan on Saturday. 'Despite fierce opposition from MAGA Republicans within his caucus, Speaker Johnson has decided that the imperative of the US providing this assistance is more important than pleasing all the members of his caucus,' wrote Julian Zelizer .\nJulian Zelizer.\n'Without this support, international adversaries, including Russia, Iran and China, would read the failure of the US Congress to pass legislation as a sign that MAGA's America First agenda was triumphant. They might conclude that the age of internationalism, entrenched into American politics since World War II, had come to an end.'\n'The problem for Johnson is that his decision to move forward might very well cost him his job,' added Zelizer, noting Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's fierce criticism of Johnson and a House rule allowing just one member to bring about a vote to oust the speaker \u2014 which led to Kevin McCarthy's downfall six months ago.\nBiden backed bipartisan legislation on the border, but in the view of Fareed Zakaria , he has missed an opportunity to take firm executive action after House Republicans scuttled the bill and launched the doomed effort to impeach and remove Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\nFareed Zakaria, he has missed an opportunity to take firm executive action after House Republicans scuttled the bill and launched the doomed effort to impeach and remove Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. 'Biden must show he can fight. He should declare a national security emergency, send the National Guard to the border, work with Congress to suspend the asylum process and propose a new one that basically makes it impossible to get asylum if you just show up at the border,' Zakaria wrote.\n'Many will scream, and it will all be challenged in court. But it will signal that Biden is taking the problem seriously. Bill Clinton often says that the American people don't always need you to succeed, but they want to catch you trying. Joe Biden needs to be caught trying to solve the immigration crisis.'\nDonald Trump's campaign denied reports that the former president dozed off several times in court last week. But no one should be surprised at the sight of a criminal defendant seeming to nod off, noted Elliot Williams , a former prosecutor who has logged countless hours in court.\nElliot Williams, a former prosecutor who has logged countless hours in court. 'Courtrooms don't lend themselves to keeping people awake. They are notoriously quiet places where people are required to remain seated almost all of the time. The air is often stagnant and the ever-so-distracting handheld devices that are our lifelines to (and barrier from) the world around us are strictly forbidden \u2026 the gears of justice are not made for the 24-hour news cycle. What might be resolved in an 8-minute final segment of an episode of \u2018Law and Order' might be drawn out over days of painstaking testimony. It can take months, if not years (even in cases in which a defendant is not deliberately attempting to slow proceedings down) before a matter finally gets to trial.'\nStill, the selection of the jury that will pronounce a verdict on the hush money trial moved faster than expected last week. There were speed bumps though, as Patrick T. Brown noted.\nPatrick T. Brown noted. 'One potential juror who underwent questioning \u2026 was subsequently struck for cause after Trump's team found social media posts from the juror referencing Trump that say, \u2018Get him out' and \u2018Lock him up.''\n'Indeed, it seems unlikely that this case would be being prosecuted with the same vigor and creative legal theorizing if Trump were an everyday citizen. After all, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg came into office promising to focus on the ongoing investigation of Trump, and would have likely felt political heat from New York Democrats had he decided to close the investigation without bringing charges.'\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook 'In the end, as The New York Times reported in March 2023, Bragg's office took a \u2018circuitous and sometimes uncertain road' to filing criminal charges, reviving a dying investigation that originally focused on Trump's business practices with a renewed focus on hush money payments.'\nWill the trial be fair? Jeffrey Abramson , author of a book on the jury system, noted, 'Impartiality is the key to jury justice, but we can hardly expect jurors to approach the case without strong opinions about Trump. Indeed, it would be disturbing to seat jurors whose only qualification was their ignorance about major news events of the day.'\nJeffrey Abramson, author of a book on the jury system, noted, 'Impartiality is the key to jury justice, but we can hardly expect jurors to approach the case without strong opinions about Trump. Indeed, it would be disturbing to seat jurors whose only qualification was their ignorance about major news events of the day.' 'Fortunately, an open mind does not require an empty mind. We can find fair jurors who understand the difference between law and politics.'\nDon't call it a hush money trial, urged Norm Eisen .\nNorm Eisen. 'The core issue \u2026 is not the payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels in October 2016 to conceal her claimed affair with Trump (he denies the affair took place). The core issue is why Trump made them.\n'Paying hush money by itself is not a crime. The crime alleged in this case is felony document falsification, as the judge detailed. That requires intent to conceal, aid or commit another crime. Here, the prosecution alleges that the intent was to violate federal campaign finance laws and also the state statute prohibiting the \u2018unlawful influence' of an election \u2014 i.e., election interference.'\n'No one can seriously dispute,' Eisen concluded, that the reason former Trump fixer Michael Cohen and Trump himself 'allegedly hatched the scheme was to deprive voters of information that could have changed the outcome of an extremely close election.'\nFor more:\nElie Honig : Which case is the biggest threat to Trump?\nElie Honig: Which case is the biggest threat to Trump?\nElie Honig: Which case is the biggest threat to Trump?\n02:13 - Source: CNN\n02:13 - Source: CNN The unimaginable is not a theory, wrote Frida Ghitis .

'Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war for decades. The notion that one day Iran would launch a direct attack against Israel may have seemed like a distant possibility: something that was bound to happen, but only at some elusive future date. The same was true of Hamas, a terrorist group that seized control of Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thought he could appease Hamas and preserve quiet in Gaza and safety for Israelis living in the south. Others worried that one day Hamas would attack with full force. Many have worried that Iran will one day attack with full force. October 7 and April 14 are reminders that the unimaginable, the barely-imaginable, can and does happen.'\nPeter Bergen wrote that 'Saturday's drone and missile attacks against Israel were designed to show Israel and the region that the Iranian regime can't be trifled with, and the Israeli attack on its military leaders in Damascus would be avenged. However, it might not trigger a major war since 99% of the 300 drones and missiles launched by Iran were intercepted, according to the Israeli military. It's likely that Iran's theocratic regime, which has faced major internal protests and is approaching a generational transition, wanted to respond to calls for retribution for the Damascus attack without triggering a major war with two superior militaries \u2014 that of the US and Israel.'\nPeter Bergen wrote that 'Saturday's drone and missile attacks against Israel were designed to show Israel and the region that the Iranian regime can't be trifled with, and the Israeli attack on its military leaders in Damascus would be avenged.

You must be sexy before you can be powerful. You must appear feminine before you can appear athletic.'\nSix people \u2014 five of them women \u2014 were killed in a stabbing attack at a mall in Sydney.

He had to stare down political opposition from his own supporters at the time, but his tough stance has been vindicated by the lack of mass shootings ever since.'\n'But restricting public access to weapons with the capability of mass lethality cannot stop hateful ideologies mixing with other noxious ingredients including radicalization and mental health issues.'\n'This includes misogyny.'\nFor more:\nJustin J.

'The party of Winston Churchill wants to ban (cigars)?' he moaned. 'Donnez-moi un break, as they say in Quebec. It's just mad.'\nThomas wrote, 'Under the proposed bill, no one born on or after January 1, 2009, would ever be allowed to buy tobacco, effectively raising the legal smoking age every year. This would mean today's 15-year-olds will never legally be able to buy cigarettes.'\n'Despite what Johnson may have led his audience to believe, a potential smoking ban enjoys broad popular support in the UK. A February survey by YouGov for the charity Action on Smoking and Health found that 71% of adults backed the goal of making Britain a country where no one smokes (12% are opposed). Like most people, I'm certain this would save many lives and relieve a massive strain on the National Health Service (NHS).

He littered his remarks with false and misleading claims on subjects ranging from his annual earnings to his cap on seniors' prescription drug spending to the demographics of China to the frequency of his past travel to Iraq and Afghanistan.\nAnd in Biden's most eyebrow-raising remarks of the campaign swing, he told and then retold a story in which he strongly suggested his late uncle, Ambrose Finnegan, was eaten by cannibals after his plane was shot down while he fought in World War II. Biden's dramatic details don't match the Defense Department's official account of the plane crash.\nHere is a fact check of eight of Biden's Pennsylvania remarks.\nIn the same Tuesday speech in Scranton, Biden repeated his regular promise that nobody making less than $400,000 per year will pay even a cent more in taxes under his proposals. He then added, 'I hope you're all able to make $400,000. I never did.'\nFacts First : Biden's 'I never did' claim is false. In fact, his presidential salary is $400,000 per year ; the joint tax filings of President Biden and first lady Jill Biden showed $619,976 in income last year , $579,514 in 2022 and $610,702 in 2021. In addition, Biden earned millions in 2017 and 2018, when, during his time as a private citizen following his vice presidency, he and Jill Biden signed a lucrative book deal and he delivered paid speeches . The Bidens' joint tax filings showed a total of about $11 million in 2017 income and about $4.6 million in 2018 income.\nFacts First: Biden's 'I never did' claim is false.

The Bidens' joint tax filings showed a total of about $11 million in 2017 income and about $4.6 million in 2018 income. Biden, who was a US senator for 36 years prior to his vice presidency, did regularly earn less than $400,000 per year before 2017. As PolitiFact has previously noted, the Bidens' joint filings reported less than $400,000 in income in each year from 1998 through 2016 except for 2013, when they were just over $407,000.\nIn the same speech in Scranton, Biden touted provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act he signed in 2022. He said: 'For example, seniors, beginning in 2024, no matter how much their prescription drug costs are, they'll never have to pay more than $2,000 a year, no matter what.'\nFacts First : Biden's claim is false in two ways. First, the $2,000 cap on Medicare Part D enrollees' out-of-pocket prescription drug spending takes effect in 2025 , not 2024; there is a higher cap, more than $3,000, in place this year . (The White House corrected the official transcript of Biden's speech to make clear Biden should have said 2025 instead of 2024.) Second, it's not true that seniors will 'never' have to spend more than $2,000 per year on prescription drugs 'no matter what.' The cap is indexed to annual inflation in Part D costs , so it is highly likely to be set higher than $2,000 in future years. Also, the cap doesn't apply to out-of-pocket spending on Medicare Part B drugs like those administered at doctors' offices.\nFacts First: Biden's claim is false in two ways.

Biden has correctly said on various previous occasions that the $2,000 cap takes effect in 2025, but he has also previously incorrectly said that the cap took effect in 2023 or 2024.\n- CNN's Tami Luhby contributed to this item.\n- CNN's Tami Luhby contributed to this item. In a Wednesday speech in Pittsburgh that was focused on US steel competition with China, Biden said, 'I always say to my colleagues \u2014 when I meet other world leaders, I say, \u2018Would you trade places with China? Would you trade places with their problems?' They've got a population that is more people in retirement than working.'\nFacts First : The claim that China has more retired people than working people is false.

Fuxian Yi, a University of Wisconsin-Madison senior scientist who is an expert on Chinese demographics , called Biden's claim 'overstated and premature.' China reported having more than 740 million employed people at the end of 2023, while it also reported having just shy of 297 million people age 60 or above that year.

Yi noted that China's ratio of working people to seniors is shrinking as the country's population ages. But Biden's claim that the number of retirees already exceeds the number of people working is clearly not correct, even if you apply the usual dose of skepticism to official Chinese data.\nratio of working people to seniors is shrinking as the country's population ages. But Biden's claim that the number of retirees already exceeds the number of people working is clearly not correct, even if you apply the usual dose of skepticism to official Chinese data. 'It's certainly the direction they're heading, but still an exaggeration,' Derek Scissors, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank who is an expert on the Chinese economy, said of Biden's claim.\nBiden made a similar claim in 2021, which CNN fact-checked as false at the time.\nAs he has on numerous previous occasions, Biden cited a 2021 report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy think tank that found that 55 of the country's largest corporations had made more than $40 billion in total profit in their previous fiscal year but not paid any federal corporate income taxes.\nBiden said in the same Tuesday speech in Scranton: 'When Trump was president in 2020, 55 of the largest corporations in America of the Fortune 500 made $40 billion in profit and paid zero \u2014 zero \u2014 in federal income taxes.' After someone in the audience called that 'sinful,' Biden continued, 'Well, guess what? I came along and took care of the sin. Not anymore. Thanks to the law that I wrote and signed, big corporations now have to pay a minimum \u2014 they should be paying more \u2014 a minimum of 15% tax.'\nFacts First : Biden's 'not anymore' claim is false \u2014 the same exaggeration he delivered in his State of the Union address in March . While the 15% corporate minimum tax he signed into law in the Inflation Reduction Act will reduce the number of big corporations that don't pay any federal taxes, it's not true that 'not anymore' will any big corporation \u2014 such as the ones on the list of 55 companies Biden mentioned \u2014 ever do so. That's because the minimum tax, on the 'book income' companies report to investors, only applies to companies with at least $1 billion in average annual income. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, only 14 of the companies on that 2021 list of 55 non-payers reported having US pre-tax income of at least $1 billion.\nFacts First: Biden's 'not anymore' claim is false \u2014 the same exaggeration he delivered in his State of the Union address in March .

In other words, there will clearly still be some big and profitable corporations paying no federal income tax despite the existence of the new Biden tax. The exact number is not known.\nMatthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told CNN in 2022 that the new tax is 'an important step forward from the status quo' and that it would raise substantial revenue, but he also said: 'I wouldn't want to assert that the minimum tax will end the phenomenon of zero-tax profitable corporations. A more accurate phrasing would be to say that the minimum tax will *help* ensure that *the most profitable* corporations pay at least some federal income tax.'\nThere are lots of nuances to the tax; you can read more specifics here. Asked for comment in early 2023, when Biden made a similar claim, a White House official told CNN: 'The Inflation Reduction Act ensures the wealthiest corporations pay a 15% minimum tax, precisely the corporations the President focused on during the campaign and in office.'\nBiden delivered another version of a claim he has regularly made about billionaires' tax rates. He said in the same Tuesday speech in Scranton: 'Do you know what the average federal tax rate for a billionaire is today in America? For real: 8.3%.' After some people in the audience laughed, Biden continued, 'That's how much federal ta- \u2014 no, I'm serious. Not a joke. Far less than the vast majority of Americans pay in federal taxes. No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a nurse, a sanitation worker.'\nFacts First : Biden's '8.3%' claim is misleading in the absence of any explanation of what this figure is. As in previous speeches , including the State of the Union address in March , Biden didn't explain that the figure is the product of an alternative calculation, from economists in his own administration, that factors in unrealized capital gains that are not treated as taxable income under federal law. In other words, while Biden made it sound like he was talking about a federal tax rate, he was actually citing a figure that is not based on the way the US tax system actually works at present.\nFacts First: Biden's '8.3%' claim is misleading in the absence of any explanation of what this figure is.

In other words, while Biden made it sound like he was talking about a federal tax rate, he was actually citing a figure that is not based on the way the US tax system actually works at present. There's nothing inherently wrong with the alternative calculation itself; the administration economists who came up with it explained it in detail on the White House website in 2021. (They said the figure was 8.2%.) Biden, however, has tended to cite the figure without any context about what it is and isn't, leaving open the impression that he was talking about what these billionaire families pay under current law.\nSo what do billionaires actually pay under current law? The answer is not publicly known, but experts say it's clearly more than 8%.\n'Biden's numbers are way too low,' Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute think tank, told CNN in 2023. Gleckman said that in 2019, University of California, Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman 'estimated the top 400 households paid an average effective tax rate of about 23 percent in 2018. They got a lot of attention at the time because that rate was lower than the average rate of 24 percent for the bottom half of the income distribution. But it still was way more than 2 or 3,' numbers Biden has used in some previous speeches, 'or even 8 percent.'\nIn February 2024, Gleckman provided additional calculations from the Tax Policy Center. The center found that the top 0.1% of households paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 30.3% in 2020, including an average income tax rate of 24.3%.\nDuring the same Tuesday speech in Scranton, Biden repeated a familiar boast about his supposed impact on the federal budget deficit. He said, 'A lot more to do, but guess what? During the whole time, I've been able to cut the federal deficit at the same exact time by over $1 trillion \u2014 $1 trillion.'\nFacts First : Biden's claim leaves out such critical context that it is misleading. While the annual federal budget deficit was more than $1 trillion lower in the 2023 fiscal year than it was in both the 2020 fiscal year (under President Donald Trump) and the 2021 fiscal year (partially under Trump and partially under Biden), analysts have repeatedly noted that Biden's own actions, including laws he has signed and executive orders he has issued, have had the overall effect of worsening annual deficits, not reducing them. As in past remarks , Biden didn't explain that the primary reason the deficit fell by a record amount during his tenure was that it had skyrocketed to a record high at the end of Trump's term because of bipartisan emergency pandemic relief spending, then fell as expected when that spending expired as planned.\nFacts First: Biden's claim leaves out such critical context that it is misleading.

'The deficit is a trillion dollars lower, roughly, than when President Biden took office. That's true. But that's driven not because he \u2018reduced' the deficit by a trillion dollars, but because when he took office it was the middle of Covid and we had been temporarily injecting huge sums of money into the economy,' Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group that promotes deficit reduction and tracks the issue, said in a February interview.\nBiden can fairly say that his policies have contributed to a strong economic recovery that has boosted tax revenues and thus eaten into deficits. On the whole, though, Goldwein said deficits under Biden have been 'higher than they otherwise would have been because of legislation President Biden has signed into law and executive actions he's taken.'\nBiden made the same claim during his State of the Union address in March. You can read a more detailed fact check here.\nBiden claimed in another Tuesday speech in Scranton: 'I was in, I think, 36, 38 times in Iraq and Afghanistan as a senator and as a vice president.'\nFacts First : These figures are false, according to statistics previously released by Biden's own 2020 presidential campaign. The campaign said in 2019 that Biden had visited Iraq and Afghanistan on a total of 21 occasions, the Washington Post reported at the time .\nFacts First: These figures are false, according to statistics previously released by Biden's own 2020 presidential campaign. The campaign said in 2019 that Biden had visited Iraq and Afghanistan on a total of 21 occasions, the Washington Post reported at the time . Biden has delivered similar falsehoods about his travel to Iraq and Afghanistan on various previous occasions \u2014 including in the 2019 remarks that prompted his campaign to correct the record \u2014 and they have been previously fact-checked by media outlets including CNN.\nIn Scranton, where Biden was born, he visited a memorial that honors local residents who died in World War II, including his late uncle Ambrose Finnegan. Before Biden left the city on Wednesday, he told a dramatic story about Finnegan: 'He got shot down in an area where there were a lot of cannibals in New Guinea at the time. They never recovered his body.' He blamed cannibalism even more directly in his Pittsburgh speech later in the day, claiming Finnegan 'got shot down in New Guinea, and they never found the body because there used to be \u2014 there were a lot of cannibals, for real, in that part of New Guinea.'\nFacts First : Biden's claim differs from the account provided by the Defense Department, as CNN's Donald Judd reported Wednesday. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency's page on Finnegan says this about the 1944 incident: 'For unknown reasons, this plane was forced to ditch in the ocean off the north coast of New Guinea. Both engines failed at low altitude, and the aircraft's nose hit the water hard. Three men failed to emerge from the sinking wreck and were lost in the crash.' This official account, which notes that an additional crew member survived the crash, makes no mention of the plane being shot down or of possible cannibalism; while Biden said the crash happened 'in' New Guinea, where there was indeed some cannibalism at the time, the official account notes the men went down in the nearby ocean.\nFacts First : Biden's claim differs from the account provided by the Defense Department, as CNN's Donald Judd reported Wednesday.

White House spokespeople did not repeat Biden's assertions about cannibals or the plane being shot down when asked about his story. 'President Biden is proud of his uncle's service in uniform, who lost his life when the military aircraft he was on crashed in the Pacific after taking off near New Guinea,' deputy press secretary Andrew Bates told CNN on Wednesday.\n- CNN's Donald Judd contributed to this item.\n- CNN's Donald Judd contributed to this item.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Daniel Dale","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/211020183910-bifen-scranton-1020.jpg?q=x_194,y_455,h_1152,w_2048,c_crop/w_800","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":2.198387,"_id":"b25c947bf362531f5891277c5cedc04d"}],"user_input":{"q":"conservative","search_in":["title_summary_en"],"lang":["en"],"not_lang":null,"countries":null,"not_countries":null,"from":"2024-04-15 00:00:00","to":null,"ranked_only":"True","from_rank":null,"to_rank":null,"sort_by":"relevancy","page":1,"size":100,"sources":["cnn.com"],"not_sources":[],"topic":null,"published_date_precision":null}}
