The devices are a tough sell, he admits. Yet this sluggish, self-serious job-gone-wrong movie could itself stand to be jolted to life.\nIt emerges that, while working for a previous employer, Cliff participated in an elaborate theft scheme that ended with the accounting man's suicide. That gory mess, seen in a prologue set in 1992, provides the first image, in the sort of sudden brutality that is meant to shock but instead comes across as posturing.\nFlash forward 17 months, to when the bulk of the action takes place. Cliff has debts, a tarnished reputation and a wife (Nora Zehetner) with whom he has had the experience of caring for a cancer-stricken child. (Evidently opening with a suicide wasn't grim enough.) Ricky (Kit Harington), a former colleague in the scandal, approaches Cliff with an offer. 'I could use a man don't mind breaking the rules,' he drawls in an accent far removed from the Montana setting.\nCliff doesn't trust that pitch \u2014 and the barely recognizable Harington shouldn't have trusted in that horseshoe mustache \u2014 but desperation is desperation. So Cliff joins a drug-running operation, with predictably violent consequences.\nDirected by Rod Blackhurst, 'Blood for Dust' is a throwback, in the sense of being exceedingly familiar. An early shot of a snow-covered parking lot inevitably evokes 'Fargo,' but 'Blood for Dust' doesn't have a witty line or a glimmer of humor. The climactic shootout is so dimly lit that it's difficult to discern who is firing at whom. It's easy enough to guess.\nBlood for Dust\nRated R. Gun violence and a topless bar. Running time: 1 hour 38 minutes. In theaters and available to rent or buy on most major platforms.\nBlood for Dust\nRated R. Gun violence and a topless bar. Running time: 1 hour 38 minutes.

'One we jokingly say belongs in a Netflix series.' The Peel police are responsible for law enforcement at Toronto's airport.\nThe gold, Chief Duraiappah said, was partly used to buy guns that were bound for Canada. The man who drove the truck used in the gold theft was arrested in Pennsylvania in September after a police officer stopped a rental car he was driving for a traffic violation and found 65 guns, two of which were fully automatic rifles. The man has been charged with conspiracy to illegally traffic firearms into Canada.\nIt is unclear if that arrest and a separate investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in the United States into the firearms smuggling revealed the broader theft plot. Eric DeGree, a special agent for the A.T.F. who was at the news conference, said that the agency contacted the Peel police after finding the man's name in a police information database.\nThe gold theft, which Chief Duraiappah said was Canada's largest, appeared to be remarkably simple. The gold and cash arrived at the Toronto airport in a special container aboard an Air Canada flight from Switzerland on April 17, 2023, and was moved to one of the airline's warehouses.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Or a charismatic opportunist luring people into his latest scam.\nThese descriptions apply equally to characters from 'A Different World' \u2014 a sitcom that ran from 1987 to 1993 \u2014 and to today's social media influencers. So it's little wonder that the show, which streams on Amazon and Max, resonates with Gen Z.\nThe series began as a spinoff of 'The Cosby Show' centered on Denise Huxtable (Lisa Bonet), and it became a hit in its own right.\n'A Different World' broke ground by giving high visibility to an ensemble of aspirational Black young adults, following an eclectic cross-section of coeds attending Hillman College, a fictional historically Black university. There they dealt with typical collegiate growing pains \u2014 studying, partying, falling in love and stumbling into adulthood \u2014 and also with more serious subject matter, including racism, domestic abuse, gun violence, homelessness and mental health struggles.\n'These things mattered, and these are issues which are still relevant today,' said Darryl M. Bell, who played the Hillman huckster Ron Johnson.\nNow, more than three decades after the series finale, Bell and other core cast members, including Charnele Brown, Jasmine Guy, Kadeem Hardison, Dawnn Lewis, Cree Summer and Glynn Turman, have reunited for a campus tour of historically Black colleges and universities.

So she gave him an ultimatum.\n'I told him, \u2018A military man is going to come,'' she remembered. '\u2018Either you go with him or you get out of my house.'' This was 2008, and Americans were stationed in war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. But she figured those places were safer than Baton Rouge.\nLouis Jr. took Option A, joining the Army the year after he graduated from high school.\nAfter six years in the service, including one year in Iraq, Louis came home. He took a Coca-Cola warehouse job, became a father to three children and was performing as a rapper under the name Louis BadAzz.\nJust shy of his 30th birthday, Louis Jr. was leaving a friend's house when he was shot dead. He was one of 78 people killed in Baton Rouge in 2018.\nMs. Robinson grieved. She was also angry \u2014 at the people shooting up her neighborhood, at potential witnesses who wouldn't help the police solve the crime, at the police for not finding her son's killer.\nLouis Robinson Jr., who performed under the name Louis BadAzz, is memorialized in his parents' home. Ms. Robinson with two of her grandchildren.\nLouis Robinson Jr., who performed under the name Louis BadAzz, is memorialized in his parents' home.\nMs. Robinson with two of her grandchildren.\nAn empty lot on Cadillac Street near where Louis Jr. became one of 78 people killed in Baton Rouge in 2018.\nSix months before Louis Jr. was killed, Murphy Paul became the chief of police in Baton Rouge. Mr. Paul had come from the upper ranks of the Louisiana State Police, and Sharon Weston Broome, the mayor who hired him, gave him a mandate: make change. Among his early acts was dismissing a white police officer who shot and killed a Black man named Alton Sterling in 2016. The officer's actions and Sterling's death, caught on phone cameras, ignited existing tensions between police and Black residents in the city. Chief Paul, who is Black, began an overhaul of the Police Department's policies on discipline and the use of force.\nChief Murphy Paul was given a mandate to make change in the Baton Rouge Police Department.\nBut reforming a mostly white police department in a Black-majority city was only part of the job; just as urgent was confronting the street gun violence \u2014 what social scientists sometimes call community gun violence \u2014 that led to Louis Jr.'s death.\nWhile mass shootings strike at seemingly random locations \u2014 concerts, parades, schools \u2014 community gun violence strikes dependably in the most disadvantaged city blocks. Apart from suicide, it is by far the deadliest use of guns in the United States and hits hardest in places where poverty and lack of opportunity give rise to crime. Homicide was the leading cause of death among Black people between 15 and 24 in 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Baton Rouge, where just over half of the 221,000 residents are Black, 85 percent of homicide victims in 2022 \u2014 and 80 percent of homicide suspects \u2014 were Black, according to a study by the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform.\nThe concentration of this violence helps fuel it. Victims, shooters and their families are often entangled in networks that can be impervious to and suspicious of law enforcement. Chief Paul wanted to break through those barriers.\nHe embraced the prevailing progressive theory of police reform: police should be guardians of a community, not warriors against it. If the police are trusted, the theory goes, witnesses feel comfortable coming forward and crimes are solved, disrupting cycles of violence and retaliation among a tiny number of heavily armed young men.\nTo that end, in early 2019, Chief Paul met with Ms. Robinson and other people who had lost family members to violence. 'I wasn't prepared for the passion, outrage, the anger and the pain that I was going to experience,' the chief said. Ms. Robinson, in particular, gave him an earful.\nHe persisted. Better policing, he told the family members, was essential, but insufficient. 'Look,' he told them, 'we need help.'\nAfter Liz Robinson lost her son to gun violence, she decided to run a non-profit called C.H.A.N.G.E. to help other families affected by gun violence\nKaran Deep Singh and Kathleen Flynn for The New York Times\nThe chief promised to work with members of the community, directing more resources and police help to groups already trying to prevent violence. Moreover, in a new experiment, he would work within a broader public safety program run by the mayor's office and community groups, spreading responsibility for public safety beyond the police.\nAll this, he hoped, would help to prevent further violence. But determining which prevention strategies really work is an evolving and complicated science. Law enforcement strategies are studied more often than community-driven alternatives, which means most existing research backs up police-driven approaches. Federal anti-violence funding has long skewed heavily toward policing, and police departments have the training and systems to collect the raw data that researchers use to study violence trends. When it comes to community-violence intervention methods like the one being tried in Baton Rouge, there are some promising results, but the number of studies is limited and the overall evidence remains unsettled.\nIn recent years, however, hundreds of millions of dollars from private foundations and the Biden administration have gone into these alternatives, offering a genuine opportunity to study their effectiveness.\n'It's exciting, and it's a moment of some trepidation as well, because there's a lot on the line,' said Nina Revoyr of Ballmer Group, the lead private funder of the organization advising Baton Rouge's experimental program. To people on the ground, helping a teenager get a summer job or calming a street dispute before it boils over is a self-evident success. But funders and policymakers want quantifiable, statistical evidence that these programs reduce violence overall. Future support nationwide hinges on the rigorous collection and analysis of that data.\nBaton Rouge is taking on the data collection challenge. And that means the people trying to prevent violence must learn a strange new language. Complex, sometimes messy situations \u2014 offhand conversations with teenagers in schools, bedside visits to hospital emergency rooms, late-night responses to chaotic crime scenes \u2014 have to be translated into atomized units that can flow into spreadsheets and databases and regression analyses. The process of codifying human interactions into orderly, ruthless statistics falls to teams of people whose preparation for this work often began with surviving violent traumas of their own.\nA year after Louis Jr.'s death, Chief Paul approached Ms. Robinson once again with a specific request: He wanted her to join a victims support group.\nThis time, she agreed.\nLearning the Newark Method The victims support group was run by Sateria Tate-Alexander, another woman Chief Paul had recruited. Like Ms. Robinson, Ms. Tate-Alexander, 48, raised her family in Baton Rouge. Her son had also been struck by a bullet, at age 17, though he survived. But it was the police killing of Alton Sterling that 'that kind of really lit my fire,' she said. She organized demonstrations, pitched in to lobby legislators for police reform, and convened neighborhood meetings.\nAs the Baton Rouge project was taking off, Ms. Tate-Alexander visited Newark, N.J., for inspiration. There, she saw the city's street team in action and decided that 'this is exactly what we need.'\nNewark had become a national beacon of violence reduction, in part through the work of Aqeela Sherrills, whom an admirer calls 'one of the godfathers of community-based violence intervention.' In 1992, at age 22, Mr. Sherrills, a former gang member, helped broker a truce between the Bloods and the Crips in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles. For the next dozen years, he crisscrossed the country and the globe, teaching about how he did it. That is what he was doing in 2004 when his 18-year-old son, Terrell, home on a break from college, was shot dead at a party.\n'It made me question everything,' Mr. Sherrills told me. 'I was broken.'\nHis son's murder went unsolved. Friends urged retaliation against the man believed to have fired the gun. Neither the justice system nor street justice offered any balm for his trauma, and he began to understand this failure as the root of the problem. The system was sorting people into victims (who were offered counseling and compensation) and perpetrators(whom it either punished harshly or failed to hold accountable). To Mr. Sherrills, this binary view encouraged a never-ending cycle of retaliatory violence.\nAqeela Sherrills, an anti-violence activist, brought the methods he had used in Newark to Baton Rouge and other cities.\nMr. Sherrills argued that breaking that divide and providing mental health care and other support could deter young men from taking matters into their own hands. He took those ideas to Newark in 2014 and would later help to create a street team that focused as much on would-be shooters as on shooting victims and their families. The idea is to deploy former gang members or others with criminal records to mediate disputes and prevent retaliation. The street team offered people counseling and connections to jobs, housing and health care. Government agencies and community-based organizations partnered to create what Mr. Sherrills called a public safety ecosystem.\nIn 2020, when cities nationwide saw spikes in gun violence, Newark held the line while all but eliminating police shootings. Mr. Sherrills said he was besieged with calls from cities wanting to learn Newark's special sauce. Later, he made connections in the Biden White House and helped organize a Black-led push for the national programs that are now funding efforts like the one in Baton Rouge. By 2023, his strategies were credited with helping to cut homicides in Newark in half since 2016.\nBaton Rouge became the first city outside New Jersey to be tutored in the Newark method. The mayor's office started an effort to mimic Newark's public safety ecosystem, overseen by Courtney Scott, then a mayoral aide. Four national organizations, including one founded by Mr. Sherrills, advise the city on community intervention, crime data analysis and other matters. At the heart of this national and local apparatus is the street team, led by Ms. Tate-Alexander.\nCalming the urge to retaliate By June 2021, when Ms. Tate-Alexander started assembling the street team, Ms. Robinson joined up. She had already taken a leading role at the victims support group and, eager to make an impact, she doubled up on her work.\nThe two women clicked from the start. Ms. Tate-Alexander has a college degree and a background in information technology and project management. Ms. Robinson, 55, who ran an office-cleaning crew with her husband for many years, has dyed bright-red hair and lets fly the occasional F-bomb. 'Liz came in and we could just see it in her,' Ms. Tate-Alexander said. 'The fight was just there.'\nChief Paul ordered police dispatchers to send alerts to the team for shootings in the high-crime neighborhoods that the team covers. The team's high-risk interventionists are the first responders to shooting scenes and heated disputes, but Ms. Robinson got an exemption from shooting-scene duties. 'I just can't see a Black man laid out there like that,' she said. 'No.'\nFour men do the bulk of the street team's outreach. They all grew up in Baton Rouge, and as in other cities with intervention programs, some sold drugs or committed even more serious crimes.\nOne of the group's elders is Gerald Haynes, 51, whom everyone calls Face for the jagged scar that runs from his left ear to his throat. Mr. Haynes spent 27 years in prison for his role in a drive-by shooting, an attempt at retribution for the killing of a friend.\nMr. Haynes knew a thing or two about the urge to retaliate: It had cost him nearly three decades of freedom. He also thought he knew how to talk to young hotheads. In prison, he said, 'I had to learn how to deal with them in a confined area where I could not get away from them and they couldn't get away from me.' But during his training in Newark, he discovered more refined skills of listening, reflecting back what people say to make them feel heard, and coming up with plans for people to step away from an argument without losing face.\nGerald Haynes joined the Baton Rouge anti-violence street team after spending 27 years in prison.\nKhoury Brown, 32, another high-risk interventionist, is best known to many of the young people the street team works with as the rapper Geaux Yella, with 129,000 Instagram followers. His skill with words is central to his job, but sometimes when a fight is brewing, he fears words will fail him. 'I could have both parties in a full-blooded conversation where everything's about to die down, and I got one knucklehead who feels like what I'm doing is soft,' he said. But he's a powerful influence even when he's not on the scene.\nThe high-risk interventionists will 'get up out of their beds at 2 o'clock in the morning to do whatever it is that's necessary,' says Ms. Tate-Alexander, who runs the street team. A high-risk interventionist, Khoury Brown is known around Baton Rouge as the rapper Geaux Yella.\nThe high-risk interventionists will 'get up out of their beds at 2 o'clock in the morning to do whatever it is that's necessary,' says Ms. Tate-Alexander, who runs the street team.\nA high-risk interventionist, Khoury Brown is known around Baton Rouge as the rapper Geaux Yella.\nDarius Crockett with his son.\nOne of the street team's initiatives is a mentorship program, in which young people at risk of violence are paired with mentors like Darius Crockett. Mr. Crockett had drifted to the streets as a teenager in Baton Rouge, selling drugs. But he had since gotten his G.E.D. and found work as a welder. He was assigned to work with a 15-year-old named Markel.\nShootings happen frequently on Markel's street. His mother, Kayla Atkins, uses a wheelchair, having been paralyzed by a gunshot long ago. From a young age, Markel had to be a caregiver. As he entered his teens, he was getting into fights. When he was 14, one of his best friends was shot and killed. His mother said she desperately wanted to save her son 'from going down that path.'\nThe mentorship program required Markel to complete three goals. Knowing Markel wanted to rap, Mr. Crockett urged him to enter a talent contest, where he performed an original rap song. Markel took first place, which meant he not only accomplished his first goal, but won prizes that would satisfy his other two: He would be a featured performer in a video with Geaux Yella himself and participate in a recording session. Markel eagerly looked forward to the coming winter when the session would happen. Mr. Crockett also helped the boy land a job at a city-run summer camp.\nMr. Crockett, left, acted as a mentor to Markel, helping him focus on music and a summer job.\nThen, in June, Markel got into an argument with his sister. He had a 'meltdown,' slamming doors and throwing things, Ms. Atkins said. Feeling helpless to control him, she called the police \u2014 and Mr. Crockett. The police officer put Markel in handcuffs in the back of his cruiser.\nWhen Mr. Crockett showed up, he asked to speak privately with Markel. The officer let him into the car. Mr. Crockett empathized with Markel. He told the teenager that he himself had 'lost my anger a little bit' with his girlfriend a few days earlier and had to reel himself in. 'Everybody gets angry,' Mr. Crockett told Markel. 'But right now, at this moment, you got to control it.'\nHe leveraged Markel's aspirations, promising that he could still appear in the Geaux Yella video. 'I'm still your big brother,' he assured him. 'I'll always be out here.' Markel settled down, and the police officer, with Ms. Atkins's blessing, let Mr. Crockett take the boy to another relative's house.\nA 'faith-based movement'? Poverty has always bred violence. In the 1990s, an upsurge in violent crime led cities to try new methods to address it on the streets. The first experiments leaned heavily on law enforcement. Hot-spots policing, for instance, the practice of focusing police attention on particular troubled neighborhoods, spread around the country.\nThen, in 1999, a Chicago epidemiologist named Gary Slutkin picked up an old idea of using outreach workers to mediate street disputes. Framing the problem in public health terms, he argued that retaliatory violence was like a communicable disease and that outreach workers \u2014 he called them violence interrupters \u2014 could mimic an immune response. Groups more or less modeled after Dr. Slutkin's organization, which came to be called Cure Violence, popped up in other cities.\nOther efforts springing from communities found a foothold in the violence prevention universe: youth counseling programs, visits with shooting victims while they are still in the hospital, cleanup of empty buildings and vacant lots that attract crime.\nThese ideas had an instinctive appeal. Violence was not about bad people, but about behaviors that could be changed. And violence interruption, in particular, gave agency both to members of a stricken community and people who regretted their own violent history. Overall, these methods emphasized prevention rather than punishment.\nAs these programs proliferated, however, policymakers had one overriding question: Do they work?\nStrong evidence emerged for some law enforcement efforts. Hot-spots policing has been studied many times in different cities and has consistently been shown to reduce violence. A carrot-and-stick approach called focused deterrence, which offers counseling and job training alongside the threat of prosecution for future crimes, has also gotten a research thumbs-up. Federal grants to initiate these policing programs often came with money for outside researchers to study them.\nHistorically, more research money has gone toward violence prevention programs run by the police than toward those run by community groups.\nBut money wasn't flowing to studies of community-based programs like violence interruption. Those studies require taxing, time-consuming design, said Jeffrey A. Butts, a violence researcher and the director of the Research and Evaluation Center at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. He lays some fault on researchers who prefer the easier work of analyzing police data.\nMuch of the research that has been done on community prevention programs is not sufficiently rigorous, Dr. Butts argues. He has studied community interventions for decades and supports systemic responses to violence, but criticizes organizations that champion their success without sufficient data. 'I see it becoming a faith-based movement,' Dr. Butts said. 'There has to be really transparent professional research in order to stand up in public and say this works.' When it comes to community-based interventions, he added, 'we are nowhere close to having that.'\nWhat troubles him most is that governments and foundations will walk away from programs that lack consistent and replicable evidence. This, he fears, will lead cities to rely only on strategies that have strong evidence \u2014 like policing.\nTo bulk up on evidence, Baton Rouge hired a data analysis company to create a system to capture the raw data. That system is still in its infancy, Ms. Scott said, and needs at least two more years before the city should even consider commissioning a formal quantitative evaluation. 'We're still working like a science project in a testing and observation mode,' she said.\nThe burden of logging that raw data falls to the street team. It's not a job they particularly relish. 'They'll get up out of their beds at 2 o'clock in the morning to go do whatever it is that's necessary,' Ms. Tate-Alexander said. 'The work is fulfilling to them. But the writing part? Yeah, no, that's not their favorite thing.'\nAbout once a week, Ms. Tate-Alexander calls a data day where they all come to the 'war room,' a windowless hovel tucked away in a community center, to get their logging done.\nMs. Robinson, Ms. Tate-Alexander and Mr. Sherrills in the street team's 'war room.'\nThey categorize each interaction on the streets: a mediation (getting conflicting parties to talk before violence occurs), an intervention (an attempt to head off retaliation after a violent incident) or a prevention (an intervention that demonstrably headed off more violence). They record whom they talked to, what was said and what they believe should be done next. 'We absolutely track everything,' Ms. Tate-Alexander said.\nThose reports are confidential, to protect sources' safety and to preserve the team's independence from law enforcement and build trust with the community. But every month, categories and actions are counted, anonymously, and then fed into the system that tracks the entire Baton Rouge public safety program, which includes 20 other agencies and organizations.\nThe dull mechanics of bureaucratic accountability are needed to comply with the multiple federal and private grants that pay for this work. Each grant has its own requirements.\nOne afternoon, interventionists reviewed work assignments at one end of a war room conference table while Ms. Tate-Alexander reviewed spreadsheet format changes the city wanted as it tracked the spending of one federal grant.\nMr. Sherrills was in town for one of his periodic visits. Six feet tall, with an ever-present Stacy Adams fedora, he cuts a striking figure. He is something of a celebrity in town, hugging and hand-slapping his way through talks and meetings.\nThe demands of funders and the research community sometimes frustrate him. He fears that the emphasis in social science toward quantitative research strips out the texture of real lives. Statistics can't capture what Markel felt when he won the talent competition or how a visit from Liz Robinson comforted a grieving family.\nMr. Sherrills is a believer in research. He was instrumental in getting a team from the University of California, Los Angeles to conduct a narrative evaluation of the Newark street team. But even Newark's precipitous fall in crime did not have the statistical backing necessary to prove that community-led interventions were responsible. When I brought up Dr. Butts's critiques to Mr. Sherrills, he grew heated, even tearing up at one point. 'Why we got to keep proving ourselves?'\nThe effort in Baton Rouge presents an opportunity not only to save lives, but to establish the community's role in doing so. While members of the street team groaned and eye-rolled through a conference call with a city official, Mr. Sherrills counseled patience. 'This,' he told them, 'is the biggest challenge of this work.'\n'I can't touch everybody' In 2023, homicides and nonfatal shootings fell as quickly across the country as they had risen during the Covid years. Analysts posit that some combination of pandemic shutdowns and protests after the murder of George Floyd threw normal social supports and policing into chaos, and that the trend is starting to reverse as life gets back to normal. But the data puzzle applies here, too: Nobody can say for sure.\nIn Baton Rouge, homicides and nonfatal shootings dropped by one-third between 2021 and 2023, to 359 victims from 535. That was a sharper decline than in many other cities.\nYet the picture still isn't clear. Violence in Baton Rouge remains higher than it was in the years before the pandemic and is still extraordinarily high for a city its size. And there were 31 homicides in the first quarter of 2024, double the number in the same period in 2023. The answer to whether community-based efforts help Baton Rouge make significant strides will only come with rigorous research down the line.\nIn July, Chief Paul announced he would retire after nearly six years on the job. Under his watch, officers' use of force went down, more Black officers were hired, and department policies and crime statistics became more accessible.\nBut throughout his tenure, there were pockets of opposition to his approach to violence prevention, including from members of the Metropolitan Council. Weeks after Mr. Paul announced his retirement, two lawsuits were filed claiming that officers secretly interrogated and brutalized suspects at a police warehouse. The mayor shut down the warehouse and the unit that was accused of using it. (The lawsuits are ongoing.) When questioned at a Metropolitan Council meeting about the lawsuits and alleged misconduct, Chief Paul lashed out at two council members who represent white-majority districts, essentially accusing them of racist motivations in trying to undermine him and his efforts to rid the department of 'bad cops.' (They denied his accusations and then unsuccessfully pressed the mayor to fire Mr. Paul ahead of his planned departure.) Community members held a 'Stand With Chief Murphy Paul Rally' outside police headquarters. In the front row at that rally was Ms. Robinson.\nThe homicides increased in Baton Rouge during the pandemic, and fell afterwards. But the number of deaths is still high \u2014 359 people in 2023.\nChief Paul's replacement is Thomas S. Morse Jr., a 20-year veteran of the department. Mr. Morse, who is white, came into office voicing support for the community's role in violence prevention. At first, Ms. Robinson and Ms. Tate-Alexander seemed wary when I asked about him. They didn't know him, they said, but hoped he would follow Chief Paul's example.\nAs 2023 came to a close, the street team faced new troubles. In early December, Mr. Crockett, the street team member who had mentored Markel, was charged with aggravated battery, domestic abuse and child endangerment. His girlfriend told the police that he had slammed her head against a wall and thrown a steam iron at her while children were sleeping in the next room. When I called Mr. Crockett to ask about the police report, he confirmed that he and his girlfriend had fought, but insisted he had not attacked her.\nMs. Tate-Alexander said that Mr. Crockett is dedicated to his work and she has never seen him be violent. When he told her about the charges, she put Mr. Crockett on an unpaid suspension for a week, but he is back at work until the case against him is resolved. She will be guided by what happens in court. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment in March.\nOn Dec. 30, Baton Rouge recorded its last homicide of 2023. A 20-year-old man named Dy'Lan Fillmore-Mitchell had been shot multiple times in his car. Ms. Robinson heard about it when her aunt called that morning. The brutal intimacy of concentrated violence had struck again: Mr. Fillmore-Mitchell was her aunt's grandson.\nMs. Robinson rushed to her family. A video taken at a memorial a week later captured Ms. Robinson in her community-organizing element, reminding the mourners that after they moved on, the family would still grieve. 'I'm telling y'all because I know ,' she said, tapping her chest for emphasis.\nknow ,' she said, tapping her chest for emphasis. Mr. Fillmore-Mitchell and Ms. Robinson's son Louis shared a birthday, 15 years apart. 'Gun violence has touched my family again,' she told me. 'And I put so much hard work in it, in the work, you know, for my family to be protected.'\nShe described the torment she had felt, her mind spinning, trying to fathom what more she could do.\n'I know I can't touch everybody,' she said. 'I know that. I just have to work harder.'","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Mark Obbie,Dean Majd","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/02/02/multimedia/HW-BATON-ROUGE-01-jczq/HW-BATON-ROUGE-01-jczq-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@nytimes","_score":5.752766,"_id":"c2ee91b4f04592add5bb1bfd52c0910b"},{"title":"\u2018Rust' Armorer Is Sentenced to 18 Months for Involuntary Manslaughter","author":"Julia Jacobs","published_date":"2024-04-15 18:12:56","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/15/arts/rust-sentencing-hannah-gutierrez-reed.html","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"The armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, was the first person to be held criminally responsible in a jury trial for the death of Halyna Hutchins, the movie's cinematographer.","summary":"The armorer on the film 'Rust,' who loaded a live round into a revolver that went off on the set in 2021 and killed its cinematographer, was sentenced on Monday to 18 months in prison for involuntary manslaughter.\nThe sentence was the maximum that the armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, could receive.\nIn her manslaughter trial last month, prosecutors argued that Ms. Gutierrez-Reed had been repeatedly reckless in her job of managing weapons and ammunition, directly causing the tragedy on Oct. 21, 2021, when the gun that Alec Baldwin was practicing drawing from his shoulder holster fired a live bullet, killing the cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins.\nMr. Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to an involuntary manslaughter charge.

The attorney general's office said the practice illegally drew on charitable donations, which are not supposed to be used for political activity.\nThe N.R.A., in a statement, portrayed the settlement as a victory, saying it had 'proved that all funds' taken from its foundation 'were applied exclusively in furtherance of its charitable programs and that there was no misuse' of resources.\nCharles Cotton, the N.R.A.'s president, called the lawsuit a 'political attack' and said his group had been vindicated, while the group's lead outside lawyer, William A. Brewer III, called it a 'politically motivated action.'\nBut Brian L. Schwalb, the attorney general, characterized the settlement much differently.\n'Caving to pressure from the N.R.A., the foundation diverted millions of dollars to the N.R.A. in grants and risky loans,' he said in his own statement, adding that the N.R.A. had used its foundation 'as an unchecked piggy bank.'\nThe settlement is one more legal shoe to drop for the embattled gun rights group. In February, a Manhattan jury found Wayne LaPierre, the longtime leader of the N.R.A., liable for misspending $5.4 million of the organization's money. Mr. LaPierre announced his resignation on the eve of the six-week corruption trial, which detailed his lavish personal expenses, including chartered flights for his relatives, excursions on luxury yachts and nearly $275,000 in Zegna suits.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

A cascade of right-wing chatter on social media has fueled the perception that Mr. Mellencamp brought it on himself by promoting President Biden during the show.\nBut that was not the case.\nAn audio recording provided to The New York Times by Mr. Mellencamp's representatives, and an interview with a reporter who covered the March 17 concert for The Blade in Toledo, show that the exchange started when a heckler grew frustrated with the singer's long-winded reminiscences about his late grandmother. Representatives for Mr. Mellencamp, who returned to the stage and resumed the concert that night several minutes after walking out, declined further comment.\nMr. Mellencamp is an unabashed liberal who has previously barred several Republican presidential candidates from using his songs at political events and has assailed Congress for its response to gun violence.

At the time of the threat, which he posted in an online public forum in August 2021, he was the leader of Feuerkrieg Division, a neo-Nazi hate group, prosecutors said.\nMr. Welker, 33, of San Jose, Calif., issued the threat by posting a photograph of the journalist, whom prosecutors did not identify, with an image of a gun aimed at the person's head and the words 'race traitor' plastered over the person's eyes, prosecutors said.\nThe post included the name of the journalist and the person's employer as well as the phrase 'Responsible for stalking our boys for information,' according to a criminal complaint.\nMr. Welker, who is also known as 'King ov Wrath,' also used an expletive in his threat while demanding that the reporter stop reporting on Feuerkrieg Division and wrote 'YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED,' prosecutors said.\nTwo underage members of Mr. Welker's group sent the post directly to a social media account maintained by the journalist to ensure that the journalist saw it, prosecutors said.\nMr. Welker's goal was to 'silence' the journalist so that Mr. Welker's 'fellow extremists could continue to commit violence against racial, ethnic, and religious minorities, and the LGBTQ+ community,' Breon Peace, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, said in a statement.\n'We will stand up for them and other journalists who bravely report on these violent hate groups,' Mr. Peace added.\nMichael Daniel Weil, a lawyer with the Federal Defenders of New York who is representing Mr. Welker, declined to comment.\nFeuerkreig Division, which translates to 'War Fire,' is an international extremist group that encourages its members to attack racial minorities, Jews, L.G.B.T. people, the U.S. government, journalists, and 'critical infrastructure,' prosecutors said.\nFeuerkreig Division is an offshoot of Atomwaffen, which law enforcement authorities consider among the most violent extremist groups in the country.","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lola Fadulu","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/19/multimedia/19ny-death-threats-qkfg/19ny-death-threats-qkfg-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":5.600928,"_id":"5d770499370272fe142e7b5617970265"},{"title":"A Ragtag Resistance Sees the Tide Turning in a Forgotten War","author":"Hannah Beech","published_date":"2024-04-20 04:01:39","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/20/world/asia/myanmar-war-rebels.html","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"Rebel fighters have handed Myanmar's army defeat after defeat, for the first time raising the possibility that the military junta could be at risk of collapse.","summary":"The night Ma Suu Kyi thought she would die of her wounds on the front lines of a forgotten war, a crescent moon hung overhead. A pendant of the Virgin Mary dangled around her neck. Maybe those augurs saved her. Or maybe, she said, it was not yet time for her to die.\n'When I joined the revolution, I knew my chances of surviving were 50-50,' Ms. Suu Kyi, 21, said of her decision to enlist as a rebel soldier, fighting to overthrow the junta that returned Myanmar to military dictatorship three years ago. 'I'm an ordinary girl, an ordinary young person. I believe in federal democracy and human rights.'\nMs. Suu Kyi said the words 'federal democracy' in English. There are no easy words for the concept in Burmese.\nSince the junta in Myanmar staged its coup in February 2021, ending a brief period of democratic reform and training its guns once again on peaceful protesters, much of the country has turned against the military. A new generation, which came of age during the civilian administration of the Nobel laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has taken to arms, joining rebels who have opposed military dictatorship for decades.\nThe world's gaze has remained focused on other conflicts on other continents \u2014 to the consternation of many in Myanmar who wonder why the chaos and death here brings little global outcry. Now, after three years of desperate resistance, the battle lines are changing fast. The rebels have overrun scores of military bases and taken over dozens of towns. The tempo of victory has quickened in recent days, and anti-junta forces now claim to control more than half of Myanmar's territory, from lowland jungles to the foothills of the Himalayas.\nMuch of the fighting's rhythm seems syncopated to that of another century: trenches dug into unrelenting mud, the slide of flip-flops down monsoon-soaked hills, the clatter of homemade AK-style assault rifles in dusty towns. The junta's multiple rocket launchers and fighter jets may bring a modern touch to the killing, as does the hovering of the resistance's battle drones. But this conflict, with its hand-to-hand combat and profusion of land mines, feels like a throwback to the kind of civil war that was documented in black and white.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

They ended the year in a political bind after two House members left to become mayors of suburbs, leaving that chamber with an even partisan split and making it impossible for Democrats to pass bills without Republican support.\nOn Tuesday, five months after their House majority evaporated, Democrats won two special elections to reclaim those seats and full control at the Michigan Capitol. The Associated Press said the Democrats Mai Xiong, a Macomb County commissioner, and Peter Herzberg, a Westland City Council member, defeated their Republican opponents.\nThe results of the special elections had never been in great doubt. Both districts, situated in the Detroit area, are liberal strongholds that Democratic candidates had carried by large margins in 2022. But the details of scheduling and running special elections meant a long, slow winter for Democratic lawmakers in Lansing while the House was evenly divided between the two parties. Michigan's governor, Gretchen Whitmer, is a Democrat, and her party has a majority in the State Senate.\nRepublicans hope the Democrats' renewed House majority is short-lived. Michigan, long a swing state, is expected to be a pivotal presidential battleground again this year. President Biden is working to rebuild a coalition that helped him win the state in 2020, but early polling has been favorable to former President Donald J. Trump. Republicans see an opening to deliver Michigan for Mr. Trump in November and to win control of the Michigan House, a goal that could be helped by newly redrawn legislative maps in the Detroit area. All 110 Michigan House seats are up for election in November, including the two seats that were contested on Tuesday.\nBefore losing their House majority last year, Michigan Democrats raced through a list of longstanding policy goals that had been stymied during decades of divided government or Republican control of the state. In the span of several months in 2023, Ms. Whitmer and legislative Democrats enacted new gun laws, codified civil rights for L.G.B.T.Q. people, solidified abortion rights and undid Republican laws that they said weakened labor unions.\nThose efforts slowed in November after one House member, Kevin Coleman, was elected mayor of Westland and another, Lori M. Stone, was elected mayor of Warren. Under Michigan law, Mr. Coleman and Ms. Stone had to resign from the Legislature when they became mayor.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

But the potential deal with Skydance has generated significant investor pushback.\nApollo previously reached out to Paramount about buying the company for at least $26 billion, including debt. But Paramount's board proceeded with its more advanced conversations with Skydance, amid questions about Apollo's financing. A joint bid with Sony would almost certainly reduce those concerns, adding operational experience and additional capital to Apollo's already significant war chest.\nTony Vinciquerra, the chief executive of Sony Pictures Entertainment, has held conversations in the last week with Apollo about teaming up on a bid, the people said. The bid would be an all-cash offer for the outstanding stock in Paramount, in effect taking the company private through a joint venture.\nThe terms of the joint bid are still being worked out, and it's possible that Sony and Apollo may not make an offer for Paramount, one of the people said. One structure could have Apollo take a minority stake in the joint venture, with Sony becoming the majority owner and operating the company. At some point, Apollo could cash out its investment, possibly by selling its stake back to Sony.\nIf Sony prevailed in its bid, the company would most likely operate the Paramount studio as a label within its own media empire, fusing the studio's marketing and distribution arm with its own. It remains to be seen how CBS, one of Paramount's crown jewels, would fit into the combined company along with Paramount's fading cable channels.\nNational Amusements, the company that controls Paramount, has already signed off on a potential deal with Skydance, which is controlled by David Ellison, the tech scion and Hollywood executive. National Amusements is controlled by Shari Redstone, who has appointed a special committee of independent board advisers to weigh Skydance's offer. Because Skydance's proposal would give Ms. Redstone cash and Paramount shareholders stock in a new company, several investors have objected.\nSkydance's deal for Paramount would bring expertise to Paramount, including tech and animation know-how from Mr. Ellison's management team, which includes John Lasseter, a former Pixar executive. The plan calls for operational efficiencies and for Skydance to supercharge Paramount's streaming abilities.\nThe fusion of Paramount and Sony would create a media colossus that would put a collection of TV channels and movie studios under the same corporate umbrella.

Tens of thousands of people have been killed, and millions more are displaced.\nSource: Special Advisory Council for Myanmar (SAC-M)\nThe fighting, in forests and towns across Myanmar, gets little of the international attention claimed by the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. Yet a decade ago, this nation wedged between India and China was touted as a rare example of a country peacefully transitioning from military dictatorship toward democratic rule. The army putsch ended any illusion of political progress. Myanmar has returned to a military reign of terror and the fractured reality of civil war. The lawlessness that thrives in conflict areas has radiated outward, with transnational crime networks using Myanmar as a base and exporting the products of their illicit activity worldwide.\nSoldiers from 8th Battalion of the Karenni Nationalities Defense Force, an armed insurgent group, during their graduation ceremony in Karenni State in February.\nAdam Ferguson for The New York Times\nThe short answer: The military coup was met by widespread peaceful protests. Then the junta, led by Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, quickly reverted to its old playbook: jail, terrorize, kill.\nPro-democracy forces took up arms, joining with militias that for decades had been fighting for the rights of ethnic minorities.\nThe longer answer: Myanmar has been in turmoil practically since gaining independence from British rule in 1948. Some of the world's longest-running armed conflicts have simmered in the country's borderlands, where ethnic militias are seeking autonomy or simply freedom from the Myanmar military's repression.\nA brief period of political reform, with a civilian government led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate, did not make life much better for many ethnic minorities. After her political party trounced the military-linked party in Myanmar's 2020 elections, a junta grabbed full control of the country again.\nA common goal of overthrowing the junta has led to unity between pro-democracy militias and armed ethnic groups. Together, these resistance forces have claimed significant territory from the Myanmar military. On April 11, they captured a key border town from the junta's forces, their biggest victory yet.\nHundreds of pro-democracy militias, ethnic armies and local defense forces. The sheer diversity of resistance groups battling the junta makes Myanmar the most fractured country on Earth, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, which tracks 50 high-level conflicts worldwide. Complicating matters, some of the rebel groups fight one another, too.\nMore than 20 militias representing various ethnic minorities have been fighting for autonomy for decades. Some of these insurgent groups control territory in Myanmar's resource-rich periphery.\nWhen ousted politicians and democracy advocates fled arrest after the coup, they found sanctuary in these ethnic rebel-held areas and formed a shadow authority called the National Unity Government.\nTens of thousands of young people \u2014 among them doctors, actors, lawyers, teachers, models, Buddhist monks, D.J.s and engineers \u2014 escaped from the junta-held cities and formed more than 200 People's Defense Forces, pledging allegiance to the shadow government.\nOften trained by the ethnic militias, the P.D.F. is now fighting in more than 100 townships across the country.\nSource: Myanmar Peace Monitor\nSince an alliance of three ethnic armies, backed by the P.D.F., began an offensive on Oct. 27, the resistance has gained significant ground. Rebels now control much of Myanmar's border region, including a strategic trading town that was captured on April 11. A few days later, they fired rockets at the nation's top military academy. Some of the fighting is taking place within striking distance of Naypyidaw, the bunkered capital that the generals built early this century.\nThis year could be a turning point in Myanmar's war, military analysts say. With each week, the junta's forces abandon more outposts. Myanmar's military is overstretched and underprovisioned. Even at the best of times, its biggest asset has been numbers, not expertise. In February, the military brought in a draft, signaling its desperation for fresh recruits.\nResistance soldiers riding in the back of a pickup truck in southern Karenni State in January.\nAdam Ferguson for The New York Times\nThe Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project says that the war in Myanmar is the most violent of the 50 conflicts it tracks. Since the coup, at least 50,000 people have been killed there, including at least 8,000 civilians, the group says.\nNote: Data as of March 15\nSource: The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project\nMore than 26,500 people have been detained for opposing the junta, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma), a rights group.\nMyanmar's military has bombarded the country with airstrikes on over 900 days since the coup, according to the Myanmar Peace Monitor, an exile group that tracks the war. Since the rebels' October offensive, there has been a fivefold increase in aerial bombardment, according to Tom Andrews, the United Nations Special Rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar.\nBy the end of last year, more than 2.6 million people had been driven from their homes in a country of about 55 million, according to the United Nations human rights office. Nearly 600,000 of those internally displaced people fled after the fighting intensified in October. More than 18 million people are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations, which says that a million had required such aid before the coup.\nSource: Myanmar Peace Monitor\nNote: Data as of April 2\nUnited Nations investigators say that the junta's forces should be investigated for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and they cite reports of organized sexual violence, village burnings and the indiscriminate use of landmines. Such abuses predate the coup. In 2017, the military conducted what the United States says was a genocidal campaign against the Rohingya Muslim minority.\nMyanmar is an extraordinarily diverse nation whose borders were shaped by British imperialism rather than ethnic boundaries. Officially, 135 ethnic groups live in the country, and practically the only thing they agree on is that this figure is wrong.\nNote: The Karenni are also known as the Kayah, the Karen as the Kayin, the Rakhine as the Arakan, and the Ta'ang as the Palaung.\nSource: General Administration Department, Myanmar\nSome ethnic minorities have more in common with people in China, India and Thailand than with the Bamar, Myanmar's largest ethnicity. Others come from princely states that were not under the full authority of a central administration until the middle of the last century. Still others, such as over a million Rohingya, have been rendered stateless because the military refuses to recognize them as rightful inhabitants of the country.\nWhat Myanmar's ethnic minorities, particularly non-Buddhist ones, share is a long record of persecution by the military.\nMyanmar's ethnic diversity is concentrated in the foothills of the Himalayas and the forested border regions that cradle the delta and lowlands through which the Irrawaddy River flows.\nIt's both.\nIn 1948, the Union of Burma declared independence from British rule. In the Burmese language, the root of the words Burma and Myanmar are the same. In 1989, a year after the violent crushing of a pro-democracy movement, a junta renamed the country internationally as Myanmar, the name by which it is known locally. The generals argued that Myanmar was a more inclusive name, because it was not so explicitly linked to the nation's Bamar ethnic majority.\nNevertheless, the pro-democracy front, led by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, tended to refer to the country as Burma to show opposition to the military regime. Ethnic minority groups often called the country Burma when speaking English. The United States still officially calls the country Burma, but most foreign governments use Myanmar. After the 2021 coup, some exiled politicians and other pro-democracy activists who once called it Myanmar switched to Burma with an international audience.\nMost people, however, still refer to Myanmar.\nThere is no commonly accepted word for the inhabitants of the country. Some refer to the Burmese of Myanmar, which seems a usage at cross-purposes. In Myanmar, the citizens are generally referred to as Myanmar, the word serving as both a nation and a nationality.\nThree years after the coup, the center of Myanmar remains mostly under junta control, but the rest of the country is a kaleidoscopic array of competing influences, fiefs, democratic havens and drug-lord hideouts. Ethnic armed groups govern some areas. Administrators aligned with the National Unity Government have set up schools and clinics in others. No one is in charge in still other parts of the country, leaving residents lacking basic services and vulnerable to life in the margins.\nA soldier from the Pa-O National Liberation Army was treated at a secret hospital in Karenni State in January.\nAdam Ferguson for The New York Times\nThe junta forces' widespread use of landmines has made parts of Myanmar off limits. Within areas under the regime's control, more than 100,000 civil servants refuse to turn up for work as part of a long-running civil disobedience campaign. Many of Myanmar's most educated people are in exile or living in the jungles. Others are in prison.\nThe military is still the country's largest and most influential institution, and a militarized culture pervades many areas that ethnic minorities control. The question is whether the Myanmar military will jettison Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, its supreme commander, if he is judged to be an impediment to the armed forces' survival \u2014 Myanmar's history is filled with military men being pushed aside for other military men. With more and more of its soldiers dying, the military is facing an existential threat.\nIt's possible that a junta, perhaps not even the current one but a new coterie, will try to negotiate cease-fires with the many armed groups arrayed against it. But given the Myanmar military's history of turning its guns against its own people, trust will be difficult to find.\nThe future of Myanmar will likely remain fractured, with no single authority in charge. Such a splintered state is likely to breed more chaos that will not be contained by national borders. Myanmar is again the world's top opium producer, displacing Afghanistan. Some ethnic armed groups survive by churning out methamphetamine and other synthetic drugs. And the country is at the center of a cyber-scam industry that steals billions of dollars from unsuspecting people and kidnaps others to forcibly work the cons.","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Hannah Beech,Weiyi Cai","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/16/multimedia/2024-03-14-myanmar-explained-index/2024-03-14-myanmar-explained-index-facebookJumbo-v4.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@nytimes","_score":3.2215219,"_id":"687de3312a1baac378c6c1cdf73752a4"},{"title":"What does the law at issue in the case actually say?","author":"Adam Liptak","published_date":"2024-04-16 14:12:28","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/16/us/supreme-court-jan-6/what-does-the-law-at-issue-in-the-case-actually-say","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"Skip to contentSkip to site indexThe Supreme Court is hearing arguments on Tuesday in a case that could eliminate some of the fed","summary":"Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The Supreme Court is hearing arguments on Tuesday in a case that could eliminate some of the federal charges against former President Donald J. Trump in the case accusing him of plotting to subvert the 2020 election and could disrupt the prosecutions of hundreds of rioters involved in the Capitol attack. The question for the justices is whether a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, enacted in the wake of the collapse of the energy giant Enron, covers the conduct of a former police officer, Joseph W. Fischer, who participated in the Capitol assault, on Jan. 6, 2021. The law figures in two of the federal charges against Mr. Trump in his election subversion case and more than 350 people who stormed the Capitol have been prosecuted under it. If the Supreme Court sides with Mr. Fischer and says the statute does not cover what he is accused of having done, Mr. Trump is almost certain to contend that it does not apply to his conduct, either. The law, signed in 2002, was prompted by accounting fraud and the destruction of documents, but the provision is written in broad terms. At least part of what the law meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code: It was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The law sought to close that gap. It did that in a two-part provision. The first part makes it a crime to corruptly alter, destroy or conceal evidence to frustrate official proceedings. The second part, at issue in Mr. Fischer's case, makes it a crime 'otherwise' to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding. Here's what else to know: The dense semantics being argued circle an important question: whether this statute \u2014 devised to curb things like destroying documents \u2014 requires specific proof that records were actually tampered with. It also raises another critical question: whether document tampering has anything to do with pro-Trump rioters breaking into the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The heart of the case is at the pivot from the first part of the provision to the second. The ordinary meaning of 'otherwise,' prosecutors say, is 'in a different manner.' That means, they say, that the obstruction of official proceedings need not involve the destruction of evidence. The second part, they say, is broad catchall applying to all sorts of conduct. Mr. Fischer's lawyers counter that the first part of the provision must inform and limit the second one \u2014 to obstruction linked to the destruction of evidence. They would read 'otherwise,' in other words, as 'similarly.' The case is one of several affecting or involving Mr. Trump on the court's docket. In a separate case to be argued next week, the justices will consider Mr. Trump's claim that he is totally immune from prosecution.\nMr. Fischer is accused of entering the Capitol around 3:24 p.m. on Jan. 6, 2021, with the counting of electoral ballots having been suspended after the initial assault. Before his trip to Washington, prosecutors said he told a superior in a text message, that 'it might get violent.' In another, he wrote that 'they should storm the capital and drag all the democrates into the street and have a mob trial.' Prosecutors say that videos showed Mr. Fischer yelling 'Charge!' before pushing through the crowd, using a vulgar term to berate police officers and crashing into a line of them.\nMr. Fischer's lawyers dispute some of this. But the question for the justices is legal, not factual: Does the 2002 law cover what Mr. Fischer is accused of? That may turn in part on the meaning of another term in the law \u2014 its requirement that the defendant acted 'corruptly.' The meaning of that word is disputed. Alan Feuer contributed reporting.

The Supreme Court in Washington. Credit... Kent Nishimura for The New York Times The provision at issue in the case, from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has two parts. The question for the justices is how they interact. And that depends on the word that links them: 'otherwise.' The first part of the provision focuses on evidence, saying that anyone who corruptly 'alters, destroys, mutilates or conceals a record, document or other object' to affect an official proceeding is guilty of a felony. So far, so good. It is uncontroversial to reinforce that destroying documents to impede an investigation has been a core purpose of the law, which was prompted by the shredding of documents in an accounting scandal. The second part of the provision makes it a crime 'otherwise' to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding. Prosecutors say the defendant in the case, Joseph W. Fischer, did that by joining the mob that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The heart of the case is how the first part of the provision pivots to the second part. The ordinary meaning of 'otherwise,' prosecutors say, is 'in a different manner.' That means, they say, that the obstruction of official proceedings need not involve the destruction of evidence. The second part, they say, is a broad catchall for any kind of corrupt interference with an official proceeding. Lawyers for Mr. Fischer, the defendant in Tuesday's case, counter that the first part must inform and limit the second one \u2014 meaning that the obstruction of official proceedings must be linked to the destruction of evidence. They would read 'otherwise' as 'similarly.' The alternative, they say, would be to create a crime of breathtaking scope that would allow prosecutors to charge political protesters and others with felonies carrying 20-year prison sentences. In 2008, in Begay v. United States, the court considered a law with a broadly similar structure, the Armed Career Criminal Act, which requires mandatory sentences for people convicted of possessing firearms if they have earlier been found guilty of three violent felonies. In one clause, it listed specific crimes that qualified as violent felonies \u2014 including burglary, arson and extortion. Then, as in the new case, there followed an 'otherwise' clause, this one adding any crime that 'otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.' The Supreme Court ruled that the examples informed and limited the sweep of the 'otherwise' clause. If Congress had 'meant the statute to be all-encompassing, it is hard to see why it would have needed to include the examples at all,' Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for the majority. A drunken driving offense, the court ruled, did not qualify as one of the covered crimes even though the plain words of the clause would seem to encompass it. Mr. Fisher's lawyers say that the 'otherwise' clause in the obstruction statute must also be anchored in the preceding clause. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed, with Judge Florence Y. Pan writing that the two uses of 'otherwise' were different. The gun law, she wrote, 'includes a list of examples followed by \u2018otherwise' in a single, unbroken sentence.' By contrast, she wrote, the 'otherwise' in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 'sits within a separately numbered subparagraph, after a semicolon and line break, all of which put distance between it and the lists of verbs and objects' in the previous part. In dissent, Judge Gregory G. Katsas wrote that 'the relationship created by the word otherwise does not depend on punctuation or line breaks.' Rather, he wrote, 'it flows from the connotation of similarity,' among other factors. That meant, he concluded, that the second part of the provision applies 'only to acts that affect the integrity or availability of evidence.'

Kenny Holston/The New York Times At its core, the case is about the meaning of a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. It was enacted following the collapse of Enron, a giant energy company, after the exposure of widespread accounting fraud and the destruction of documents by the company's outside auditor. There is an uneasy fit between the immediate purpose of the law and its recent use in more than 300 prosecutions arising from the violent riot that forced a halt to the constitutionally required congressional count of presidential electors' ballots. At least part of what it meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code at the time: It was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The law meant to close that gap. It did, in a two-part provision, Section 1512(c) of the federal criminal code: (c) Whoever corruptly \u2014 (1) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object , or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding or (2) otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding , or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. The first part focuses on evidence, making it a felony to tamper with it to affect an official proceeding. The second part makes it a crime 'otherwise' to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding. The heart of this case is the pivot from the first part to the second part. The ordinary meaning of 'otherwise,' prosecutors say, is 'in a different manner.' That means, they say, that the obstruction of official proceedings need not involve the destruction of evidence \u2014 in their view, making the second part a broad catchall for any kind of corrupt interference with an official proceeding. The lawyers for Joseph W. Fischer, who was accused of breaching the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and of assaulting police officers, counter that the first part must inform and limit the second one \u2014 meaning that the obstruction of official proceedings must be linked to the destruction of evidence. They would read 'otherwise' as 'similarly.' The alternative, they say, would be to create a felony of breathtaking scope that would allow prosecutors to charge political protesters with felonies carrying 20-year prison sentences. April 16, 2024, 10:11 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 10:11 a.m. ET Two lawyers will argue: Jeffrey T. Green for the defendant and Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar for the government. They will each face 30 minutes of free-for-all questions followed by a round of one-by-one questions from the justices in order of seniority. Two of the four criminal counts former President Donald J. Trump is facing in that case are based on the obstruction law. Credit... Michelle Gustafson for The New York Times While the Supreme Court's hearing is intended to determine the scope and validity of an obstruction law used against hundreds of rioters who broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6, any decision could also have an impact on a separate criminal case: one in which former President Donald J. Trump has been accused of plotting to overturn the 2020 election. Two of the four criminal counts Mr. Trump is facing in that case are based on the obstruction law. In an indictment filed in Washington last summer, he was charged with conspiring to obstruct the certification of the election on Jan. 6 during a joint session of Congress at the Capitol as well as with actually obstructing it. If the justices determine that prosecutors improperly used the obstruction law against members of the pro-Trump mob who disrupted the session, Mr. Trump's lawyers will surely seek to have the charges against him dismissed as well. In fact, they already tried that in October. They argued unsuccessfully to the trial judge in the case that Mr. Trump's indictment unfairly used the statute, which was initially 'directed at the destruction of records in accounting fraud,' by applying it 'to disputing the outcome of a presidential election.' 'This stretches the statutory language beyond any plausible mooring to its text,' the lawyers wrote. Jack Smith, the special counsel handling Mr. Trump's case, has told the Supreme Court that the two obstruction counts against the former president would be still valid even if the justices narrowed the law to cover only crimes that involved tampering with documents or records. Mr. Trump triggered that provision of the law, Mr. Smith has said, by plotting to create fake slates of electors that claimed he won in several keys swing states that he actually lost to President Biden. Mr. Smith has accused Mr. Trump of trying to use those fake slates to throw the certification proceeding into chaos and by urging his vice president, Mike Pence, to capitalize on the confusion by single-handedly declaring him the winner of the race. Even if the obstruction count were ultimately removed from Trump's indictment, it would probably not be a fatal blow. The indictment contains two other conspiracy counts that overlap almost entirely with the accusations in the obstruction counts. One of the conspiracy charges accuses Mr. Trump of committing fraud by using deceit to subvert the normal course of the election. The other charges him with plotting to deprive millions of Americans of the right to have votes properly counted.  April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET A little backstory on why prosecutors opted to charge so many defendants with obstruction: Michael Sherwin, the U.S. attorney in Washington who initially led the Jan. 6 prosecution, promised 'shock and awe' in charging as many people as possible. But using overtly political crimes like insurrection or seditious conspiracy turned out not to be legally feasible. The government settled on using the obstruction count to describe how the election's certification proceeding was disrupted by defendants who went beyond mere trespass or assault. April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET Prosecutors tried to set general rules for who was charged with the obstruction count. It was often used if a defendant actually entered the Senate chamber or made their way into congressional offices. It was also used if there was evidence that a defendant's behavior had some sort of role in chasing lawmakers away from their sworn duties to certify the election on Jan. 6. April 16, 2024, 9:54 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:54 a.m. ET Of course, one of the biggest attractions of this obstruction count to prosecutors is that it carries a hefty 20-year maximum sentence. No defendant has been sentenced to that maximum yet, but the stiff penalty likely has some sort of deterrent effect on others. April 16, 2024, 9:48 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:48 a.m. ET The argument is likely to be focused on the text and purpose of the obstruction law at issue in the case. Expect close examination, for instance, of the meaning of the word 'otherwise.' More than 1,380 people had been charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol as of early this month, according to the Justice Department. Credit... Hailey Sadler for The New York Times The investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack is already the largest criminal inquiry in Justice Department history, federal prosecutors have said. And even after more than three years, it has shown little sign of slowing down. Every week, a few more rioters are arrested and charges against them are unsealed in Federal District Court in Washington. Prosecutors have suggested that a total of 2,000 or 2,500 people could ultimately face indictment for their roles in the attack. More than 1,380 people had been charged in connection with the attack as of early this month, according to the Justice Department. Among the most common charges brought against them are two misdemeanors: illegal parading inside the Capitol and entering and remaining in a restricted federal area, a type of trespassing. About 350 rioters have been accused of violating the obstruction statute that the Supreme Court is considering at its hearing, and nearly 500 people have been charged with assaulting police officers. Many rioters have been charged with multiple crimes, the most serious of which so far has been seditious conspiracy. Almost 800 defendants have already pleaded guilty; about 250 of them have done so to felony charges. Prosecutors have won the vast majority of the cases that have gone to trial: More than 150 defendants have been convicted at trial and only two have been fully acquitted. More than 850 people have been sentenced so far, and about 520 have received at least some time in prison. The stiffest penalties have been handed down to the former leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, far-right extremist groups that played central roles in the Capitol attack. Enrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader, was sentenced to 22 years in prison, and Stewart Rhodes, who once led the Oath Keepers, was given an 18-year term.  April 16, 2024, 9:36 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:36 a.m. ET All along the defense lawyers have claimed that federal prosecutors stretched the statute in an unprecedented way to fit the central crime that took place at the Capitol on Jan. 6: the disruption of the certification of the election. Then again, nothing like the storming of the Capitol had ever happened before. So perhaps it's no surprise that prosecutors use the obstruction law in a novel manner. April 16, 2024, 9:31 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:31 a.m. ET It's worth remembering as today's hearing is poised to get underway that lawyers defending Jan. 6 rioters have been questioning the government's use of this particular obstruction law from the very outset of criminal cases being filed by the Justice Department. It's taken three years, but now the issue has finally reached the Supreme Court. April 16, 2024, 9:26 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:26 a.m. ET The argument will not start promptly at 10:00 a.m. The court has said it will issue one or more decisions first. They will be announced from the bench but will not be broadcast. A mob walked to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times The man whose case led to the Supreme Court hearing on a controversial federal obstruction law is a former police officer from rural Pennsylvania indicted on charges of storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and crashing into a line of his fellow officers defending the building. Joseph W. Fischer was working for the police department in North Cornwall Township, Pa., when prosecutors say he pushed his way into the Capitol while holding up his cellphone to take videos of the surge. Once inside, he and another rioter 'galloped forward,' prosecutors say, making contact with a line of officers who were fighting off the crowd. Mr. Fischer fell to the ground and, as some nearby officers helped him to his feet, he tried to engage with them, prosecutors say. 'I'm a cop too,' he said, 'sometimes the country is worth more than your job.' According to court papers, Mr. Fischer was concerned about his own job before making the trip to Washington. Investigators unearthed text messages he wrote to the chief of his department, saying that things could get 'violent' on Jan. 6 and that the crowd should 'storm the capital and drag all the democrates.' He also warned the chief that he might need him to post his bail, the papers said. Township officials suspended Mr. Fischer without pay on the day of his arrest in February 2021 and later fired him. But he has pushed back against the government's description of behavior on Jan. 6. His lawyers say that he and a companion were prepared to leave Washington that day after listening President Trump's speech near the White House and turned around to head toward the Capitol only after hearing about the mounting protest there. The lawyers also claim that Mr. Fischer arrived at the Capitol grounds well after Congress had recessed the proceeding to certify the results of the 2020 election because of the attack. 'As Mr. Fischer walked toward the east side of the building, no barricades or fences impeded him,' the lawyers wrote in their brief to the Supreme Court. Mr. Fischer has disputed the assertion by prosecutors that he charged the police line inside the Capitol, telling the court instead that he was pushed into the officers by 'the weight of the crowd.' He also characterized his interactions with the officers differently than prosecutors did, claiming that he merely talked with one of the officers and patted him on the shoulder.  The Supreme Court has said that the purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was 'to safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron.' Credit...The provision at issue in the case is part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a 2002 law enacted after the collapse of Enron, a giant energy company, after the exposure of widespread accounting fraud and the destruction of documents by its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen. The Supreme Court has said that the purpose of the law was 'to safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets following the collapse of Enron.' At least part of what the law meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code: it was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was meant to close that gap. Lawyers for Joseph W. Fischer, charged under the law with obstructing an official proceeding by joining the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, said his case had an Alice-in-Wonderland quality. 'The Through the Looking Glass moment here,' they wrote in a Supreme Court brief, 'would be for those who wrote the Sarbanes-Oxley Act upon learning that they had created a new and breathtaking obstruction offense by endeavoring to close the narrow Enron-Arthur Anderson loophole.' Indeed, in a different case on the scope of the statute, one of the sponsors of the law, Michael Oxley, filed a supporting brief saying prosecutors had interpreted it too broadly. The law meant to address 'specific loopholes' that Arthur Andersen 'had exploited when they shredded business documents and destroyed hard drives in anticipation of federal law-enforcement action,' wrote Mr. Oxley, a former Ohio representative who died in 2016. In that case, concerning a separate provision of the law, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the law's origins informed its meaning and spared the defendant. 'The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, all agree, was prompted by the exposure of Enron's massive accounting fraud and revelations that the company's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen, had systematically destroyed potentially incriminating documents,' she wrote for four of the justices in the majority. She added that the government had acknowledged that the provision 'was intended to prohibit, in particular, corporate document-shredding to hide evidence of financial wrongdoing.'

Erin Schaff/The New York Times The Supreme Court's decision to consider the soundness of an obstruction law that has been widely used against those who took part in the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, is already having an effect on some of the rioters. A small group of people convicted under the law have been released from custody \u2014 or will soon go free \u2014 even though the justices hearing arguments on Tuesday are not expected to decide the case for months. Over the past several weeks, federal judges in Washington have agreed to release about 10 defendants who were serving prison terms because of the obstruction law, saying the defendants could wait at home as the court determined whether the law should have been used at all to keep them locked up. Among those already free is Matthew Bledsoe, the owner of a moving company from Tennessee who scaled a wall outside the Capitol and then paraded through the building with a Trump flag, ultimately planting it in the arm of a statue of President Gerald R. Ford. Soon to be released are defendants like Kevin Seefried, a drywall installer from Delaware who carried a Confederate flag through the Capitol, and Alexander Sheppard, an Ohio man who overran police lines to become one of the first people to break into the building. The interrupted sentences \u2014 which could be reinstated depending on how the Supreme Court rules \u2014 are just one of the complications to have emerged from the court's review of the obstruction statute, known in the penal code as 18 U.S.C. 1512. The charge has been used so far against more than 350 rioters, including Jacob Chansley, the so-called QAnon Shaman, and members of the far-right extremist groups the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. When the justices announced in December that they planned to scrutinize the law, many legal experts expressed concern that a ruling narrowing its scope or striking down its use in Jan. 6-related cases could deliver a devastating blow to the Justice Department's efforts to hold hundreds of rioters accountable. Federal prosecutors have often used the obstruction count in lieu of more politically fraught charges like seditious conspiracy to punish the central event of Jan. 6: the disruption of a proceeding at the Capitol to certify the election. But in the past few months, judges and prosecutors working on Capitol riot cases have quietly adjusted to the potential threat from a Supreme Court ruling, and the risk that there could be catastrophic consequences to the cases overall no longer seems as grave. For one thing, there are currently no defendants facing only the obstruction charge, according to the Justice Department. Every rioter indicted on that count has also been charged with other crimes, meaning that even if the obstruction law is removed as a tool of the Jan. 6 prosecutions, there would not be any cases that would disappear entirely. Indeed, if the court rules that the obstruction count does not apply to the Capitol attack, the main effect of the decision would be on the sentences defendants face. The obstruction law carries a hefty maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and while few, if any, rioters have gotten that much, the statute has routinely resulted in terms of several years. But some judges have already signaled they would increase the sentences stemming from other charges if the obstruction count was not available to them. In February, for example, Judge Royce C. Lamberth denied an early release to an Iowa man named Leo Kelly, who was sentenced to 30 months in prison on the obstruction count and six other misdemeanors. Judge Lamberth's reason for not setting Mr. Kelly free? Even if the Supreme Court ruled he was not permitted to sentence Mr. Kelly for obstruction, Judge Lamberth said he could increase the defendant's total time in prison by imposing consecutive, not concurrent, terms on the misdemeanor charges.  \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe Supreme Court is hearing arguments on Tuesday in a case that could eliminate some of the federal charges against former President Donald J. Trump in the case accusing him of plotting to subvert the 2020 election and could disrupt the prosecutions of hundreds of rioters involved in the Capitol attack.\nThe question for the justices is whether a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, enacted in the wake of the collapse of the energy giant Enron, covers the conduct of a former police officer, Joseph W. Fischer, who participated in the Capitol assault, on Jan. 6, 2021.\nThe law figures in two of the federal charges against Mr. Trump in his election subversion case and more than 350 people who stormed the Capitol have been prosecuted under it. If the Supreme Court sides with Mr. Fischer and says the statute does not cover what he is accused of having done, Mr. Trump is almost certain to contend that it does not apply to his conduct, either.\nThe law, signed in 2002, was prompted by accounting fraud and the destruction of documents, but the provision is written in broad terms.\nAt least part of what the law meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code: It was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself. The law sought to close that gap.\nIt did that in a two-part provision. The first part makes it a crime to corruptly alter, destroy or conceal evidence to frustrate official proceedings. The second part, at issue in Mr. Fischer's case, makes it a crime 'otherwise' to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding.\nHere's what else to know:\nThe dense semantics being argued circle an important question: whether this statute \u2014 devised to curb things like destroying documents \u2014 requires specific proof that records were actually tampered with. It also raises another critical question: whether document tampering has anything to do with pro-Trump rioters breaking into the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\nThe heart of the case is at the pivot from the first part of the provision to the second. The ordinary meaning of 'otherwise,' prosecutors say, is 'in a different manner.' That means, they say, that the obstruction of official proceedings need not involve the destruction of evidence. The second part, they say, is broad catchall applying to all sorts of conduct. Mr. Fischer's lawyers counter that the first part of the provision must inform and limit the second one \u2014 to obstruction linked to the destruction of evidence. They would read 'otherwise,' in other words, as 'similarly.'\nThe case is one of several affecting or involving Mr. Trump on the court's docket. In a separate case to be argued next week, the justices will consider Mr. Trump's claim that he is totally immune from prosecution.\nMr. Fischer is accused of entering the Capitol around 3:24 p.m. on Jan. 6, 2021, with the counting of electoral ballots having been suspended after the initial assault. Before his trip to Washington, prosecutors said he told a superior in a text message, that 'it might get violent.' In another, he wrote that 'they should storm the capital and drag all the democrates into the street and have a mob trial.' Prosecutors say that videos showed Mr. Fischer yelling 'Charge!' before pushing through the crowd, using a vulgar term to berate police officers and crashing into a line of them.\nMr. Fischer's lawyers dispute some of this. But the question for the justices is legal, not factual: Does the 2002 law cover what Mr. Fischer is accused of? That may turn in part on the meaning of another term in the law \u2014 its requirement that the defendant acted 'corruptly.' The meaning of that word is disputed.\nAlan Feuer contributed reporting.\nApril 16, 2024, 10:23 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 10:23 a.m. ET The dense semantics being argued here are circling an important question: whether this statute \u2014 designed to curb things like destroying documents \u2014 requires specific proof that records were actually tampered with.

Credit... Kent Nishimura for The New York Times The provision at issue in the case, from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has two parts. The question for the justices is how they interact. And that depends on the word that links them: 'otherwise.'\nThe first part of the provision focuses on evidence, saying that anyone who corruptly 'alters, destroys, mutilates or conceals a record, document or other object' to affect an official proceeding is guilty of a felony.\nSo far, so good. It is uncontroversial to reinforce that destroying documents to impede an investigation has been a core purpose of the law, which was prompted by the shredding of documents in an accounting scandal.\nThe second part of the provision makes it a crime 'otherwise' to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding. Prosecutors say the defendant in the case, Joseph W. Fischer, did that by joining the mob that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\nThe heart of the case is how the first part of the provision pivots to the second part.\nThe ordinary meaning of 'otherwise,' prosecutors say, is 'in a different manner.' That means, they say, that the obstruction of official proceedings need not involve the destruction of evidence. The second part, they say, is a broad catchall for any kind of corrupt interference with an official proceeding.\nLawyers for Mr. Fischer, the defendant in Tuesday's case, counter that the first part must inform and limit the second one \u2014 meaning that the obstruction of official proceedings must be linked to the destruction of evidence. They would read 'otherwise' as 'similarly.'\nThe alternative, they say, would be to create a crime of breathtaking scope that would allow prosecutors to charge political protesters and others with felonies carrying 20-year prison sentences.\nIn 2008, in Begay v. United States, the court considered a law with a broadly similar structure, the Armed Career Criminal Act, which requires mandatory sentences for people convicted of possessing firearms if they have earlier been found guilty of three violent felonies. In one clause, it listed specific crimes that qualified as violent felonies \u2014 including burglary, arson and extortion.\nThen, as in the new case, there followed an 'otherwise' clause, this one adding any crime that 'otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.'\nThe Supreme Court ruled that the examples informed and limited the sweep of the 'otherwise' clause. If Congress had 'meant the statute to be all-encompassing, it is hard to see why it would have needed to include the examples at all,' Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for the majority.\nA drunken driving offense, the court ruled, did not qualify as one of the covered crimes even though the plain words of the clause would seem to encompass it.\nMr. Fisher's lawyers say that the 'otherwise' clause in the obstruction statute must also be anchored in the preceding clause.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed, with Judge Florence Y. Pan writing that the two uses of 'otherwise' were different. The gun law, she wrote, 'includes a list of examples followed by \u2018otherwise' in a single, unbroken sentence.'\nBy contrast, she wrote, the 'otherwise' in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 'sits within a separately numbered subparagraph, after a semicolon and line break, all of which put distance between it and the lists of verbs and objects' in the previous part.\nIn dissent, Judge Gregory G. Katsas wrote that 'the relationship created by the word otherwise does not depend on punctuation or line breaks.'\notherwise does not depend on punctuation or line breaks.' Rather, he wrote, 'it flows from the connotation of similarity,' among other factors. That meant, he concluded, that the second part of the provision applies 'only to acts that affect the integrity or availability of evidence.'\nApril 16, 2024, 10:13 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 10:13 a.m. ET Justice Clarence Thomas asked the first question, in keeping with the court's practice since the pandemic.

Kenny Holston/The New York Times At its core, the case is about the meaning of a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. It was enacted following the collapse of Enron, a giant energy company, after the exposure of widespread accounting fraud and the destruction of documents by the company's outside auditor.\nThere is an uneasy fit between the immediate purpose of the law and its recent use in more than 300 prosecutions arising from the violent riot that forced a halt to the constitutionally required congressional count of presidential electors' ballots.\nAt least part of what it meant to accomplish was to address a gap in the federal criminal code at the time: It was a crime to persuade others to destroy records relevant to an investigation or official proceeding but not to do so oneself.\nThe law meant to close that gap. It did, in a two-part provision, Section 1512(c) of the federal criminal code:\n(c) Whoever corruptly \u2014\n\u2014 (1) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object , or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding\n, or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding or (2) otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding , or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.\n, or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. The first part focuses on evidence, making it a felony to tamper with it to affect an official proceeding. The second part makes it a crime 'otherwise' to corruptly obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding.\nThe heart of this case is the pivot from the first part to the second part. The ordinary meaning of 'otherwise,' prosecutors say, is 'in a different manner.'

Michelle Gustafson for The New York Times While the Supreme Court's hearing is intended to determine the scope and validity of an obstruction law used against hundreds of rioters who broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6, any decision could also have an impact on a separate criminal case: one in which former President Donald J. Trump has been accused of plotting to overturn the 2020 election.\nTwo of the four criminal counts Mr. Trump is facing in that case are based on the obstruction law. In an indictment filed in Washington last summer, he was charged with conspiring to obstruct the certification of the election on Jan. 6 during a joint session of Congress at the Capitol as well as with actually obstructing it.\nIf the justices determine that prosecutors improperly used the obstruction law against members of the pro-Trump mob who disrupted the session, Mr. Trump's lawyers will surely seek to have the charges against him dismissed as well. In fact, they already tried that in October. They argued unsuccessfully to the trial judge in the case that Mr. Trump's indictment unfairly used the statute, which was initially 'directed at the destruction of records in accounting fraud,' by applying it 'to disputing the outcome of a presidential election.'\n'This stretches the statutory language beyond any plausible mooring to its text,' the lawyers wrote.\nJack Smith, the special counsel handling Mr. Trump's case, has told the Supreme Court that the two obstruction counts against the former president would be still valid even if the justices narrowed the law to cover only crimes that involved tampering with documents or records.\nMr. Trump triggered that provision of the law, Mr. Smith has said, by plotting to create fake slates of electors that claimed he won in several keys swing states that he actually lost to President Biden. Mr. Smith has accused Mr. Trump of trying to use those fake slates to throw the certification proceeding into chaos and by urging his vice president, Mike Pence, to capitalize on the confusion by single-handedly declaring him the winner of the race.\nEven if the obstruction count were ultimately removed from Trump's indictment, it would probably not be a fatal blow.\nThe indictment contains two other conspiracy counts that overlap almost entirely with the accusations in the obstruction counts. One of the conspiracy charges accuses Mr. Trump of committing fraud by using deceit to subvert the normal course of the election. The other charges him with plotting to deprive millions of Americans of the right to have votes properly counted.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 9:53 a.m. ET A little backstory on why prosecutors opted to charge so many defendants with obstruction: Michael Sherwin, the U.S. attorney in Washington who initially led the Jan. 6 prosecution, promised 'shock and awe' in charging as many people as possible.

Investigators unearthed text messages he wrote to the chief of his department, saying that things could get 'violent' on Jan. 6 and that the crowd should 'storm the capital and drag all the democrates.'\nHe also warned the chief that he might need him to post his bail, the papers said.\nTownship officials suspended Mr. Fischer without pay on the day of his arrest in February 2021 and later fired him.

Every rioter indicted on that count has also been charged with other crimes, meaning that even if the obstruction law is removed as a tool of the Jan. 6 prosecutions, there would not be any cases that would disappear entirely.\nIndeed, if the court rules that the obstruction count does not apply to the Capitol attack, the main effect of the decision would be on the sentences defendants face. The obstruction law carries a hefty maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and while few, if any, rioters have gotten that much, the statute has routinely resulted in terms of several years.\nBut some judges have already signaled they would increase the sentences stemming from other charges if the obstruction count was not available to them.\nIn February, for example, Judge Royce C. Lamberth denied an early release to an Iowa man named Leo Kelly, who was sentenced to 30 months in prison on the obstruction count and six other misdemeanors.\nJudge Lamberth's reason for not setting Mr. Kelly free?\nEven if the Supreme Court ruled he was not permitted to sentence Mr. Kelly for obstruction, Judge Lamberth said he could increase the defendant's total time in prison by imposing consecutive, not concurrent, terms on the misdemeanor charges.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Adam Liptak","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/16/multimedia/16scotus-obstruction-obstruction-law-zvhq/16scotus-obstruction-obstruction-law-zvhq-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":2.0957322,"_id":"5be306034a019d7118aa996c56139adc"},{"title":"The opening arguments gave a preview of how the two sides will present the case.","author":"Jonah E.

Trump engaged in a conspiracy to cover up a sex scandal in order to get elected president in 2016. The first witness called was the tabloid publisher David Pecker, whom prosecutors described as one member of a three-man plot to conceal damaging stories \u2014 including a porn star's account of a sexual tryst \u2014 as Mr. Trump mounted his bid for the presidency. Mr. Pecker was on the stand for only a few minutes in the afternoon before court adjourned for the day. He described how his publication, The National Enquirer, paid for stories, a practice he called 'checkbook journalism.' He is expected to return to the stand on Tuesday. Matthew Colangelo, one of the prosecutors for the Manhattan district attorney's office, told the jury in his opening statement that the case was about 'a criminal conspiracy and a coverup,' describing how Mr. Trump, his longtime counsel Michael D. Cohen, and Mr. Pecker engaged in a strategy to 'catch and kill' negative stories. The lead lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, insisted in his opening statement that the former president had done nothing wrong. 'President Trump is innocent,' he told the jury. 'President Trump did not commit any crimes.' The case centers on a $130,000 hush-money payment that Mr. Cohen made to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, to buy her silence as the 2016 campaign was winding down. Prosecutors say he was reimbursed by Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump falsified business records to conceal his conduct. Mr. Colangelo said the payment to Ms. Daniels came on the heels of another scandal \u2014 the 'Access Hollywood' tape, on which Mr. Trump bragged about groping women. Ms. Daniels's account, he said, 'could have been devastating to his campaign.' He added, 'With pressure mounting and Election Day fast approaching, Donald Trump agreed to the payoff and directed Cohen to proceed.' Mr. Cohen, who was an executive vice president at the Trump Organization and counsel to Mr. Trump, and Mr. Pecker are expected to be central witnesses. Mr. Blanche attacked Mr. Cohen's credibility, saying that his livelihood hinges on attacking the former president, and insisted that prosecutors were attempting to present perfectly legal activities, such as entering into nondisclosure agreements, in a negative light. 'I have a spoiler alert: There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,' Mr. Blanche said. 'It's called democracy.' He continued: 'They put something sinister on this idea as if it were a crime. You'll learn it's not.' Here's what else to know about the trial: The Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump was unveiled a year ago by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and if convicted could face up to four years in prison. Those are felonies because prosecutors say Mr. Trump sought to conceal another crime. On Monday, they strongly emphasized a violation of state election law \u2014 conspiracy to promote election \u2014 that is not one of the actual charges, but they say is baked into the overall crime.\nThe case is the former president's first criminal trial, although he has been indicted three other times in three other cities. With those other cases tied up in appeals and other delays, the Manhattan case may be the only one he faces before the 2024 presidential election. The trial is expected to last six weeks.\nBefore opening statements, the judge overseeing the case delivered a crucial ruling that determined what prosecutors can question Mr. Trump about should he decide to take the stand in his own defense. The ruling, a significant victory for prosecutors that might prompt Mr. Trump to decide not to testify, allows them to question him about several recent losses he suffered in unrelated civil trials, including a fraud case this year in which the former president was found liable for conspiring to manipulate his net worth and was penalized $454 million.\nThe jury was drawn from a pool of residents of Manhattan, where Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular; during jury selection, dozens of prospective jurors were excused because they said they could not be impartial. But the jurors who were selected each pledged to decide the case based only on the facts. Read more about them.\nThe case will receive vast media attention, but the proceedings won't be shown on television. Matthew Colangelo, a prosecutor, said there would be 'only one conclusion: Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.' Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times The Manhattan district attorney's office and lawyers for Donald J. Trump presented opening statements to jurors on Monday, with prosecutors accusing the former president of entering a criminal conspiracy while the defense sought to discredit two key witnesses. A prosecutor, Matthew Colangelo, began by telling jurors that Mr. Trump had conspired with his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, and the publisher of The National Enquirer, David Pecker, to conceal damaging stories during his 2016 campaign. 'This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover-up,' Mr. Colangelo said, telling a story about a hush-money payment to a porn star and insisting that the former president was ultimately responsible. In the end, Mr. Colangelo said, there would be 'only one conclusion: Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.' Immediately after Mr. Colangelo's presentation, Mr. Trump's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, directly disagreed, insisting that the jury acquit the former president. Mr. Trump, he said, had engaged in actions that were legal and normal. 'President Trump did not commit any crimes,' Mr. Blanche told the jury, using the former president's preferred form of address. The lawyer told jurors that Mr. Trump had earned the right to be referred to as 'president' and reminded them that he was the presumptive Republican nominee. Mr. Blanche argued that there was nothing illegal about nondisclosure agreements, which he said companies, the wealthy and the famous all use frequently. And, he said, prosecutors were wrong to suggest something criminal about Mr. Trump's efforts to win the White House. 'I have a spoiler alert: There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,' Mr. Blanche said. 'It's called democracy.' Mr. Blanche asserted that Mr. Cohen, a key prosecution witness, was paid for legal services, and he attempted to undermine Mr. Cohen's credibility. Mr. Blanche called Mr. Cohen a 'criminal' who 'can't be trusted' and suggested that he was testifying only because he didn't get a job in the Trump administration. He also took aim at Stormy Daniels, the former porn star who claimed she had sex with Mr. Trump, characterizing her as an opportunist who had used a brief encounter with Mr. Trump related to his reality show, 'The Apprentice,' to make huge sums of money. He added that Ms. Daniels was 'biased' against the former president and made a living off her story about the sexual encounter. Mr. Blanche also sought to minimize the charges, saying the records at the heart of the case were just '34 pieces of paper' that the former president had nothing to do with. Mr. Trump is accused of falsifying business records \u2014 which is a felony if prosecutors can show the records were altered with an intent to commit or conceal a second crime. A year ago, when the former president was formally charged with 34 felonies, the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, told reporters that he did not have to specify what the second crime was, and listed three options. During opening statements, Mr. Colangelo made it clear he believed that the strongest case relied on one of those options: convincing jurors that Mr. Trump concealed the violation of a state law that forbids 'conspiracy to promote or prevent an election.'

The New York state court system has just agreed to publish a transcript of each day's proceeding by the end of the following day on its website. You can find the daily transcripts here. April 22, 2024, 1:07 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:07 p.m. ET Trump's motorcade left the courthouse just after 1:05 p.m., wrapping up the trial's first day of testimony. The view was blocked by an N.Y.P.D. dump truck, to many reporters' great frustration. Inside Collect Pond Park, across from the courthouse, a lone pro-Trump protester's 'Trump for President '24' banner flaps meekly in the light breeze. April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse The charges against Trump, which accuse him of falsifying records, are felonies because prosecutors say he sought to conceal another crime. Prosecutors had said before the trial that they had a menu of three crimes to choose from. The one they emphasized most strongly today is a violation of state election law: 'conspiracy to promote election.' It's not one of the actual charges, but they say it was baked into the overall crime. April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse And its worth emphasizing that when the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, was first asked about this, at a news conference directly after Trump was formally charged, he said that prosecutors did not have to specify which crime they were alleging Trump concealed. But today, Colangelo took the opposite tack: hitting the word 'conspiracy' again and again. April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET With the trial now underway, here's the People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump by the numbers: The case was born as 'Investigation No. 2018-00403803 \u2013 Investigation Into the Business Affairs of John Doe.' That's how the Manhattan district attorney's office identified the six-year inquiry that led to today's proceedings, with the number and name appearing on subpoenas and the correspondence case. Arrest No. M23613757 was given to Mr. Trump when he surrendered last year on April 4. And when the former president was arraigned later that day, his indictment was given a Docket Number, IND-71543-23, which the court system uses to track the case.  Collect Pond Park across from the courthouse has attracted onlookers and interested parties since Donald J. Trump's trial began last week. Credit... Nate Schweber for The New York Times Andrew Giuliani, the son of Donald J. Trump's former lawyer and a regular strutting presence on the periphery of the courthouse where the former president is on trial, posed for photos inside Collect Pond Park. Grinning and wearing a campaign jacket, Mr. Giuliani, who has made a career as a right-wing media figure, hugged supporters of Mr. Trump on Monday. From one, he borrowed a flag with Mr. Trump's face that promotes him for president in 2024. 'Two-thousand twenty-four years in prison!' taunted Ricky Caballero, 56, from Brooklyn. 'He owes your dad money. Why you out here supporting him?' Mr. Caballero wore a tank top with a Puerto Rican flag. He said that was his heritage, and that he remembers watching Mr. Trump lob paper towels at survivors of Hurricane Maria in 2017. Mr. Caballero said he was still furious. Mr. Giuliani circulated like a celebrity among Mr. Trump's supporters and ignored Mr. Caballero. It was one of a number of loud exchanges between supporters and detractors of Mr. Trump that were noticeably monitored by the police. There were no police in the park on Friday, when a man amid a mental health crisis burned himself to death in an anti-government protest. On Monday, there were six community affairs officers and six regular uniformed officers watching closely for trouble. At one point, the sound of the national anthem wafted through the park, courtesy of the flute-playing activist Marc Crawford Leavitt. 'I'm just playing and no one can argue with my playing patriotic songs,' he said, a sign decrying Trump as a liar hanging around his neck. Anusha Bayya contributed reporting.

April 22, 2024, 12:26 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:26 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse Trump's lawyers have sought to cast the tabloid that Pecker presided over as a media company like any other.

They will be taken into a lot of different environments \u2014 these editorial meetings, the Trump campaign and the Trump White House, and small meetings of New York operators in which, prosecutors will argue, the history of the country was shaped.

Steinglass, the prosecutor, asks him whether he had \"final say\" over editorial decisions. Anything over $10,000 for a story, Pecker says, had to be approved by him. April 22, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET Jesse McKinley Reporting from the courthouse Pecker says in his experience, the only thing that's important 'is the cover' of a magazine. David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, was described as a master of the 'catch-and-kill' technique by people who have worked for him. Credit... Mary Altaffer/Associated Press 'Catch-and-kill' is a term coined by old-time tabloid editors for buying the exclusive rights to stories, or 'catching' them, for the specific purpose of ensuring the information never becomes public. That's the 'killing' part. Why would anyone want to spend money on a story that it never intends to publish? In the world of tabloid journalism, where ethical lines are blurry, deciding what to publish and why is often a calculus that covers favors doled out and chits called in. David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, who also oversaw other tabloids such as Star and lifestyle publications such as Men's Fitness, was a master of the technique, according to people who have worked for him. In 2003, Mr. Pecker's company, American Media Inc., bought several muscle magazines founded by a mentor of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilding legend and movie star. When Mr. Schwarzenegger, who was often featured in those magazines, jumped into the recall election to replace California's governor, Mr. Pecker ordered his staff to buy up negative stories about him in order to protect his investment, former employees said. Staff members called it 'the David Pecker Project.' American Media paid $20,000 to a former mistress of Mr. Schwarzenegger so that she would not speak about their affair \u2014 though news of it had previously been published. The company paid another $1,000 to her friend and $2,000 to a man who had a video of Mr. Schwarzenegger dancing lewdly in Rio de Janeiro 20 years earlier. Mr. Schwarzenegger was elected governor. Mr. Pecker's publications made deals with other celebrities as well, though not always for money. He traded away dirt about the golfer Tiger Woods in exchange for an exclusive interview in Men's Fitness in 2007, according to people with knowledge of that episode. And, according to the prosecutors in the Manhattan trial of Donald J. Trump, Mr. Pecker employed 'catch-and-kill' tactics in the 2016 presidential election, paying a doorman and a Playboy model to suppress negative stories about Mr. Trump and boost the candidacy of his longtime associate.  April 22, 2024, 12:11 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:11 p.m. ET Kate Christobek Reporting from the courthouse Justice Merchan has shown so far that he is eager to keep this trial on schedule. Court will be adjourned for the day in less than a half an hour, but yet the judge has chosen to start the first witness. He seems serious about keeping his word to the jurors that the trial will last six weeks. April 22, 2024, 12:08 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:08 p.m. ET Alan Feuer Providing analysis of Trump cases What will be interesting about Pecker's testimony, if it goes as opening statements suggested it would, is that he won't really be describing Trump's involvement in any actual criminal activity. Rather, he will serve as a tour guide to the seamy way in which Trump used The National Enquirer to his political advantage \u2014 a storytelling point on the way to alleged criminal activity. April 22, 2024, 12:10 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:10 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse And yet, prosecutors have framed Pecker's involvement here as part of a 'conspiracy.' This could be a risk for them \u2014 conspiracy is not one of the charged crimes. And this jury has at least two lawyers. David Pecker's publication, The National Enquirer, was a repository for as many secrets as it published. Credit... Marion Curtis/Associated Press The first witness in Donald J. Trump's criminal is David Pecker, who was the publisher of The National Enquirer, and had traded favors with Mr. Trump since the 1990s. Mr. Pecker, who was sometimes referred to as the 'tabloid king,' had long used his publications to curry favor with Mr. Trump and other celebrities, in exchange for tips or for business reasons. Staff members called Mr. Trump, like other favored stars who were off limits, an 'F.O.P.' \u2014 'Friend of Pecker.' Mr. Trump and Mr. Pecker, along with Mr. Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen, hatched a plan in August 2015 to boost his upstart presidential campaign, prosecutors say. The former Trump allies are each expected to take a turn on the witness stand, giving testimony that could help make him the first president convicted of a felony. Prosecutors for Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, will try to show that the hush money payment to a porn star at the center of the trial was part of a larger effort to suppress negative news about Mr. Trump to sway the election. That scheme, they will contend, includes two other deals, both involving Mr. Pecker. Mr. Trump had announced his presidential campaign in June 2015. The plan the men laid out two months later was simple, according to court documents, interviews with people involved in the events or familiar with them, private communications and other records. Mr. Pecker would use The Enquirer to publish positive stories about Mr. Trump's campaign and negative stories about his rivals. He would alert Mr. Trump, through Mr. Cohen, when The Enquirer learned of stories that might threaten Mr. Trump. The Enquirer could buy the rights to those stories in order to suppress them, a practice known in the tabloid world as 'catch and kill.' In late 2015, Mr. Pecker's company paid $30,000 to suppress a claim by a former doorman at a Trump building who said he had heard Mr. Trump fathered a child out of wedlock \u2014 a rumor that was apparently untrue. Then in August 2016, The Enquirer's parent company paid $150,000 to a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, to keep her account of an affair with Mr. Trump quiet. Two months later, Mr. Pecker and The Enquirer's editor helped Mr. Cohen negotiate a $130,000 hush-money payment with Stormy Daniels, the former porn star who also said she had sex with Mr. Trump. He has denied both women's claims. Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance crimes in 2018. The Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., made a deal that year to avoid federal prosecution, acknowledging that it had illegally tried to influence the election.

Pool photo by Jabin Botsford Donald J. Trump has assembled a team of defense lawyers with extensive experience representing people charged with white-collar crimes to defend him against the charges filed by the Manhattan district attorney's office. Some have worked for Mr. Trump for years. Others are more recent additions, but are involved in the former president's broader legal defense, also representing him in other criminal cases. Here's a look at Mr. Trump's defense team: Mr. Blanche started representing Mr. Trump last year, leaving a prestigious position as a partner at Wall Street's oldest law firm to take him on as a client. He is also representing Mr. Trump in his federal classified documents case in Florida and his federal election interference case in Washington. Mr. Blanche has also represented Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, as well as Boris Epshteyn, an adviser to Mr. Trump. Before turning to private practice, Mr. Blanche was a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where he supervised violent-crime cases. Ms. Necheles has been a lawyer for Mr. Trump since 2021 and represented the Trump Organization during its criminal tax fraud trial in Manhattan. The business was convicted of 17 felonies and ordered by Justice Juan M. Merchan to pay the maximum penalty of $1.6 million. Ms. Necheles previously represented defendants in major organized-crime and public-corruption cases, including Venero Mangano, the Genovese crime family underboss who was known as Benny Eggs. Mr. Bove, the newest addition to Mr. Trump's legal team, is a legal partner to Mr. Blanche. He is a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York who turned to private practice and now represents defendants charged with white-collar crimes. Mr. Stern is a law partner to Ms. Necheles and also defended the Trump Organization in its criminal tax-fraud trial. He has previous experience representing clients charged with bribery, fraud and conspiracy.  Justice Juan M. Merchan handed prosecutors a legal cudgel that could dissuade Donald J. Trump from testifying. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times The judge in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial ruled on Monday morning that prosecutors could ask the former president about a range of previous cases that he has lost, as well as past violations of gag orders, in the event that he decides to testify in his defense. Among other cases, the ruling by the judge, Juan M. Merchan, would allow prosecutors to question Mr. Trump about the civil fraud case brought by the New York attorney general, Letitia James, in which the former president was found to have inflated his net worth to obtain favorable loans. That case resulted in a $454 million judgment against Mr. Trump. Justice Merchan will also allow the Manhattan district attorney's office \u2014 which brought the case against Mr. Trump \u2014 to question him about civil cases brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. Those cases found that Mr. Trump was liable for sexually abusing and defaming Ms. Carroll in the first instance and for defamation in the second. (Justice Merchan did not mention the sexual abuse finding, only the defamation, in his ruling regarding the Carroll cases on Monday.) Justice Merchan will also let prosecutors ask about Mr. Trump's attack on a law clerk in a civil fraud case, in violation of a gag order, as well as a 2018 decision that led to the dissolution of the Donald J. Trump Foundation to resolve a case brought by the New York attorney general at the time, Barbara Underwood, over financial irregularities. The former president suggested in early April that he would testify in the criminal trial, saying that prosecutors 'have no case.' That said, Mr. Trump has promised to testify in previous cases only to back out, and Justice Merchan's decision could change his thinking on such a maneuver. Justice Merchan said that, in the event that Mr. Trump did testify, he would give jurors 'careful and specific' instructions about the scope of prosecutors' queries, adding that he had 'greatly curtailed' what specifics could be the target of questions. However, Justice Merchan warned Mr. Trump that his ruling was 'a shield and not a sword' and that the former president's testimony could open 'the door to questioning that has otherwise been excluded.' Mr. Trump is being tried on charges that he falsified business records to cover up a hush-money payment to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. He has denied the charges. Susan Hoffinger and Joshua Steinglass are among the experienced team that the Manhattan district attorney has put together to prosecute Donald J. Trump. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has assembled an accomplished team to take on perhaps the most high-profile case in his office's history: the first criminal trial against former President Donald J. Trump. The group includes veteran prosecutors and former white-collar criminal defense lawyers who have extensive experience going up against Mr. Trump. Here's a look at the prosecution team: Mr. Steinglass, who has served as an assistant district attorney since 1998, is a recent addition to this case; in 2022 he helped lead the team that secured a conviction against the Trump Organization for conspiracy, criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records. He typically prosecutes significant violent crimes, such as a violent brawl on the Upper East Side that led to the conviction of two Proud Boy extremists in 2019. After starting her career at the Manhattan district attorney's office, Ms. Hoffinger founded her own firm and spent 20 years as a defense lawyer focusing on white-collar criminal defense. She rejoined the district attorney's office in 2022 and worked with Mr. Steinglass to obtain the conviction of the Trump Organization in its criminal tax fraud trial. A prosecutor for 28 years, Mr. Conroy previously led the Manhattan district attorney's office's major economic crimes unit, where he was involved in the prosecution of the bankrupt law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf and supervised investigations into multinational financial institutions for falsification of business records. Mr. Conroy is the longest serving member of this trial team. Mr. Colangelo joined the district attorney's office in 2022 after serving for two years as a senior official at the U.S. Department of Justice. He previously worked for the New York attorney general's office, where he oversaw the investigation into the Trump Foundation, which led to its dissolution. He was also, for a time, one of the lead lawyers on the civil fraud inquiry into Mr. Trump. Before joining Mr. Bragg's major economic crimes unit in 2022, Ms. Mangold clerked for a U.S. District Court judge in New Jersey and worked in private practice for over 10 years. As a partner at the law firm Kobre & Kim, Ms. Mangold focused on criminal and regulatory investigations related to financial misconduct. Ms. Ellis joined the Manhattan district attorney's office in 2018 after working as an associate at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. Before becoming a lawyer, Ms. Ellis worked as a legal analyst at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank.  Broadcast feeds from the trial are limited to those from outside the courtroom. Credit... Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times The Manhattan criminal trial of Donald J. Trump will be closely followed around the world. But you will not be able to watch the proceedings on TV. There will be no video feed aired live from the courtroom. Nor will there be an audio feed, as some federal courts allow. New York courts generally do not permit video to be broadcast from courtrooms, although a feed is being transmitted into an overflow room for the reporters covering the trial. And cameras will be stationed in the hallway outside the courtroom to capture Mr. Trump's remarks as he enters and leaves. Shortly after court adjourned on Monday, the state's chief administrative judge, Joseph A. Zayas, issued a statement saying that transcripts of each day of the trial would be published online by the end of the following day on the court system's website. Judge Zayas was responding to a request for public transcripts filed last week by a New York lawyer, Jim Walden, on behalf of a civic group and a news website. 'With current law restricting the broadcasting of trial proceedings and courtroom space for public spectators very limited, the release of the daily transcripts on the court system's website is the best way to provide the public a direct view of the proceedings in this historic trial,' Judge Zayas wrote in his statement. Court will be in session, for the most part, every weekday except Wednesdays, from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., until the trial ends. The weeklong jury selection process was a pressure cooker for many of the nearly 300 Manhattan residents who were summoned to be interviewed. Credit... Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times Follow our live coverage of Trump's hush money trial in Manhattan. The two Manhattan residents were led into the courtroom to fulfill a foundational civic duty: to be interviewed as prospective jurors. But in the room when they arrived was a defendant, Donald J. Trump, unlike any in American history. Both would-be jurors, a man and a woman, were eventually excused. But the experience thrust them into the spotlight in a way they never had imagined. One was challenged by Mr. Trump's lawyers over his past social media posts relating to the former president. The other has a medical practice that she could not shut for six weeks while serving on the jury. While they were not chosen as jurors, their experiences illustrate the intensity of the attention focused on Mr. Trump's trial \u2014 and on the first jury to ever weigh the fate of a former United States president in a criminal proceeding. Both contacted The New York Times only after they were excused from serving. Though the court's rules protecting prospective jurors' identities end when they are dismissed from serving, The Times is withholding their names and most identifying characteristics about them. Like the other prospective jurors who were considered, both included detailed personal information on the juror questionnaires they filled out, including where they work. They were made to answer those questions by speaking into a microphone in open court; soon, both were blindsided as details of their lives ricocheted around the internet. They said they were frustrated that so much attention was devoted to prospective jurors and ascertaining information about them. While they later learned that the judge in the case, Justice Juan M. Merchan, had ordered the redaction of some of the information jurors were ordered to reveal publicly, they felt that he had acted too late. As with many things connected to the trial, the rhythms and even some of the parameters are being written in real time. Their experiences mirrored some that other prospective jurors who were dismissed have described. One, a man who gave his name as Mark to NBC News, said he had 'satirized Mr. Trump often in my artwork,' and because of that, he had expected not to be chosen. A woman who gave her name as Kara, who said the nature of her job made serving extremely difficult, told NBC News that she realized the gravity of serving on any criminal jury, but particularly this one. Seeing Mr. Trump in person, she said, was 'very jarring.' He was, she realized, just 'another guy.' One of the prospective jurors who spoke with The Times, the man, did not immediately realize what case he was involved in when he was led into the courtroom on the 15th floor of the Manhattan criminal courthouse. The woman had a sense a week earlier, having read a news story about the trial beginning the week she was supposed to respond to a juror summons. The man, sitting a few rows behind the prosecutors' table when the two were part of the first panel of 96 prospective jurors brought into the courtroom Monday afternoon, felt a sense of calm about five minutes into being there. Trump was simply a defendant, he thought. It was a business-records trial. Prosecutors were on one side, the defense lawyers on the other. The woman was struck by the fact that Mr. Trump stood and waved to prospective jurors, she said, as he and his lawyers were introduced to the group. It felt more to her like the behavior of a campaigning candidate than of a criminal defendant. (Mr. Trump, of course, is both.) Both were put off by efforts by Mr. Trump's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, to assess prospective jurors' views of Mr. Trump. The man said Mr. Blanche seemed 'folksy' in a way he found disingenuous, while the woman was sharper, describing a 'witch hunt' to root out people sympathetic to Democrats on the panel \u2014 a phrase Mr. Trump uses often to criticize the various prosecutors investigating his conduct. The man in particular was frustrated that he was asked about past social media posts in which he had been critical of Mr. Trump, which Mr. Blanche's team raised and which Justice Merchan ultimately agreed meant the man should be excused. The man believed he could have been fair and resented the implication that he could not have been. Both he and the woman, who said they believed in the system of jury service, noted that they had begun the day taking sworn oaths vowing to render a fair and impartial judgment on the evidence. The man believed his own views \u2014 especially views from years ago \u2014 had no bearing on his ability to judge the evidence. If anything, he said, he would have been hyper-conscious in doing so. Both had realized the magnitude of what serving on that jury would mean. But they were also conscious of the threats and blowback that could come with weighing evidence against Mr. Trump \u2014 particularly with their personal details traceable in public. And both had concerns about being chosen because of that; the man in particular said his spouse had been worried. Both would have valued being part of the historic trial. But both also had a sense of relief that they were not picked.  Former President Donald J. Trump is accused of 34 felonies, but a conviction is no sure thing. Credit... Pool photo by Curtis Means In the official record, the case is known as the People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump, and, for now, the people have the stronger hand: They have insider witnesses, a favorable jury pool and a lurid set of facts about a presidential candidate, a payoff and a porn star. On Monday, the prosecutors will formally introduce the case to 12 all-important jurors, embarking on the first prosecution of an American president. The trial, which could brand Mr. Trump a felon as he mounts another White House run, will reverberate throughout the nation and test the durability of the justice system that Mr. Trump is attacking in a way that no other defendant would be allowed to do. Though the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has assembled a mountain of evidence, a conviction is hardly assured. Over the next six weeks, Mr. Trump's lawyers will seize on three apparent weak points: a key witness's credibility, a president's culpability and the case's legal complexity. Prosecutors will seek to maneuver around those vulnerabilities, dazzling the jury with a tale that mixes politics and sex, as they confront a shrewd defendant with a decades-long track record of skirting legal consequences. They will also seek to bolster the credibility of that key witness, Michael D. Cohen, a former fixer to Mr. Trump who previously pleaded guilty to federal crimes for paying the porn star, Stormy Daniels. Daniel J. Horwitz, a veteran defense lawyer who previously worked in the Manhattan district attorney's office prosecuting white-collar cases, said prosecutors can be expected to corroborate Mr. Cohen's story wherever possible. 'The prosecution has layers upon layers of evidence to back up what Michael Cohen says,' Mr. Horwitz said. Despite its tawdry particulars, District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg has cast the case as one of election interference. Credit... Pool photo by Mary Altaffer Both sides will lay out their cases in opening statements on Monday, offering dueling interpretations of the evidence some six years after the payoff to Ms. Daniels entered the public consciousness and briefly imperiled Mr. Trump's presidency. But in previewing the case for prospective jurors last week, Manhattan prosecutors emphasized neither the payoff that secured Ms. Daniels's silence, nor the sex scandal that was buried in the process. One prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, instead distilled the trial's stakes to a fundamental question: 'This case is about the rule of law and whether or not Donald Trump broke it.' Mr. Steinglass's boss, Mr. Bragg, has offered a loftier interpretation, casting Mr. Trump's actions as election interference. Although Mr. Trump's lawyers might claim he was merely trying to hide embarrassing stories from his family, Mr. Bragg says Mr. Trump orchestrated a scheme to conceal simmering sex scandals from voters as they headed to the polls in 2016. All told, his allies struck three hush-money deals, paying off people who had stories to tell \u2014 stories that could have derailed Mr. Trump's candidacy. Mr. Bragg's prosecutors will seek to turn that 2016 campaign strategy against him: The tactics that helped propel Mr. Trump to victory will be admitted as evidence and reconsidered far beyond the courtroom. Aides and friends who lied on Mr. Trump's behalf will take the witness stand to testify against him. They include: David Pecker, the tabloid publisher who bought and buried damaging stories about Mr. Trump; Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman who tried to spin reporters; and Mr. Cohen, the fixer who paid Ms. Daniels. Mr. Pecker, who ran the company that owned The National Enquirer, is set to go first, and is expected to recount for the jury several conversations with Mr. Trump about the hush money, according to a person familiar with the plan. Stormy Daniels was paid $130,000 to bury her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Credit... Jeenah Moon for The New York Times Mr. Trump faces 34 felony counts, and up to four years behind bars, but more than just his freedom is at stake. If convicted, he might lose the right to vote, including to cast a ballot for himself. If he were to win back the White House, he would be the first convicted criminal to serve as commander in chief. And the question of how he might serve a prison sentence, should it come to that if he does not receive probation, could throw the country into turmoil. America has grown accustomed to seeing Mr. Trump smash through its customs and is now witnessing a phenomenon that is a first in the 248 years of its history. Presidents have been impeached, driven from office and rejected at the polls. Mr. Trump is about to be the first to have his fate decided not just by voters, but by 12 citizens in a jury box. And they all hail from Manhattan, the borough that made Mr. Trump famous, and where he is now deeply unpopular. A favorable jury pool, legal experts say, has given Mr. Bragg a leg up at the trial. Yet the jury, which was made final on Friday and includes six alternates, is no rubber stamp: It includes at least two people who have expressed some affection for the former president, and it takes only one skeptical member to force a mistrial, an outcome that Mr. Trump would celebrate as a win. The stakes are high for Mr. Bragg as well. He is betting his career and his legacy on a prosecution he inherited, rejected and then transformed. When he took office in 2022, he declined to bring a financial fraud case against Mr. Trump that his predecessor had prepared, prompting an uproar when two prosecutors resigned in protest. But Mr. Bragg continued to investigate and soon revisited the hush-money deal \u2014 an episode that had become known internally as 'the zombie case,' because it kept coming back to life. Little more than a year after taking office, Mr. Bragg indicted the former president. Three other indictments followed in three other cities, but with those cases mired in delay, Mr. Bragg's trial may now be the only one that Mr. Trump will face before Election Day. The Manhattan case comprises the three hush-money deals: with Ms. Daniels, with a former Playboy model and with a onetime doorman who told a tale of Mr. Trump fathering a child out of wedlock. Mr. Pecker and his tabloid bought the silence of the doorman, whose story turned out to be false. They also bought the rights to the story told by the model, Karen McDougal, and then never wrote it, a practice known as 'catch and kill.' David Pecker, the chief executive of American Media, had a cooperative relationship with Mr. Trump for years. Credit... Marion Curtis/Associated Press Then there was Ms. Daniels, who was interested in selling her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Mr. Pecker drew the line there: Her price was too high. Instead, he and a top editor alerted Mr. Cohen, who soon paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 not to tell her story about a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump a decade earlier. Mr. Cohen has said he acted at Mr. Trump's direction, but the former president is not charged over the payment itself. Instead, he stands accused of covering up the transaction by disguising reimbursements to Mr. Cohen. In internal records, Mr. Trump's company marked those payments as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet no such expenses existed, prosecutors say, and the retainer agreement was fictional. Mr. Trump is accused of engineering \u2014 or, at least, approving \u2014 the coverup. His company, prosecutors argue, produced 34 false records that underpin the counts against him: 11 checks, 11 monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted and 12 entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust. Mr. Trump signed several of the checks in the White House, as prosecutors will surely point out at the trial. But directly linking Mr. Trump to the plot to falsify those records is another matter altogether. His lawyers will be likely to argue that he was oblivious, and that Mr. Cohen handled the specifics. Mr. Cohen hashed out the reimbursement plan with Mr. Trump's chief financial officer, Allen H. Weisselberg, who is serving jail time for perjury and will not testify, records show. The lack of a firsthand witness to confirm Mr. Cohen's account is a potential flaw in the case, but it may not be fatal. Prosecutors plan to introduce a document containing Mr. Weisselberg's handwritten notes about the reimbursements \u2014 a key piece of evidence demonstrating that Mr. Cohen did not act alone. And under the law, the prosecutors need not prove that Mr. Trump personally falsified the records. Already during the trial's first week, Mr. Steinglass laid the groundwork with a simple analogy: He asked prospective jurors whether they could accept that, if a husband hired a hit man to murder his wife, the husband was just as guilty as the man who pulled the trigger. 'Can you all follow the same kind of logic in this case?' Mr. Steinglass asked the prospective jurors. Many said they could. Mr. Cohen is expected to offer the closest thing this case has to a smoking gun: He is likely to say that, in early 2017, he and Mr. Trump discussed the repayment scheme in the Oval Office. If Mr. Trump testifies in his own defense, that could pit Mr. Cohen's word against Mr. Trump's \u2014 a he-said, he-said story, with two questionable narrators. Whether or not Mr. Trump takes the stand, the trial could become a referendum on Mr. Cohen's credibility, with the verdict possibly hinging on a convincing performance. In 2018, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to a variety of federal crimes, admitting to participating in the hush-money deals with Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal and lying to Congress about plans for a Trump business deal in Russia. Mr. Trump's lawyers will seek to emphasize Mr. Cohen's checkered past at every turn. And, on cross-examination, Mr. Trump's lawyers are likely to portray Mr. Cohen as a serial liar with a grudge against his former boss. Michael D. Cohen, a former fixer to Mr. Trump and a conduit for the hush money, will be a crucial witness. Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times Susan Necheles, one of Mr. Trump's lawyers, began that campaign during jury selection. She referenced Mr. Cohen's 2022 book 'Revenge,' questioning the credibility of 'someone who says that they want revenge against President Trump.' Yet the prosecution is expected to note that Mr. Cohen told many of his lies for Mr. Trump. And prosecutors will offer evidence corroborating the broad strokes of Mr. Cohen's story, which could persuade jurors when they are weighing his testimony about the crucial Oval Office meeting. Mr. Trump's White House executive assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, who has been identified as a potential witness, could confirm that Mr. Cohen did indeed meet with Mr. Trump, even if she cannot confirm what they discussed. Mr. Pecker can support at least some of Mr. Cohen's testimony about Mr. Trump's involvement in the hush-money deals. And a recording Mr. Cohen made of a call he had with Mr. Trump will capture the former president discussing the deal with Ms. McDougal. 'The prosecution's argument is that you can trust Michael Cohen beyond a reasonable doubt as to their isolated conversation,' said Mr. Horwitz, the former prosecutor. He called the approach 'Prosecuting 101.' William K. Rashbaum, Maggie Haberman, Jonathan Swan and Michael Rothfeld contributed reporting.  \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nProsecutors in the first criminal trial of an American president began laying out their case for a jury of 12 New Yorkers on Monday, saying Donald J. Trump engaged in a conspiracy to cover up a sex scandal in order to get elected president in 2016.\nThe first witness called was the tabloid publisher David Pecker, whom prosecutors described as one member of a three-man plot to conceal damaging stories \u2014 including a porn star's account of a sexual tryst \u2014 as Mr. Trump mounted his bid for the presidency.\nMr. Pecker was on the stand for only a few minutes in the afternoon before court adjourned for the day. He described how his publication, The National Enquirer, paid for stories, a practice he called 'checkbook journalism.' He is expected to return to the stand on Tuesday.\nMatthew Colangelo, one of the prosecutors for the Manhattan district attorney's office, told the jury in his opening statement that the case was about 'a criminal conspiracy and a coverup,' describing how Mr. Trump, his longtime counsel Michael D. Cohen, and Mr. Pecker engaged in a strategy to 'catch and kill' negative stories.\nThe lead lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, insisted in his opening statement that the former president had done nothing wrong. 'President Trump is innocent,' he told the jury. 'President Trump did not commit any crimes.'\nThe case centers on a $130,000 hush-money payment that Mr. Cohen made to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, to buy her silence as the 2016 campaign was winding down. Prosecutors say he was reimbursed by Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump falsified business records to conceal his conduct.\nMr. Colangelo said the payment to Ms. Daniels came on the heels of another scandal \u2014 the 'Access Hollywood' tape, on which Mr. Trump bragged about groping women. Ms. Daniels's account, he said, 'could have been devastating to his campaign.'\nHe added, 'With pressure mounting and Election Day fast approaching, Donald Trump agreed to the payoff and directed Cohen to proceed.'\nMr. Cohen, who was an executive vice president at the Trump Organization and counsel to Mr. Trump, and Mr. Pecker are expected to be central witnesses.\nMr. Blanche attacked Mr. Cohen's credibility, saying that his livelihood hinges on attacking the former president, and insisted that prosecutors were attempting to present perfectly legal activities, such as entering into nondisclosure agreements, in a negative light.\n'I have a spoiler alert: There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,' Mr. Blanche said. 'It's called democracy.'\nHe continued: 'They put something sinister on this idea as if it were a crime. You'll learn it's not.'\nHere's what else to know about the trial:\nThe Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump was unveiled a year ago by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and if convicted could face up to four years in prison. Those are felonies because prosecutors say Mr. Trump sought to conceal another crime. On Monday, they strongly emphasized a violation of state election law \u2014 conspiracy to promote election \u2014 that is not one of the actual charges, but they say is baked into the overall crime.\nThe case is the former president's first criminal trial, although he has been indicted three other times in three other cities. With those other cases tied up in appeals and other delays, the Manhattan case may be the only one he faces before the 2024 presidential election. The trial is expected to last six weeks.\nBefore opening statements, the judge overseeing the case delivered a crucial ruling that determined what prosecutors can question Mr. Trump about should he decide to take the stand in his own defense. The ruling, a significant victory for prosecutors that might prompt Mr. Trump to decide not to testify, allows them to question him about several recent losses he suffered in unrelated civil trials, including a fraud case this year in which the former president was found liable for conspiring to manipulate his net worth and was penalized $454 million.\nThe jury was drawn from a pool of residents of Manhattan, where Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular; during jury selection, dozens of prospective jurors were excused because they said they could not be impartial. But the jurors who were selected each pledged to decide the case based only on the facts. Read more about them.\nThe case will receive vast media attention, but the proceedings won't be shown on television.\nMatthew Colangelo, a prosecutor, said there would be 'only one conclusion: Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.' Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times The Manhattan district attorney's office and lawyers for Donald J. Trump presented opening statements to jurors on Monday, with prosecutors accusing the former president of entering a criminal conspiracy while the defense sought to discredit two key witnesses.\nA prosecutor, Matthew Colangelo, began by telling jurors that Mr. Trump had conspired with his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, and the publisher of The National Enquirer, David Pecker, to conceal damaging stories during his 2016 campaign.\n'This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover-up,' Mr. Colangelo said, telling a story about a hush-money payment to a porn star and insisting that the former president was ultimately responsible.\nIn the end, Mr. Colangelo said, there would be 'only one conclusion: Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.'\nImmediately after Mr. Colangelo's presentation, Mr. Trump's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, directly disagreed, insisting that the jury acquit the former president. Mr. Trump, he said, had engaged in actions that were legal and normal.\n'President Trump did not commit any crimes,' Mr. Blanche told the jury, using the former president's preferred form of address. The lawyer told jurors that Mr. Trump had earned the right to be referred to as 'president' and reminded them that he was the presumptive Republican nominee.\nMr. Blanche argued that there was nothing illegal about nondisclosure agreements, which he said companies, the wealthy and the famous all use frequently. And, he said, prosecutors were wrong to suggest something criminal about Mr. Trump's efforts to win the White House.\n'I have a spoiler alert: There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,' Mr. Blanche said. 'It's called democracy.'\nMr. Blanche asserted that Mr. Cohen, a key prosecution witness, was paid for legal services, and he attempted to undermine Mr. Cohen's credibility. Mr. Blanche called Mr. Cohen a 'criminal' who 'can't be trusted' and suggested that he was testifying only because he didn't get a job in the Trump administration.\nHe also took aim at Stormy Daniels, the former porn star who claimed she had sex with Mr. Trump, characterizing her as an opportunist who had used a brief encounter with Mr. Trump related to his reality show, 'The Apprentice,' to make huge sums of money.\nHe added that Ms. Daniels was 'biased' against the former president and made a living off her story about the sexual encounter.\nMr. Blanche also sought to minimize the charges, saying the records at the heart of the case were just '34 pieces of paper' that the former president had nothing to do with.\nMr. Trump is accused of falsifying business records \u2014 which is a felony if prosecutors can show the records were altered with an intent to commit or conceal a second crime.\nA year ago, when the former president was formally charged with 34 felonies, the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, told reporters that he did not have to specify what the second crime was, and listed three options. During opening statements, Mr. Colangelo made it clear he believed that the strongest case relied on one of those options: convincing jurors that Mr. Trump concealed the violation of a state law that forbids 'conspiracy to promote or prevent an election.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 1:37 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:37 p.m. ET Alan Feuer\nAlan Feuer Providing analysis of Trump cases There's some good news for people who want to follow the Trump trial in detail, but can't make it to the courthouse.

It's not one of the actual charges, but they say it was baked into the overall crime.\nApril 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich\nJonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse And its worth emphasizing that when the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, was first asked about this, at a news conference directly after Trump was formally charged, he said that prosecutors did not have to specify which crime they were alleging Trump concealed.

Donald J. Trump by the numbers: The case was born as 'Investigation No. 2018-00403803 \u2013 Investigation Into the Business Affairs of John Doe.' That's how the Manhattan district attorney's office identified the six-year inquiry that led to today's proceedings, with the number and name appearing on subpoenas and the correspondence case. Arrest No. M23613757 was given to Mr. Trump when he surrendered last year on April 4. And when the former president was arraigned later that day, his indictment was given a Docket Number, IND-71543-23, which the court system uses to track the case.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Collect Pond Park across from the courthouse has attracted onlookers and interested parties since Donald J.

Credit... Mary Altaffer/Associated Press 'Catch-and-kill' is a term coined by old-time tabloid editors for buying the exclusive rights to stories, or 'catching' them, for the specific purpose of ensuring the information never becomes public. That's the 'killing' part.\nWhy would anyone want to spend money on a story that it never intends to publish? In the world of tabloid journalism, where ethical lines are blurry, deciding what to publish and why is often a calculus that covers favors doled out and chits called in.\nDavid Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, who also oversaw other tabloids such as Star and lifestyle publications such as Men's Fitness, was a master of the technique, according to people who have worked for him.\nIn 2003, Mr. Pecker's company, American Media Inc., bought several muscle magazines founded by a mentor of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilding legend and movie star. When Mr. Schwarzenegger, who was often featured in those magazines, jumped into the recall election to replace California's governor, Mr. Pecker ordered his staff to buy up negative stories about him in order to protect his investment, former employees said.\nStaff members called it 'the David Pecker Project.' American Media paid $20,000 to a former mistress of Mr. Schwarzenegger so that she would not speak about their affair \u2014 though news of it had previously been published. The company paid another $1,000 to her friend and $2,000 to a man who had a video of Mr. Schwarzenegger dancing lewdly in Rio de Janeiro 20 years earlier. Mr. Schwarzenegger was elected governor.\nMr. Pecker's publications made deals with other celebrities as well, though not always for money. He traded away dirt about the golfer Tiger Woods in exchange for an exclusive interview in Men's Fitness in 2007, according to people with knowledge of that episode.\nAnd, according to the prosecutors in the Manhattan trial of Donald J. Trump, Mr. Pecker employed 'catch-and-kill' tactics in the 2016 presidential election, paying a doorman and a Playboy model to suppress negative stories about Mr. Trump and boost the candidacy of his longtime associate.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 12:11 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:11 p.m. ET Kate Christobek\nKate Christobek Reporting from the courthouse Justice Merchan has shown so far that he is eager to keep this trial on schedule.

This could be a risk for them \u2014 conspiracy is not one of the charged crimes. And this jury has at least two lawyers.\nDavid Pecker's publication, The National Enquirer, was a repository for as many secrets as it published. Credit... Marion Curtis/Associated Press The first witness in Donald J. Trump's criminal is David Pecker, who was the publisher of The National Enquirer, and had traded favors with Mr. Trump since the 1990s.\nMr. Pecker, who was sometimes referred to as the 'tabloid king,' had long used his publications to curry favor with Mr. Trump and other celebrities, in exchange for tips or for business reasons. Staff members called Mr. Trump, like other favored stars who were off limits, an 'F.O.P.' \u2014 'Friend of Pecker.'\nMr. Trump and Mr. Pecker, along with Mr. Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen, hatched a plan in August 2015 to boost his upstart presidential campaign, prosecutors say. The former Trump allies are each expected to take a turn on the witness stand, giving testimony that could help make him the first president convicted of a felony.\nProsecutors for Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, will try to show that the hush money payment to a porn star at the center of the trial was part of a larger effort to suppress negative news about Mr. Trump to sway the election. That scheme, they will contend, includes two other deals, both involving Mr. Pecker.\nMr. Trump had announced his presidential campaign in June 2015. The plan the men laid out two months later was simple, according to court documents, interviews with people involved in the events or familiar with them, private communications and other records.\nMr. Pecker would use The Enquirer to publish positive stories about Mr. Trump's campaign and negative stories about his rivals. He would alert Mr. Trump, through Mr. Cohen, when The Enquirer learned of stories that might threaten Mr. Trump. The Enquirer could buy the rights to those stories in order to suppress them, a practice known in the tabloid world as 'catch and kill.'\nIn late 2015, Mr. Pecker's company paid $30,000 to suppress a claim by a former doorman at a Trump building who said he had heard Mr. Trump fathered a child out of wedlock \u2014 a rumor that was apparently untrue. Then in August 2016, The Enquirer's parent company paid $150,000 to a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, to keep her account of an affair with Mr. Trump quiet. Two months later, Mr. Pecker and The Enquirer's editor helped Mr. Cohen negotiate a $130,000 hush-money payment with Stormy Daniels, the former porn star who also said she had sex with Mr. Trump. He has denied both women's claims.\nMr. Cohen pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance crimes in 2018.\nThe Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., made a deal that year to avoid federal prosecution, acknowledging that it had illegally tried to influence the election.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 12:07 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:07 p.m. ET Maggie Haberman\nMaggie Haberman Reporting from the courthouse Merchan stops testimony, says he realizes jurors weren't given writing materials to take notes.

Some have worked for Mr. Trump for years. Others are more recent additions, but are involved in the former president's broader legal defense, also representing him in other criminal cases.\nHere's a look at Mr. Trump's defense team:\nMr. Blanche started representing Mr. Trump last year, leaving a prestigious position as a partner at Wall Street's oldest law firm to take him on as a client. He is also representing Mr. Trump in his federal classified documents case in Florida and his federal election interference case in Washington.\nMr. Blanche has also represented Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, as well as Boris Epshteyn, an adviser to Mr. Trump. Before turning to private practice, Mr. Blanche was a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where he supervised violent-crime cases.\nMs. Necheles has been a lawyer for Mr. Trump since 2021 and represented the Trump Organization during its criminal tax fraud trial in Manhattan. The business was convicted of 17 felonies and ordered by Justice Juan M. Merchan to pay the maximum penalty of $1.6 million.\nMs. Necheles previously represented defendants in major organized-crime and public-corruption cases, including Venero Mangano, the Genovese crime family underboss who was known as Benny Eggs.\nMr. Bove, the newest addition to Mr. Trump's legal team, is a legal partner to Mr. Blanche. He is a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York who turned to private practice and now represents defendants charged with white-collar crimes.\nMr. Stern is a law partner to Ms. Necheles and also defended the Trump Organization in its criminal tax-fraud trial. He has previous experience representing clients charged with bribery, fraud and conspiracy.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Justice Juan M. Merchan handed prosecutors a legal cudgel that could dissuade Donald J. Trump from testifying. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times The judge in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial ruled on Monday morning that prosecutors could ask the former president about a range of previous cases that he has lost, as well as past violations of gag orders, in the event that he decides to testify in his defense.\nAmong other cases, the ruling by the judge, Juan M. Merchan, would allow prosecutors to question Mr. Trump about the civil fraud case brought by the New York attorney general, Letitia James, in which the former president was found to have inflated his net worth to obtain favorable loans. That case resulted in a $454 million judgment against Mr. Trump.\nJustice Merchan will also allow the Manhattan district attorney's office \u2014 which brought the case against Mr. Trump \u2014 to question him about civil cases brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. Those cases found that Mr. Trump was liable for sexually abusing and defaming Ms. Carroll in the first instance and for defamation in the second. (Justice Merchan did not mention the sexual abuse finding, only the defamation, in his ruling regarding the Carroll cases on Monday.)\nJustice Merchan will also let prosecutors ask about Mr. Trump's attack on a law clerk in a civil fraud case, in violation of a gag order, as well as a 2018 decision that led to the dissolution of the Donald J. Trump Foundation to resolve a case brought by the New York attorney general at the time, Barbara Underwood, over financial irregularities.\nThe former president suggested in early April that he would testify in the criminal trial, saying that prosecutors 'have no case.' That said, Mr. Trump has promised to testify in previous cases only to back out, and Justice Merchan's decision could change his thinking on such a maneuver.\nJustice Merchan said that, in the event that Mr. Trump did testify, he would give jurors 'careful and specific' instructions about the scope of prosecutors' queries, adding that he had 'greatly curtailed' what specifics could be the target of questions.\nHowever, Justice Merchan warned Mr. Trump that his ruling was 'a shield and not a sword' and that the former president's testimony could open 'the door to questioning that has otherwise been excluded.'\nMr. Trump is being tried on charges that he falsified business records to cover up a hush-money payment to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. He has denied the charges.\nSusan Hoffinger and Joshua Steinglass are among the experienced team that the Manhattan district attorney has put together to prosecute Donald J. Trump. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has assembled an accomplished team to take on perhaps the most high-profile case in his office's history: the first criminal trial against former President Donald J. Trump. The group includes veteran prosecutors and former white-collar criminal defense lawyers who have extensive experience going up against Mr. Trump.\nHere's a look at the prosecution team:\nMr. Steinglass, who has served as an assistant district attorney since 1998, is a recent addition to this case; in 2022 he helped lead the team that secured a conviction against the Trump Organization for conspiracy, criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records. He typically prosecutes significant violent crimes, such as a violent brawl on the Upper East Side that led to the conviction of two Proud Boy extremists in 2019.\nAfter starting her career at the Manhattan district attorney's office, Ms. Hoffinger founded her own firm and spent 20 years as a defense lawyer focusing on white-collar criminal defense. She rejoined the district attorney's office in 2022 and worked with Mr. Steinglass to obtain the conviction of the Trump Organization in its criminal tax fraud trial.\nA prosecutor for 28 years, Mr. Conroy previously led the Manhattan district attorney's office's major economic crimes unit, where he was involved in the prosecution of the bankrupt law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf and supervised investigations into multinational financial institutions for falsification of business records. Mr. Conroy is the longest serving member of this trial team.\nMr. Colangelo joined the district attorney's office in 2022 after serving for two years as a senior official at the U.S. Department of Justice. He previously worked for the New York attorney general's office, where he oversaw the investigation into the Trump Foundation, which led to its dissolution. He was also, for a time, one of the lead lawyers on the civil fraud inquiry into Mr. Trump.\nBefore joining Mr. Bragg's major economic crimes unit in 2022, Ms. Mangold clerked for a U.S. District Court judge in New Jersey and worked in private practice for over 10 years. As a partner at the law firm Kobre & Kim, Ms. Mangold focused on criminal and regulatory investigations related to financial misconduct.\nMs. Ellis joined the Manhattan district attorney's office in 2018 after working as an associate at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. Before becoming a lawyer, Ms. Ellis worked as a legal analyst at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Broadcast feeds from the trial are limited to those from outside the courtroom.

Nor will there be an audio feed, as some federal courts allow.\nNew York courts generally do not permit video to be broadcast from courtrooms, although a feed is being transmitted into an overflow room for the reporters covering the trial. And cameras will be stationed in the hallway outside the courtroom to capture Mr. Trump's remarks as he enters and leaves.\nShortly after court adjourned on Monday, the state's chief administrative judge, Joseph A. Zayas, issued a statement saying that transcripts of each day of the trial would be published online by the end of the following day on the court system's website.\nJudge Zayas was responding to a request for public transcripts filed last week by a New York lawyer, Jim Walden, on behalf of a civic group and a news website.\n'With current law restricting the broadcasting of trial proceedings and courtroom space for public spectators very limited, the release of the daily transcripts on the court system's website is the best way to provide the public a direct view of the proceedings in this historic trial,' Judge Zayas wrote in his statement.\nCourt will be in session, for the most part, every weekday except Wednesdays, from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., until the trial ends.\nThe weeklong jury selection process was a pressure cooker for many of the nearly 300 Manhattan residents who were summoned to be interviewed.

The two Manhattan residents were led into the courtroom to fulfill a foundational civic duty: to be interviewed as prospective jurors.\nBut in the room when they arrived was a defendant, Donald J. Trump, unlike any in American history.\nBoth would-be jurors, a man and a woman, were eventually excused. But the experience thrust them into the spotlight in a way they never had imagined.\nOne was challenged by Mr. Trump's lawyers over his past social media posts relating to the former president. The other has a medical practice that she could not shut for six weeks while serving on the jury.\nWhile they were not chosen as jurors, their experiences illustrate the intensity of the attention focused on Mr. Trump's trial \u2014 and on the first jury to ever weigh the fate of a former United States president in a criminal proceeding.\nBoth contacted The New York Times only after they were excused from serving. Though the court's rules protecting prospective jurors' identities end when they are dismissed from serving, The Times is withholding their names and most identifying characteristics about them.\nLike the other prospective jurors who were considered, both included detailed personal information on the juror questionnaires they filled out, including where they work.\nThey were made to answer those questions by speaking into a microphone in open court; soon, both were blindsided as details of their lives ricocheted around the internet. They said they were frustrated that so much attention was devoted to prospective jurors and ascertaining information about them.\nWhile they later learned that the judge in the case, Justice Juan M. Merchan, had ordered the redaction of some of the information jurors were ordered to reveal publicly, they felt that he had acted too late. As with many things connected to the trial, the rhythms and even some of the parameters are being written in real time.\nTheir experiences mirrored some that other prospective jurors who were dismissed have described. One, a man who gave his name as Mark to NBC News, said he had 'satirized Mr. Trump often in my artwork,' and because of that, he had expected not to be chosen.\nA woman who gave her name as Kara, who said the nature of her job made serving extremely difficult, told NBC News that she realized the gravity of serving on any criminal jury, but particularly this one.\nSeeing Mr. Trump in person, she said, was 'very jarring.' He was, she realized, just 'another guy.'\nOne of the prospective jurors who spoke with The Times, the man, did not immediately realize what case he was involved in when he was led into the courtroom on the 15th floor of the Manhattan criminal courthouse. The woman had a sense a week earlier, having read a news story about the trial beginning the week she was supposed to respond to a juror summons.\nThe man, sitting a few rows behind the prosecutors' table when the two were part of the first panel of 96 prospective jurors brought into the courtroom Monday afternoon, felt a sense of calm about five minutes into being there. Trump was simply a defendant, he thought. It was a business-records trial. Prosecutors were on one side, the defense lawyers on the other.\nThe woman was struck by the fact that Mr. Trump stood and waved to prospective jurors, she said, as he and his lawyers were introduced to the group. It felt more to her like the behavior of a campaigning candidate than of a criminal defendant. (Mr. Trump, of course, is both.)\nBoth were put off by efforts by Mr. Trump's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, to assess prospective jurors' views of Mr. Trump. The man said Mr. Blanche seemed 'folksy' in a way he found disingenuous, while the woman was sharper, describing a 'witch hunt' to root out people sympathetic to Democrats on the panel \u2014 a phrase Mr. Trump uses often to criticize the various prosecutors investigating his conduct.\nThe man in particular was frustrated that he was asked about past social media posts in which he had been critical of Mr. Trump, which Mr. Blanche's team raised and which Justice Merchan ultimately agreed meant the man should be excused.\nThe man believed he could have been fair and resented the implication that he could not have been. Both he and the woman, who said they believed in the system of jury service, noted that they had begun the day taking sworn oaths vowing to render a fair and impartial judgment on the evidence. The man believed his own views \u2014 especially views from years ago \u2014 had no bearing on his ability to judge the evidence. If anything, he said, he would have been hyper-conscious in doing so.\nBoth had realized the magnitude of what serving on that jury would mean.\nBut they were also conscious of the threats and blowback that could come with weighing evidence against Mr. Trump \u2014 particularly with their personal details traceable in public. And both had concerns about being chosen because of that; the man in particular said his spouse had been worried.\nBoth would have valued being part of the historic trial. But both also had a sense of relief that they were not picked.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J. Trump is accused of 34 felonies, but a conviction is no sure thing. Credit... Pool photo by Curtis Means In the official record, the case is known as the People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump, and, for now, the people have the stronger hand: They have insider witnesses, a favorable jury pool and a lurid set of facts about a presidential candidate, a payoff and a porn star.\nOn Monday, the prosecutors will formally introduce the case to 12 all-important jurors, embarking on the first prosecution of an American president. The trial, which could brand Mr. Trump a felon as he mounts another White House run, will reverberate throughout the nation and test the durability of the justice system that Mr. Trump is attacking in a way that no other defendant would be allowed to do.\nThough the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has assembled a mountain of evidence, a conviction is hardly assured. Over the next six weeks, Mr. Trump's lawyers will seize on three apparent weak points: a key witness's credibility, a president's culpability and the case's legal complexity.\nProsecutors will seek to maneuver around those vulnerabilities, dazzling the jury with a tale that mixes politics and sex, as they confront a shrewd defendant with a decades-long track record of skirting legal consequences. They will also seek to bolster the credibility of that key witness, Michael D. Cohen, a former fixer to Mr. Trump who previously pleaded guilty to federal crimes for paying the porn star, Stormy Daniels.\nDaniel J. Horwitz, a veteran defense lawyer who previously worked in the Manhattan district attorney's office prosecuting white-collar cases, said prosecutors can be expected to corroborate Mr. Cohen's story wherever possible.\n'The prosecution has layers upon layers of evidence to back up what Michael Cohen says,' Mr. Horwitz said.\nDespite its tawdry particulars, District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg has cast the case as one of election interference. Credit... Pool photo by Mary Altaffer Both sides will lay out their cases in opening statements on Monday, offering dueling interpretations of the evidence some six years after the payoff to Ms. Daniels entered the public consciousness and briefly imperiled Mr. Trump's presidency.\nBut in previewing the case for prospective jurors last week, Manhattan prosecutors emphasized neither the payoff that secured Ms. Daniels's silence, nor the sex scandal that was buried in the process. One prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, instead distilled the trial's stakes to a fundamental question: 'This case is about the rule of law and whether or not Donald Trump broke it.'\nMr. Steinglass's boss, Mr. Bragg, has offered a loftier interpretation, casting Mr. Trump's actions as election interference. Although Mr. Trump's lawyers might claim he was merely trying to hide embarrassing stories from his family, Mr. Bragg says Mr. Trump orchestrated a scheme to conceal simmering sex scandals from voters as they headed to the polls in 2016. All told, his allies struck three hush-money deals, paying off people who had stories to tell \u2014 stories that could have derailed Mr. Trump's candidacy.\nthree hush-money deals, paying off people who had stories to tell \u2014 stories that could have derailed Mr. Trump's candidacy. Mr. Bragg's prosecutors will seek to turn that 2016 campaign strategy against him: The tactics that helped propel Mr. Trump to victory will be admitted as evidence and reconsidered far beyond the courtroom. Aides and friends who lied on Mr. Trump's behalf will take the witness stand to testify against him.\nThey include: David Pecker, the tabloid publisher who bought and buried damaging stories about Mr. Trump; Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman who tried to spin reporters; and Mr. Cohen, the fixer who paid Ms. Daniels. Mr. Pecker, who ran the company that owned The National Enquirer, is set to go first, and is expected to recount for the jury several conversations with Mr. Trump about the hush money, according to a person familiar with the plan.\nStormy Daniels was paid $130,000 to bury her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Credit... Jeenah Moon for The New York Times Mr. Trump faces 34 felony counts, and up to four years behind bars, but more than just his freedom is at stake. If convicted, he might lose the right to vote, including to cast a ballot for himself. If he were to win back the White House, he would be the first convicted criminal to serve as commander in chief. And the question of how he might serve a prison sentence, should it come to that if he does not receive probation, could throw the country into turmoil.\nAmerica has grown accustomed to seeing Mr. Trump smash through its customs and is now witnessing a phenomenon that is a first in the 248 years of its history. Presidents have been impeached, driven from office and rejected at the polls. Mr. Trump is about to be the first to have his fate decided not just by voters, but by 12 citizens in a jury box.\nAnd they all hail from Manhattan, the borough that made Mr. Trump famous, and where he is now deeply unpopular. A favorable jury pool, legal experts say, has given Mr. Bragg a leg up at the trial.\nYet the jury, which was made final on Friday and includes six alternates, is no rubber stamp: It includes at least two people who have expressed some affection for the former president, and it takes only one skeptical member to force a mistrial, an outcome that Mr. Trump would celebrate as a win.\nThe stakes are high for Mr. Bragg as well. He is betting his career and his legacy on a prosecution he inherited, rejected and then transformed.\nWhen he took office in 2022, he declined to bring a financial fraud case against Mr. Trump that his predecessor had prepared, prompting an uproar when two prosecutors resigned in protest.\nBut Mr. Bragg continued to investigate and soon revisited the hush-money deal \u2014 an episode that had become known internally as 'the zombie case,' because it kept coming back to life. Little more than a year after taking office, Mr. Bragg indicted the former president.\nThree other indictments followed in three other cities, but with those cases mired in delay, Mr. Bragg's trial may now be the only one that Mr. Trump will face before Election Day.\nThe Manhattan case comprises the three hush-money deals: with Ms. Daniels, with a former Playboy model and with a onetime doorman who told a tale of Mr. Trump fathering a child out of wedlock.\nMr. Pecker and his tabloid bought the silence of the doorman, whose story turned out to be false. They also bought the rights to the story told by the model, Karen McDougal, and then never wrote it, a practice known as 'catch and kill.'\nDavid Pecker, the chief executive of American Media, had a cooperative relationship with Mr. Trump for years. Credit... Marion Curtis/Associated Press Then there was Ms. Daniels, who was interested in selling her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Mr. Pecker drew the line there: Her price was too high.\nInstead, he and a top editor alerted Mr. Cohen, who soon paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 not to tell her story about a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump a decade earlier.\nMr. Cohen has said he acted at Mr. Trump's direction, but the former president is not charged over the payment itself. Instead, he stands accused of covering up the transaction by disguising reimbursements to Mr. Cohen.\nIn internal records, Mr. Trump's company marked those payments as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet no such expenses existed, prosecutors say, and the retainer agreement was fictional.\nMr. Trump is accused of engineering \u2014 or, at least, approving \u2014 the coverup. His company, prosecutors argue, produced 34 false records that underpin the counts against him: 11 checks, 11 monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted and 12 entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust.\nMr. Trump signed several of the checks in the White House, as prosecutors will surely point out at the trial.\nBut directly linking Mr. Trump to the plot to falsify those records is another matter altogether.\nHis lawyers will be likely to argue that he was oblivious, and that Mr. Cohen handled the specifics. Mr. Cohen hashed out the reimbursement plan with Mr. Trump's chief financial officer, Allen H. Weisselberg, who is serving jail time for perjury and will not testify, records show.\nThe lack of a firsthand witness to confirm Mr. Cohen's account is a potential flaw in the case, but it may not be fatal. Prosecutors plan to introduce a document containing Mr. Weisselberg's handwritten notes about the reimbursements \u2014 a key piece of evidence demonstrating that Mr. Cohen did not act alone.\nAnd under the law, the prosecutors need not prove that Mr. Trump personally falsified the records. Already during the trial's first week, Mr. Steinglass laid the groundwork with a simple analogy: He asked prospective jurors whether they could accept that, if a husband hired a hit man to murder his wife, the husband was just as guilty as the man who pulled the trigger.\n'Can you all follow the same kind of logic in this case?' Mr. Steinglass asked the prospective jurors. Many said they could.\nMr. Cohen is expected to offer the closest thing this case has to a smoking gun: He is likely to say that, in early 2017, he and Mr. Trump discussed the repayment scheme in the Oval Office.\nIf Mr. Trump testifies in his own defense, that could pit Mr. Cohen's word against Mr. Trump's \u2014 a he-said, he-said story, with two questionable narrators.\nWhether or not Mr. Trump takes the stand, the trial could become a referendum on Mr. Cohen's credibility, with the verdict possibly hinging on a convincing performance.\nIn 2018, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to a variety of federal crimes, admitting to participating in the hush-money deals with Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal and lying to Congress about plans for a Trump business deal in Russia. Mr. Trump's lawyers will seek to emphasize Mr. Cohen's checkered past at every turn.\nAnd, on cross-examination, Mr. Trump's lawyers are likely to portray Mr. Cohen as a serial liar with a grudge against his former boss.\nMichael D. Cohen, a former fixer to Mr. Trump and a conduit for the hush money, will be a crucial witness. Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times Susan Necheles, one of Mr. Trump's lawyers, began that campaign during jury selection. She referenced Mr. Cohen's 2022 book 'Revenge,' questioning the credibility of 'someone who says that they want revenge against President Trump.'\nYet the prosecution is expected to note that Mr. Cohen told many of his lies for Mr. Trump. And prosecutors will offer evidence corroborating the broad strokes of Mr. Cohen's story, which could persuade jurors when they are weighing his testimony about the crucial Oval Office meeting.\nMr. Trump's White House executive assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, who has been identified as a potential witness, could confirm that Mr. Cohen did indeed meet with Mr. Trump, even if she cannot confirm what they discussed. Mr. Pecker can support at least some of Mr. Cohen's testimony about Mr. Trump's involvement in the hush-money deals. And a recording Mr. Cohen made of a call he had with Mr. Trump will capture the former president discussing the deal with Ms. McDougal.\n'The prosecution's argument is that you can trust Michael Cohen beyond a reasonable doubt as to their isolated conversation,' said Mr. Horwitz, the former prosecutor. He called the approach 'Prosecuting 101.'\nWilliam K.
