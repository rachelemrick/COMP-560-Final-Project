Central banks in the United States, Europe and key emerging markets are making progress corralling inflation, though the fund warned that the fight against rising prices is not yet won.\nWhile positive, the outlook is cause for only muted celebration.\nThis year's anticipated growth falls short of the pre-pandemic annual average of 3.8 percent and reflects an uneven global picture, with the United States posting a better-than-expected result while Europe languishes and the world's poorest nations fall further behind.\nAdvertisement\nRising geopolitical risks, including signs of a global trading system dividing into separate blocs oriented around the United States and China, are also troubling fund officials. If that split widens, nations could suffer 'large output losses' as goods and capital move around the world less efficiently, the fund warned in its flagship World Economic Outlook.\nThe view is darker a few years from now.\nUnless policy reforms or new technologies emerge, annual global growth rates will slip over the remainder of this decade, the fund said in a detailed assessment of 'medium-term' growth prospects.\nBy 2030, the global economy could be expanding at an anemic 2.8 percent annual rate, which the fund called 'historically weak.' Slower growth would disappoint expectations of rising living standards and further progress in anti-poverty efforts.\nAdvertisement\nOfficials said chronic weakness in the global economy's performance since the 2008 financial crisis raises concerns that growth will struggle to accelerate beyond today's middling pace.\nGrowth has lagged because of a productivity slump in both advanced and developing economies. The supply of labor has expanded more slowly as societies have aged, while business investment has ebbed, the fund said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe United States is an exception to the global trend, with its companies proving more adept at deploying workers and capital in more-efficient ways, the fund said.\nThe IMF's economic forecasts and the global economy's actual growth rates have steadily ratcheted lower over the past decade and a half.\nIn a speech last week, Kristalina Georgieva, the fund's managing director, warned that the global economy is headed for 'a sluggish and disappointing decade,' which she dubbed the 'Tepid Twenties.'\nAdvertisement\nStill, the current situation is better than what the fund anticipated six months ago. At that point, fund economists worried that the higher interest rates needed to fight inflation would send unemployment soaring.\nBut that hasn't happened. If current trends continue as expected, central banks including the Federal Reserve should be in position to begin lowering interest rates later this year.\n'Despite many gloomy predictions, the global economy has held steady, and inflation has been returning to target,' said Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the fund's chief economist, who briefed reporters on the outlook.\nThe report was released on the eve of the annual spring meetings of the IMF and its sister organization, the World Bank. Central bankers and finance ministers from around the world will gather in Washington this week to discuss the inflation outlook, global debt and prospects for reform of financial aid for developing countries.\nAdvertisement\nThis year, China is likely to fall short of last year's 5.2 percent growth, as a lingering property crisis weighs on the economy, according to the fund. And Russia, having shrugged off U.S. and allied financial sanctions imposed in response to its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, will grow at an annual rate of 3.2 percent.\nThat's faster than the United States, Europe, Britain and Japan.\nThe fund coupled its praise of the United States, which it says will grow this year at an annual rate of 2.7 percent, with a warning that its government spending is 'out of line with what is needed for long-term fiscal stability.' Last year's $1.7 trillion U.S. federal budget deficit was up from about $1.4 trillion in fiscal 2022. All that red ink risks adding to inflation and damaging global financial stability in the long run, by raising borrowing costs for governments around the world, the fund said.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"business","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David J.

That's down from expectations for six or more cuts at the start of this year. Some traders are bracing for potentially no cuts because inflation and the overall economy have remained stubbornly above forecasts this year.\nHigh interest rates and bond yields hurt prices for all kinds of investments, particularly those that look expensive or those that compete for the same kinds of investors as bonds do.\nAdvertisement\nMore influential was weakness for Big Tech stocks. Apple dropped 2.2%, Nvidia fell 2.5% and Microsoft sank 2%. They've been past beneficiaries of low interest rates and often feel pressure when yields are rising.

He even nodded to the visit in a speech that mixed his biography with his thoughts on tax policy.\n'Scranton is a place that climbs in your heart, and it never leaves,' Biden said. 'For me it was 2446 North Washington Avenue.'\nBut the trip was about more than sentiment during the first day of Biden's three-day swing through this pivotal battleground state. He leaned into populist anger against the rich and worries of a world weighted against the middle class as he sought to draw distinctions between himself and his likely Republican opponent in November, Donald Trump.\nAdvertisement\n'All I knew about people like Trump is that they looked down on us,' Biden told the crowd in his childhood town, contrasting his upbringing with Trump's frequent visits to his resort in Palm Beach, Fla. 'They wouldn't let us into their homes and their country clubs. When I look at the economy, I look at it through the eyes of Scranton, not through the eyes of Mar-a-Lago.'\nBiden will further stress that contrast Wednesday when he travels to Pittsburgh to address the United Steelworkers and unveil a raft of new trade protections for the steel industry. The president will call for a tripling of the 7.5 percent tariff on Chinese steel imports, as well as increased pressure to prevent China from shipping steel to America through Mexican ports.\nBiden will also call for an investigation of Chinese subsidies for its shipbuilding industry, following a petition from the United Steelworkers and four other unions last month.\nAdvertisement\nThe actions are just the latest sign of the president's determination to be seen as a defender of American workers like those in the steel industry, whose employees are spread across states in the industrial Midwest, the so-called 'blue wall' that could decide Biden's political fate in November.\nIn making the argument, he has leaned into his middle-class upbringing, including the years he spent in Scranton, which he portrays as a scrappy, working-class town. He argues that Trump, on the other hand, is a billionaire who lives in a gilded club in Florida and would bolster other billionaires, the very people who have had an unfair advantage for too long.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nHoning that point, Biden stressed that the richest Americans, and the companies they own, pay little or no taxes.\n'No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher,' he said, citing Trump as part of the problem.\nAdvertisement\nBiden in recent months has struck a populist tone in other ways. He has criticized big corporations for raising prices and imposing what he calls 'junk fees' \u2014 hidden costs that companies like banks and airlines tuck into their consumer prices.\nTrump and his supporters respond that Trump was by far the better president for working-class Americans and would be again \u2014 one who boosts the economy, fights illegal immigration, cuts taxes and slashes regulation. But the battle is also over who is more emotionally aligned with workers, as Trump stresses his cultural conservatism and Biden emphasizes his modest upbringing and ties to unions.\nPennsylvania, which is central to these battles, is a pivotal swing state that is expected to see frequent visits from both Trump and Biden before November's election. Trump won the state in 2016 but lost it by some 80,000 votes to Biden in 2020. After Biden's stop in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, he will travel to Philadelphia on Thursday.\nAdvertisement\nTrump is courting the same middle-class voters with his own brand of economic nationalism. The Republican has said that, if elected, he would impose an across-the-board tariff of 10 percent on all foreign products and a 60 percent levy on Chinese imports. Many economists say the move would stoke inflation.\nWhile Biden will talk international economic policy on Wednesday, Tuesday was about linking his biography to his politics.\n'We know that the best way to build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up. \u2026 It's a stark contrast to my opponent,' Biden said in Scranton. 'He looks at the economy from Mar-a-Lago where he and his rich friends embraced trickle-down economics that have failed working families for more than 40 years. Scranton values and Mar-a-Lago values \u2014 these are the competing visions for our economy.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Cleve R.

This might well be Trump's most inflationary and economically destructive idea yet. That's quite an achievement, considering everything else he and his advisers have cooked up (universal tariff hikes, deficit-financed tax cuts, huge reductions in the labor force, etc.).\nTrump's objective, Politico reports, is to boost U.S. exports and reduce imports. Basically, if a dollar buys, say, fewer euros or Japanese yen than it currently does, that makes U.S.-made products look a little cheaper and potentially more attractive to European and Japanese customers (among others). So, hey, maybe this could help some U.S. companies trying to sell products abroad.\nAdvertisement\nThat is, until you consider everything else that might happen if we deliberately tried to weaken our currency, which would open up a Pandora's shipping container of disastrous consequences.\nelse that might happen if we deliberately tried to weaken our currency, which would open up a Pandora's shipping container of disastrous consequences.\nFollow this author Catherine Rampell 's opinions\nFollow this author\nCatherine Rampell\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nIt's true the dollar is unusually strong right now, although probably not for reasons Trump is happy about. Exchange rates typically reflect a country's macroeconomic conditions (among other factors, such as interest rates). Thanks to a variety of factors \u2014 including our relatively limited exposure to the war in Ukraine \u2014 we're doing better than most of our peer countries. In the words of Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former International Monetary Fund chief economist, 'The U.S. economy has been on a tear.'\nThe relative strength of the dollar does make U.S.-made goods less attractive, though with so many other countries in or edging toward recession, our potential global customers might not be feeling terribly flush anyway. I suppose if Trump tanked the U.S. economy, whether on purpose or otherwise, that might achieve his objective of swiftly weakening the dollar and shrinking trade deficits.\nAdvertisement\nIf not via recession, how would Team Trump weaken our currency? That's not totally clear. He might try to force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. This is something Trump already wants to do for other reasons. (For instance, he owes a lot of debt, so lower rates would help his own finances.) Or maybe he would bully lots of other countries into raising their interest rates, which seems unlikely to happen. But if it did, it might result in a global recession.\nOr perhaps he would tax foreign financial flows into the United States, as some senators have proposed. This, too, would likely tank the economy, according to Peterson Institute for International Economics fellow Maurice Obstfeld.\n(Noticing any themes here?)\nWhatever the mechanism, a weaker dollar would likely lead to higher prices for American consumers , and not just during their summer vacations to Italy. Americans buy a lot of imported goods, from fruit to toys to cars to home furnishings. Those would all get more expensive as the purchasing power of the dollar fell.\nhigher prices for American consumers, and not just during their summer vacations to Italy. Americans buy a lot of imported goods, from fruit to toys to cars to home furnishings. Those would all get more expensive as the purchasing power of the dollar fell.\nAdvertisement\nSo much for Trump's pledge to vanquish inflation. And that's not the only problem with his plan.\nPerhaps some U.S. exports would get more competitive, as Trump hopes. Ironically, though, some U.S. industries that stand to benefit most from a weaker dollar are not exactly Republican darlings. They include Big Tech, Hollywood and higher education, sectors that enjoy some combination of being quite competitive at exporting things and/or having large offshore profits, which would become more valuable.\nThere's also a risk that other countries won't want to go along with Trump's scheme. Our trading partners might engage in a series of countermeasures to keep their currencies from appreciating against the dollar, which we might meet with counter-countermeasures, and so on. In other words, we might see a sequel to the trade wars Trump initiated before.\nAdvertisement\nGlobal trade or currency wars would, again, likely be bad for pretty much everyone, including U.S. businesses and consumers.\nDeliberately weakening the dollar, or even attempting to, also threatens its role as the world's 'reserve currency.' We have a stable government that has reliably paid its bills and doesn't do dodgy things to deliberately manipulate the value of its fiat currency. As a result, the dollar is widely used in international trade and dollar-denominated U.S. government debt is in high demand.\nThe fact that U.S. dollars are considered a virtually risk-free store of value gives the United States some huge privileges. It enables us to keep spending more than we collect in taxes, since it's cheap and easy for our government to borrow to finance ever-growing deficits. Eroding the dollar's global use might make it more expensive for the U.S. government to keep borrowing so much (which means taxes might need to rise, or spending decline, to cover budget shortfalls).\nAdvertisement\nWe might also weaken our ability to impose sanctions upon countries, businesses or individuals whose actions we disapprove of, since dollars are used so often in international transactions and we have some ability to restrict those transactions.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Catherine Rampell","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2Y6M7ZENAE5BL2GYPSHK3LLZNQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.8807907,"_id":"a8bd1822802b05c7d26ec68912fbfbc3"},{"title":"Retail sales up a strong 0.7% in March from February, underscoring the resiliency of the US consumer","author":"Anne D'Innocenzio","published_date":"2024-04-15 12:45:48","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/04/15/retail-economy-consumer/152f798a-fb26-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Americans increased their spending pace in March at a better-than-expected pace from February, underscoring how shoppers remain resilient despite inflationary pressures and other economic challenges","summary":"NEW YORK \u2014 Americans increased their spending pace in March at a better-than-expected pace the previous month, , underscoring how shoppers remain resilient despite inflationary pressures and other economic challenges.\nRetail sales rose 0.7% last month after being up a revised 0.9% in February, according to the Commerce Department's report on Monday.

Powell laid out his case for why borrowing costs could stay higher for longer than the central bank expected just a few weeks ago. Since the start of the year, Powell and his colleagues had said they are looking for more assurance that inflation was ticking steadily down. Instead, they've gotten the opposite.\n'The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence, and instead indicate it's likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence,' Powell said at a panel discussion on the Canadian and U.S. economies Tuesday.\nPlus, the rest of the economy has stayed remarkably resilient as interest rates climbed to the highest rate in decades. The job market continues to grow at a surprising clip. And that means the Fed can stay focused on zapping inflation, without worrying that its fight is eroding business' willingness or ability to hire, or peoples' ability to find stable jobs. Put together, the data on inflation and jobs mean it is 'appropriate to allow restrictive policy further time to work.'\nAdvertisement\nThe message was echoed earlier in the morning by Powell's no. 2.

Last month, when central bankers sketched out their expectations for the path ahead, they penciled in three cuts before the end of the year.\nBut Fed watchers and the financial markets are now questioning not just when cuts will happen, but if the Fed will be able to eke out even one or two cuts. The outlook shifted considerably last week after March inflation data came in hotter than expected, cementing fears that a new trend had taken hold.\nNow that Fed officials have gotten three months of disappointing news, economists assume they'll need as much encouraging news \u2014 at the very least \u2014 to put them back on track to cut. That means even the most optimistic scenarios don't include a cut before late summer.\nAdvertisement\n'There's absolutely, in my mind, no urgency to adjust the policy rate,' San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said last week. 'Policy is in a good place right now, and I need to be fully confident that inflation is on track to come down to 2 percent \u2014 which is our definition of price stability \u2014 before we would consider a rate cut.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Rachel Siegel","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XQMHAZQHWVMWKK5GOXRAALIX5U_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":5.7118664,"_id":"32db0d88a9f6fff0b9543e3984d1bba8"},{"title":"Solomon Islanders cast votes in an election that will shape relations with China","author":"Associated Press","published_date":"2024-04-17 01:17:08","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/16/solomon-islands-election-sogavare-china-taiwan/35a2e9f8-fc58-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Voting has begun across the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific nation's first general election since the government switched diplomatic allegiances from Taiwan to Beijing and struck a secret\u2026","summary":"HONIARA, Solomon Islands \u2014 Voting began across the Solomon Islands on Wednesday in the South Pacific nation's first general election since the government switched diplomatic allegiances from Taiwan to Beijing and struck a secret security pact that has raised fears of the Chinese navy gaining a foothold in the region.\nThe Solomons' closer relationship with China and a troubled domestic economy will be weighing on voters' minds as they cast their ballots.\nAs many as 420,000 registered voters will have their say across 50 national seats on Wednesday.\nFor the first time, the national vote also coincides with elections for eight of the 10 local governments.\nEsther Maeluma cast her vote in the National Art Gallery in the capital Honiara and said it seemed busier than the last national election in 2019.\nAdvertisement\n'I want my country and the economy to be good and that's why I chose my candidate,' she said outside a polling station.\nSome voters queued outside polling stations from 4 a.m. local time (17:00 GMT) \u2014 three hours before polling began \u2014 with many more flocking to booths early after seeing the growing crowds.\nWith early voting available to a select few, voters have spent recent days traveling back to home electorates, quietening the streets of Honiara and forcing the nation's main hospital to enter crisis mode due to a lack of staff.\n'I didn't used to vote, but now I can see that maybe my vote can change the system and the country,' hospital worker Loretta Maeohu said.\nThe United States has been working to build diplomatic bridges with South Pacific island nations since Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare signed the security pact with China.\nAdvertisement\nRussia's Sputnik news agency last week published an article featuring anonymous claims that the United States was planning an 'electoral coup' in the Solomon Islands, which were repeated in an article published by the Chinese Communist Party's Global Times newspaper.

NATO membership is currently limited to countries of Europe, Turkey, Canada and the United States.\nAdvertisement\nThe designation could allow Argentina access to advanced technology, security systems and training not previously available to it, the Argentine presidency said.\n'Argentina plays an important role in Latin America,' Geoana said at the NATO headquarters. 'Closer political and practical cooperation could benefit us both.'\nMilei has been pushing a radical libertarian agenda aimed at reversing years of protectionist trade measures, overspending and crippling international debt that have plunged the country's economy into a tailspin.\nOver his past four months as president, he has reshaped Argentina's foreign policy to one of almost unconditional support for the United States \u2014 part of an effort to return Argentina to prominence in the global economy after past administrations allowed relations with Washington and European allies to wither.\nAdvertisement\nMilei's government is also seeking security benefits through warming ties with Western countries. On Thursday, the U.S. government announced it was providing Argentina with $40 million in foreign military financing for the first time in more than two decades \u2014 a grant that allows key U.S. allies like Israel to buy American weaponry.\nThe funds, intended to help Argentina equip and modernize its military, will help foot the bill for 24 American F-16 fighter aircraft Argentina bought from Denmark earlier this week. Defense Minister Petri hailed the acquisition of the advanced warplanes as 'the most important military purchase since Argentina's return to democracy' in 1983. The $300 million price tag has drawn criticism from Milei's political opponents as he slashes spending across the government.\nFormally partnering with NATO requires the consensus of all 32 NATO members. Argentina's ties to key NATO ally Britain have been fraught since 1982, when the two went to war over the contested Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic.\nAdvertisement\nOther global partners of the Alliance include Afghanistan, Australia, Iraq, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand and Pakistan.

The speech he delivered at a think tank then was something of a bombshell in the foreign policy community \u2014 a declaration by a senior U.S. official that the world's leading superpower wanted to move on from decades of economic orthodoxy and unfettered globalization to a different arrangement between nations and their societies.\nA year ago, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan announced the advent of a new 'Washington consensus.'

The diktats of these Washington-based institutions \u2014 mandating austerity, deregulation and privatization \u2014 prefigured a wave of globalization that crested into the 21st century. They undergirded a sense of the world bound together by commerce and trade, and lifted up by a shared prosperity, that became a kind of dogma for political elites in the West and elsewhere.\nAdvertisement\nSuch convictions are no longer commonly held. In the West, political leaders now speak of globalization in pejorative terms \u2014 a legacy of economic policy that made some rich while weakening the middle classes of their own societies, where manufacturing jobs dried up, wages stagnated and life grew more precarious. Sullivan pointed to the Biden administration's embrace of industrial policy and major stimulus spending as a major paradigm shift \u2014 and a key cog in the United States' plans to compete with China in the decades to come.\nThe world was not 'flat,' Sullivan seemed to argue, but bumpy. And it was up to governments and alliances of like-minded states to smooth out the disturbances and disruptions caused by shocks such as the pandemic, the ambitions of rising great powers like China and wars that snarl global supply chains. Move over, laissez faire capitalism \u2014 welcome back, mercantilism and protectionism.\nEven as the contours of the new orthodoxy are still taking shape, some underlying global realities remain the same \u2014 perhaps, even more pronounced. As the IMF and World Bank staged their annual meetings this week in Washington, officials and economists put forward somewhat gloomy prognostications. The IMF projected annual global growth at levels still below what took place before the pandemic, and warned of longer-term troubles ahead.\nEven as the contours of the new orthodoxy are still taking shape, some underlying global realities remain the same \u2014 perhaps, even more pronounced.

The IMF projected annual global growth at levels still below what took place before the pandemic, and warned of longer-term troubles ahead.\nAdvertisement\n'Rising geopolitical risks, including signs of a global trading system dividing into separate blocs oriented around the United States and China, are also troubling fund officials,' my colleague David Lynch reported. 'If that split widens, nations could suffer \u2018large output losses' as goods and capital move around the world less efficiently, the fund warned in its flagship World Economic Outlook.'\nThis sluggishness has major ramifications for the West's graying societies, but it's all the more concerning for poorer nations in the developing world. The ambitious programs of stimulus and subsidies put forward by the United States and the European Union may cut against investment and opportunities elsewhere. 'Poorer and less-developed countries could be deprived of the benefits of globalization as the major economies turn inward and as trade and financial flows fragment and fall in line with deepening geopolitical fissures,' Eswar Prasad, an international trade expert at Cornell University, told Bloomberg News.\nMany countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, are also buckling under crippling public debt burdens and struggling to chart a way out. 'With growth being slow, the chances to catch up are actually worsened,' IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said earlier this year. 'You have countries that are truly facing life or death, economic, social difficulties.'\nAdvertisement\nTo some in the Global South, institutions like the IMF and World Bank remain part of the problem . A new analysis by Oxfam found that 'income inequality is high or increasing' in 60 percent of low- and middle-income countries that receive grants or loans from the IMF and World Bank. That's in part due to enforced cuts in public spending that impact the lives of ordinary citizens in these countries.\nTo some in the Global South, institutions like the IMF and World Bank remain part of the problem.

That's in part due to enforced cuts in public spending that impact the lives of ordinary citizens in these countries.\nGrieve Chelwa, a Zambian economist based in the United Arab Emirates, pointed to his country's recent experience, where IMF mandates have hobbled social spending, contributed to a rise in food prices and exacerbated a cost of living crisis. 'IMF-enforced austerity,' he told me, may 'lead to another lost generation for Zambia and Zambians.'\n'More than ever, the U.S. and other rich nations must wake up the reality that that these institutions, as they function, have not only outlived their usefulness, but fallen into a destructive obsolescence,' said Ndongo Samba Sylla, a Senegalese development economist, speaking at an event hosted by Oxfam in Washington this week.\nAdvertisement\nWhile Americans and citizens of other wealthy nations face their own economic headwinds, people in poorer countries find themselves trapped in situations where their governments sometimes have their hands tied. The strength of the U.S. dollar and the whims of foreign credit ratings agencies have as much impact on their lives as the policies of their own states.\nIn the more competitive era hailed by Sullivan, Western governments appear to be reducing their development assistance to poorer nations , at ruinous cost. Mohamed Nasheed, former president of the Maldives and the head of a bloc of nations known as Climate Vulnerable Forum, which represents some of the nations most threatened by the effects of global warming, said that the 68 economies in this bloc lost more than half a trillion dollars in wealth over the past two decades thanks to climate change, though they contributed only about 4 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn the more competitive era hailed by Sullivan, Western governments appear to be reducing their development assistance to poorer nations, at ruinous cost.

Western officials are also trying to address widening inequalities both within countries and between them. In Washington, the finance ministers of France and Brazil jointly revealed plans to crack down on tax avoidance by the wealthy.

'We have four children that are in their 20s,' the 56-year-old truck driver and moderate Democrat said. 'It's like, what's our grandkids' world going to be like?'\nA new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 45% of adults in the United States say they have become more concerned about climate change over the past year, including roughly 6 in 10 Democrats and one-quarter of Republicans.\nPresident Joe Biden's signature climate change policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, was intended to address some of those fears, investing billions in incentives for consumers and businesses to move toward clean energy sources. Biden has pointed to this climate agenda as a major presidential success during his run for reelection. But the poll suggests that although the law has already affected some Americans, it's not widely known among the general population \u2014 and may not be the electoral boost Biden is looking for.\nAdvertisement\nAbout one-quarter of Americans say tax credits for renewable energy projects such as wind power have benefited people like them so far, with similar numbers for incentives for companies to manufacture clean energy technologies in the U.S. rather than abroad, tax credits for individuals to add solar panels to their homes, or subsidies and tax credits for electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances like heat pumps. Those numbers are fairly substantial for a law that passed less than two years ago, where the benefits largely hinge on big-ticket purchases like cars or home improvements.\nPromoting electric vehicles has also been a major focus for the Biden administration, and 15% of U.S. adults say electric vehicles have had a good impact on them personally.\n'I totally agree with the act because it's done so many things for people,' said Charles Lopez, a 65-year-old liberal Democrat from the Florida Keys. 'They help everybody ... I'm not ready for a full electric, but I'll get there when there's enough charging stations.'\nAdvertisement\nBut the people who have benefited from the law are disproportionately Democrats. And while only about 1 in 10 U.S. adults think the individual tax credits and subsidies have hurt people like them, those provisions of the law aren't yet registering with the majority of Americans \u2014 roughly one-quarter say those credits haven't made a difference to people like them. Nearly 4 in 10 in each instance don't know enough to have an opinion about them.\n'I still think that, as much as we'd like for them to be implemented in a way that we can actually see results, it's not really happening in my eyes,' said Sandra Sherman, a 62-year-old resident of Vero Beach, Florida, who identifies as a liberal Democrat. 'With solar panels, although it seems like a really good idea, I see very few people in the area in Florida that I live in that actually have them.'\nGenerally, U.S. adults also aren't confident the IRA will have an impact even in more time. The poll found that only between 23% and 35% of U.S. adults say the law's key components will eventually help address climate change. About 2 in 10 think the main provisions of the law will make no difference in addressing climate change, and about one-third don't know enough to say.\nAdvertisement\n'A lot of the public feeling on it is, \u2018well something needs to be done,' but not necessarily knowing what needs to be done or not even necessarily having strong feelings about what needs to be done,' said David Weakliem, a University of Connecticut professor emeritus.\nBiden still has an advantage over his opponent, former President Donald Trump, when it comes to climate change generally. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults and two-thirds of Democrats have 'a lot' or 'some' trust in Biden on climate change. That includes 29-year-old Jaime Said, a moderate Republican.\nBiden has 'talked about it more and he has mentioned a few plans of things he wants to do. So even if he doesn't do them, at the very least he's thinking about them. That's kind of headed in the right direction,' Said, a medical student in Panama City, Florida, said.\nAdvertisement\n'I know already, right off the bat, (Trump is) not going to address it much,' Said added. 'That's why I don't have too much faith in him doing anything about it.'\nOnly about 3 in 10 say they have 'a lot' or 'some' trust in Trump with regard to addressing climate change.\nBut one of Biden's major pitches for the IRA \u2014 that it will help the American economy and U.S. workers \u2014 doesn't seem to be resonating. According to the poll, only about 2 in 10 Americans say the law has done more to help the U.S. economy, while about one-quarter think it's done more to hurt the economy, and about half think it either made no difference or don't know enough to say.\nAnd broadly, a majority of Americans say the federal government is currently doing 'too little' to address climate change. They generally agree it's important for the government to support climate solutions. About half say it's extremely or very important to limit the use of products and technologies that harm the environment, and nearly half say it's important for the government to pass stricter environmental laws and regulations. About 4 in 10 say it's important for the government to build a national network of public charging stations for electric vehicles, which is another Biden administration priority.\nAdvertisement\nMost say it's extremely or very important for the federal government to invest in new, environmentally friendly technologies, and most, like 38-year-old Julio Carmona, a health program associate who lives in Stratford, Connecticut, and identifies as a moderate Democrat, say the same about enforcing current environmental regulations.\n'We can all do our part when it comes to saving energy, recycling and all those other things,' said Carmona. 'But if the big corporations aren't doing it, I think that, for me, would be where the government should start.'\n___\nThe poll of 1,204 adults was conducted April 4-8, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

A final decision on proposals to repurpose the Russian assets awaits a June summit meeting of President Biden and other Group of Seven leaders in Italy.\nAdvertisement\n'They've had the arguments for a long time. It's now a question of can you get it done?' said Clay Lowery, executive vice president of the Institute of International Finance and a former Treasury official.\nThe glacial pace of decision-making highlights an uncomfortable reality for Kyiv: Despite this week's apparent breakthrough in Congress, Ukraine faces recurring battles to win financial help. The current bill for damages and reconstruction is $486 billion and rising, according to a joint estimate by the government, the World Bank and the European Commission. And its battered economy remains dependent on international support.\nEvents are moving more quickly on the battlefield, where the Kremlin has been grinding out gains. Russian forces in recent days made 'relatively significant tactical advances' outside of Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a nonprofit research group.\nAdvertisement\nEuropean officials have balked at confiscating the Russian assets, fearing it could breach international law, discourage investors from trusting the euro and invite Russian retaliation.\nChristine Lagarde, head of the European Central Bank, said last week that proposals to tap the frozen Russian assets for Ukraine's benefit risk 'breaking the international legal order that you want to protect.'\nEuropean officials also bristle at American insistence on what they see as a risky course of action when they hold the vast majority of the assets and any Russian retaliation will probably fall on Europe, not the United States.\nAs of September, the frozen Russian assets total $280 billion, 'the majority of which is held in the European Union,' according to the G-7 task force monitoring the funds.\nAbout $210 billion of that amount is held by Euroclear, a Belgian financial services company. Only around $5 billion is believed to be in the United States.\nAdvertisement\nAt the IMF and World Bank meetings, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen met with her European counterparts in hopes of hammering out a compromise.\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters Wednesday that officials were discussing the European Commission's March proposal to transfer to Ukraine about 3 billion to 5 billion euros annually. That sum, representing interest earned on the immobilized assets, could narrow Kyiv's budget deficit or help it acquire additional military hardware.\nAmid Washington's protracted debate, Ukraine has run short of shells, bullets and air defense systems. But the modest sums being discussed, measured against Ukraine's daunting needs, have left some observers skeptical.\n'That is not going to change the battlefield or the fate of the Ukrainian economy,' said Douglas Rediker, chairman of International Capital Strategies, a financial advisory firm.\nAdvertisement\nEuropean finance ministers also fear that confiscating the Russian central bank assets could trigger a flight of global capital from the continent, according to Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University professor who served as chief of the financial studies division at the IMF.\nBut Prasad defended the measure as an important step if it leads to additional transfers of Russian revenue to Ukraine over time.\n'If they can find a sensible way to start using Russian resources to transfer money to Ukraine, even if modest amounts, the symbolic significance cannot be overstated,' Prasad said.\nEven if European reluctance can be overcome, the details of utilizing Russian funds are vexing. The Belgian prime minister last month floated the idea of raising money for Ukraine by issuing bonds that would pay investors interest with profits from the Russian assets. The United States has pushed the idea of having the G-7 nations join to arrange a syndicated loan, which would be backed by Ukraine's reparation claims against Russia.

At the same, he will portray Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee and a billionaire himself, as a tool of wealthy interests.\nIt's all aimed at reframing the conversation around the economy, which has left many Americans feeling sour about their financial situations at a time of stubborn inflation and elevated interest rates despite low unemployment.\nAdvertisement\nBiden plans to spend Tuesday night in Scranton before continuing to Pittsburgh on Wednesday morning. He then goes back to the White House, only to return to Pennsylvania on Thursday, this time visiting Philadelphia.\nBy the time the week is over, Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris will have visited the state eight times this year, reflecting its importance to Biden's hopes for a second term.\n'It's hard to draw paths to Biden winning the White House that don't involve Pennsylvania,' said Daniel Hopkins, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania. No Democrat has become president without winning the state since Harry Truman in 1948.\nScranton, the president's first destination, will blend the personal and the political for Biden. He grew up in a three-story colonial home in the Green Ridge neighborhood until his father struggled to find work and moved the family to Delaware when the future president was 10.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough Delaware eventually became the launching pad for Biden's political career, he often returned to Scranton and grounded his autobiography in the city. He visited so often, he was sometimes called 'Pennsylvania's third senator.'\nIn 2020, Biden described the presidential campaign as 'Scranton versus Park Avenue,\" and his reelection team is framing this year's race in a similar way.\n'You've got Joe Biden, who sees the world from the kitchen table where he grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Donald Trump, who sees the world from his country club down in Mar-a-Lago,' said Michael Tyler, the campaign's communications director.\nChristopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, described Scranton as a 'mythical place in political culture,' and it will provide a test for Biden's political appeal.\nAdvertisement\n'It's an area that, on paper, aligns perfectly with the populist gains of the Republican Party during the Trump era,' Borick said.\nHowever, Biden won the city and the surrounding county in 2020. If he's able to carry Scranton and similar places again this year, as well as limit Trump's winning margins in rural areas, Biden may be able to secure another victory in Pennsylvania.\n'Everything is on the margin.

Many of the cuts expire at the end of 2025, and Biden wants to keep a majority of them to fulfill his promise that no one earning less than $400,000 will pay more taxes.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, he also wants to raise $4.9 trillion in revenue over 10 years with higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations. His platform includes a 'billionaire's tax,' which would set a minimum rate of 25% on the income of the richest Americans.\nBiden's travels in Pennsylvania overlap with the start of Trump's first criminal trial, presenting an opportunity and a challenge for the president's campaign.\nTrump is defending himself against criminal charges for a scheme to suppress allegations of affairs with a porn actress and a Playboy model. Biden's team has quietly embraced the contrast of the former president sequestered in a courtroom while the current president has free rein to focus on economic issues that are top of mind for voters.\nHowever, the juxtaposition becomes less helpful if Trump soaks up the country's attention during the first-ever criminal trial of a former president.\nAdvertisement\nBiden campaign officials said they weren't worried about the trial.\n'No matter where Donald Trump is, whether it's in Mar-a-Lago or a courtroom or anywhere else, he'll be focused on himself, his toxic agenda, his campaign of revenge and retribution,' Tyler said. 'That's going to be a continuation of the contrast the American people have been able to see since this campaign began.'\nSam DeMarco, chair of the Republican Party in Allegheny County, where Pittsburgh is located, said Democrats' message is that 'the economy is good, we're just not smart enough to realize it.'\nHowever, DeMarco said, 'across the board, it costs more to live today than it did when Joe Biden came to office.'\n'These are the things that families feel,' he said. 'And a scripted appearance by the president is not going to change that.'\nAdvertisement\nTrump was last in Pennsylvania on Saturday night in Schnecksville, where he described Biden as a 'demented tyrant' and blamed him for all of the country's problems, in addition to his own legal woes.\n'All of America knows that the real blame for this nightmare lies with one person, Crooked Joe Biden,' Trump said.\nHe attacked Biden's tax plans, falsely claiming that 'they're going to raise your taxes by four times.'\nTrump also went on an extended riff about the Civil War battle in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, calling it 'so vicious and horrible, and so beautiful in so many different ways,' and suggesting that the Confederate General Robert E.

A puzzling new book on the subject misses the sense of pride and communal belonging that comes from living far from cities and suburbs.","summary":"Nicholas F.

This op-ed was adapted from an article in UnHerd .\nNicholas F. Jacobs is an assistant professor of government at Colby College, where Daniel M. Shea is a professor of government. They are the authors of 'The Rural Voter.' This op-ed was adapted from an article in UnHerd.\nA good American progressive is meant to disapprove of disparaging political stereotypes. But that hasn't stopped them gleefully embracing the caricature of the enraged rural American. You know the tropes; they're the last ones you can utter in respectable conversation: 'white trash,' 'redneck,' 'hillbilly,' all them ignorant belligerents in stark raving anger ready to storm the Capitol.\nAcademic Thomas Schaller, co-author of 'White Rural Rage: The Threat to American Democracy,' recently stoked this prejudice on MSNBC: Rural voters 'are the most racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-gay geo-demographic group in the country. \u2026 They are the most likely to excuse or justify violence as an acceptable alternative to peaceful public discourse.' The book was soon trending on X.\nAdvertisement\nAs two scholars of rural politics, who have spent the past three years poring over thousands of survey interviews with rural Americans, this caricature of the rural rabble-rouser is deeply puzzling. Instead of threats to democracy, or rebellious politics, or reflexive anger, we keep finding something different: pride in rural living, a sense of communal belonging, a shared fate that intertwines the economic well-being of rich and poor in rural communities. Yes, there are resentments, especially toward government officials and experts. But resentment is not a stereotype. It's a motivation, a story.\nStill, rageful stereotypes sell better than complex backstories. And they're easier for our political and media ecosystems to make sense of. Reference some data point about QAnon conspiracies in the heartlands, and you'll raise more money from nervous liberals in the city (who just so happen to live next to three times as many QAnon conspiracy believers). Lash out against the xenophobia in small towns, and you'll mobilize your city voters to the polls. Rage draws clicks. It makes a splash. Yes, racism and hostility toward these groups exists in the countryside, as it does throughout the United States. And we are deeply troubled by the enduring role it plays in U.S. politics. But it is a national problem, not one to which White rural Americans uniquely contribute.\nWhat we do see in rural America are a unique set of resentments or grievances that arise from real and perceived slights against rural communities. These include economic policies that have devastated local industries, a lack of investment in rural infrastructure and education, and a sense of cultural dismissal from urban-centric media and politics.\nAdvertisement\nSuch failures help to explain the deep-rooted skepticism in many rural areas toward government policy solutions. Just consider the aftermath of the North American Free Trade Agreement, implemented in 1994. NAFTA's champions, including both Democrats and Republicans, promised that the deal would bring prosperity to small farmers, but between 1998 and 2018, 1 out of every 10 small U.S. farms disappeared. Not long after the trade barriers were removed, Canadian cattle ranchers flooded the U.S. market with beef and prices plummeted, forcing small farms out of business. Meanwhile, large-scale agribusinesses capitalized on the open borders. If government neglect drove your grandpa off his farm back then, why would you trust it now?\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIf one is interested in building political coalitions that include rural voters, and which may lead to more inclusive and equitable policymaking, it is these resentments that must be understood. The stereotype of the raging rural American misrepresents the complexities of the rural experience. It is why Hollywood fell for Sen. J.D. Vance's (R-Ohio) story of Appalachian poverty, while failing to recognize that he was running a political campaign that spoke to the resilience, values and pride of rural residents. And it is why most progressives don't have much empathy left for rural voters \u2014 despite feeling deeply for nearly every other marginalized group in American society.\nIn some circles, this lack of empathy stems from the fact that these so-called deplorables are blamed for having brought Donald Trump to power. As Paul Waldman, the second co-author of 'White Rural Rage,' said: 'If Donald Trump gets back to the Oval Office, it will be because \u2014 once again \u2014 rural Whites put him there.'\nAdvertisement\nBut rural America is not responsible for Trump. If simply voting for Trump makes you 'enraged,' then the residents of cities and suburbs, from which Trump derived 80 percent of his total votes in 2020, are downright furious. Pinning Trump's gains on decades of rural America's losses is just another form of confirmation bias \u2014 reinforcing existing beliefs without critical examination. Rarely do you hear mentions of figures such as Bill Clinton, who championed NAFTA, or Hillary Clinton, who seemed to openly celebrate the fact that she lost the places that were economically suffering the most.\nWith stereotypes of rage come stereotypes of irrationality. But rural folk have good reason to partly blame Democrats, experts and college professors for their misfortunes. They know full well that federal agriculture and trade policies pushed by both Democrats and Republicans did destroy rural economies. And that liberal elites stood by as rural students became one of the least likely groups to attend college, and one of the most likely to drop out. Surely, the drive for diversity and inclusion should include rural kids, too?\ndid destroy rural economies. And that liberal elites stood by as rural students became one of the least likely groups to attend college, and one of the most likely to drop out. Surely, the drive for diversity and inclusion should include rural kids, too?\nWe've also noticed that city dwellers tend use stereotypes as a crutch to disguise the fact that they know very little about how different people live their lives. Both rural and urban people see the 'other' as having different values. Many of these differences are overblown, but some of them are, undoubtedly, true. We see it in our own lives: As college professors who choose to live in the countryside, we hear colleagues playfully say we've 'gone native,' and our neighbors think we're squirrelly. We love both worlds and the people within them, even when they value different things. But stereotypes, generalizations, tropes and unchecked hyperbole foreclose the possibility of closing this divide.\nAdvertisement","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Nicholas F.

And on Tuesday, he is scheduled to deliver a speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania, about why the wealthy should pay more in taxes to reduce the federal deficit and help fund programs for the poor and middle class.\nBiden is proud to say that he was largely without money for much of his decades-long career in public service, unlike Trump, who inherited hundreds of millions of dollars from his father and used his billionaire status to launch a TV show and later a presidential campaign.\nAdvertisement\n'For 36 years, I was listed as the poorest man in Congress,' Biden told donors in California in February. 'Not a joke.'\nIn 2015, Trump declared as part of his candidacy, 'I'm really rich.'\nThe Republican former president has argued that voters have no need to see his tax data and that past financial disclosures are more than sufficient. He maintains that keeping taxes low for the wealthy will supercharge investment and lead to more jobs, while tax hikes would crush an economy still recovering from inflation that hit a four-decade peak in 2022.\n'Biden wants to give the IRS even more cash by proposing the largest tax hike on the American people in history when they are already being robbed by his record-high inflation crisis,' said Karoline Leavitt, press secretary for the Trump campaign.\nThe split goes beyond an ideological difference to a very real challenge for whoever triumphs in the November election. At the end of 2025, many of the tax cuts that Trump signed into law in 2017 will expire \u2014 setting up an avalanche of choices about how much people across the income spectrum should pay as the national debt is expected to climb to unprecedented levels.\nAdvertisement\nIncluding interest costs, extending all the tax breaks could add another $3.8 trillion to the national debt through 2033, according to an analysis last year by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\nBiden would like to keep the majority of the tax breaks, based on his pledge that no one earning less than $400,000 will have to pay more. But he released a budget proposal this year with tax increases on the wealthy and corporations that would raise $4.9 trillion in revenues and trim forecasted deficits by $3.2 trillion over 10 years.\nStill, he's telling voters that he's all for letting the Trump-era tax cuts lapse.\n'Does anyone here think the tax code is fair? Raise your hand,' Biden said Tuesday at a speech in Washington's Union Station to a crowd predisposed to dislike Trump's broad tax cuts that helped many in the middle class but disproportionately favored wealthier households.\nAdvertisement\n'It added more to the national debt than any presidential term in history,' Biden continued. 'And it's due to expire next year. And guess what? I hope to be president because it expires \u2014 it's going to stay expired.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nTrump has called for higher tariffs on foreign-made goods, which are taxes that could hit consumers in the form of higher prices. But his campaign is committed to tax cuts while promising that a Trump presidency would reduce a national debt that has risen for decades, including during his Oval Office tenure.\n'When President Trump is back in the White House, he will advocate for more tax cuts for all Americans and reinvigorate America's energy industry to bring down inflation, lower the cost of living, and pay down our debt,' Leavitt said.\nMost economists say Trump's tax cuts could not generate enough growth to pay down the national debt. An analysis released Friday by Oxford Economics found that a 'full-blown Trump' policy with tax cuts, higher tariffs and blocking immigration would slow growth and increase inflation.\nAdvertisement\nAmong Biden's proposals is a 'billionaire minimum income tax' that would apply a minimum rate of 25% on households with a net worth of at least $100 million.\nThe tax would directly target billionaires such as Trump, who refused to release his personal taxes as presidents have traditionally done. But six years of his tax returns were released in 2022 by Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee.\nIn 2018, Trump earned more than $24 million and paid about 4% of that in federal income taxes. The congressional panel also found that the IRS delayed legally mandated audits of Trump during his presidency, with the panel concluding the audit process was ' dormant, at best.'\nBiden has publicly released more than two decades of his tax returns. In 2022, he and his wife, Jill, made $579,514 and paid nearly 24% of that in federal income taxes, more than double the rate paid by Trump.\nAdvertisement\nTrump has maintained that his tax records are complicated because of his use of various tax credits and past business losses, which in some cases have allowed him to avoid taxes. He also previously declined to release his tax returns under the claim that the IRS was auditing him for pre-presidential filings.\nHis finances recently received a boost from the stock market debut of Trump Media, which controls Trump's preferred social media outlet, Truth Social.

Although the coral can recover, severe and prolonged bleaching can kill it.\nScientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and International Coral Reef Initiative said on Monday that coral bleaching across at least 53 countries, territories or local economies has been confirmed since February 2023.\nAlthough much is being done to protect coral reefs around the world, the prime cause driving events such as global bleaching is the burning of fossil fuels, which leads to greenhouse gas emissions and warming oceans, Thomson said.\n'Is enough being done? The answer is definitely not,' he said. 'And the \u2018done' factor is the transition away from burning fossil fuels.'\nAdvertisement\nThomson said he believes some more resilient coral will survive, and noted efforts to preserve coral in facilities such as aquariums.

All are testing the proposition he made to voters during his 2020 campaign that a Biden White House would bring a measure of calm and renewed respect for the United States on the world stage.\nForeign policy matters are not typically the top issue for American voters. This November is expected to be no different, with the economy and border security carrying greater resonance.\nBut public polling suggests that overseas concerns could have more relevance with voters than in any U.S. election since 2006, when voter dissatisfaction over the Iraq War was a major factor in the Republican Party losing 30 House and six Senate seats.\n'We see this issue rising in saliency, and at the same time we're seeing voter appraisals of President Biden's handling of foreign affairs being quite negative,' said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. 'That combination is not a great one for Biden.'\nAdvertisement\nBiden has staked enormous political capital on his response to the Israel-Hamas war as well as his administration's backing of Ukraine as it fends off a Russian invasion.\nThe apparent de-escalation of tensions between Israel and Iran also comes as Congress moves closer to approving $95 billion in wartime aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, a measure that Biden has pushed for as Ukrainian forces run desperately short on arms.\nAfter months of delay in the face of the threat of ouster by his party's right flank, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pushed the package forward and final House passage was expected this weekend. That prospect \u2014 and a surge of weaponry to the front lines \u2014 is giving the White House renewed hope that Ukraine can right the ship after months of setbacks in the war.\nBiden also has made bolstering relations in the Indo-Pacific a central focus of his foreign policy agenda, looking to win allies and build ties as China becomes a more formidable economic and military competitor.\nAdvertisement\nBut Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have an argument to make that Biden's policies have contributed to U.S. dealing with myriad global quandaries, said Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Washington think tank Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.\nRepublicans have criticized Biden's unsuccessful efforts earlier in his term to revive a nuclear deal with Iran brokered by the Obama administration and abandoned by Trump, saying that would embolden Tehran. The agreement had provided Iran with billions in sanctions relief in exchange for the country agreeing to roll back its nuclear program.\nGOP critics have sought to connect Russia's invasion of Ukraine to Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan and they blame the Obama administration for not offering a strong enough response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's 2014 seizure of Crimea.\nAdvertisement\n'You can make an intellectual case, a policy case of how we got from Point A to B to C to D and ended up in a world on fire,' said Goldberg, a national security official in the Trump administration. 'People may not care about how we got here, but they do care that we are here.'\nPolling suggests Americans' concerns about foreign policy issues are growing, and there are mixed signs of whether Biden's pitch as a steady foreign policy hand is resonating with voters.\nAbout 4 in 10 U.S. adults named foreign policy topics in an open-ended question that asked people to share up to five issues for the government to work on in 2024, according to The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll published in January. That's about twice as many as mentioned the topic in an AP- NORC poll conducted in the previous year.\nAdvertisement\nFurther, about 47% of Americans said they believe Biden has hurt relations with other countries, according to an AP-NORC poll published this month. Similarly, 47% said the same about Trump.\nBiden was flying high in the first six months of his presidency, with the American electorate largely approving of his performance and giving him high marks for his handling of the economy and the coronavirus pandemic. But the president saw his approval ratings tank in the aftermath of the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in August 2021 and they never fully recovered.\nNow, Biden finds himself dealing with uncertainty of two wars. Both could shadow him right up to Election Day.\nWith the Israel-Hamas war, Republicans pillory him as being not being adequately supportive of Israel, and the left wing of his party harshly criticize the president, who has shown displeasure with Netanyahu's prosecution of the war, for not doing more to force the Israelis to safeguard Palestinian lives.\nAdvertisement\nAfter Israel's carefully calibrated strikes on Iran, Middle East tensions have entered a 'gray area' that all parties must navigate carefully, said Aaron David Miller, an adviser on Middle East issues in Republican and Democratic administrations.\n'Does what has occurred over the last 10 days strengthen each sides' risk-readiness or has it made them drop back from the brink and revert into risk aversion?' Miller said. 'Israel and Iran got away with striking each other's territory without a major escalation. What conclusions do they draw from that? Is the conclusion that we might be able to do this again? Or is it we really dodged a bullet here and we have to be exceedingly careful.'\nIsrael and Hamas appear far away from an agreement on a temporary cease-fire that would facilitate the release of remaining hostages in Hamas-controlled Gaza and help get aid into the territory. It's an agreement that Biden sees as essential to finding an endgame to the war.\nAdvertisement\nCIA Director William Burns expressed disappointment this past week that Hamas has not yet accepted a proposal that Egyptian and Qatari negotiators had presented this month. He blamed the group for 'standing in the way of innocent civilians in Gaza getting humanitarian relief that they so desperately need.'\nAt the same time, the Biden administration has tried to demonstrate it is holding Israel accountable, imposing new penalties Friday on two entities accused of fundraising for extremist Israel settlers that were already under sanctions, as well as the founder of an organization whose members regularly assault Palestinians.\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan and other administration officials met on Thursday with Israel's minister for strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, and national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi. U.S. officials, according to the White House, reiterated Biden's concerns about Israel's plans to carry out an operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where some 1.5 million Palestinians have taken shelter.\nRoss Baker, professor emeritus of political science at Rutgers University, said Biden may have temporarily benefited from Israeli-Iranian tensions driving attention away from the deprivation in Gaza.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Aamer Madhani","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/44Y2JLX7C4I65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":4.49181,"_id":"2406be669a5e0a3650c28071c898708d"},{"title":"Transcript: The Race to Decarbonize: Manufacturing","author":"Washington Post Live","published_date":"2024-04-17 21:56:52","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/washington-post-live/2024/04/17/transcript-race-decarbonize-manufacturing","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Transcript: The Race to Decarbonize: Manufacturing","summary":"MR. LYNCH: Hello, and welcome to Washington Post Live. I'm David J. Lynch, global economics correspondent here at The Post.\nToday we have two segments on American manufacturing and the emerging workforce. Later we'll hear from the president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Valerie Sheares Ashby. But first, I'm joined by Jay Timmons, the president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers.\nJay, welcome to Washington Post Live.\nMR. TIMMONS: Great to be here, David. Thanks for having me.\nMR. LYNCH: Well, we're glad you could join us.\nSo let's set the stage for how things look in manufacturing. The number of factory jobs is up almost 800,000 since President Biden took office. As a percentage of total employment, however, it's about flat. But spending on new factories has shot through the roof. It's roughly double what it was three years ago. So what's your assessment of the overall health of the American manufacturing sector right now?\nAdvertisement\nMR. TIMMONS: So David, I would say we're--you know, look, we're very strong right now. There's no question about it.\nI think it's important to put this into a historic perspective, if you will. I think back to the work that President Bush 43, and even before him, Clinton and Bush 41 and Reagan and then President Obama, the work that they did to expand our trade agreements so that we could sell more products overseas. I think of the investments that were made during the Trump administration because of those just record tax reforms that were put in place as well as the regulatory certainty. And then, of course, you fast forward to this administration, and you look at the investments that were made through the President's manufacturing strategy in terms of infrastructure investment, the CHIPS and Science Act, and many provisions of the IRA. All of that has led to a place today where manufacturing is stronger than we've seen it in more than a generation.\nAnd, in fact, you referenced the number of manufacturing workers that are out there today. It's the highest number since 2008. The sector is seeing record investment in new plants and equipment, and you've also seen record wage growth. That's all because of these policies that were put in place by administrations of different political stripes. Now our challenge is to maintain this momentum that we have and ensure that America continues to lead the world economically and certainly leads the world through manufacturing prowess.\nAdvertisement\nMR. LYNCH: Well, that's a perfect segue into a question from one of our viewers. Anthony Vance from Washington, D.C., asks, 'Is the surge in manufacturing a temporary phenomenon largely stimulated by government policies instituted in the last three years, or is it likely to remain with us for a decade or so?'\nMR. TIMMONS: Well, I guess the answer to that is yes to both of those questions, Anthony, depending on what public policies are put into place.\nI mentioned this continuum that we've seen, this focus by both political parties, which is great, on growing the manufacturing economy here in the United States and making manufacturing even stronger. But we have some choices to make. We're at a crossroads. There's no question about that, and those choices, they all relate back to all of those issues that I've mentioned. And I would add one other, which I'll get to in a second.\nAdvertisement\nBut you have tax policy that has expired in terms of our ability to really prioritize innovation through the research and development tax deduction, interest deductibility, and immediate expensing. Those three things alone contribute to a significant amount of manufacturing investment here in the United States, and the fact that that has ceased to exist in the last couple of years and we're waiting for Congress to renew those incentives, it's chilling future manufacturing investment--or current and future manufacturing investment.\nThen you have the tax reforms of 2017 that are up for discussion and action in 2025, and those are specifically the rates for small- and medium-sized manufacturers who file as S-corporations. Those rates expire at the end of 2025. And what I fear is that there will be politicians, probably of both political stripes, who are trying to appease a very important part of their constituency and a very important part of the manufacturing economy, small businesses, by saying, well, why don't we just capitulate on the C-corp rate and raise that a few percentage points so that we can keep the rate low for small and medium manufacturers? And I say that is a losing strategy. You've got to have competitive rates across the board, and right now we're at 21 percent at the C-corp level. We need to maintain that. We also have to get--and in the promo video, the initial video, David, that you ran, it said that I argued against--I'm arguing against additional regulation. That's not quite accurate.\nI'm arguing actually for smart regulation, and that means business and government sitting down together to talk about what the possibilities are. We all agree on what the issues are before us, whether it's lowering carbon intensity or making sure that our drinking water is safe and our air is cleaner and our communities are healthier for our children and our grandchildren, but you can't just be aspirational about what your objectives are. You have to be very pragmatic and level-headed, and you have to understand what is possible in the world today as well as what will be possible in the world tomorrow. And then that goes right back to those incentives like the research and development tax deduction. If you want to innovate here in America, you've got to have all of those tools.\nAdvertisement\nI would also add that it's important to have trade agreements. We haven't negotiated one for over 10 years.\nAnd then, lastly, I would say it's extraordinarily important, Anthony, that we have the workforce that we need to fill the jobs that are open. We have almost 600,000 open jobs in manufacturing today. We're doing really well. But by the year 2033, we're going to need to fill 3.8 million jobs in our sector because of retirements or growth in our sector, and if things keep going the way they are, it's going to be about 1.9 million of those jobs that we can't fill. That's not sustainable. That doesn't allow us to be the leader in the world.\nMR. LYNCH: Let's--I want to--I want to talk about the administration's industrial policies, which are, at least in part, in good part, probably, responsible for some of this manufacturing uptick, which is the good news.\nAdvertisement\nMR. TIMMONS: No question.\nMR. LYNCH: But this sort of government-directed steering of the economy or steering of capital represents a big change from the market-oriented policies that we've seen in recent decades. Are you uncomfortable at all with the notion of government getting bigger and more involved in the economy?\nMR. TIMMONS: So I don't think there's any pure system when it comes to a free market economy, David. I think--you know, I think you have to be, again, pragmatic.\nThe fact is that China, sure, they're an economic competitor, and, you know, we can--we can deal with that if we were dealing with a level playing field and they were truly a free market economy, but they're not. They're a command economy. They manipulate. They manipulate markets. They manipulate how products are made.\nAdvertisement\nBut even more important than that is our national security interests. So, for instance, CHIPS and Science, that legislation that passed that provided billions of dollars of grants to incentivize chip fab facilities being built here in the United States, that was absolutely critical for our national security. We could not allow these devices to be made in the country where we may not always have the ability to have decent relations.\nSo I was pleased from a national security perspective that we invested there, but it also adds to our economic security, because everything today, as we all know, has some sort of an electronic component or a chip in its manufacture, in its body. So we have to have that capability here as well as some of the other investments, I think, that have been really important for ensuring our worldwide mantle of leadership.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, many of these industrial policy projects that the administration is promoting are in the clean energy space aimed at addressing climate change. Many of them are located, as you know, in so-called \"red states,\" where Republican lawmakers often have voted against the legislation that has created the projects in the first place. So what do you think is the likelihood that that kind of work, that kind of funding would survive a change in administrations?\nAdvertisement\nMR. TIMMONS: Well, to the best of my understanding, a lot of these--a lot of these grants and loans are going to be moving very quickly. The administration is trying to move them through the process very quickly.\nBut, you know, I'd like to take the politics maybe out of some of--some of these discussions. Yes, there are philosophical disagreements on how we're enacting some of these policies that are part of the president's manufacturing strategy, but ultimately, we all have the same goal. And the same goal is for the United States to be the leader, for the United States to grow its manufacturing base, and for the United States to be able to increase the number of workers in the manufacturing sector, because, quite frankly, manufacturing has led to a stronger and healthier quality of life and economic status for Americans all across the board. And politicians of both parties understand that.\nThey might look at things a little bit differently, right? So you may see--you may see some elected officials say, well, let's have a program where we can spend money, and you might have others say, well, let's have a program where you can incentivize through tax policy. I think either of those can work, and we can debate all day about which one is more effective or which one is more free market oriented. But ultimately, we all want to get to the same objective.\nAdvertisement\nMR. LYNCH: You mentioned earlier the need for smart regulation. I'd be interested if you could provide sort of your favorite example of a grossly misguided regulation that puts burdens on your members that would strike the audience as almost ludicrous, not something that's a minor irritant that might take just a little bit more paperwork but something that you think is just obviously counterproductive and ought to be eliminated.\nMR. TIMMONS: Well, you want to make this really dramatic, it seems, so I--[laughs].\nMR. LYNCH: No, I want to--I want to give--I'm giving you a chance to--\nMR. TIMMONS: Yeah, I understand.\nMR. LYNCH: --help explain to viewers what changes you need to see.\nMR. TIMMONS: Yeah. Let me start with a positive because I think--I think--and then I'll get to a specific regulation that answers your question.\nOn the positive side, I can point to the Securities and Exchange Commission and their work about two years ago to introduce a climate emissions regulation that was going to be imposed on all businesses of all sizes. We had some real concerns with that proposal, because in the end, we couldn't comply. There was literally no way to comply with that regulation. This was an example of a regulatory agency, regulators, and the business community collaborating, talking, discussing what the goals and objectives are from the regulatory side or the regulator side of the aisle, and what the possibilities were and the realities were from the business side. And in the end, David, the SEC literally addressed every single thing that we said was problematic. So that's an example of how you can work together.\nNow, we don't love that regulation. Let me just be very clear about that. But it's a regulation that I think is at least achievable, and the agency listened. The other side of that is the particulate matter, PM2.5 regulation that was issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, which is--you know, it is onerous for manufacturers and actually is counter to what the president is trying to achieve through his manufacturing strategy. What the PM2.5 regulation will do, quite simply, is it will shut down the ability of businesses to invest and build new facilities in many communities across this country. It's going to cause mayors and governors to make a choice between, say, building a bridge that might be available or might be possible through the infrastructure funding legislation that was passed or having the private sector come in and build a new chips facility. These choices are going to be--these tradeoffs are going to be present very soon. That regulation is now in place, and it's going to cause a lot of very difficult decisions, and it's going to impede growth. It's going to impede the ability of manufacturers who could actually help solve the climate issue, to build facilities and innovate and create new products, to be a part of the solution. So it's one of those regulations that, frankly, is just not smart.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, you mentioned permitting issues a bit earlier, and that's been a perennial complaint for years. There was some movement, I think, at one point last year. There was a brief glimmer of hope for improvement that, I think, faded away. Are you at all optimistic about anything changing in that regard, say, in this calendar year, or is that inevitably something that gets pushed over to a new administration or the next administration?\nMR. TIMMONS: I am always an optimist, and on this, I am really optimistic. And the reason I am, David, is because Republicans and Democrats have both indicated--or they have all indicated to me that they're very concerned about the permitting process.\nIf you think about it, again, from the business perspective, where you want to put that shovel in the ground, but it's taking years for a permit to be able to do so, whether that's because of state agencies or federal agencies, and then you have--think about the clean energy investments that the administration is making right now, we simply can't get things built because of the lack of a streamlined permitting process.\nAnd then also think about if we're--if we're talking about our competition with China and China's ability to produce and mine critical minerals for many of those batteries and clean energy technologies that we're trying to employ here in the United States, but our inability to do so here because it takes 15 years to get a mine permitted, 15 years from now, I'm sorry, but China will have the advantage.\nSo we've got to figure out how to make sure that we are protecting safety, we're protecting environmental standards, but moving the process along much more quickly. And I would say also coordinating the various agencies that have to sign off on permits, coordinating their work, so that you have one--you know, one timeline rather than, say, 10 timelines, because you have 10 agencies that are part of the process.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, the unemployment rate remains quite low by historical standards, still plenty of job openings out there. What's the labor market look like for your members? Are they having trouble finding enough workers? And is that going to be a choke point, particularly for some of these projects in the chip world, where I think some of the efforts out in Arizona by TMSC have already run into snags in terms of the availability of skilled labor?\nMR. TIMMONS: Yeah, it is definitely a problem. As I mentioned, we have almost 600,000 jobs open in our sector.\nI'm really proud of our industry, though, because there are, of course, many open jobs throughout the entire economy. I don't know what it is now, eight-, nine-, ten million open jobs. But I'm proud of our industry because they took it head on, and they are continuing to do so. Not only are they upskilling and training the workers that are part of their--part of their employee base now so that those jobs are future-proofed as new technologies come on board, but they've also invested in programs to recruit the next generation of manufacturing workers.\nHere at the NAM, we had a campaign called Creators Wanted, and Creators Wanted went to communities all over the country to inspire young people with a--kind of a hands-on escape room concept to show them what skills are necessary in manufacturing. And, David, you could just see these young people come out beaming and saying, \"I want to be a part of manufacturing. How can I do this?\"\nWe went to my hometown of Circleville, Ohio, for the Circleville Pumpkin Show. We had thousands of kids going through that experience and coming out and saying, \"I want a job,\" and that's really important, because in central Ohio, you have two very big investments. You have the Honda and LG battery facility that's being created in the Mount Sterling area, and then you have the Intel facility that I was happy to attend the groundbreaking of with President Biden in the Columbus area. And those two plants alone are going to hire thousands and thousands of people.\nSo we've got an obligation, right, as the industry to take this on, but making sure that we have the right educational tools in place at the local level and having states work with us, which many are doing to ensure that we have the technical training that's necessary, that's important as well.\nMR. LYNCH: Yep. Well, Jay, I've still got several more questions for you, but unfortunately, we are out of time. So thanks for a great conversation. Jay Timmons, thanks for joining us today.\nMR. TIMMONS: Thanks for having me, David.\nMR. LYNCH: Next up, we'll hear from the President of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Valerie Sheares Ashby, right after this. So please stay with us.\n[Video plays]\nMR. ETZWILER: Hi. I'm David Etzwiler, CEO of the Siemens Foundation. Last fall, the Siemens Foundation created an EV charging workforce initiative called Everyone Charging Forward. Because the electric vehicle charging sector is experiencing rapid growth, there is and will be for the foreseeable future a significant need for workers in EV manufacturing, installation, and maintenance. What we recognized was a confluence of need and opportunity to draw more people from all backgrounds into this growing industry, and that's really what this initiative is all about, working together with our government, business, labor, philanthropy, and community partners to ensure everyone, especially those from underserved communities, has access to resources that can connect them to clean energy careers.\nHere with me today is Cheryl Sanford, director of Workforce Programming, MUST Careers, in Detroit, Michigan, which is developing a career readiness program with a heavy focus on the electrical field.\nHi, Cheryl. How are you?\nMS. SANFORD: I'm doing well, David. Thank you for having the conversation today.\nMR. ETZWILER: Absolutely, my pleasure.\nCheryl, MUST works with the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program, one of the foundation's partners, implementing statewide strategies and local partnerships. Tell us more about EVITP's and MUST's Electric Fast Track program and how it operates.\nMS. SANFORD: Thank you. I'm really excited about this new initiative in partnership with Siemens.\nThe program is really twofold, the purpose of the program is twofold. One is to upskill the current electricians with the EVITP training and certification, and that's for electricians that will be working on the EV charging installation projects going on all over the country.\nThe second part of the program--and this is really something that's new. It's only been piloted in--well, in our experience, we've piloted this program once in Michigan, and that is to provide a work-based learning opportunity for individuals who are thinking maybe they want a career in EV electrical industry but lack that hands-on experience. So this is an opportunity to provide career awareness and some of the hands-on experience that we always hear from our contractors. You know, when we're trying to help individuals make that connection and get into building trades, especially electrical, they lack the hands-on experience. So this is an opportunity to do that with a 10-week paid work experience component that will really take individuals who have had some classroom training and provide them with the kind of work-based learning, hands-on experience. So they'll get to work alongside journeyworker electricians and really decide if this is the best fit for them.\nMR. ETZWILER: Cheryl, that's great background. Help us understand the current demographic makeup of the electrical field and the future of the sector. Why the focus on new entrants?\nMS. SANFORD: Because we know over the foreseeable future that we are going to need more electricians, based on the historic investment in infrastructure in the country, which is fantastic.\nBut we know, for example, in the state of Michigan, that between now and 2030, we will need approximately 13.5 percent increase in electricians. In North Carolina, which is the other area where we will be piloting the program, the demand is expected to increase up to 17 percent.\nMR. ETZWILER: Wow.\nMS. SANFORD: And we know just looking at the demographics, again, in the state of Michigan, when you look at construction overall, less than 6 percent of the construction apprentices are females, approximately 17 percent for people of color, and for youth, it's less than 1 percent. So all of this investment provides a historic opportunity for us to really expand the pipeline of talent and to be more inclusive and diverse and to do it in a very intentional way. So we want to make sure that we are reaching out to those previously underserved populations to make sure that they are included, and the fact is that more and more of the skilled electricians are retiring.\nSo according to the National Electrical Contractors Association, approximately 10,000 electricians--this is nationwide, but 10,000 electricians retire every year. About 7,000 are coming in. So we--you know, we know that there's a gap, and again, that provides an opportunity for programs like the Electric Fast Track to fill that need and to reach out to those individuals who probably never thought they could work in this field. They never even thought about it. So with career exploration outreach, it just gives us an opportunity to be much more inclusive.\nMR. ETZWILER: Yeah. So much urgency in the statistics you give. What are the partnership trends or best practices that you're seeing around the country? What, for example, is necessary and helpful in these types of partnerships in local communities?\nMS. SANFORD: Well, we know from the work that we've done in this space, and MUST and EVITP have worked together for a long time working on providing those kind of programming opportunities for the building trades industry. And what we've learned is that industry engagement is key, and those partnerships are really key to the successful outcomes of this kind of program. So if we don't have industry at the table, then we're just training for the sake of training. We want to make sure that every participant who goes through this program will have a successful outcome, hopefully employment in the industry in a registered apprenticeship, and if by chance they decide after 10 weeks of working in the Electric Fast Track that this just isn't a good fit for you--maybe you've decided, you know, you thought you wanted to be an electrician, but you really don't--we have workforce development partners, community-based partners. And this provides an opportunity for us to redirect them back through the system.\nSo, you know, we don't want it to be a failure for someone because you decided you don't want to work in the construction industry or in the electrical industry. Our goal is to help those individuals find the occupation that is a better fit for them.\nMR. ETZWILER: That's great, Cheryl. That's a wonderful overview of all of that.\nAnd if I had to underline one takeaway from today's discussion, it's the importance of business, labor, and communities coming together to engage and support new and diverse entrants in the clean economy workforce. It's the right thing to do, and it's imperative to the success of our country's decarbonization, economic, and security goals. We simply must ensure participation by everyone in our economy.\nCheryl, thank you for being here today and for the insightful conversation. I look forward to our continued partnership, and with that, I'll turn it back to the Washington Post.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nMS. SANFORD: Thank you.\n[Video plays]\nMR. LYNCH: Hello, and welcome back. For those just tuning in, I'm David J. Lynch, global economics correspondent here at The Post.\nI'm joined now by Valerie Sheares Ashby, president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Valerie, welcome to Washington Post Live.\nDR. ASHBY: Thank you so much. It's a pleasure to be here.\nMR. LYNCH: Well, we're glad to have you with us.\nNow, for any of our viewers who may not be familiar with UMBC and its historical role, its traditional role as an enormous pipeline of Black graduates in the STEM fields, perhaps you could just take a moment and educate us all. In particular, what was the opportunity that attracted you to the school a couple of years ago, and how do you plan to build on its already impressive legacy?\nDR. ASHBY: Well, I so appreciate that question. This is the question that energizes me daily.\nSo I'm really proud of UMBC. So for those who may not be familiar, UMBC is located in this Baltimore County area, which is very close to Washington, D.C., obviously, and so we are situated in a place where we have industry around us, we have government agencies around us, where the STEM workforce that they need is just tremendous. And we're also situated, obviously, in the state of Maryland that is very diverse, and so we are a public institution. It is our job to actually educate the Marylanders first and provide this workforce that is needed, and UMBC has been a leader for decades in this space.\nWe produce--we're number one in the production of Black undergraduates in the fields of the life sciences, mathematics, and computer science combined. That's quite a feat for us. And we produce these students, and they go on to do amazing things, not only in the state of Maryland but all over the country.\nWe're also the number one producer of Black graduates who go on to get MD-PhDs. So now they are scholar researchers in medicine, and so we're really proud of that. That has been our history.\nAnd I would just note that the goal is just to produce excellent scholars, and it turns out that when you actually have a goal of producing excellent scholars, you become more inclusive.\nAnd so for UMBC, part of what we say in our vision statement, in the very first sentence, is that we are not going to call ourselves excellent if we're not inclusive, and so that really then has been the impetus for everything that we do for years. And so we have now achieved this status, and it has become a part of our culture that we just expect all of our students to be excellent. And underrepresented minority students, in particular, are just thriving in this environment.\nAnd by the way, that's what drew me here. I am a chemist by training, as you know. So to come to an institution with this history and at this moment for our country, we really need to continue to do what we're doing, and we not only need us to do it, but we need all of higher education to really take this on as a priority.\nMR. LYNCH: Well, first of all, I promise not to ask you any questions about chemistry. That would be a\nshort conversation, at least on this side of the camera.\nDR. ASHBY: [Laughs] If I had a blackboard, I'd draw some organic chemistry formulas behind me, but, okay, not this time.\n[Laughter]\nMR. LYNCH: Not this time.\nSo Black students, in general, of course, are underrepresented in the sciences but not at your institution. So what's your secret? What should other universities be doing that they're not doing if they wanted to replicate your success?\nDR. ASHBY: So, you know, we can look back and really understand and learn, you know, some best practices that aren't rocket science, which that's the good news. It's not rocket science. Literally, anybody who has the desire can do this.\nAnd so what we have learned, mostly as a start from our Meyerhoff Scholars Program, which is nationally known, is that if you give students the opportunity, you give them the support, you give them a cohort, you give them the encouragement, you give them the opportunity to do research and to see themselves as scientists, then you really have given them everything that they need. And those students become successful. They get the highest grades in our courses. They go on to do internships and great research, and they go on to get PhDs and MDs and MD-PhDs. And so it's about this culture where our expectation is that our students will be successful, and so it is not about remedial anything. They're quite capable. The question is, are we giving them all the opportunities and the support in order to be successful in these disciplines? So that's the way we have approached this.\nMR. LYNCH: Let's talk a little bit about national policy now. I don't know if you caught our earlier segment, but we were talking a little bit about the Biden administration's industrial policies, particularly in the area of semiconductors, clean renewable energies, and the like. What's your assessment of the outlook for producing the size, skilled workforce that we're going to need to make those programs a success, and do you see that--those areas as an opportunity for your future graduates?\nDR. ASHBY: Without a doubt. These are the areas that we are training our students. It is the basic sciences. It is engineering. It's the social sciences. It's the fullness of the liberal arts education that's rooted in STEM. So absolutely, our students are qualified now and will be qualified for emerging technologies.\nThe other piece to this is that we are very clear about giving our students--I heard in a previous--in the previous segment--hands-on opportunities as a part of that preparation.\nSo for example, you were talking to Jay, who was mentioning about--talking about manufacturing. There, we have real digitized manufacturing facilities on this campus where students can now understand cybersecurity threats in relationship to digitized manufacturing, and not only that, we are upscaling those who are actually in the manufacturing fields, where these are professionals who come onto our campus. And they are allowed to now--they can upscale and really understand the connection between cybersecurity and manufacturing. And so it's a combination of tools that we are using to prepare our students, and we absolutely have students that are so well prepared. And the question is, how many more can we produce?\nMR. LYNCH: Now, artificial intelligence is obviously a topic that everyone in business and government and your neighborhood is talking about these days, and there seem to be broadly two views of it in a labor market context. Mark Cuban, I saw, quoted the other day, saying that the disruption we're going to experience in the next several years will dwarf anything we've seen in past technological changes.\nAt the same time, David Autor of MIT, who's a very well-known economist who popularized the term \"China shock\" in regard to the effect on unskilled labor in this country from the rise of China's manufacturing power, he's actually quite optimistic about the effects of AI. He says it may, in fact, revitalize the middle class. I'm curious what your view is, as someone who's in the field. Should we be worried about this from a labor market standpoint, or is it mostly upside?\nDR. ASHBY: So I would have to say to you, first of all, that I am an optimist, and as a scientist, new technology does not scare me. And I understand all of the downsides and the possibilities for people who--look, anytime you have new technology, people can use it for bad or they can use it for good, and so it's our job to actually train our students in order--so that they will be able to use the technologies for good. So it does not scare me.\nAnd also, I should just mention that not everybody needs a college degree. Let me just say that. So when we talk about the workforce that's going to be needed, it's going to be a number of college-educated students. It's going to be a number of students who have advanced degrees. But it's also going to be people who are going to community colleges or people who have high school diplomas who just have the skill set.\nSo we have an opportunity to have an impact on the education from high school all the way through an advanced terminal degree, and so with that kind of optimism, I'm confident that we can upscale a workforce that is broad. And also, by the way, I should mention this is why universities that educate their students in a liberal arts fashion are so important, because we will not only teach our students the science, but we will teach them the ethics. And that's critical for what we are talking about whether you--and by the way, we need to do that in high school and middle school and every other place. But that's why I am optimistic.\nI see our students. They are brilliant. They want to use this technology for good, and that gives me hope every day.\nMR. LYNCH: I think that last remark about liberal arts deserves a moment, because I think some people see a sharp choice between what they regard as meaningful, career-focused endeavors like the STEM fields, and then liberal arts, which is regarded as some sort of playground of listening to music and going to plays. But it's really much more than that, isn't it? It's about learning how to think and learning where ideas come from and learning the history even of scientific thought.\nDR. ASHBY: Yes, without a doubt. And so this is a place where we are not delivering a full education, if it is not a full liberal arts and sciences education. It is all of those disciplines that you just mentioned.\nBut just think about any of these scientific fields, and think about how you are going to apply that in a community where you don't understand their history. You don't understand the challenges. You don't understand the environment. You don't understand the culture. So we can produce all sorts of wonderful technologies, but communities may not adopt them or they may not trust our science if we don't understand how to enter communities and how to engage them as a part of the scientific process. So this is really important.\nAnd let me just throw in a little bit of data, because I know sometimes people say, oh, anecdotally, people love a liberal arts education. Ninety-two percent of my undergraduates walk out of this institution either going into employment or into graduate school, and 93 percent of them, of my undergraduates who have--with a college degree finished their four-year degree, are in disciplines that they studied. And so I just, you know--the talk about a liberal arts education and music and art and all those things and that's all you do--and let me just also say, I think it's a little bit of a matter of the mental health and well-being of our entire world.\nPeople need a whole life, and a whole life includes music and art and understanding religion and culture and the environment, all of those things, and there's something that happens in communities when people are happy. And so when you just think about just the ways that we don't even know how to have conversations with each other anymore, not just about STEM-related issues, but about anything--so I'm a real fan of a liberal arts and sciences education. I am a chemist, but I treasure my religion class and my philosophy class and my writing course and my communications courses. So it's a full package.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, UMBC obviously remains quite affordable, but colleges across the country are under pressure, deservedly so, for rising costs. There's a lot of frustration about tuition bills, and you hear a lot of voices saying, you know, with it being just so expensive, you know, college just isn't worth it anymore. What would you say to those folks, even acknowledging that, you know, college is not necessarily for everybody? But what do you say to folks who say it's just gotten way out of hand how expensive it is?\nDR. ASHBY: So several things. So first, let me say I am delighted to be in the University System of Maryland, which is a public system in the state of Maryland, and our costs in public higher education in the state of Maryland are, you know, relatively reasonable compared to many other institutions across the country.\nThat being said, there literally is not a single other game changer in a person's life that's more significant than a college education. It changes our health. It changes our communities. It changes our service. It changes the way we engage the political system. It changes everything that makes a life full.\nAnd for people particularly who come from economically challenged backgrounds, there is no greater game changer than a college degree, and so this is critical for us to state.\nNow, I do appreciate all of the talk about how expensive it is. Indeed, it can be. Even at our reasonable cost, it can seem expensive. Therefore, it's incumbent upon us to actually make it more accessible. So whether that's through increased need-based financial aid or various types of scholarships, it is important for us to make it available to students. It changes their lives. It changes their families' lives for generations. It changes communities. But it's our job in higher education to make our case and so to really help families understand the difference maker that this is.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, the Supreme Court last year severely limited the use of affirmative action and race in college admissions. How are universities adjusting to this change? How worried are you that that's going to be a further headwind working against efforts to increase minority representation in the STEM fields in particular?\nDR. ASHBY: So let me speak just about UMBC, and then maybe I can speak about it more broadly. I'm really proud. I go back to your original question of why I decided to come to UMBC and what drew me here.\nThis is an institution that, again, has understood that if you are not inclusive, you cannot be excellent. So when you think about STEM fields where we're talking about innovation and creativity, you need diverse teams of people from diverse backgrounds, diverse disciplines. All of that is necessary to be as creative and innovative as possible, and so for UMBC, this is not a challenge for us because we are simply looking for excellence. And by doing so, we are actually very inclusive, and so we have a campus that looks like our community, which is a beautiful thing.\nAnd so for me, this is just rooted in excellence. If we don't have multiple perspectives at the table and in the creation process and in the problem-solving process and the solution-making process, then we cannot be excellent.\nSo for us, it is not a challenge. If you walk across our campus, it looks like our community. It looks like the world, and because of that, students are getting a phenomenal education.\nNow, if you were actually using quotas to just check the box, to say that we have some diversity on our campus, you have a problem, because now you have to decide how serious are you about that, and do you really think you can be excellent without it?\nNow, that's--I'm glad that's not our question. It is not. But for universities and maybe some other institutions where it wasn't a priority, because you didn't really believe that excellence equaled diversity or diversity equaled excellence, now this is a challenge.\nAnd so I would say that my students who sit in a classroom, whether it's in the social sciences or humanities or natural sciences and they sit in that classroom with a diverse group of students to discuss hard, challenging topics, they are receiving a world-class education. And so it's a challenge for us in higher education to decide, do we really believe you can be excellent without diversity or not? And at UMBC, that's not our question.\nMR. LYNCH: Well, I think that's a great place to end on. Valerie Sheares Ashby, thanks so much for joining us today on Washington Post Live.\nDR. ASHBY: It's been my pleasure. Thank you so much.\nMR.

And if you can't wait a few months for approval, add $2,805 per application for expedited processing.\nAdvertisement\nIf the application is not accepted, that money is not refunded \u2014 on top of losses from a canceled tour and missing out on 'significant, potentially career-changing opportunities,' says Jen Jacobsen, executive director at The Artist Rights Alliance.\nIf a musician has support staff, a backing band or other employees to bring on the tour, these individuals need visas, too.\n'Even if you're Capitol Records and you have all the money in the world to throw at it, you still can't get rid of U.S. bureaucracy,' says immigration attorney Gabriel Castro.\nAll international musicians require work authorization to perform in the U.S. There are few exemptions: Those are reserved for 'showcases' through the Visa Waiver Program \u2014 like what is often used at South by Southwest, where international artists perform exclusively at official showcases, without pay and for exposure.\nAdvertisement\nCurrently, there are few hurdles for U.S. musicians looking to enter other countries for the specific purpose of earning money through live performances. According to Castro, American performers are able to enter most countries without a visa and under an exception to tourism rules.\nWHAT'S THE IMPACT ON ARTISTS?\nGareth Paisey, singer of the independent, seven-piece Welsh band Los Campesinos!, will tour in the U.S. this June. The band made sure to apply for visas before the April 1 cut off, a difference of paying $3,220 or $11,305 in fees. Next time they have to get a visa, he says they'll likely try to squeeze two tours in one year \u2014 the length of their particular visa \u2014 to make up the cost.\nHe says the application process requires providing an itinerary for the full year and supplemental evidence: press clippings to justify their status as 'career musicians,' and testimonials from people of note \u2014 often from more famous musicians.\nAdvertisement\n'Nobody gets into a band because they've got a passion for making cash flow forecasts,' he says. 'It's unfair to expect people who are brilliant at writing songs to also be brilliant at filling out a 20-page visa application.'\nAfter Brexit, he says touring in Europe for U.K. acts has become more complicated, but the U.S. process is by far the most complex \u2014 both in terms of paperwork and what it represents for music moving forward.\n'This idea that you need to be a career musician to get a visa, and visa fees are going up, increases the idea that music is a competition,' says Paisey. 'And part of that competition is making as much money as you can \u2014 like that's the only valid way to participate in the music industry.'\nWHY HAVE THE FEES JUMPED SO MUCH?\nTwo reasons: They hadn't in some time, and because immigration officials are scrutinizing the process more closely.\nAdvertisement\nThe last increase was in 2016, when fees grew from $325 to $460.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe U.S. government is 'putting more and more burden on the application process,' says Castro of BAL Sports and Entertainment Practice, which specializes in visas for musicians, entertainers and athletes.\nHe says 20 years ago, applications were just two or three pages. Now, they're 15 or 20 pages.\n'And those are just the forms before supporting evidence,' he says. 'Now I'm submitting documents that are 200 pages, 300 pages long just to explain why this band should be traveling throughout the United States.'\nOfficials 'might have done better to look at inefficiencies in the system to save money,' he says.\nPaisey says he's heard that the increase will allow the USCIS to 'get rid of the backlog... But is that because you're going to employ more staff or is it probably because you're going to get less applications?' he wonders, because it's going to benefit 'people who can afford to go than rather than who wants to go or has the fan base to go.'\nWHY HAVE THE APPLICATIONS CHANGED OVER TIME?\nCastro says some of it is to account for 'abuses in the system \u2014 to make sure that individuals that are coming here for certain activities actually have those activities in place,' but the increased scrutiny is a lingering effect from Trump administration's immigration policies.\nAdvertisement\n'The immigration process overall became more difficult for everyone. Whether you're coming across the border, whether you're coming here to perform at Madison Square Garden, whatever it is,' he says. 'That has changed the culture of U.S. immigrations agencies.'\nWHO DOES THIS HARM?\nIndependent and emerging talent, as well as ensembles and groups.\n' Dua Lipa, the Rolling Stones, they're going to pay these fees. It's not even a rounding error. They could misplace $1,200 in their budgets and they wouldn't even notice,' says Castro. 'It's the indie rock bands, niche acts, jazz musicians from Japan who will be affected.'\n'Every dime counts. They have very small margins,' he adds.\n'We've already got a problem with not enough musical acts breaking through to the next level,' Paisey says. 'And this is going to stop them from getting that chance in the States.'\nAdvertisement\nTouring in the U.S. is a pipe dream for many independent acts, he says, and it is in danger of 'not even being a dream.'\nJacobsen points out that there will be ripple effects as well: Musicians, drivers, tour managers and beyond who would be hired to work with international talent will lose work, venues will lose fruitful bookings, festivals that focus on international talent will reduce in size, the costs of tickets could increase and so on.\nShe says these fee increases could affect U.S. music culture \u2014 'the richness of the music ecosystem in terms of diversity of genres.'\nIf lesser known, global genre artists cannot perform in the U.S., audiences will miss out on a critical cultural exchange. 'We need the marketplace to be friendly and accessible to all those different types of musicians,' she says.\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n'You're going to see a decrease in international acts coming to the United States,' says Castro. 'And maybe it's decreased frequency more than a decrease in the absolute number. We'll see less and less emerging artists.\nAdvertisement\n'The harder you make it for them to come to the United States, the less you're going to see them here.'\nLocal economies, too, will feel the result: 'It's not just the mid-sized venue in Cleveland that will feel it, but the parking lot down the street, the restaurants and bars people go to before and after.'\nAnd there could be long-term consequences that have yet to be seen. 'There is an absolute concern that there would be a reciprocal effect,' says Jacobson.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Maria Sherman","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RC7VXUX4GMI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":4.3757443,"_id":"dac147e95e78d4c27798e9a4d832474b"},{"title":"Ukraine's foreign minister says Israel's response to an Iranian aerial attack shows what Kyiv needs","author":"Susie Blann","published_date":"2024-04-15 13:41:24","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/15/russia-ukraine-war-israel-iran-air-defense/da06a204-fb2d-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Ukraine's foreign minister says the success of Israel and its allies in largely thwarting a massive Iranian missile and drone attack shows what Ukraine could achieve against Russian aerial barrages if it had more support from its partners","summary":"KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 The success of Israel and its allies in largely thwarting a massive Iranian missile and drone attack shows what Ukraine could achieve against Russian aerial barrages if it had more support from its partners, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Monday.\nA recent Russian aerial campaign targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure and other targets has wrought extensive damage, and Ukrainian officials have pleaded with the country's Western allies to provide more air defense systems as the war stretches into its third year.\nIsrael's defense system, with assistance from the U.S. and Britain \u2014 countries that are also supporting Ukraine's war effort \u2014 is credited with preventing serious damage or casualties in Sunday's attack by Iran using more than 300 drones and missiles.\nKuleba, speaking to reporters in Kyiv, urged Ukraine's allies to 'give us what we need and we will do the rest of the job.'\nAdvertisement\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made the same point late Sunday, referring to the Iranian attack. 'The whole world sees what real defense is. It sees that it is feasible,' he wrote on Telegram.\nRussia last week fired nearly 130 exploding drones, more than 80 Russian missiles and nearly 700 guided aerial bombs at Ukraine, Zelenskyy said Sunday on the social platform X. He has pleaded with allies to send more Patriot systems.\nHowever, the Institute for the Study of War noted there are key differences between the challenges faced by Israel and by Ukraine.\n'Russian forces launch drones and missiles from throughout occupied Ukraine and in close proximity to Ukraine from within Russia, affording Ukrainian air defenders a fraction of the time that Israel and its allies leveraged to successfully blunt the mass Iranian missile and drone strike,' the Washington think tank said in an assessment late Sunday.\nAdvertisement\nThe scale and improved accuracy of recent Russian attacks have unnerved Ukraine's defenders. They say Kremlin forces now have better intelligence and fresh tactics in their campaign to destroy Ukraine's power grid and crush its economy.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said Sunday he will try to move the package forward this week.\n'The exhaustion of U.S.-provided air defenses resulting from delays in the resumption of U.S. military assistance to Ukraine combined with improvements in Russian strike tactics have led to increasing effectiveness of the Russian strike campaign in Ukraine,' the Institute for the Study of War said.\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Susie Blann,Illia Novikov","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2FFJKOX3FUI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":4.3144693,"_id":"0e6753f30ea7b400abc1797195753efc"},{"title":"Anti-Trump Republican Larry Hogan navigates dangerous political terrain in pivotal Senate contest","author":"Steve Peoples","published_date":"2024-04-17 04:20:10","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/17/larry-hogan-republican-maryland-senate-majority-democrat/c75c79e0-fc71-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Larry Hogan has transformed Maryland's sleepy Senate race into a top-tier contest in the fight for the Senate majority","summary":"STEVENSVILLE, Md. \u2014 Andy DePaola welcomed Larry Hogan to his family's restaurant with a big smile and a handshake. The warning came a few minutes later.\nDePaola, the 64-year-old namesake of DePaola's Bagel and Brunch here in Maryland's conservative Eastern Shore, whispered to a reporter that Hogan better avoid disparaging former President Donald Trump.\n'I'm a Trumper,' DePaola said as Hogan posed for pictures and made small talk with the excited breakfast crowd on a recent Friday morning. 'I think Larry would be better off if he kept how he felt about Trump under his breath.'\nThe brief exchange during a weeks-long bus tour illustrates a stark political reality for the popular Republican former governor, who has single-handedly transformed Maryland's sleepy Senate race into a top-tier contest in the national fight for the Senate majority. Hogan, who was perhaps the most outspoken anti-Trump Republican governor in the nation, can ill afford to lose any pieces of his delicate and diverse political coalition.\nAdvertisement\nHe's hoping to become the first Republican in more than 40 years to win a Senate seat in this deep-blue state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1 statewide, with much of the Democratic support in Baltimore and the suburbs of Washington. Over the next six months, Hogan will have to fend off political threats from all sides.\nAs Trump loyalists eye the 67-year-old businessman with skepticism, Democrats are counting on abortion rights to make Hogan's historic challenge even harder. But the R after his name may ultimately prove the most serious liability for Hogan in a state Trump lost by 33 points four years ago.\nIf Hogan wins Maryland's open Senate seat, Republicans would almost certainly claim the majority in the U.S. Senate \u2014 and with it, the power to control the agenda and judicial nominations for the next two years, at least.\nAdvertisement\nIn an interview, Hogan confirmed that he would caucus with Republicans in Washington, despite his concerns about Trump's grip on the party. He also vowed not to leave the GOP after the election, even if Trump returns to the White House.\n'I'm a real Republican,' Hogan told The Associated Press, noting that he does not identify with Trump's 'Make America Great Again' movement.\nWhen pressed to explain his concerns about MAGA, and whether he views Trump as a threat to U.S. democracy, Hogan parsed his words carefully.\n'I think certainly there has been some threats,' Hogan said. 'But you know, I think that's not what this campaign is really all about.'\nMeanwhile, Hogan's opponents on the left are only just beginning to organize as Democrats wade through their own nomination process. While Hogan faces token opposition in the GOP, Democrats will pick Hogan's general election opponent next month.\nAdvertisement\nOn Tuesday, a coalition of labor, immigration and progressive groups gathered in the state capital to criticize the former governor for using his veto powers to block legislation to increase abortion access while undermining other Democratic priorities, including health care, environmental protection and education funding.\nThe anti-Hogan event was a reminder that voters in his gubernatorial elections may have been more willing to overlook party affiliation than they will be in a Senate contest that could tilt the balance of power in Washington toward Republicans.\n'Despite him claiming to be a moderate, we know his actions show that he's a staunch Republican,' said 1199 SEIU political director Ricarra Jones, who slammed Hogan's veto of legislation to increase the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour.\nAdvertisement\n'The Senate race in November is bigger than just Maryland,' she continued. 'A Republican-dominated Senate would pursue a drastically different agenda, one that could unwind years of progressive achievements and reshape Maryland's policy landscape in ways that could take generations to reverse.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nMeanwhile, Hogan is trying to avoid divisive political disputes as he reintroduces himself to Maryland voters during a low-profile 'Back to Work' bus tour across the state.\nPerhaps the nation's most vocal anti-Trump Republican governor while in office, Hogan barely mentions Trump's name unless asked about him. He's just as eager to ignore abortion, even though Maryland is among the states that will vote on an abortion referendum this fall \u2014 a winning issue for Democrats in red and blue states alike where ballot questions have appeared since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022.\nAdvertisement\nDemocrats suggest he would support a federal abortion ban, but Hogan insisted in an interview that he would not.\nHe also said he strongly supports in-vitro fertilization and would introduce legislation to protect the practice, an apparent attempt to clarify his position after he declined to say in an Axios interview last month whether he would support such federal protections.\nHe also said he 'would consider voting for' a Maryland ballot measure this fall that would preserve abortion rights, although he argues that it's unnecessary.\nHogan said abortion doesn't comes up much on the campaign trail. He predicted it wouldn't be 'a deciding issue' in the election.\nAsked about the issues that matter most to him, Hogan said he's most focused on ending the divisiveness in Washington, followed by the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, crime and the economy.\nAdvertisement\nBut Hogan largely avoided talking politics at all on his weekend bus tour, preferring to connect with voters on a personal level. He was eager to jump behind restaurant counters to chat with the kitchen staff or pose for pictures welcoming small business owners. And voters, regardless of their party affiliation, embraced him enthusiastically at nearly every stop.\nLanda Mitchell, a 46-year-old old African American woman from Hanover, Maryland, flagged down the governor as he toured small business booths at a weekend boat show. She had met him years ago at a fundraiser for the homeless.\nMitchell said she's not a Republican, but she'd likely vote for Hogan.\n'He's not far right wing. He's over there, but he's not far far over there,' Mitchell said with a laugh, adding that she's not sure whether she'll support President Joe Biden this fall because of the state of the economy. 'I'm far from a Trump supporter, but I go into the grocery store today and I cry.'\nAdvertisement\nCaroline County Sheriff Donald Baker, who welcomed Hogan on a tour through his office, said he also appreciates the former governor's strong support for law enforcement, noting that the sheriff's office didn't get a single applicant for a recent job posting.\n'It's gonna be a tough road for him to navigate,' Baker said of Hogan's political challenge. 'If anybody can do it, I believe Larry Hogan can do it. Why? Because he is a middle-of-the-road kind of guy. He knows how to work with people.'\nAnd as Democrats fight to link him to Trump's Republican Party, Hogan will take pains to distance himself from Trump \u2014 but not too far.\n'We don't want to alienate Trump voters,' Hogan told the AP. 'We need Trump voters. And we need a lot of Biden voters. Maryland is tough.'\nBut he doesn't expect Trump or any other MAGA celebrities to campaign in Maryland on his behalf in the coming months. He said he's not sure if he'll even attend this summer's Republican National Convention, where Trump will formally become the GOP presidential nominee; Hogan skipped Trump's last two nominating conventions as well.\n'I don't think Trump would help me at all. I ran 46 points ahead of him,' Hogan said, noting that Trump lost Maryland in 2020 by a bigger margin than any other state in the nation. 'I don't think he needs to campaign in Maryland.'\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brian Witte,Steve Peoples","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XOXDTUH4OEI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":4.2851706,"_id":"de1c62eb78be15b75d6ab364c61b7173"},{"title":"Testimony in USC case before labor relations board administrative judge could be wrapping up","author":"Joe Reedy","published_date":"2024-04-15 18:28:17","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/04/15/usc-ncaa-nlrb/ed41d762-fb55-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"A National Labor Relations Board complaint against the University of Southern California that alleges student-athletes should be classified as employees could be entering a new stage by the end of the\u2026","summary":"LOS ANGELES \u2014 A National Labor Relations Board complaint against the University of Southern California that alleges student-athletes should be classified as employees could be entering a new stage by the end of the week.\nIn a statement to The Associated Press, USC said the final set of witnesses for all three entities named in the complaint \u2014 the university, the NCAA and the Pac-12 Conference \u2014 will testify when the hearing resumes Tuesday for three days before an administrative judge in Los Angeles.\nThe NLRB's Los Angeles office filed its complaint last May and amended it three months later. It alleges players on USC's football and men's and women's basketball teams are employees and not 'student-athletes' within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act.\nThe NCAA and Pac-12 are part of the complaint because the NLRB considers them joint employers.

Beijing has ignored rulings not in its favor, particularly in the South China Sea, where it is in dispute with five other parties over islands, waterways and undersea resources.\nJapan continues to defend its control over the uninhabited Senkaku island chain, called Diaoyu by China, in the East China Sea, against incursions by the Chinese coast guard.\nTaiwan last week reinforced its foothold in the disputed South China Sea by establishing satellite communications between the main island and its garrison on Taiping Island, also known as Itu Aba, the largest land feature in the highly contested Spratly Island chain. China has created seven artificial islands in the area by piling sand and cement on top of coral reefs and then equipping them with airstrips and other military infrastructure.\nAdvertisement\nZhang said China's territorial sovereignty 'brooks no infringement and its core interests cannot be challenged. We do not provoke trouble, but we will never flinch in face of provocation. The Chinese military will resolutely defend the reunification and interest of the motherland.'\nZhang has spoken in the past of Beijing's determination to take control of the self-governing island republic of Taiwan, which it claims as its own territory, using force if necessary. With its crucial high-tech economy, Taiwan has been building up its defenses on its own and with help from the U.S., where Congress this weekend approved $8 billion in military aid for Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific.\nTaiwan is also building its own submarines and trainer aircraft and waiting on the delivery of upgraded versions of F-16 fighters, battle tanks and other hardware from the U.S.\nAdvertisement\nZhang appeared to press China's unilateralist approach to foreign relations and military conflicts as espoused by Xi Jinping, the top military commander, Communist Party leader and head-of-state for life, who has eliminated all dissenting views.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nChina 'remains committed to resolving maritime disputes with directly concerned countries through friendly consultations, but we will not allow our good faith to be abused,' Zhang said.

But they acknowledged numerous hurdles \u2014 for instance, the lack of access to health insurance, which heightens the financial risks of any accident. Expenses such as 'renting' food-delivery accounts and financing mopeds add to their burdens. And while some drivers say that their ability to deliver food quickly has been praised by customers and restaurants, some D.C. residents have publicly expressed frustration at what they say is erratic and unsafe behavior on the mopeds.\nYonatan Colmenarez, a 31-year-old Venezuelan immigrant, has made a living as a moped delivery driver since February. Today, he's been up since sunrise, but the day has been slow. Around 4:10 p.m., he gets a notification from his Uber Eats account.\nIt takes Colmenarez a little over three minutes to hop on his moped and grab the order at Lou's City Bar about a block away. By 4:21 p.m., he's carefully placed the food in front of a resident's door. Colmenarez has made $3 on the trip, adding to the $90 he has gathered by riding all over Washington. But he'll be out on the street until midnight \u2014 or, at least, until he makes his daily goal of $200.\n'I'm working really hard to contribute to this country that opened its doors to us,' Colmenarez said in Spanish. 'At the end of the day, it's a job many Americans don't want to do, but I do it gladly because I want to show that I appreciate being here and that most of us are good people. After all it took to arrive, being in the United States is truly a blessing from God.'\nAdvertisement\nThe dangerous journey\nThough their paths in the United States differ, many of the Venezuelans' stories begin the same way: Desperation and a hope for a brighter future that propels them to embark on a perilous journey north \u2014 one often marked by death.\nColmenarez was once a member of the Venezuelan army. Over time, he became disenchanted by the country's authoritarian government and how years of mismanagement had resulted in families barely scraping by and struggling to feed their children. In 2016, he defected to Colombia. For seven years, he dabbled in taxi driving, food delivery and document processing \u2014 a skill he acquired while working at Venezuela's civil registry agency. In 2023, Colombia's low salaries, inflation and lack of jobs pushed him to venture to the United States.\nHe left last April with $228 in his pocket, a small backpack and one big prayer: 'I said, \u2018Lord, if it's your will, someday you'll let me arrive. And if I do, I just ask that you help me save enough to buy a house in my country \u2014 whatever else you give me ahead will be blessings.''\nwith $228 in his pocket, a small backpack and one big prayer: 'I said, \u2018Lord, if it's your will, someday you'll let me arrive. And if I do, I just ask that you help me save enough to buy a house in my country \u2014 whatever else you give me ahead will be blessings.''\nColmenarez said he nearly died after crossing a treacherous swath of jungle between Colombia and Panama, known as the Dari\u00e9n Gap. He ran out of money and resorted to drinking from puddles and rivers, which gave him a severe infection.\nBy May 1, Colmenarez had crossed \u2014 mostly by foot \u2014 through Panama, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico, where he turned himself in to U.S. officials in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. After he was processed and released on parole some 13 days later, a friend helped him pay for a flight to D.C. He spent his first night on the street, perched on a park bench and shivering from the cold.\nA new economy\nYonatan Colmenarez, a 31-year-old Venezuelan immigrant, makes a food delivery in Washington, D.C. (Video: Mar\u00eda Luisa Pa\u00fal/The Washington Post)\nThe moped deliveries in D.C. began about two years ago, according to the drivers, with three Venezuelan immigrants and one Colombian. Since then, the trade has evolved into a cottage industry fostered by word-of-mouth recommendations and mutual trust. The drivers share advice, from navigating the labyrinth of popular eateries to establishing online bank accounts with minimal verification. Many buy their mopeds from Facebook Marketplace, local stores or from one man who sells them out of a white van near a Panda Express in Columbia Heights.\ninto a cottage industry fostered by word-of-mouth recommendations and mutual trust.

Many buy their mopeds from Facebook Marketplace, local stores or from one man who sells them out of a white van near a Panda Express in Columbia Heights.\nAfter arriving in D.C., Colmenarez found himself a home in one of the city's shelters and eventually gained work authorization. He decided to take up moped deliveries after hearing about them from a friend, figuring that would be a better option than juggling work at a construction company in Virginia during the day and a midnight shift at McDonald's.\nMcDonald's.\nIn February, he gathered $300 to pay the first weekly installment for a $1,500 moped from a Colombian man who had imported the vehicles from New York City, where immigrants are similarly working as delivery drivers. He opened an Uber Eats account and set up a schedule: delivering from 7 a.m. to about 3 p.m., resting at 4 p.m., a slow period the drivers call 'la hora muerta,' and heading back out from 5 p.m. to midnight, six days a week.\nan Uber Eats account and set up a schedule: delivering from 7 a.m. to about 3 p.m., resting at 4 p.m., a slow period the drivers call 'la hora muerta,' and heading back out from 5 p.m. to midnight, six days a week.\nNow, Colmenarez makes about $4,000 each month \u2014 $700 of which he sends to his wife and three children, who live in a home he bought for them in Venezuela with his earnings, 'just like I asked God for.'\nOthers in the business said they earn about the same amount as Colmenarez, though much depends on the time they put in and the tips they receive. The earnings have allowed many to afford rent in neighborhoods across the region, especially in Maryland, where most of the drivers said they live. Some have also bought cars or higher-quality mopeds. Others help their families and take English lessons at night.\nThe job comes with challenges: The migrants work rain or shine and in snow, ice and wind. Their mopeds have occasionally been stolen \u2014 but some said that, instead of reporting it to police, they try to gather enough money to buy another bike. And car drivers who aren't used to mopeds on the streets seemingly 'just throw themselves at us,' said Raibi Gonz\u00e1lez, 32.\nMany migrants without work permits 'rent' Uber Eats or DoorDash accounts from relatives or friends, often for a weekly fee of $100 to $150. Spokespeople for Uber and DoorDash said they have safeguards in place to try to ensure that everyone using their platforms is who they say they are. Both said anyone using an account fraudulently will be removed from the app.\nYonatan Colmenarez, a Venezuelan immigrant, drives through D.C. to make food deliveries. (Video: Mar\u00eda Luisa Pa\u00fal/The Washington Post)\nSeveral drivers said D.C. police have mostly left them alone, but they fear that any misstep could cause police to crack down on unregistered mopeds, like they've done in New York City.\nCity officials from the Office of Migrant Services and the Highway Safety Office have been meeting with the drivers and their vendors to educate them about local traffic rules.\n'Fortunately, we have seen no uptick in crashes involving these devices and we want it to stay that way,' Deputy Mayor for Operations and Infrastructure Keith Anderson said in a statement.\nTo avoid confrontations with other residents or police, some drivers are seeking to formalize their work with the city. They've proposed having a delimited area where they can park without disturbing traffic; organizing more courses on traffic rules; wearing uniforms that highlight them as delivery drivers; and getting help registering their mopeds \u2014 a process that requires identification documents, such as a passport, that are hard to come by in Venezuela and that many migrants don't have.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nD.C. law requires drivers to register mopeds with more than 55 cubic centimeters of motor power. That means many of the delivery workers' vehicles should be registered, said council member Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1), who represents Columbia Heights and chairs the committee overseeing regulation of for-hire vehicles. Registrations of motor-driven cycles, a category that includes mopeds, more than doubled last year, from 54 in 2022 to 143 in 2023, according to the D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles.\nNadaeu said she supports clarifying the registration rules and educating recent immigrants about the requirements. She added that she arranged for a traffic-control officer at 14th and Irving streets NW to designate an area where the mopeds can park without blocking traffic.\n'As we continue to redesign our streets, we need to be thinking about how to incorporate these vehicles and their uses,' Nadeau said.\nAdvertisement\nThe more the city supports the drivers, the better, said Abel Nu\u00f1ez, executive director of the local immigration advocacy group CARECEN. More organization, he said, could help new immigrants safely make a living without relying on government subsidies.\n'It's a little messy right now, but it has incredible potential to be a win-win for everyone,' Nu\u00f1ez said.\nAndy Brown, owner of popular local chain Andy's Pizza, mostly sees the messiness. He said he has asked delivery apps not to send moped drivers to his restaurants and directs his staff to turn drivers away if they arrive on the bikes anyway.\nMany customers have complained about pizzas being cold after arriving via moped, with air rushing into the box during transit, he said. While Brown appreciates that food delivery enables recent immigrants to work, he's concerned about the impact on his business.\n'There's pros and cons,' he said. 'There just are.'\n\u2018Be an eagle'\nEvery morning, Colmenarez repeats the same mantra: 'Be an eagle.' It's a phrase he borrowed from an interview with a taxi driver he saw online, which, in essence, means going the extra mile for the job.\nFor Colmenarez, that means meticulously choosing his outfit, spraying cologne before leaving and constantly communicating with his customers \u2014 something that, he said, has enabled him to achieve Uber's highest status tier for drivers, Diamond. But it's not always easy: There's usually a language barrier. And he grieves the distance from his family.\n'I've had to cry alone because there are moments when one gets depressed,' he said. 'But then, you say, \u2018Let's go, you can find a way' \u2014 that is, instead of doing bad things, always trying to find a way to make a difference.'\nColmenarez returns to the silver linings: The city he gets to explore. The beauty of the sun as it sets over historic monuments. His children's smiles when they FaceTime. The people he feeds every time his phone pings \u2014 whether they're in the Russell Senate Office Building, the White House, a police station or a random apartment building.\n'I've made it this far in the American Dream,' Colmenarez said.\nFor some, that dream means grinding as delivery drivers for as long as there's appetite in the city. Others hope to land better jobs or make enough money to have their families join them in the United States.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Mar\u00eda Luisa Pa\u00fal,Marisa Iati","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Z2G26PIRI3RVGF2XPIBZ3W6VZE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":4.1676717,"_id":"0da17bd210d14c3aba07f5191602374b"},{"title":"White's Ferry may reopen after owners offer to donate it to Md. county","author":"Justin Wm.

I'm optimistic about how we're going to resolve the remaining issues,' Elrich said. 'It will still take a year to get it operational by the time all of our legal stuff is being cleared.'\nAdvertisement\nA lifeline connecting Maryland and Virginia in an area with few crossings for miles around, White's Ferry began shuttling travelers over the Potomac River before George Washington was president. In the modern era, about 800 cars per day took the 3-minute, 30-second ride between Montgomery and Loudoun counties, according to one study, and demand for trips had been expected to exceed 2,300 per day by 2040.\nHowever, on Dec. 28, 2020, White's Ferry ceased operations \u2014 the victim of a long-running property dispute over landing rights that, despite attempted intervention by the two states, continues more than three years later.\nThe Kuhns said they would donate the service to Montgomery County as 'part of their commitment to getting the ferry operational to preserve history, save jobs and reduce traffic.' They said in their statement they had worked to gain access to the ferry landing on the Virginia side from Rockland Farm, its private owner, and that the farm owners rejected a $1.25 million offer for an easement. Then, they offered the farm the opportunity to buy the ferry 'with no success.'\nAdvertisement\nLibby Devlin, a co-owner of Rockland Farm, said the donation offer was 'great news.'\n'We very much look forward to working with Montgomery and Loudoun to get the ferry open again,' Devlin said in an interview Wednesday. 'I think it should be open pretty soon.'\nThe ferry's demise has had a dramatic impact on the area where it operated. There is no other Potomac crossing between the Point of Rocks and American Legion bridges \u2014 a span of about 35 miles.\n'Despite many good faith efforts to work with the Virginia landowners to make ferry access available, donating the operation became the only solution that made sense to ensure the ferry has a chance to become a functioning part of our lives and local economy,' the Kuhns said in the statement. 'This is not what we had originally envisioned, but we recognize the importance of White's Ferry to our region.'\nAdvertisement\nElrich declined to discuss details of a possible deal but said the main obstacle was 'tension' between the Kuhns and Devlin. If the county owns the ferry, this obstacle will be removed.\n'We could not get the two parties to ever talk to each other,' he said. 'That was a closed door. We had to go back and forth.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nElrich added that eminent domain \u2014 the practice of a government seizing private land \u2014 is a possibility absent a deal. This move, however, would have to be undertaken by officials in Virginia.\n'We thought eminent domain should have been used early on,' Elrich said. 'If there's no way ... other than eminent domain, we hope that the county over there or state over there is willing to do it.'

South Africa's ruling party for the past 30 years, since the country's first all-race elections, the ANC was once unassailable as the party of the country's first Black president, Nelson Mandela, and the vanguard of the liberation movement that ended the abhorrent apartheid regime.\nAdvertisement\nBut after three decades of unchallenged power, the ANC has become ossified, unresponsive, and tainted by corruption and failure to deliver basic services. Kickbacks for state contracts have become rampant, especially during the disastrous administration of Jacob Zuma, who faced multiple indictments and allegations of corrupt dealings and who was briefly imprisoned before being questionably paroled. Last month, the powerful speaker of the national assembly and ANC member, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, was accused by prosecutors of taking $135,000 in bribes when she served as defense minister. She resigned Wednesday.\nNow many young South Africans appear to be turning against the ANC. National elections are due May 29, and most signs and surveys suggest the ANC might for the first time lose its absolute majority in parliament. That would be a good thing.\nWhat happens after the election will be a crucial test for the country's young democracy and will have implications across the continent for other struggling democracies. South Africa has no experience with coalition government. How the various parties navigate the uncertainty \u2014 and even if the ANC would accept a loss of its complete control \u2014 point to a fraught post-election period.\nAdvertisement\nTo be sure, the ANC is still a massive voter turnout machine that commands loyalty among the older generation. It's leaders, including President Cyril Ramaphosa, like to remind voters that many of the country's problems stem from the inequalities of the repugnant apartheid regime. But among younger voters, that message falls short.\nFollow this author Editorial Board 's opinions\nFollow this author\nEditorial Board\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nIf the ANC lands just a few seats shy of a majority, it could assemble a coalition with independents and tiny parties. But if its losses are bigger \u2014 and some projections put its support as low as 40 percent \u2014 then the ANC will need to join forces with one of the larger established parties to maintain its hold on government. . Which way the ANC turns will determine its economic direction as well as its future foreign policy, including relations with the United States.\nThe current main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, is expected to come in second. An ANC-DA alliance would likely ensure a centrist liberal economic policy scaling back the heavy state role in the economy. The DA has also been more critical of Russia's invasion of Ukraine than the ANC, which has adopted a neutral position. The DA runs the provincial government in Western Cape, considered in public opinion surveys to be South Africa's best-run province. But the Democratic Alliance suffers from the stigma of being seen as the party favored by the country's White minority.\nAdvertisement\nAnother party poised to do well is an ANC offshoot, the Economic Freedom Fighters, which advocates a blend of Marxist economic policies and land confiscation. It's fiery, charismatic leader, Julius Malema, is also given to harsh, violence-tinged rhetoric. An ANC alliance with the EFF would mean a sharp turn to a far-left, socialist and anti-Western agenda.\nThe wild card is Mr. Zuma, who has formed a new party, uMkhonto weSizwe, which is expected to peel away votes from the ANC in Mr. Zuma's native KwaZulu-Natal province. Mr. Zuma retains a significant base. His supporters have also shown a penchant for violence, as in 2021 when Zuma supporters rioted against his arrest. There are fears of a repeat of violence if his new party fares poorly.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Editorial Board","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YXE3GYI3HQ37EZMWOJJBJPO2DA_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":4.125962,"_id":"c7471f917ffd2cda32457e63e224e7bf"},{"title":"Seeking answers to D.C.'s truancy problem","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-22 21:28:16","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/22/dc-truancy-parents-children-health-care-ukraine-politics","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Plus, Post readers on children's health, urban planning, Ukraine aid and political parties.","summary":"Regarding Colbert I.

Clearly, the deputy mayor for education and the schools need to play a crucial role in dealing with this. But, as Mr. King points out, unless and until the parents are required (and helped) to meet their responsibilities, major improvements are unlikely to happen.

Investing in children's health is our most powerful lever to create a healthier society and stronger economy. Gov. Mike DeWine (R) says, 'It's hard to sell stuff on the basis of public health.' I know the feeling. As a pediatric surgeon and CEO of a children's health system, I fight the uphill battle of selling public health every day.\nAdvertisement\nI believe Mr. DeWine has got it right. In this country, we mistakenly equate health with medical care. Medical care is an important but relatively small part of health. The governor's health agenda is built around children, as it should be. It includes safety, good nutrition, freedom from violence, early education and more. All these factors are major determinants of health, and all can be markedly affected by small investments during childhood.\nBeyond improving our population's health, this agenda's economic benefits are enough to appeal to both sides of the aisle. Studies show that spending a dollar now to set a child up for lifelong health yields shockingly high returns to taxpayers and the broader economy for years, decades and even generations to come. Mr. DeWine is correct in saying, 'Everyone wants to see kids do better.' I couldn't agree more. It is time to prioritize public health by investing in our children.\nR.

We saw this vividly during the pandemic beginning in 2020, when urban dwellers relied on green spaces as a rare source of beautiful and socially distanced outdoor respite.\nClimate change gives us the clear imperative \u2014 and opportunity \u2014 to prioritize nature in the urban planning of U.S. cities. What does this look like? A study from the Global Center for Clean Air Research finds that the unique infrastructure of botanical gardens has a measurable cooling effect on city air temperatures. This emphasizes the importance of plants, including trees, in greening our cities. By restoring and conserving a diverse array of plant life, especially in dense urban environments, we create much more livable cities for people, wildlife and future generations.\nAdvertisement\nNo less valuable are the communities that green spaces cultivate. Urban farms and community gardens are a powerful way to plant social connections, while also spreading nature within cities.\nWe urge all city leaders and urban planners to support well-managed urban conservation projects and green spaces.

Mr. Dorfman compares this action with his own experience of escaping a certain death at the hands of oppressive military dictator Augusto Pinochet by finding refuge in the Argentine Embassy in Santiago, Chile, in 1973.\nAdvertisement\nBut Mr. Dorfman was truly vulnerable, and his refugee status saved his life. Mr. Glas, on the other hand, was convicted twice for corruption, receiving prison sentences of six and eight years. In one case, he was convicted of taking millions of dollars from a Brazilian construction company and, in the other, he was found guilty for his role in a scheme that collected bribes for public procurement.\nTo further question whether Mr. Glas was even worthy of asylum, he was released from prison early in a controversial ruling by Judge Emerson Curipallo. Judge Curipallo is now in custody pending an investigation into his alleged role in a bribery scheme involving favorable rulings for a drug lord and others.\nMr. Dorfman cites the importance of respecting the 20th-century refugee protections that are included in a series of agreements and laws. Are these protections designed for convicted criminals? If so, where then does the search for asylum by bad people end?\nAdvertisement\nMaybe it's time to revisit these agreements and laws to ensure that those most vulnerable are protected in their time of need while not giving protection to convicted criminals such as Mr. Glas.\nCurtis Schaeffer , Falls Church\nCurtis Schaeffer, Falls Church\nThe need for Ukraine aid\nRegarding the April 15 news article 'Iran attacks add urgency to stalled aid efforts for Israel':\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nWithout reservation, I support Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. I agree entirely that Israel is of central political and historical importance to the United States. This said, I take issue with Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) when he states that 'Israel's a much closer ally, is a much more core American national security interest' than Ukraine.\nMr. Vance is dead wrong. When Israel is attacked, we must surely support it with the weapons and materiel needed to secure their self-defense. To my knowledge, however, we are not bound by treaty to place troops in Israel, nor to make war directly against another nation on Israel's behalf. The same cannot be said of Europe.\nAdvertisement\nRussia has made clear that it aspires eventually to reconquer those European countries once comprising the Soviet empire. Ukraine stands in the way of that aspiration. Some countries of the old U.S.S.R. are now our NATO allies, whom we are formally required to defend in the event of attack. Should Ukraine fall, and history be a guide, Russia would gain borders with its former vassal states and then could pick its spots to begin snatching territory from NATO's easternmost members. In this case, more U.S. troops would have to be deployed to Europe at incalculable risk to us and the entire world.\nIn a real sense, the United States is already fighting its war with Russia. Ukrainian citizens, however, are doing the fighting for us; their lives and their blood, not ours, are lost. What do we gain for the money and equipment supplied to NATO or to Ukraine? We gain the privilege of watching a war fought on European ground, at massive cost to its people and not so much to ours \u2014 in my view, a pretty good bargain.\nMr. Vance and his some of his Republican colleagues in Congress seem to be advocating for Russia, in effect making arguments for the Russian cause. My response: It is neither fair nor accurate to compare the gravity and enormity of our obligation to NATO (or Ukraine) with our close ties to Israel or, please, to connect any of this with our problems at the border with Mexico.\nAdvertisement\nBill Coe , Washington\nBill Coe, Washington\nThree parties aren't a crowd\nIn the April 9 Prompt 2024 newsletter, 'Why is it so hard to find a winning third-party candidate?,' Alexi McCammond and her colleagues made several meritorious points. However, it is important to note that third-party and independent candidates must contend with various built-in roadblocks from state sore-loser and disaffiliation laws to debate rules controlled by the two-party duopoly and designed to stifle competition.\nAdditionally, in the case of No Labels' recent attempt to recruit a 'unity ticket,' potential candidates were fearful of playing the role of spoiler and tipping the election to Donald Trump. Enactment by each state of a unified, nonpartisan/open primary system in conjunction with ranked-choice voting (RCV) as practiced in Alaska would render moot that major criticism of the No Labels ballot access effort. RCV shuts down the spoiler argument by eliminating the candidate with the least number of votes round by round until a majority of votes is obtained by one candidate. Such a reform offers a long-term solution to reduce polarization in our politics, and serves fairness as opposed to disenfranchisement by allowing independent/unaffiliated voters to participate in state-funded primaries.

Europe is now feeling pressure amid U.S. and Chinese efforts to support investment in domestic production through subsidies and tax breaks, particularly in renewable energy and green technology.\nAdvertisement\nBefore the summit in Brussels, the former president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, said the EU did not pay enough attention to 'external competitiveness as a serious policy question' and insisted Europe's biggest economic rivals 'are no longer playing by the rules.'\n'In the face of a new geopolitical reality and increasingly complex challenges, the European Union is committed to strengthening its strategic sovereignty and acting decisively to ensure its long-term competitiveness, prosperity and leadership on the global stage,' leaders were expected to agree at their summit in Brussels, according to a draft of conclusions seen by The Associated Press.\nLeaders will hear a proposal for an EU-wide effort to subsidize industrial companies in response to the Biden administration's support for investment in environmentally friendly technology through the Inflation Reduction Act, and to China's subsidies for electric cars and solar panels.\nAdvertisement\nThe proposals, contained in a report from former Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta, are in response to widespread concern that U.S. subsidies, which favor domestic production in the U.S., are drawing investment from Europe and threatening the loss of industrial jobs on the continent.\n'Competitiveness means prosperity for our citizens,' Letta said. 'We're in danger of falling out of touch. There is no time to waste. The gap between the European Union and the U.S. in terms of economic performances is becoming bigger and bigger.'\nAccording to his report, GDP per capita in the U.S. increased by almost 60% from 1993 to 2022, while in Europe the increase was less than 30%.\nDraghi said the EU lacks a clear strategy to answer the challenges proposed by Chinese and American rivals in key industries.\nAdvertisement\n'Today we invest less in digital and advanced technologies than the U.S. and China, including for defense, and we only have four global European tech players among the top 50 worldwide,' he said. 'We are lacking a strategy for how to shield our traditional industries from an unlevel global playing field caused by asymmetries in regulations, subsidies and trade policies.'\nEU rules restrict member governments' aid to companies to avoid distorting business competition across the 27-member union's free trade zone. One solution, Letta proposed, is to require countries to use a chunk of such aid for EU-wide projects instead of purely national ones.\nThe report also calls for better integrating the bloc's financial markets so companies can raise money for new renewable energy projects from stock, bond and venture capital investors instead of relying mostly on bank lending. That is a longstanding idea that has progressed slowly. Letta's ideas would be taken up only after this year's EU parliament elections and the appointment of a new executive commission.\nAdvertisement\n'There is a need for more investment,' said European Council President Charles Michel, who chairs EU summits. 'What is fundamental is to act in order to put in place the capital markets union. And also to increase the capacities of the European Investment Bank to invest in strategic sectors.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nCreating more broad-based financial markets would channel European citizens' 'billions of euros' in savings as a tool to invest in strategic sectors within the bloc.\n'Today, there's a paradox,' he said. 'A substantial part of these savings leaves the European Union and is not mobilized to support the economic base, to support innovation, to support the technological base.'\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Samuel Petrequin","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NCWLRMX5NEI65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":4.036626,"_id":"30346b1814d6adabfd3bcad01a8164f7"},{"title":"Immigrant asylum seekers can revive Rust Belt cities in the heartland","author":"Editorial Board","published_date":"2024-04-20 18:50:26","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/20/migrants-asylum-heartland-development","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"A resettlement policy for asylum seekers could help revive the rusting industrial cities of the heartland.","summary":"The population of Providence, R.I., has barely held even since 2020. Had it not been for some 8,300 immigrants who settled in Saint Joseph County, it would have shrunk by 1.3 percent by last year. Same in South Bend, Ind., where some 1,700 immigrants into the county barely filled a gap left by locals ditching town.\nImmigrants slowed demographic decline in more than 1,100 counties from 2020 to 2023, according to census estimates. Their numbers made up more than the entire growth of the population in 131 of them. The demographic reality casts immigration in a different light, not as a burden but as an opportunity: a powerful tool to lift vast swaths of America that prosperity has left behind.\nIt would require smart policy and political will \u2014 neither of which is plentiful in Washington, but Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's (R) idea of busing migrants to cause political pain in blue jurisdictions could, unwittingly, be put to valuable use: encouraging migrants to rekindle economic development in depopulating cities such as Buffalo, Akron or Detroit, which have struggled to keep up with the economic transformations of the past 30 years.\nAdvertisement\nAdding people might not revive beleaguered towns that have lost their economic rationale, however. If people have moved out, it's largely because the jobs have gone, too. Still, for legacy industrial cities on the edge of decline, arresting population loss is imperative to avoid entering a downward spiral.\nThere is a precedent: the refugee resettlement program. Troubled cities in Upstate New York, for instance, have benefited enormously from thousands of refugees who have settled in communities along the Erie Canal; so much so that cities have tried to lure them.\nDepopulation is bad for economies. Housing prices tank, local tax revenue collapses, the labor force shrinks, businesses go bust or leave, schools close. 'All problems get harder because of population loss,' notes John Lettieri of the Economic Innovation Group. 'To a first approximation problems would ease with more people of working age.'\nFollow this author Editorial Board 's opinions\nFollow this author\nEditorial Board\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nThere would be upfront costs. Shuttered schools would need to be refurbished. Local services might be strained, at first. But migrants would provide not only labor \u2014 potentially useful for elderly residents, who need help with tasks such as cooking or shopping, left behind in these places.\nAdvertisement\nMigrants would also add to local demand, lifting tax revenue. Many would open small businesses. Given an initial boost \u2014 perhaps with state funds, as well as migrants' savings \u2014 they could help build a future for places that, today, don't seem to have one. As Enrico Moretti of the University of California noted, 'For a locality it might not be a bad bet.' And from migrants' perspectives, legacy cities offer one critical advantage: cheap, available housing.\nThis is not how migration is playing out today, though. Asylum seekers tend to go to large urban centers with more jobs and populations of similar immigrants, not to sluggish cities in the heartland. They don't enjoy the supports granted to refugees resettled by the government, which help defray their short-term costs and make them attractive to local jurisdictions. From New York to Denver, where so many migrants have arrived courtesy of Mr. Abbott, mayors tend to perceive them as a fiscal disaster.\nGiovanni Peri, who studies the economic impacts of immigration at the University of California at Davis, suggests there might be a way around this challenge even without federal help, taking advantage of the nation's hot labor market. A state government resettlement plan for asylum seekers might lure businesses into selected communities by guaranteeing a reliable pool of workers. Communities might compete to get into the program. The prospect of a secure job would provide a powerful incentive for the migrants themselves, without the need for federal subsidies distorting the geographical distribution of labor.\nAdvertisement\nFor anything like this to work, of course, asylum seekers would need certainty that they can stay and work. A city or a business is unlikely to bet on asylum seekers who a year from now might be found ineligible to remain and forced to leave the country or, most likely, into the undocumented labor force.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Editorial Board","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RHJCB53YP6L2HMO62BUTDQWNXU_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":3.9479806,"_id":"5f02bd05bc96ede14ca3ebaf1c555918"},{"title":"Chinese foreign minister arrives in Cambodia, Beijing's closest Southeast Asian ally","author":"Sopheng Cheang","published_date":"2024-04-21 13:20:27","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/21/cambodia-china-wang/eb5790be-ffe1-11ee-8eac-39c6dcb59eb5_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has arrived in Cambodia for a three-day official visit to reaffirm ties with Beijing's closest ally in Southeast Asia","summary":"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia \u2014 Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi arrived in Cambodia on Sunday for a three-day official visit to reaffirm ties with Beijing's closest ally in Southeast Asia. His visit is the last stop on a three-nation regional swing that also took him to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.\nHe is visiting amid foreign concerns about two big Chinese-funded projects in Cambodia \u2014 a planned canal and a naval base \u2014 that critics allege could aid Beijing's strategic military interests in Southeast Asia.\nChina is Cambodia's most important ally and benefactor, with strong influence in its economy. That is illustrated by numerous Chinese-funded projects \u2014 particularly infrastructure, including airports and roads, but also private projects such as hotels, casinos and property development. More than 40% of Cambodia's $10 billion in foreign debt is owed to China.\nAdvertisement\nWang is scheduled to have separate meetings with Prime Minister Hun Manet and his father, Hun Sen, now serving as president of the Senate after serving for 38 years as Cambodia's head of government until he stepped down last year to be succeeded by his son. Wang was also granted a royal audience with King Norodom Sihamoni.\nHun Manet has shown no sign of deviating from his father's pro-Beijing foreign policy. In August 2023, Wang visited Cambodia just days after Hun Sen announced he would step down as prime minister in favor of his eldest son.\nBeijing's support allows Cambodia to disregard Western concerns about its poor record on human and political rights, and in turn Cambodia generally supports Beijing's positions on foreign policy issues such as its territorial claims in the South China Sea.\nAdvertisement\nCambodia has recently reiterated its determination to go ahead with the Chinese-financed 180-kilometer (112-mile) long, $1.7 billion Funan Techo Canal project across four provinces in the southern part of the country to connect the capital, Phnom Penh, to the Gulf of Thailand.\nThe plan has raised concern from neighboring Vietnam, where some scholars speculated the 100-meter (330-foot) -wide and 5.4 meter (18-foot) -deep canal could make it easier for China to send military forces southward, close to Vietnam's southern coast. There are often frosty relations between Vietnam and its massive northern neighbor China, which aggressively claims maritime territory claimed by Hanoi and in 1979 staged a brief invasion.\nThe United States has also weighed in on the project, appealing for transparency on the part of Cambodia's government. Wesley Holzer, a U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Phnom Penh, was quoted as telling the Voice of America that 'the Cambodian people, along with people in neighboring countries and the broader region, would benefit from transparency on any major undertaking with potential implications for regional water management, agricultural sustainability, and security,'\nAdvertisement\nHun Manet, speaking Thursday to government officials and villagers in southern Takeo province, dismissed the Vietnamese concern and vowed to push forward with the project, which he said would provide a huge benefit to Cambodia.\nChina also is involved with another project causing foreign concern, its Ream Naval Base on the Gulf of Thailand , which the United States and some international security analysts say is destined to serve as a strategic outpost for Beijing's navy.\nThe Ream base initially attracted attention in 2019 when The Wall Street Journal reported that an early draft of an agreement seen by U.S. officials would allow China 30 years' use of the base, where it would be able to post military personnel, store weapons and berth warships.\nHun Sen in response repeatedly denied there was such an agreement, pointing out that Cambodia's constitution does not allow foreign military bases to be established on its soil and declaring that visiting ships from all nations are welcome.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAdvertisement\nThe base is situated on the Gulf of Thailand, adjacent to the South China Sea, where China has aggressively asserted its claim to virtually the entire strategic waterway.

There are really only two possible scenarios: Either the Islamic republic's aim was not to inflict major damage on Israeli targets, or its aim was but it was incapable of doing so.\nEither way, what the drone and missile attacks should clarify is that Iran doesn't have the means to mount a significant conventional response to Israeli might. And Tehran is painfully aware of this.\nNo one can deny that the image of hundreds of projectiles launched into the air was an impressive and terrifying sight. The fact that apparently not a single one hit a target of any strategic value, however, is telling. Despite its stated intention of destroying Israel, this was the first military offensive Tehran ever launched against the Jewish state, and it was thwarted with apparent ease. Many reports indicate a high level of information-sharing by Iran itself ahead of the attack, giving the United States, Israel and other allies ample opportunity to prepare for the onslaught. This would suggest that the Iranians did not want to maximize damage to Israeli assets and provoke a larger conflict.\nAdvertisement\nThe clear message seems to be that the regime, its bluster notwithstanding, is weak. Iran's economy is in tatters, and the government has no credible remedies for people's woes. Protests against the clerical system have grown in recent years.\nFollow this author Jason Rezaian 's opinions\nFollow this author\nJason Rezaian\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nLess obvious is the regime's fear of a conflict that bleeds into Iranian territory. A direct, protracted war with Israel is not something Iran is equipped to fight. For context, Iran, a country of nearly 90 million people, spent roughly $7 billion on its military in 2022. Israel, with a population of about 9 million, spent more than $23 billion. As Iran's currency spirals downward in value (reaching an all-time low after the weekend attack), it's difficult to envision how the country could ever catch up to Israel's military capabilities.\nJust as critical, though, is the fact that since its devastating eight-year war with Iraq ended in 1988, the Islamic republic has been able to keep the country mostly safe from external military strikes. It's one of the few arguments the regime can make to the people about its success. Yet suddenly \u2014 and ironically, if it wanted to avoid provocation \u2014 that promise of continued internal security feels very flimsy.\nAdvertisement\nSo why conduct the strikes in the first place?\nThis was not a simple act of unprovoked aggression. Don't forget that the air assault was a response to an Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed a top commander and several officers of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. In recent months, and in fact over several years, Israel has assassinated numerous Iranian military officials and nuclear scientists and generally wreaked havoc on Iranian assets without suffering significant consequences.\nIran's leaders, shaken by the killing of top military brass, felt they had to respond with a show of strength. Not doing so would signal impotence to Israel and Iran's Arab adversaries, as well as a restive domestic population that is increasingly eager to see the end of the theocratic regime.\nAdvertisement\nWhether it was designed to cause damage or not, the result was a spectacular failure.\nMake no mistake, this doesn't mean Iran is no longer a threat; but the threats it poses are not the ones we usually presume them to be. Democratic countries should be prepared for the kind of personalized terror Iran has exercised against the many people it has deemed threats to the system's power since its inception. Iranian dissidents, human rights activists, former regime officials, diplomats and journalists \u2014 including me \u2014 have all been targets of the Islamic republic's malice.\nAbductions and assassinations, which are unpredictable and cheap compared with military operations, seem far likelier in the days and weeks ahead than Iran wanting to engage in a kinetic war that would result in heavy domestic casualties.\nAdvertisement\nThe Biden administration recognizes that a retaliation by Israel, which would be orders of magnitude stronger than anything Tehran can muster \u2014 but would very likely result in Iran unleashing these asymmetrical tactics \u2014 is not in U.S. interests. This is why President Biden has wisely declared that the United States would not participate in any Israeli offensive actions against Iran.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jason Rezaian,Global Opinions Writer","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QJXTJS3VNPWSBCWLMZNXAKCNVU_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":3.9358358,"_id":"ad7092d1a84d133b598d8aecb86be679"},{"title":"UN refugee agency tells Cyprus to stick to the law in its efforts at sea to thwart refugee boats","author":"Menelaos Hadjicostis","published_date":"2024-04-19 17:18:01","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/19/migration-syria-refugees-lebanon-boats-cyprus/c61e75d2-fe70-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The United Nations agency for refugees says Cypriot efforts at sea to stop numerous Syrian refugee-laden boats departing Lebanon from reaching the European Union-member island nation mustn't\u2026","summary":"NICOSIA, Cyprus \u2014 The United Nations' refugee agency said Friday that Cypriot efforts at sea to stop numerous Syrian refugee-laden boats departing Lebanon from reaching the European Union-member island nation mustn't contravene international human rights laws or put passengers at risk.\nCypriot authorities have reportedly dispatched police patrol vessels just outside Lebanese territorial waters to thwart boat loads of Syrian refugees from reaching the island about 110 miles (180 kilometers) away.\nThe Cypriot government says a crumbling Lebanese economy coupled with the uncertainty brought on by the Israeli-Hamas war and the recent tit-for-tat strikes between Israel and Lebanon has resulted in a huge number of rickety boats overloaded with migrants \u2013 almost all Syrians \u2013 reaching the island.\nEarlier this week, Cypriot patrol craft reportedly intercepted five boats carrying hundreds of Syrian refugees and migrants.

The occasion offers the former president a fresh chance to amplify claims that his multiple pending indictments are an establishment conspiracy to take him down \u2014 and, by extension, squelch the voters who first elected him eight years ago.\n'They want to keep me off the campaign trail,' Trump insisted earlier this week in Harlem, where he visited a neighborhood convenience store and addressed a throng of media outside. Rather than pursue violent criminals, he alleged, 'They go after Trump.'\nAdvertisement\nThe event Saturday also underscores the importance of North Carolina, a presidential battleground that Trump won by 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020. That was the closest margin of any state that Trump won. Saturday will be the second time in as many months that Trump has come to the state.\n'The presidential race is going to run through North Carolina,' said Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, in a recent interview.\nNorth Carolina is one of seven states that both the Trump and Biden campaigns have said they will dedicate significant campaign resources to winning. Trump has insisted he wants to widen the map, even into his native New York, which is heavily Democratic. Most Republicans, though, agree that Trump will have a difficult path to an Electoral College majority if Biden were to win North Carolina's 15 electoral votes. Trump tacitly acknowledged North Carolina's status by tapping then-state Republican Chairman Michael Whatley to lead his campaign's effective takeover of the Republican National Committee.\nAdvertisement\nThere is no precedent for the kind of campaign Trump now has to run \u2014 in North Carolina and nationally.\nWith opening arguments of his trial expected Monday, Trump will be confined to the courtroom for the foreseeable future, limiting his ability to see voters, fundraise and make calls. Biden, conversely, spent multiple days this week campaigning in Pennsylvania, another key battleground. Trump aides have promised weekend rallies and events on Wednesdays, the one weekday Trump's trial is expected to be in recess. The former president's campaign also has promised additional weeknight appearances around New York, as in Harlem.\nThat schedule adds pressure for Trump to maximize his limited opportunities to reach voters and command media attention beyond his indictments.\nIn North Carolina, Biden's campaign already has hired statewide leadership and field organizers for offices across the state. That's on top of state party staff that began an organizing program last year ahead of municipal races and looking to this year's statewide races \u2013 including an open governor's race since Cooper is barred from seeking a third term.\nAdvertisement\n'We needed to build energy on the ground early,' said state Democratic Chairwoman Anderson Clayton, noting that the last Democratic presidential nominee to win North Carolina \u2014 Barack Obama in 2008 \u2014 had organized the state in a hotly contested primary campaign that ramped up the previous year.\nMatt Mercer, spokesman for the North Carolina Republican Party, countered that veteran GOP staffers have been working in the state since the 2020 election cycle.

The investigation is a response to a petition from the United Steelworkers and four other unions last month.\nAdvertisement\nThe actions are just the latest sign of the president's determination to be seen as a defender of the steel industry, whose workers are spread across states in the industrial Midwest that could decide the election. In March, the president made an unusually direct comment about a pending corporate acquisition, saying it was 'vital' that U.S. Steel remain American-owned.\nNippon Steel, a larger and more profitable Japanese company, has agreed to acquire the once-famed American steelmaker for $14.9 billion. The deal is being reviewed for potential national security issues by a Treasury Department-led committee.\nThe burst of industry-specific safeguards is likely to cheer the president's union audience Wednesday. But it could raise costs for industries that use steel, which employ far more workers.\nAdvertisement\nBiden's likely opponent this fall, former president Donald Trump, is courting the same voters with his own brand of economic nationalism. The Republican has said he will impose an across-the-board tariff of 10 percent on all foreign products and a 60 percent levy on Chinese imports, a move many economists say would stoke inflation.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe mix of tariffs and investigations also represent Biden's sharpest actions to date to prevent China from unleashing on global markets an avalanche of low-cost goods, at a time when demand in its domestic economy is weak.\nTreasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen recently returned from a visit to Beijing, where she warned Chinese officials that the United States would not accept a second 'China shock,' a reference to the impact of China's economic rise in the early 2000s on U.S. manufacturers. China's routine use of subsidies and other preferences for favored companies has resulted in excess capacity in traditional sectors like steelmaking and the emerging industries of clean energy.\nAdvertisement\n'China's policy-driven overcapacity poses a serious risk to the future of the American steel and aluminum industry. China cannot export its way to recovery. China is simply too big to play by its own rules. In manufacturing sectors like steel, China is already producing more than China or the world can easily absorb,' said Lael Brainard, director of the National Economic Council, who briefed reporters on the president's actions.\nChina's steel production is equal to roughly half of global demand for the industrial metal, and its export prices are about 40 percent lower than what U.S. steelmakers charge, according to the administration.\nStill, current Chinese imports amount to just 0.6 percent of total U.S. steel demand, according to a second White House official who spoke on background, under the administration's ground rules for such calls.\nAdvertisement\nThe 25 percent tariffs Biden wants on Chinese steel and aluminum would come after the U.S. Trade Representative concludes its long-running review of existing trade barriers on goods from China.\nThe administration expects the tariffs to have 'no inflationary' effect, since they apply to such a limited set of goods, the official added.\nBiden administration officials have been pressing Mexico for months to address a sharp increase in shipments of steel and aluminum to the United States. Tai has accused Mexico of violating a 2019 agreement that led to the removal of Trump's 25 percent tariff, imposed in 2018.\nU.S. officials have held several rounds of talks with their Mexican counterparts, including this week. Mexican officials have rejected claims that the shipments violate the vaguely worded agreement.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David J.

Nearly 970 million voters \u2014 more than 10% of the world's population \u2014 will elect 543 members to the lower house of Parliament for five years during the staggered elections that run until June 1.

Its more than 20 parties have not put forward a candidate, saying they will choose one after the results are in.\nThe election comes after a decade of Modi's leadership, during which the BJP has consolidated power through a combination of Hindu-first politics and economic development.\nModi has ratcheted up Hindu nationalist rhetoric on the campaign trail, and has sought to present himself as a global leader. His ministers tout him as the steward of a surging India, while his supporters celebrate his campaign promise to make India a developed nation by 2047, when it marks 100 years of independence.\nAdvertisement\nBut while India's economy is among the world's fastest-growing, many of its people face growing economic distress.

His Hindu nationalist politics, they argue, has bred intolerance and threatens the country's secular roots.\nThe alliance has promised to arrest the democratic slide it says India has witnessed under Modi's rule. They accuse Modi of sidelining elected ministers in favor of trusted bureaucrats and using tax authorities and the police to harass critics and opposition parties.\nAdvertisement\n'Modi has a very authoritarian mindset.

He doesn't believe in Parliamentarianism,' said Christophe Jaffrelot, who has written about Modi and the Hindu right.\nModi insists that India's commitment to democracy is unchanged. He told a Summit for Democracy meeting in New Delhi in March that \u2018'India is not only fulfilling the aspirations of its 1.4 billion people, but is also providing hope to the world that democracy delivers and empowers.''\nThe Indian leader enjoys vast popularity among India's 1.4 billion people. His BJP dominates in Hindi-speaking northern and central parts of India, and is now trying to gain a foothold in the east and south to capture a two-thirds majority.

The current rate is 7.5% for both metals. The administration also promised to pursue anti-dumping investigations against countries and importers that try to saturate existing markets with Chinese steel, and said it was working with Mexico to ensure that Chinese companies can't circumvent the tariffs by shipping steel there for subsequent export to the U.S.\nAdvertisement\n'The president understands we must invest in American manufacturing. But we also have to protect those investments and those workers from unfair exports associated with China's industrial overcapacity,' White House National Economic Adviser Lael Brainard said on a call with reporters.\nBiden was set to announce that he is asking the U.S. Trade Representative to consider tripling the tariffs during a visit to United Steelworkers union headquarters in Pittsburgh. The president is on a three-day Pennsylvania swing that began in Scranton on Tuesday and will include a visit to Philadelphia on Thursday.\nThe administration says China is distorting markets and eroding competition by unfairly flooding the market with below-market-cost steel.\n'China's policy-driven overcapacity poses a serious risk to the future of the American steel and aluminum industry,' Brainard said. Referencing China's economic downturn, she added that Beijing 'cannot export its way to recovery.'\nAdvertisement\n'China is simply too big to play by its own rules,' Brainard said.\nHigher tariffs can carry major economic risks.

An outside analysis by the consultancy Oxford Economics has suggested that implementing the tariffs Trump has proposed could hurt the overall U.S. economy.\nAdvertisement\nSenior Biden administration officials said that, unlike the Trump administration, they were seeking a 'strategic and balanced' approach to new tariff rates. China produces around half of the world's steel, and is already making far more than its domestic market needs. It sells steel on the world market for less than half what U.S.-produced steel costs, the officials said.\nBiden's announcement follows his administration's efforts to provide up to $6.6 billion so that a Taiwanese semiconductor giant can expand facilities that it is already building in Arizona and better ensure that the world's most-advanced microchips are produced in the U.S. That move could be seen as working to better compete with China chip manufacturers.\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen, during a recent visit to China, warned against oversaturating the market with cheap goods, and said low-cost steel had 'decimated industries across the world and in the United States.' The Chinese, in turn, expressed grave concern over American trade and economic measures that restrict China, according to the China's official news agency.

The bill could be law as soon as next week if Congress moves quickly.\nThe TikTok legislation, which passed the House in March and has widespread support in both chambers, was included in the House foreign policy package after negotiations with the Senate over how long the Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd. would have to sell its stake for the app to continue operating in the United States. President Joe Biden has said he would sign the TikTok legislation if it reaches his desk.\nThe House legislation also won a key endorsement Wednesday from Senate Commerce Committee Chairwoman Maria Cantwell, who said in a statement that she had successfully pushed to extend the period from six months to a year to give the company enough time to find a buyer. While the original legislation had a six-month deadline for TikTok to be sold, the new House bill would give nine months and a possible three-month extension if a sale was in progress.\nAdvertisement\n'Extending the divestment period is necessary to ensure there is enough time for a new buyer to get a deal done,' said Cantwell, who had previously expressed doubts about the bill. 'I support this updated legislation.'\nIf Congress passes the TitkTok legislation, it would be an extraordinary and unusual moment in which both parties unite against one company \u2013 something lawmakers are usually reluctant to do. But the popular social media app has prompted widespread outrage on Capitol Hill, where there is bipartisan concern about Chinese threats to the United States and where few members use the platform themselves.\nOpponents say they believe the ban would be unconstitutional. Since the House passed the legislation last month, there has been aggressive pushback from the company, content creators who make money on the app and some of the platform's 170 million U.S. users, many of whom are young. In some cases, lawmakers have received profanity-laced calls from users who were prompted by the app to call their representatives in Congress.\nAdvertisement\nTo date, the U.S. government has not provided evidence that shows TikTok shared U.S. user data with the Chinese government, or that Chinese authorities have tinkered with the company's popular algorithm, which influences what Americans see.\nSince mid-March, the company has spent $5 million on TV ads opposing the legislation, according to AdImpact, an advertising tracking firm. The ads have included a range of content creators, including a nun, extolling the positive impacts of the platform on their lives and arguing a ban would trample on the First Amendment.\nTikTok, which declined to comment on how much it was spending on TV ads, has also spent money on Facebook and Instagram ads that, among other things, talk about investments in data safety. The company has also mounted a lobbying campaign in Washington that included flying in content creators who rely on the platform for income.\nAdvertisement\nAlex Haurek, a spokesman for the company, said in a statement Thursday that 'It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually.'\nPassage of the bill would be the most significant step Congress has taken in decades to regulate the tech industry. For years Congress has failed to act on bills that would protect users' privacy, protect children from online threats, make companies more liable for their content and put loose guardrails around artificial intelligence, among other things.\nStill, it is a narrow shot at one company when many lawmakers would like to see broader change. A bipartisan group of senators has been pushing a Senate bill to protect kids online, and Cantwell recently struck an agreement with the Republican chairwoman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, on legislation to protect Americans' data privacy.\nAdvertisement\nWhile most lawmakers support the TikTok bill, some have said it would set a dangerous precedent.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'The passage of the House TikTok ban is not just a misguided overreach; it's a draconian measure that stifles free expression, tramples constitutional rights, and disrupts the economic pursuits of millions of Americans,' Kentucky Sen.

Others see Trump as a far bigger threat.","summary":"PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The symbolic mix of soul food and Palestinian dishes had been eaten to conclude the Ramadan fast, and remarks from Palestinian Americans about the war in Gaza had just wrapped up at the Masjidullah community center when Suad Islam stepped to a microphone seeking some political advice.\n'This presidential election is very disappointing. Is there a candidate that you would suggest that we vote for? Because I don't know any Muslim that could vote for Biden,' said Islam, who is Black and a lifelong Philadelphia resident. 'Who should we vote for? I'm just very disappointed.'\nIslam, who has lived in Philadelphia since the 1970s, has voted in every election since she was 18, almost always for Democrats. She picked President Biden over former president Donald Trump in 2020, and even volunteered at a polling place. But she said she cannot fathom punching a ballot for Biden again, not with more than 33,000 dead in Gaza, many of them fellow Muslims.\nAdvertisement\n'The economy, the crime rate. I want to cry every time I go to the gas station,' Islam said in an interview, ticking off the things that are on her mind as she mulls voting in November. 'It's just a whole bunch of stuff that's going on. It's disappointing. But of course, this war is at the top of my list.'\nAs the Gaza war enters its seventh month, some Black Americans say Biden's handling of the conflict makes them question whether he deserves a second term, according to interviews with nearly two dozen voters, opinion leaders and activists working through a political and moral conundrum in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\nFor some, the conflagration 6,000 miles away has already changed their vote, edging out domestic concerns such as the economy, inflation and crime. Others say the war in the Middle East, which has already cost thousands of lives and has a region on the brink of famine, mirrors other tragedies afflicting people of color \u2014 and that Biden's support for what they see as a moral disaster should have consequences at the ballot box.\nshould have consequences at the ballot box.\nAdvertisement\nStill others see the biggest threat as something else entirely: another Trump presidency.\nWhere these voters ultimately land could play an outsize role in who occupies the White House next year. Pennsylvania is one of a handful of battleground states that both Republicans and Democrats see as pivotal to winning the presidency. In 2020, Biden won the state by just over 80,000 votes, including a 4-to-1 margin in heavily Black Philadelphia. But there are signs that the coalition that elected him is fragmenting.\nIn a nod to the importance of the state and its largest, most diverse city, Biden has been to Philadelphia more than 20 times as president \u2014 more than anywhere else except his hometown of Wilmington. Biden is spending most of this week in Pennsylvania: two days in Scranton, where he was partially raised, a day in Pittsburgh and Thursday in Philadelphia.\nAdvertisement\nBut even while he visits their city, some Black Philadelphians are focused on how his policies are playing out half a world away.\n'I want the president to get it right because it's right. That's the first reason, but beyond that, there is a political ramification if he does not get it right,' said Rev. Mark Tyler, the senior pastor of Mother Bethel AME Church, who is planning to attend the Democratic National Convention this summer. He said he's lost count of the number of conversations he's had with parishioners about the Middle East conflict.\n'And to think that this (conflict) is not going to have an impact on Black voters in particular, who connect with this story in a way that maybe other Americans cannot \u2014 it would be a mistake to think that it won't be a problem going into November,' Tyler said.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas militants rampaged through the Israel-Gaza border fence and killed 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and took 250 others hostage. In response, Israel has commenced a military campaign that has devastated much of the enclave while severely restricting humanitarian aid.\nComplicating matters, last weekend Iran launched a salvo of rockets and drones into Israel in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian consulate in Syria. Most of the weapons were shot down by Israel and its allies, but the episode has raised fears of a broader conflict.\nSupporters of Israel reject the notion that its incursion into Gaza is racist or mirrors American racial dynamics. Rather, they say, the 150-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict is rooted in a territorial dispute between two groups with historical ties to the same land. The country's backers also note that Jews themselves have been victims through history, and giving them a safe haven is a central reason for Israel's existence.\nAdvertisement\nBut as the Gaza war has raged on, Biden and other Democrats have faced protesters at virtually all of their public events, over the Palestinian death toll. In Scranton on Tuesday, after Biden gave a campaign speech on tax policy, the president's motorcade was met by protesters chanting, 'Biden Biden, you can't hide. We charge you with genocide,' and 'Welcome home, Scranton Joe \u2014 make sure Gazans have a home also.' Demonstrators also shouted at Biden as he visited his childhood home.\nIn several states, Muslims and Arab Americans have organized movements urging members of their communities \u2014 as well as people of color, liberals and others dissatisfied with Biden's support of Israel \u2014 to choose 'uncommitted' in Democratic primaries, an effort that notched more than 100,000 votes in Michigan.\nFor seven months, organizers in Philadelphia have been stoking a similar movement in advance of Pennsylvania's April 23 Democratic primary. They contend that Israel's military onslaught resembles other racist oppression that called for a global moral response: Jim Crow in the American South, or apartheid in South Africa.\nAdvertisement\nThat sentiment has resulted in a growing link between Black and Arab American activists.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBlack Americans 'have been struggling through this for many, many years,' said Osama Al-Qasem, who directs the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. 'They understand what we're going through, and therefore they empathize and sympathize and support our struggle, as well. So the built-in relationship becomes a hub we leverage.'\nBiden has made racial justice a central tenet of his administration, and as his reelection campaign intensifies he has highlighted the strides Black Americans have made during his presidency. Putting Trump back in the White House, he and his surrogates argue, would stymie that progress.\nBiden has stressed that he needs Black voters to help put him in the White House again. but recent polls have shown declining support among the demographic, particularly in battleground states that will probably swing the election.\nSome 92 percent of Black voters picked Biden over Trump in 2020. A Wall Street Journal poll of swing states, however, found that 57 percent of Black men planned to vote for Biden in the 2024 election, while 30 percent said they were likely to vote for Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.\nAdvertisement\nSimilarly, 11 percent of Black women in the 2020 poll said they would 'definitely' or 'probably' vote for Trump, compared to 6 percent of Black women who voted for him in 2020.\nBiden's campaign announced in August that it was spending $25 million to reach key voters in battleground states, including what it called the largest and earliest investment in Black media for a reelection campaign in history. Those ads highlight Biden's efforts to close the racial wealth gap and note that he has presided over the lowest Black unemployment rate in history.\nIn addition Biden launched a pair of ads last month aimed at Black voters in battleground states, touting his administration's pandemic relief checks and its successful effort to cap the price of insulin at $35 a month.\n'At both the national and state level, this campaign is committed to engaging with Black voters earlier and more often than any other campaign to date,' Kellan White, a senior adviser in Pennsylvania for Biden-Harris 2024 and a Philadelphia native, said in a statement.\nBiden's defenders say critics have a dangerously myopic view of the conflict in the Middle East, and that efforts to turn Black voters away from Biden will play directly into the hands of Trump, who would be far worse for both Black Americans and Palestinians.\nAdvertisement\nBiden is handling the Gaza war as best he can, they add. 'You can't solve the problem of the Middle East as a purist or idealist,' said Marshall Mitchell, a pastor at Salem Baptist Church of Abington, a Black church in Montgomery County, Pa. 'They don't understand the power of quiet diplomacy. And they're going to force a hand, and then you won't be able to turn Pennsylvania back.'\nAt the mosque and community center where Islam voiced her electoral concerns, many who came to learn about the Palestinian cause acknowledged that it was just one of the issues that would affect Black voters' decisions.\nSalima Suswell, leader of the Black Muslim Leadership Council and one of the organizers of the cross-cultural event, said she feels a connection to the suffering of those in Gaza who share her faith. But she said she also understands that it may be difficult for people to sublimate their own self-interest to make a political point, even on such a searing issue.\n'Some folks feel that there are domestic issues that require priority, like gun violence in a city like Philadelphia, where Black Muslim children are being murdered,' Suswell said. 'So many people feel like we need a cease-fire right here in our city. And to some level, there is some frustration also with people who feel that Trump is a huge threat to our community.'\nSuswell was one of a handful of Muslim leaders invited to the White House this month to discuss the war in Gaza and other issues. She has also hosted events in her hometown aimed at helping Black Philadelphians understand the plight of Palestinians and what the community can do to influence U.S. policy.\nOthers are disenchanted with the notion that they must choose between two parties whose policies toward Israel may not be substantively different.\n'I think there's a recognition that neither the Democrats nor Republicans are really representing our interests. They're not representing Black interests. They're not representing the interests of poor and working-class folks,' said Melina Abdullah, who recently became the running mate of third-party presidential candidate Cornel West.\nIn 2015, she and other founding members of Black Lives Matter issued a statement of solidarity with Palestinians. 'We don't have to take a lesser-of-two-evils approach,' Abdullah said. 'Lesser of two evils is still evil.'\nIn contrast, Rahima Abdullah, 67, a lifelong Philadelphia resident, said the events of the past six months have not deterred her desire to vote for Biden. Voting 'uncommitted' or staying home 'is a vote for Trump,' she added.\n'I just feel like we've got to do it,' she said of voting for Biden. 'And then we've got to pray.'\nScott Clement and Yasmeen Abutaleb in Washington contributed to this report.\nScott Clement and Yasmeen Abutaleb in Washington contributed to this report.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Cleve R.

Lack of oversight, inadequate scientific review and faulty accounting have left the voluntary offset market awash in credits that studies conclude are not coming close to canceling out the level of emissions claimed, and often not erasing any.\nAs the world's climate goals slip further from reach, activists, regulators and companies are scrambling for fixes, warning that keeping warming in check may hinge on their success. One of the most ambitious initiatives launches Wednesday, when the Rockefeller Foundation unveils a pioneering plan to create offsets targeted at shutting down heavily polluting coal plants in developing Asian economies.\nAdvertisement\nThe goal is to show offsets can, indeed, be a credible and effective way to slow warming, rather than a Rube Goldberg-like mechanism enabling companies to skirt their climate commitments.\n'There has been a lot of sloppy thinking' in the offset industry, said Joseph Curtin, managing director of Rockefeller's power and climate team. 'It has led to bad practices and over crediting.'\nThis is particularly true in places such as the United States that lack a federal climate policy guiding how businesses ramp down their emissions. In that vacuum, a voluntary offset system emerged through which corporations set their own climate goals and purchase the credits to help meet them. Companies also sell credits directly to consumers of such things as plane tickets and rental cars, promising that a few extra bucks will cancel out the emissions created by the travel.\nAdvertisement\nBut the system, managed by an unregulated industry of credit sellers, is often opaque and dysfunctional. In numerous cases, assertions that projects are lowering global emissions have been debunked by scientific evidence showing otherwise. At least one offsets leader has overhauled its methodology.\nThe foundation's goal is to offer companies that purchase the credits concrete proof that they helped speed the retirement of dirty coal plants that would have been operating years longer but for the offsets. Carbon credits have never before been used to decommission coal plants. The energy is replaced with clean power through the program, and workers in shuttered coal plants will be provided alternative employment.\nprovided alternative employment.\nIt is not a cheap endeavor. The foundation would not talk publicly about the cost of the credits it plans to sell once the project is operational or identify the companies expressing interest in buying them. But one of the challenges faced by the Rockefeller-sponsored effort, called the Coal to Clean Credit Initiative, is the market is awash in flawed credits that can be bought for a fraction of the price of those used to shut down coal plants.\nAdvertisement\n'A lot of revenue will be needed to make this work,' Curtin said. 'The question is, will we find purchasers?'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe target buyers, program officials say, are financially flush corporations in sectors such as tech or banking that have made ambitious commitments to erase their carbon footprints but are struggling to find a viable path to fulfill them.\nThe program will get underway in the Philippines, working with the ACEN South Luzon Thermal Energy Corp. to shut down a large coal plant it operates there. The plant has contracts to run through 2040. Officials at the Rockefeller Foundation are aiming to sell credits to close the plant a decade earlier. Doing so, they say, would avert as much as 19 million tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere. The central bank of Singapore has also joined the effort.\nAdvertisement\n'The reality is that we are going backwards in the fight against climate change and in advancing the energy transition needed in developing countries,' said Rajiv J. Shah, president of the foundation. 'If we don't make progress this decade on increasing private investment into speeding their transition away from coal and into cleaner forms of energy, we will lose the fight on climate, period.'\nThe Philippines plant is one of 6,500 coal-fired plants around the world, most of them locked into operating for years into the future through long-term energy contracts. They are projected to dump more than 190 billion tons of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere during that time.\nDeveloping credible offsets to shut them down is a heavy lift, as they must be structured in a way that prevents shrewd energy companies from cashing in on the credits and building more coal plants nearby. But replacing the lost energy with clean power is a costly endeavor, involving not just solar panels or wind turbines, but also industrial-scale batteries that can store the clean energy so it can be fed back onto the grid when there is no sunshine or wind.\nin on the credits and building more coal plants nearby.

With growing support in the Senate, the legislation appears more likely than ever to become law.\nThe move represents one of the most significant threats to the U.S. operations of the wildly popular app, which is used by roughly 170 million Americans, but whose China-based parent company ByteDance has long sparked national security fears in Washington.\nTikTok is 'a spy balloon in Americans' phones' used to \"surveil and exploit America's personal information,' Rep. Michael McCaul said Saturday as he introduced the measure for debate.\nAdvertisement\nThe House voted 360 to 58 to approve legislation authorizing new sanctions against Russia and Iran, and requiring that TikTok divest from ByteDance or face a prohibition, one of several measures considered alongside the $95 billion foreign aid bills.\nHouse lawmakers overwhelmingly advanced an earlier version of the legislation targeting TikTok last month, but by tying the issue to the aid package, which has broad bipartisan support in both chambers, the new effort could trigger swift consideration in the Senate.\nSenate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Friday he hopes the House passes the foreign aid bills 'without further delay' and that the 'Senate will move expeditiously to send it to the president's desk' if passed.\nPresident Biden said last month he would sign the TikTok bill if passed by Congress, and on Wednesday he endorsed the House foreign aid package, saying, 'The House must pass the package this week, and the Senate should quickly follow.'\nAdvertisement\nBut until House lawmakers unveiled plans to merge the TikTok legislation with foreign aid this week, the bill's path in the Senate remained murky with no clear timetable for consideration.\nUnder an updated version of the bill, ByteDance would have up to 360 days to divest TikTok. If it declined or failed to do so during that time, mobile app stores and web-hosting providers would be prohibited from offering the app to users in the United States, effectively banning it nationwide. The bill explicitly targets TikTok and ByteDance, but would give the president the power to impose a similar ultimatum against other apps deemed to be 'controlled' by 'foreign adversaries.'\nTikTok has blasted lawmakers' efforts to potentially ban the app as an affront on free speech and disputes lawmakers' suggestions that it is beholden to China or any government.\nAdvertisement\n'It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans,' the company said in a statement posted online this week.\nSince lawmakers introduced their latest proposal targeting the app last month, the company has launched a major counteroffensive against the effort, enlisting scores of users through pop-up notifications to bombard lawmakers with calls voicing opposition to the legislation.\n'It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,' TikTok said in a statement to the Washington Post.\nAdvertisement\nAfter House lawmakers passed the earlier TikTok legislation in just over a week, many senators called for slowing down deliberations in the upper chamber. Senate Commerce Committee Chairwoman Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), whose committee has jurisdiction over the bill, initially expressed concerns about whether the proposal could withstand legal scrutiny and called for hearings.\nBut since then, a number of senators have come out in favor of the proposal and plans to tuck it into the foreign aid package. Cantwell announced Wednesday that she now supports the legislation after lawmakers agreed to give ByteDance more time to sell off TikTok.\nSens. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee, are supportive of the bill's inclusion in the aid package, their offices confirmed. The two lawmakers had previously led separate legislative efforts to tackle concerns over the app.\nAdvertisement\n'I'm glad to see the House help push this important bill forward to force Beijing-based ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok,' Warner said in a statement to The Washington Post.\nThe effort is likely to face significant legal hurdles, as have previous attempts by the Trump administration and states to force a sale or ban of the app.\nNadine Farid Johnson, policy director of the Knight First Amendment Institute, a group that advocates for free speech rights, said in a statement Friday that the TikTok bill would 'infringe' on 'Americans' First Amendment right to access information, ideas, and media from abroad.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"tech","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Taylor Telford,Cristiano Lima-Strong","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SN4MBQJZFNEMPFHPEVH2BISZ4U.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":3.7125466,"_id":"f6819d95b230fd107590b363a1aadf08"},{"title":"Virginia lawmakers set to take up Youngkin's proposed amendments, vetoes in reconvened session","author":"Sarah Rankin","published_date":"2024-04-17 04:05:59","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/2024/04/17/virginia-legislature-glenn-youngkin-session-reconvened/cc2e9374-fc6f-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Gambling regulations, school construction and the state budget are on the agenda as Virginia lawmakers return to Richmond to consider Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's proposed amendments to\u2026","summary":"RICHMOND, Va. \u2014 Gambling regulations, school construction and the state budget were on the agenda for Virginia lawmakers returning to Richmond on Wednesday to consider Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's proposed amendments to legislation and his record number of vetoes.\nDemocrats who control the General Assembly don't have the numbers to override Youngkin's vetoes without GOP support, but their leaders have signaled that they plan to reject many of his proposed changes, including most of those he made to the two-year budget bill. Youngkin's rewrite of the spending plan \u2014 he's submitted more than 200 amendments \u2014 was so extensive, it exceeded the governor's authority, legislative leaders say.\n'If you think of the governor as a surgeon, the Constitution authorizes nips and tucks, but not organ transplants. And his 233 amendments are trying to give the budget a new heart, lungs and kidneys,' said Senate Democratic Majority Leader Scott Surovell, who predicted lawmakers would reject the vast majority of Youngkin's proposed changes to that bill.\nAdvertisement\nPrior to Wednesday's so-called reconvened session, Democratic lawmakers spent weeks publicly at odds with the governor over the budget that they sent him in a bipartisan vote on the final day of their regular session.\nYoungkin embarked on a series of public events during which he blasted what he called the 'backward budget,' criticizing lawmakers for including a sales tax expansion to digital products that he initially proposed at the start of the process in December but had paired with an income tax cut that Democrats rejected. The governor has said unequivocally that he won't sign a budget that increases taxes.\nDemocrats criticized Youngkin for his tour but then launched one of their own to defend their budget plan, which would increase K-12 education spending and pay for teachers and other public workers.\nAdvertisement\nWith his budget amendments, the governor has proposed sticking with the tax policy status quo, which required him to also suggest spending cuts and other accounting maneuvers to account for the revenue that would be lost by eliminating the new digital sales tax.\nDemocratic Del. Luke Torian, who chairs the House of Delegates' budget-writing committee, signaled in an interview Tuesday that his caucus has no intention of going along with that proposal from the governor.\n'The new digital economy (tax), as we call it, is something that's important to us,' he said.\nLawmakers' objections to Youngkin's budget changes could very well result in a version that he ends up vetoing, something longtime government observers say would be unprecedented.\n'My thinking is, we're just at the beginning of the battle,' said Bob Holsworth, a veteran political analyst and commentator.\nAdvertisement\nThe governor has said he hopes to avoid that option, however. He struck an optimistic tone in a statement Tuesday, saying he was encouraged by extensive discussions with legislators from both chambers and both parties.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'Tomorrow is another step towards our destination, which is to pass and sign a common ground budget,' Youngkin said.\nLawmakers will also be working through dozens of other bills Youngkin returned to them with suggested changes, including a heavily lobbied measure dealing with so-called skill games, gambling machines that proliferated in convenience stores and other small businesses around the state before lawmakers passed a ban in 2020.\nThis year's legislation would legalize, regulate and tax the machines, though the changes Youngkin suggested would implement far stricter limits and a higher tax rate than the version the Assembly sent him. Convenience stores around the state staged demonstrations this week, briefly halting lottery ticket sales Monday and closing for an hour on Tuesday, in an effort to draw attention to the issue and urge lawmakers to reject the governor's amendments.\nAdvertisement\nSurovell said he saw the skill-games bill as one of two that could potentially face a veto override, the other being a measure that would have allowed all localities to hold a referendum on raising sales taxes to help fund school construction. The bill passed with strong bipartisan support and has been supported by school officials in red-leaning rural areas.\nIn remarks Tuesday with reporters, House Speaker Don Scott said he's gotten calls from school superintendents in southwest Virginia who questioned the veto. Scott also criticized the governor for a proposed amendment that would ban state funding for abortions in cases of severe fetal abnormalities.\nBetween Youngkin's proposed amendments and his record number of vetoes \u2014 more this year alone than in any of the complete four-year terms of the state's past seven governors, according to the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project \u2014 the governor showed he's no moderate, Scott said.\nAdvertisement\n'He went after the most vulnerable citizens again,' Scott said. 'And so we're just saying that he's not a middle-ground, bipartisan governor. He has been an extreme \u2014 I call him MAGA-in-disguise \u2014 governor,' Scott said, referring to the 'Make America Great Again' slogan of former president and presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Sarah Rankin","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZEONQYX4N4I65B5MED36M7F6FE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":3.7093635,"_id":"58a29dd636621c698633603d78c5208a"},{"title":"Is it rude to deplane before the row ahead of me?","author":"Natalie B.

What is the courteous practice here? \u2014 Anonymous\nAdvertisement\nIf you're taking the time to write to us for an answer to this question, you're not the problem. I don't think you're acting like a jerk during the disembarkation process, and judging by the description, I'd wager your fellow travelers know you mean well, too.\nTo check my take, I went to three etiquette experts for their deplaning advice.\nNick Leighton, a two-time Emmy award-winning talk show host, and co-host of the podcast 'Were You Raised By Wolves?' started with the general principle that etiquette is all about the acknowledgment that other people exist.\nTo be a polite traveler, 'we want to minimize inconvenience to people unnecessarily,' he said. 'We want to be mindful of other passengers.' You appear to be doing this, so good on you.\nLeighton pointed out that airplanes can be a battleground for etiquette issues because they confine lots of people together from many different backgrounds.\nAdvertisement\n'All etiquette is local etiquette,' he said. 'Paris, France, and Paris, Texas, have different etiquette ... everybody's working on slightly different etiquette playbooks.'\nThat means there will be people on a plane with different opinions on when to de-board.\nIn the United States, we have a generally agreed upon rule that passengers should wait for the rows in front of them to exit before stepping into the aisle, with the exception of allowing passengers through who have tight connections.\n'It should be row by row \u2014 there's no question about that,' said Jules Hirst, an etiquette expert and co-author of the book 'Power of Civility.'\nThe gray area kicks in with when to stand up, she said, although you should never stand before the seat belt light goes off. A passenger standing could stop the taxing process.\nAdvertisement\nIn a perfect world, we would all stay seated like church mice until we can time perfectly when to pop up, grab our stuff and leave right behind the row in front of us \u2014 not wasting an extra second. But the reality is that sitting in economy takes a physical toll, and many of us want to stand after hours of cramped misery.\nHirst says it's acceptable for you to stand and give yourself some relief, just be mindful of any travelers who may need to pass you.\nLisa Mirza Grotts, a certified etiquette professional, agreed. As long as you're not trying to jump the line, 'there's no harm in standing in your row while you wait,' she said in an email.\nEvery expert agreed that what's much worse than standing is stalling. Your row mates will appreciate any proactive preparedness.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'If [the aisle passengers] want to jump up, they don't want to jump up \u2014 that's fine,' Leighton said. 'Where I don't want them is their stuff is everywhere, their phone is still plugged into the charger in the seat ... I want to know that when it's our time, they're ready to go.'\nAdvertisement\nParticularly if you're in the aisle seat, you should have your belongings together and ready to leave before it's your turn to exit. If you're looking for a signal, look for people four or five rows ahead of you to finish before you fish your bag from the overhead bin.\nMirza Grotts adds that being ready for your turn 'will only have a positive ripple effect on the plane, and who doesn't want to ride that wave?'\nHave a travel dilemma for By The Way Concierge?

Those hired workers picked up tar balls on the beach, deployed booms from boats to soak up oil and rescued injured wildlife.\nMany of them got sick, but a settlement was supposed to help.\nBP agreed to pay workers who got ill after exposure to oil and a chemical dispersant used to break it up. Early on, the settlement was praised by attorneys for workers and BP as a fair solution that would provide money to victims without placing too much burden on them to prove their claims.\nThe Associated Press found that in practice the settlement didn't work out that way. A smaller number of people than hoped got paid \u2014 and it was less money than they expected.\nAdvertisement\nThousands later were forced to file federal lawsuits that have been dismissed in batches across the South. The AP found just one person, boat captain John Maas, who sued and successfully settled with BP.\nHOW PEOPLE GET SICK FROM AN OIL SPILL\nTo break up the oil, roughly 1.8 million gallons of the dispersant Corexit were dropped from planes and sprayed from boats. Research has found it can damage cells that protect airways and cause scarring that narrows breathing tubes, making it harder to breathe over time.\nPlus, oil itself is linked to illness. One of its toxic components is benzene, which can cause conditions ranging from skin irritation to cancer.\nMajor studies, including by the National Institutes of Health, have found that workers exposed to oil were more likely to experience dizziness, nausea, lung problems and heart attacks.\nAdvertisement\nTHE FIRST BIG PROBLEM\nAt the most basic level, workers and residents could submit affidavits attesting to their medical problems and collect $1,300. The vast majority of those compensated, just under 80%, got this lowest award.\nPeople with long-term illnesses backed up by medical tests could collect up to $60,700, or more if they'd been hospitalized. But almost no one had this medical proof at the time the settlement was approved in early 2013. This became glaringly apparent the next year when BP and the workers' attorneys had a disagreement over a key date.\nBP argued that anyone without a diagnosis before April 12, 2012 couldn't be paid through the routine claims process. Instead, they would fall into a category of people with 'later manifested' conditions who would need to file individual lawsuits for compensation.\nAdvertisement\nWorkers' attorneys disputed that, saying the category was meant only for people whose illnesses showed up several years after the spill, such as any who developed cancer.\nU.S. District Judge Carl Barbier said that when he initially approved the settlement, he didn't expect it to force large numbers of people to file lawsuits. In the end, however, he sided with BP, ruling that the settlement's wording made anyone diagnosed after the 2012 date ineligible for a payout after filing a claim.\nThat ruling threw thousands of workers out of the settlement's relatively easy claims process and into federal courts throughout the South.\nTHROWN OUT OF COURT\nWorkers have fared poorly in federal court.\nThe Nations Law Firm, for example, represented huge numbers of workers and had collected medical evidence believing that would help clients receive more than the settlement's $1,300 minimum through the claims process.\nAdvertisement\nBut when those workers were forced to file lawsuits, BP alleged in a Mississippi federal court that the firm manufactured medical diagnoses. Then Nations agreed to dismiss cases by the dozens. In an interview, Nations did not deny BP's allegations but said the cases were unwinnable without an adequate expert witness.\nIt was also hard for workers to convince courts that the scientific evidence was strong enough to show they were exposed to enough oil and dispersant to likely cause their illness.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe workers' experts relied on studies, such as those from the National Institutes of Health, that found people exposed to oil and Corexit were more likely to develop certain illnesses.\nBut BP's experts argued individual workers needed to show exactly how much oil and dispersant they had inhaled or ingested and that it was sufficient to cause their sickness.\nAdvertisement\nBP also poked holes in professional histories and work of some experts put forward by workers' attorneys. And some law firms with hundreds of cases buckled under the strain, begging judges for more time so overloaded experts could produce reports.\nMost judges have sided with BP, rejecting workers' experts as unreliable, effectively ending the cases.\nLOOKING AHEAD\nThe Downs Law Group, which has lost hundreds of cases against BP, is pursuing appeals in two federal circuit courts, hoping they'll rule district judges have misconstrued the level of proof needed for toxic exposure cases. One of those judges said the issue is 'very ripe for the Supreme Court to resolve.'\n'It has a broader reach than the BP oil spill,' said Jason Clark, a Downs attorney. 'If the burden is one that's too high for any plaintiff to meet, then a lot of people who are exposed ... are never going to see justice.'\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Michael Phillis,Travis Loller","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XCFR3UH5RII65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":3.7017717,"_id":"2637ae14a797f655ba3a4cd6acba7db0"},{"title":"Europe wants 2 things from China.

Second, a reduction in the trade imbalance \u2014 Chinese goods exports to the EU exceeded its imports from the 27-nation bloc by 291 billion euros ($310 billion) last year.\nIt's not clear if it will get very far on either front.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz became the latest European leader to leave China with promises to talk but little more. The Chinese statements on his meetings in Beijing this week didn't appear to give ground on the issues that divide the EU and China.\nThere is some reason for hope in Europe. China badly wants foreign investment to boost its sluggish economy. And China has made efforts to mend its relationships from Europe to the United States and Australia, despite its differences with them.\nAdvertisement\nBut those considerations may not outweigh the larger strategic reasons China has for aligning itself with Russia as it seeks an alternative to the U.S.-led global order and for promoting its green energy companies as it tries to build the nation into a technology leader.\nA EUROPEAN DIVIDE ON TARIFFS\nBoth the EU and the U.S. are complaining that Chinese policies to promote green energy have incentivized companies to build too much manufacturing capacity for electric cars, solar panels and other related products.\nLow-priced exports have taken a toll on solar companies in Europe and America and pose a potential threat to other industries. The EU launched an investigation last fall into Chinese subsidies and could impose tariffs on electric vehicles exported from China.\nChina has agreed to talks on production capacity with the U.S. but remained steadfast in defending its exports of green energy products. They have 'not only enriched global supply and eased global inflationary pressure, but also made an important contribution to the global response to climate change and the green and low-carbon transition,' Chinese leader Xi Jinping told Scholz.\nAdvertisement\nOvercapacity is also a problem for China. Experts have called for better policy coordination. so that not every province promotes the same industries. While that may avoid future problems, it won't reduce existing overcapacity.\nNot everyone in Europe agrees that tariffs would be a good thing. China is a major market for many European companies, and some fear tariffs could trigger a trade war.\nThe German Chamber of Commerce said it would like the focus to be on further opening Chinese markets to German companies. In line with that thinking, Scholz called for a reliable legal system, the protection of intellectual property and equal market access for foreign firms in China.\nThese issues have taken on increased importance as Chinese companies emerge as innovation leaders in key technologies. A recent Chamber survey of German companies found that 5% viewed Chinese competitors as innovation leaders, with 11% doing so in the auto sector.\nAdvertisement\n'This is really a new topic,' said Maximilian Butek, executive director of the German Chamber of Commerce in East China. 'And if those highly competitive companies are still protected by the government, then we have actually global challenges resulting from that.'\nA FUNDAMENTAL DIVIDE ON UKRAINE\nIf there is one issue most of Europe can agree on, it is the hope that China would lean on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the invasion of Ukraine, now in its third year with no sign of letting up.\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said three weeks ago in Beijing that he had asked Chinese leaders 'to put their considerable weight ... on Russia to influence the course of events.' Five days later, French Foreign Minister St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 said after meeting his Chinese counterpart that France expects China to pass on clear messages to Russia on Ukraine.\nAdvertisement\nThis week it was Scholz's turn. 'China's word carries weight in Russia,' he said. 'So I asked President Xi to bear upon Russia so that Putin finally breaks off his insane campaign, withdraws his troops and ends this terrible war.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe problem is that Europe and China have fundamentally different starting points. Europe, together with the United States, says Russia is in the wrong and should pull its forces back and leave Ukraine. China doesn't blame Russia, and says any peace settlement would need to address Russia's concerns as well as those of Ukraine and the West.\nChina has undercut Western sanctions by continuing to trade with Russia, and Scholz and others have expressed concern about reports that Chinese companies are selling 'dual-use' items that help Russia build military hardware. China has blamed the U.S. and others for prolonging the fighting by supplying armaments to Ukraine.\nAdvertisement\n'China has not provided weapons to either side, and it is China's right to maintain normal economic and trade relations with Russia,' said Ding Chun, the director of the Center for European Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.\nThe Chinese government shares the desire of others to see an end to the fighting but seems unlikely to pressure Russia to pull out.

A standalone bill with a six-month selling deadline passed the House in March by an overwhelming bipartisan vote as both Democrats and Republicans voiced national security concerns about the app's owner, the Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd.\nThe modified measure, passed by a 360-58 vote, now goes to the Senate after negotiations that produced a compromise.\nAdvertisement\nEven if the legislation becomes law, though, the company would have up to a year to find a buyer and would likely try to challenge the law in court, arguing it would deprive the app's millions of users of their First Amendment rights. Court challenges could significantly delay the timeline set out by Congress or block the law from going into effect.\nThe company lobbied hard against the legislation, pushing the app's 170 million U.S. users \u2014 many of whom are young \u2014 to call Congress and voice opposition. But the ferocity of the pushback angered lawmakers on Capitol Hill, where there is broad concern about Chinese threats to the U.S. and where few members use the platform themselves.\n'We will not stop fighting and advocating for you,' TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said in a video that was posted on the platform last month and directed toward the app's users. 'We will continue to do all we can, including exercising our legal rights, to protect this amazing platform that we have built with you.'\nAdvertisement\nThe bill's quick path through Congress is extraordinary because it targets one company and because Congress has taken a hands-off approach to tech regulation for decades. Lawmakers had failed to act despite efforts to protect children online, safeguard users' privacy and make companies more liable for content posted on their platforms, among other measures.\nThe TikTok ban reflects widespread concerns from lawmakers about China.\nMembers of both parties, along with intelligence officials, have worried that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over American user data or direct the company to suppress or boost TikTok content favorable to its interests. TikTok has denied assertions that it could be used as a tool of the Chinese government and has said it has not shared U.S. user data with Chinese authorities.\nAdvertisement\nThe U.S. government has not publicly provided evidence that shows TikTok shared U.S. user data with the Chinese government or tinkered with the company's popular algorithm, which influences what Americans see.\nThe company has good reason to think a legal challenge could be successful, having seen some success in previous legal fights over its operations in the U.S.. In November, a federal judge blocked a Montana law that would ban TikTok use across the state after the company and five content creators who use the platform sued.\nIn 2020, federal courts blocked an executive order issued by then-President Donald Trump to ban TikTok after the company sued on the grounds that the order violated free speech and due process rights. His administration brokered a deal that would have had U.S. corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok. The sale never went through for a number of reasons; one was China, which imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers.\nAdvertisement\nDozens of states and the federal government have put in place TikTok bans on government devices. Texas' ban was challenged last year by The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which argued in a lawsuit that the policy was impeding academic freedom because it extended to public universities.

In California, the world's fifth largest economy, such businesses are already required to register with the Secretary of State and share information including the name of the business, its address and the names of its executives or representatives.\nBut Democratic state Sen. Maria Elana Durazo said that that's not enough. She also wants the public to know who actually owns the company. Her bill would require these companies to list anyone who owns at least 25% of the company's assets on its registration with the state. It would apply to all LLCs and similar corporations regardless of the size.\nAdvertisement\nDurazo said the lack of that crucial information has allowed people to set up business structures where one company is owned in the name of another, all to shield their identities from the public, government officials and even law enforcement agencies. In many cases, local and state officials must spend significant time and resources to track down the owners before they can charge or sue the business for violating state laws, if they can find them at all.\n'Some owners can abuse LLC to shield not only their assets but also their identities,' Durazo said at a hearing Wednesday. 'This is a good governance bill.'\nWith support from labor, housing and environmental groups, her bill passed a key legislative committee Wednesday. There was no debate. It needs a second committee vote before reaching the Senate floor.\nAdvertisement\nA similar proposal last year did not survive the Legislature's suspense file, a mysterious process where lawmakers decide \u2014 with no explanation \u2014 whether bills should move forward or not.\nThe legislation faces fierce opposition from a number of business groups including those that represent landlords. They argue that LLCs must already share lots of information with the government and note that they will be required to disclose ownership to a branch of the U.S. Treasury Department by 2025.\nThey also point to costs. Last year, the Secretary of State estimated the new disclosure requirement would cost $9 million to implement and an additional $3.4 million annually in subsequent years to employ 28 support workers.\n'It really doesn't make any sense to us.' said Debra Carlton, an executive of California Apartment Association. 'Why add these costs onto the state,' she asked, 'when we're already having financial challenges?'\nAdvertisement\nThe practice of operating business anonymously is prevalent in many California industries, proponents of the bill said. In Oakland, after city officials condemned a dilapidated building rented out to low-income immigrant families, the city attorney's office spent more than a year investigating and combing through hundreds of city code enforcement records to find the owners of the building, said Suzie Dershowitz, who worked on the case at the time. The city eventually found and successfully sued the landlords, who owned more than 130 properties in the city through a network of LLCs and corporations. The investigation would have had taken half a day of work if Durazo's bill was law at the time, she added.\n'As a government agency, I had access to a lot of information,' said Dershowitz, who now works for Public Advocates, an advocacy group sponsoring the bill. 'But the lack of transparency in corporate ownership really hampered our investigation.'\nSome employers also rely on the practice to dodge labor violations and cheat workers out of their pay, labor attorney Ruth Silver-Taube said. She pointed to a case in San Jose where a hotel worker was fired from his job for filing a wage theft claim with the state. The state couldn't track down the business owners and had to name 14 different companies, some of which were defunct, in its lawsuit before the owners agreed to settle, she said. The agreement came nine years after the worker filed the initial complaint.\nAdvertisement\n'Justice delayed is justice denied,' Silver-Taube said.\nBy hiding behind an anonymous LLC, Silicon Valley billionaires were successful in shielding their identities in a secretive $800 million land-buying spree in rural Northern California, despite years of local scrutiny.\nOthers managed to dodge legal ramifications and responsibilities altogether through the practice, said Haley Ehlers of climate watchdog organization Climate First: Replacing Oil & Gas. The group has spent years advocating for the removal of orphan and idle wells left behind by defunct oil operations. Orphan wells are often be sold to private, anonymous shell companies designed to go bankrupt to help owners of oil businesses evade legal responsibility to clean up the site, leaving taxpayers to shoulder the cost, she said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'If we had more owner transparency, bad actors wouldn't be able to hide behind a new shell company name,' Ehlers said.\nAdvertisement\nThe federal reporting requirement was passed by Congress in 2021. The legislation requires businesses to report owners to an agency called the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which aims to cut down on shell corporations and money laundering. But currently, only law enforcement and government officials \u2014 not the public \u2014 have access to the information.\nA federal court ruled that the law is unconstitutional and exempted more than 65,000 members of a small business association in Alabama. The Justice Department is now appealing the ruling.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Tr\u00e2n Nguy\u1ec5n","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LEMX2SH5CEI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":3.5654078,"_id":"d7cce31a31ca888d10e41777cc8f99cf"},{"title":"House hearing highlights potential flashpoints in renewed privacy talks","author":"Cristiano Lima-Strong","published_date":"2024-04-18 09:57:13","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/18/house-hearing-highlights-potential-flashpoints-renewed-privacy-talks","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"'I'm fired up.

Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.).\nHere are our top takeaways from the session:\nMembers are largely on the same page on core details of a privacy pact\nAfter years of back-and-forth debate over whether a federal privacy law should override state standards and give consumers the ability to sue companies, there was limited disagreement at Wednesday's hearing about lawmakers' proposed compromise on those issues.\nSome of the members and witnesses testifying raised questions about the scope of the bill's state-preemption language or its limits on the right to bring lawsuits. But there was little to no disagreement that Congress needs a deal on those issues to move forward.\nAdvertisement\nThere also appeared to be broad consensus that a framework built around the concept of 'data minimization' \u2014 that companies should only collect as much information as they need to offer specific services \u2014 is the right approach for a national privacy standard. Pallone, who as chair advanced a separate 'comprehensive' privacy bill during the last Congress, noted that the new proposal 'adopts many of the key pillars' of the prior effort, including data minimization rules.\nChildren's privacy, online safety may be the biggest wild cards\nAs has been the case for years , whether lawmakers agree to advance both broader privacy safeguards for all consumers as well as heightened protections for children online could decide whether any legislation can succeed this Congress.\nAs has been the case for years , whether lawmakers agree to advance both broader privacy safeguards for all consumers as well as heightened protections for children online could decide whether any legislation can succeed this Congress.\nThe session marked the first time House lawmakers considered legislation that has already advanced twice in the Senate to expand federal privacy protections for kids and create new safety obligations for digital platforms, the Kids Online Safety Act and the Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act, otherwise known as KOSA and COPPA 2.0.\nAdvertisement\nIn a notable shift in tone, McMorris Rodgers talked about advancing the two buckets of legislation together. 'Working together with other important legislation \u2026 these solutions will ensure the best protections to date for our children,' she said of the kids-focused bills.\nBut Pallone voiced concern that the children's privacy update, COPPA 2.0, 'does not provide sufficiently robust privacy protections for children,' and he appeared to call for including such guardrails in the broader privacy bill, rather than taking up a stand-alone bill. Hashing out that dispute, as well as what other children's protections to include, will be key for lawmakers.\nThe data broker dilemma\nSeveral members said any privacy package must include stronger rights allowing consumers to control how data brokers collect and use their personal information.\nAdvertisement\nRep. Lori Trahan (D-Mass.) said she was concerned that the draft privacy proposal would require that users 'individually' ask hundreds of data brokers to delete their information, rather than creating a central mechanism where they could do so in one place, as her separate Delete Act proposal would do. 'That's just not feasible,' she said of the current approach.\nLori Trahan (D-Mass.) said she was concerned that the draft privacy proposal would require that users 'individually' ask hundreds of data brokers to delete their information, rather than creating a central mechanism where they could do so in one place, as her separate Delete Act proposal would do. 'That's just not feasible,' she said of the current approach.\nThere are also questions about how the fresh privacy efforts will intersect with other attempts to rein in data brokers. Those include a measure that passed the House last month to bar 'foreign adversaries' from buying Americans' data from brokers and a separate bill to prevent the U.S. government from obtaining users' data without a warrant .\na measure that passed the House last month to bar 'foreign adversaries' from buying Americans' data from brokers and a separate bill to prevent the U.S. government from obtaining users' data without a warrant .\nHill happenings\nAdvertisement\nInside the industry\nCompetition watch\nPrivacy monitor\nWorkforce report\nTrending\nDaybook\nSemafor hosts its World Economy Summit event Wednesday and Thursday at Gallup's Great Hall and the Mellon Auditorium.\nBefore you log off\nNew: Facebook's AI chatbot told a parent in a group asking for advice that it has a gifted, disabled child who attended school in New York Cityhttps://t.co/BE6rfxfTpi\nspotted by @korolova pic.twitter.com/Hr72ceYO4H\nspotted by @korolova pic.twitter.com/Hr72ceYO4H \u2014 Jason Koebler (@jason_koebler) April 17, 2024","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Cristiano Lima-Strong","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UZY6YZH7WVSUV7QALQWKYSURSY_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":3.4387896,"_id":"1965ecef44731b3270dd27ba7b406111"},{"title":"Tex. hack may be first disruption of U.S. water system by Russia","author":"Ellen Nakashima","published_date":"2024-04-17 13:04:53","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/17/tex-hack-may-be-first-disruption-us-water-system-by-russia","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Cyber firm Mandiant suspects the hackers are tied to Russian military spy group Sandworm.","summary":"Happy Wednesday!

An infinite number of variables (e.g., Trump could be convicted, Trump could be acquitted, a wider Middle East war could break out, Biden could negotiate a Middle East peace deal) are at play. Just think how a single speech, Biden's State of the Union, affected voters' perception. Polling before that event that didn't account for it appeared even less relevant in retrospect.\nthen will look the way the polls do now.

Honestly, it is a cheaply obtained, lazy way to generate an audience.\neverything between now and then will determine the outcome. So what's the point of polling in April? Honestly, it is a cheaply obtained, lazy way to generate an audience.\nEarly polling rarely reflects the outcome. Too much (it's called 'the campaign') happens in the interim. That was true in 2020, 2016, 2012 and 2008. Pollsters struggle with extremely low response rates and uncertainty in determining who will vote months from now. But the problem is more basic.\nBrian Klaas, a political scientist and author of the fascinating book 'Fluke: Chance, Chaos, and Why Everything We Do Matters,' told an interviewer in January: 'I have no idea who's going to win the 2024 election. It's impossible to say, and that's because the world is going to change drastically in the next 10 months or so.' He adds that 'anyone who tells you, \u2018Oh, I know exactly what's going on,' they're just lying to you.' Maybe they are just desperately trying to sell newspapers, draw eyeballs and attract clicks.\nAdvertisement\nKlaas continued, 'We don't know what's going to happen. I wish that there was a bit more humility in forecasting and a bit more recognition that chaos theory tells us that the ability to predict the future is a pipe dream. We're not going to be in that world where we can imagine the future quite clearly.'\nPsychologists tell us we have an inherent bias (specifically, projection bias) that leads us to assume that the future ( Biden loses! ) will resemble the present ( Biden behind!) . And yet, in April 2008, few anticipated the financial collapse that essentially doomed John McCain's campaign; in April 2016, no one imagined that former FBI director James B. Comey would pipe up with 'new evidence' about Hillary Clinton's emails 11 days before the election. And the 'red wave' forecasters who spent months predicting a Democratic wipeout in 2022 never accounted for Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization . In other words, stuff happens.\nBiden loses!) will resemble the present (Biden behind!).

But as countries around the world urge Israel to show restraint and the threat of a multi-front war mounts, it's clear that a direct Israeli attack on Iranian soil would lead to major fallout.\nIran says it carried out the strike to avenge an Israeli airstrike that killed two Iranian generals in Syria on April 1. It has pledged a much tougher response to any Israeli counterattack attack on its soil.\nWith Israel focused on its war against Hamas in Gaza, and already battling Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon every day, the U.S. has urged Israel to show restraint.\nAdvertisement\nU.S. officials say President Joe Biden has told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. will not participate in any offensive action against Iran, and the president made 'very clear' to Netanyahu 'that we do have to think carefully and strategically' about the risks of escalation.\nIsrael's war cabinet has spent the last two days debating their next move. Here are some considerations key to their decision.\nINCREASING ISRAELI ISOLATION\nIsrael's successful air defense Saturday night \u2014 conducted in tandem with the U.S., Britain, France and Jordan \u2014 bought the country a brief moment of international support and sympathy after months of mounting international isolation over the Gaza war. The six-month offensive has killed nearly 34,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and unleashed a humanitarian catastrophe.\nAdvertisement\nA coalition of international partners helped Israel defend itself effectively. Israel's military says 99% of the weapons were intercepted, with few reaching Israeli airspace. The attack caused only minor damage and wounded one person: a 7-year-old girl.\nThis coalition worked under the leadership of the U.S. Central Command, which oversees American forces in the region. It works closely with Israel and moderate Arab countries to form a unified front against Iran.\nJordan, a country whose population is predominantly pro-Palestinian, joined the effort, despite being at odds with Israel over the war in Gaza, calling its participation self-defense.\nIt also appears likely that help may have come from regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia, which does not have official relations with Israel. A map released by Israel shows many of the Iranian missiles flying through Saudi airspace.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael has been careful not to identify its Arab partners, but an Israeli air force official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the mission, said Israeli warplanes needed to fly 'east of Israel' to shoot down missiles.\nYoel Guzansky, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv think tank, said Israel would be risking this goodwill if it acts alone.\n'Israel can take advantage of this and buy itself a lot of credit right now, if it does not launch a massive retaliatory attack,' he said. 'But if it does attack, a lot of credit is lost.'\nThe tacit support of Arab states does not mean they would assist Israel in a counterattack on Iran. Any air or missile response other than ballistic missiles \u2014 which would arc over neighboring countries' airspace rather than through it \u2014 would require overflights of surrounding countries, which technically would require Israel obtain permission from those Arab neighbors, said Daniel Byman, a senior fellow with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nAdvertisement\n'With Saudi Arabia and Jordan, there's kind of a route and access questions,' in terms of whether they would grant Israel overflight clearance.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'From Iran's point of view, that would be seen as a hostile act,' Byman said. 'And even though these countries don't like Iran, they're not terribly eager to be seen on the side of Israel doing that.'\nFEARS OF A MULTI-FRONT WAR\nA major retaliatory strike on Iranian soil risks sparking a full-scale regional war, so any response must be carefully calculated.\nA direct strike on Iranian soil would almost certainly result in a brutal counterattack and risk prompting Hezbollah to launch further attacks. The Iranian-backed Lebanese group has a far more powerful arsenal than Hamas, but has so far shown hesitancy about engaging in an all-out war.\nSome 60,000 citizens in northern Israel already have been forced to evacuate their homes due to ongoing exchanges with Hezbollah. Heavier fighting would likely force them to spend even more time away from home.\nAdvertisement\nA direct conflict would also further stretch Israel's military, remove its focus from Gaza and hamper Israel's war-wearied economy.\nAny major attack on Iranian soil could also undermine shaky U.S. support for the war.\nTwo U.S. officials said Israel has not yet told the U.S. how it intends to respond. But the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe diplomatic discussions, said Israel has signaled that whatever it does will be designed to prevent a worsening of the already tense regional security situation. That could point to a more limited action, such as a strike on Iranian proxies across the region or a cyber attack on Iran.\nTamar Hermann, a polling expert at the Israel Democracy Institute, says most Israelis are in favor of some sort of military response as long as it is coordinated with regional allies, including the United States.\nAdvertisement\n'If it is done with no consultation and no agreement with allies \u2026 support will be much smaller,' Hermann said.\nMILITARY CAPACITY\nIsrael's army is vastly superior to others in the region. It possesses a range of high-tech weaponry, including F35 fighter planes that can launch long-range munitions. Experts say it has the ability to directly strike Iran or its proxies in the region.\nFabian Hinz, a weapons expert and research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Iranian air force is 'not even remotely comparable.' He said the force is composed of a collection of planes from the 1980s and 90s, with some dating back to the reign of the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi who ruled the country until 1979.\nThe extent of the Islamic republic's air defense system is less known, he said. Many of Iran's missile sites and nuclear installations are deep underground, making them difficult to hit, Hindz added. Israel might also need the agreement of Gulf Arab countries to use their airspace \u2014 something that is not guaranteed.\n'I don't think it's going to be a full-scale Israeli attack against many targets all over Iran,' said Raz Zimmt, another senior researcher at Israel's INSS. 'It will probably be limited against one or two, perhaps inside Iran.'\n___","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jack Jeffery,Julia Frankel","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZWPIQPH4FUI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":3.33576,"_id":"d25e1ef5baadd6d01aacec434d174e8f"},{"title":"Biden limits oil drilling across 13 million acres of Alaskan Arctic","author":"Maxine Joselow","published_date":"2024-04-19 09:01:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/04/19/drilling-alaska-national-petroleum-reserve","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The Interior Department finalized a rule limiting future oil and gas development across 13 million acres of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.","summary":"Future oil and gas drilling will be limited across more than 13 million acres of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, the nation's largest expanse of public land, under a sweeping Biden administration plan aimed at protecting sensitive ecosystems and wildlife.\nThe Interior Department's final rule represents one of President Biden's most significant steps to curb fossil fuel development on federal lands. It could help the president's reelection campaign court young voters, a key Democratic constituency, after many youth climate activists criticized the administration's approval of a massive drilling project on Alaska's North Slope last year.\nIn a separate move, Interior announced Friday that it will block a controversial road crucial to operating a planned copper and zinc mine in northern Alaska, saying it would threaten Indigenous communities and fragment wildlife habitat. Together, the two decisions are aimed at safeguarding some of Alaska's last wild places from development.\nAdvertisement\nIn a statement, Biden said he was proud of his administration's efforts to protect the Arctic for current and future generations.\n'Alaska's majestic and rugged lands and waters are among the most remarkable and healthy landscapes in the world, sustaining a vibrant subsistence economy for Alaska Native communities,' Biden said. 'These natural wonders demand our protection.'\nBoth moves carry political and legal risks for the administration. In particular, the protections for the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska are expected to face lawsuits from fossil fuel companies and fierce opposition from Alaskan lawmakers, including Rep. Mary Peltola, a popular Democrat who faces a tough reelection contest.\nPeltola, whose race will help determine which party controls the House, wrote in a social media post last week that the administration was ignoring Alaskans' preferences for drilling in the reserve.\nAdvertisement\n'In the end it should be up to Alaskans to decide what they want developed in their regions,' Peltola wrote. 'I'm calling on the Biden Administration to rethink this misguided action that would only hurt Alaskans and our domestic energy production.'\nThe roughly 23 million-acre National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska is one of the most ecologically valuable tracts of federal land. It provides a critical refuge for tens of thousands of migrating caribou, as well as polar bears, grizzly bears, walruses and waterfowl.\nTeshekpuk Lake, in the eastern part of the reserve, is one of the most important places for waterfowl in the entire Arctic. Up to 100,000 geese converge on the area each summer, seeking safety from predators as they molt and become flightless. The adjacent wetlands serve as breeding grounds for several types of shorebirds, including dunlins, sandpipers and black-bellied plovers.\nYet the reserve, about the size of Indiana, is also one of the most promising onshore oil prospects in the country. Two weeks before leaving office, President Donald Trump sought to open up the reserve to oil and gas leasing, saying it would make the United States less dependent on foreign sources of energy.\nAdvertisement\nThe Biden administration has reversed course. In a proposed rule released last year, the Interior Department called for designating approximately 13 million acres of the reserve as 'special areas' where future oil and gas leasing would be limited. The agency also recommended an outright ban on new leasing across 10.6 million acres \u2014 more than 40 percent of the reserve.\nThe final rule closely resembles the proposed rule. Like the proposal, it would not affect ConocoPhillips's controversial Willow oil drilling project or other existing leases in the reserve. Willow alone could produce between 576 million and 614 million barrels of oil over the next 30 years.\n'The approval of Willow was certainly disappointing to many of us who recognize the climate impact of oil and gas development,' said Rachael Hamby, policy director at the Center for Western Priorities, a conservation group. 'With the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska rule, I think we see a more balanced approach to managing public lands for multiple uses, including conservation.'\nAdvertisement\nFossil fuel companies disagree. In public comments on the proposed rule, ConocoPhillips wrote that it could 'significantly and adversely affect future proposals for new activities and developments' in the reserve. Armstrong Oil & Gas, which has leases in the reserve spanning 1.1 million acres, said the proposal could prevent it from building the infrastructure needed to access those tracts.\nThe final rule drew a mixed reaction from Alaska Natives, who have lived on the North Slope for millennia and subsist on its caribou.\nDoreen Leavitt, director of natural resources for the I\u00f1upiat Community of the Arctic Slope, said the administration did not adequately consult Alaska Natives about the economic benefits of fossil fuel development in this remote region. Taxes on oil and gas infrastructure have funded local schools, police officers, firefighters and sanitation services.\nAdvertisement\n'We're barely 50 years away from getting indoor plumbing, and that was brought by oil and gas,' Leavitt said, adding, 'We feel that our voices haven't been listened to.'\nRosemary Ahtuangaruak, the former mayor of Nuiqsut, a town of roughly 500 people on the North Slope, said oil drilling has brought both prosperity and peril to her community. The region around Nuiqsut (pronounced noo-IK-sut) is one of the fastest-warming places on Earth. Its average temperature has risen 4 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels \u2014 more than three times the global average, according to a Washington Post analysis of temperature data.\nThe warmer climate has taken a toll on caribou populations near Nuiqsut, where residents get half their food through hunting. Warmer waters and less sea ice have also shifted the migration patterns of bowhead whales and derailed the fall whale hunt, an essential tradition for the Inupiat of the North Slope.\nAdvertisement\n'We want to protect our cultural traditions,' Ahtuangaruak said. 'And we want to give future generations hope that they won't be continually fighting to protect our way of life.'\nInterior's decision to block Ambler Road is intended to safeguard such lifestyles. In an analysis released Friday, the agency found that the road could threaten the subsistence activities of more than 60 Alaska Native communities, up from 27 communities in a highly contested 2020 analysis completed during the Trump administration. It also found that the road could cause irreparable harm to caribou and permafrost.\nAs a result, Interior recommended that there should be 'no action' on the federal land where the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA) wants to build Ambler Road. If finalized, the decision will prevent AIDEA from receiving a permit to construct the road, and it will effectively block the mining venture Ambler Metals from accessing the planned open-pit mine. The company has yet to seek or obtain permits for the mine.\nAdvertisement\nAIDEA, the state's publicly owned development corporation, had planned for Ambler Road to extend 211 miles, crossing 11 major rivers and breaking apart unspoiled tundra. Twenty-six of those miles would have carved through Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, sending giant trucks rumbling through wild lands where tens of thousands of caribou migrate.\nThe Trump administration approved a right-of-way permit for Ambler Road in 2020, saying it could provide access to significant copper and cobalt deposits. But after Biden took office, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland ordered a fresh review of the road, saying the previous administration had not adequately studied its environmental impact.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Maxine Joselow","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T5HTZWDTHMI6ZCYKXT5LQAGEGA_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":3.2365475,"_id":"707c9213380426f154322c03b5eb2713"},{"title":"The House's Ukraine bill should deliver aid just in time to avert disaster","author":"Max Boot","published_date":"2024-04-20 22:05:11","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/20/house-ukraine-aid-bill-passed","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Having exhausted all the other options, the House finally did the right thing.","summary":"The last U.S. aid bill for Ukraine was approved in December 2022 when Democrats still controlled both houses of Congress. The Biden administration has been requesting another aid package, with growing urgency, since last August. Now, nearly four months after almost all U.S. aid shipments ran out, the Republican-controlled House finally approved on Saturday a $61 billion aid bill for Ukraine as part of a larger foreign-assistance package. This would seem to vindicate the aphorism (often wrongly attributed to Winston Churchill) that America can always be counted on to do the right thing after having exhausted all the alternatives.\nWhile House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) wasted months struggling to stand up to his party's pro-Putin wing, the battlefield situation in Ukraine took an ominous turn for the worse. Russian forces have been advancing since the failure of the Ukrainian counteroffensive last year. In February, the invaders captured Avdiivka, a strategic city in eastern Ukraine, securing their biggest victory since the fall of Bakhmut in May 2023. In all, since the start of the year, Russian forces have taken 139 square miles, an area the size of Detroit, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank.\nFears have been growing that a Russian offensive, reportedly planned for June, could break through Ukraine's depleted front lines. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, told PBS NewsHour this week that his forces were being outgunned 10 to 1 in artillery shells, making it impossible to 'hold our ground.' CIA Director William J. Burns warned on Thursday that Ukraine could 'lose' the war by the end of the year without U.S. aid. The alarms raised by U.S. intelligence agencies \u2014 combined with Iran's attack on Israel \u2014 finally spurred Johnson to act on the long-stalled foreign-aid bill.\nAdvertisement\nRussian forces have been pummeling Ukrainian defenders not only with artillery fire but also with massive 'glide bombs' that can shatter fortifications. Meanwhile, Ukraine has confronted a critical shortage of air-defense ammunition, forcing senior leaders to make a Sophie's choice between protecting front-line troops or urban centers.\nRecent Russian airstrikes have inflicted heavy damage on Ukraine's electrical infrastructure, and this week, a Russian missile strike on the city of Chernihiv killed at least 18 people. Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, located only 20 miles from Russia, has been hit so hard that its mayor warns it is in danger of becoming 'a second Aleppo,' invoking the Syrian city destroyed by Russian bombing between 2012 and 2016.\nWhile Ukraine has grown weaker, Russia has been getting stronger. In chilling testimony to the House Armed Services Committee on April 10, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, the top U.S. commander in Europe, said that despite losing more than 2,000 tanks and 315,000 soldiers, Russian forces are 'reconstituting \u2026 far faster than our initial estimates suggested.' He noted that the Russian army 'is actually now larger \u2014 by 15 percent \u2014 than it was when it invaded Ukraine.'\nAdvertisement\nEven more concerning than the growing size of the Russian forces is their increased competence. We should not imagine that the Russian army of today is the same one that couldn't keep its tanks and trucks fueled during the initial invasion. As Cavoli noted, 'The Russian military in the past year has shown an accelerating ability to learn and adapt to battlefield challenges both tactically and technologically.'\nThe Ukrainians have still won some critical victories in recent months, such as opening up the Black Sea to Ukrainian grain exports and using long-range drones to knock out one-seventh of Russia's oil refining capacity. But the Russians have achieved parity, at a minimum, in drone capability while bringing to bear superior resources in electronic warfare, artillery and air power.\nFollow this author Max Boot 's opinions\nFollow this author\nMax Boot\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nThe U.S. armed forces must begin delivering emergency aid to Ukraine as soon as the Senate endorses the House bill and President Biden signs it, with artillery shells and air defense ammunition the most urgent priorities. That should allow Ukrainian forces to stanch the erosion of their lines and raise sagging morale. Much more, however, is needed to roll back the growing Russian menace.\nAdvertisement\nUkraine has been short not only of ammunition but also of soldiers: Its roughly 200,000 troops at the front face an estimated 470,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine. Many of the Ukrainian troops have been fighting since the start of the invasion, and they are getting tired and dispirited. Their numbers have been steadily depleted by Russian firepower and 'meat grinder' assaults, leaving many units severely undermanned. (Zelensky said in February that 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the start of the war, but the real toll is probably much higher.)\nYet fewer Ukrainians have been willing to enlist than in the heady early days of the war. That's hardly surprising, given that potential recruits know they could be sent indefinitely to the front without adequate ammunition, leadership or training. Ukraine desperately needs more soldiers to hold the lines and to allow those already at the front to rotate back to the rear.\nEarlier this month, Zelensky signed a badly needed law overhauling the unwieldy conscription process and decreasing the draft age from 27 to 25, but it will take many months to mobilize and train hundreds of thousands of new soldiers. That process can be streamlined if Western militaries send their own trainers \u2014 or at least contractors \u2014 to Ukraine rather than forcing Ukrainian recruits to go to other countries to be trained.\nAdvertisement\nThe House bill calls on the administration to send long-range ATACMS, missiles that could do serious damage to the Crimean bases that support Russian forces in southern Ukraine. Biden should have sent those weapons systems long ago, and it is imperative that they be dispatched now, along with the longer-range Taurus cruise missiles that Germany has so far refused to send. The United States and its allies must enable Ukrainian forces to finally knock out the Kerch Strait bridge linking Crimea to Russia \u2014 a critical cog in Russia's war effort and a Putin showcase project.\nThe United States and its allies also need to dig deep \u2014 and take some short-term risks with their own defense requirements if necessary \u2014 to send more of the Patriot batteries that the Ukrainians are desperately requesting to protect against Russian airstrikes. If the United States will not use its own aircraft to defend Ukraine, as it did for Israel, then this is the least it can do. Beyond saving lives, air defenses offer the additional benefit of allowing Ukraine to expand its own defense production, thereby decreasing its long-term reliance on foreign aid.\nThe good news is that all is far from lost, despite the shamefully long delay in delivering U.S. aid and the resulting loss of Ukrainian lives. Ukraine still controls roughly 80 percent of its own territory, and the Ukrainian people remain united in resistance. The Ukrainian economy is projected to keep growing this year, while Russia is facing its own wartime strains \u2014 which could be exacerbated by tougher sanctions on its oil and gas sector.\nAdvertisement","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Max Boot","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VVVHD2R2NJJYIXD7GP6FWS5WQY.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":3.2280116,"_id":"52020cf5fa229f096d2757059f5434d2"},{"title":"Ukraine's attacks on Russian oil refineries deepen tensions with U.S.","author":"John Hudson","published_date":"2024-04-15 09:00:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/04/15/ukraine-russia-oil-refinery-attacks","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The Biden administration views Ukraine's attacks on Russian oil facilities as reckless. Kyiv sees them as essential.","summary":"BRUSSELS \u2014 When Vice President Harris met privately with Volodymyr Zelensky at the Munich Security Conference in February, she told the Ukrainian leader something he didn't want to hear: Refrain from attacking Russian oil refineries, a tactic U.S. officials believed would raise global energy prices and invite more aggressive Russian retaliation inside Ukraine.\nThe request, according to officials familiar with the matter, irritated Zelensky and his top aides, who view Kyiv's string of drone strikes on Russian energy facilities as a rare bright spot in a grinding war with a bigger and better equipped foe.\nZelensky brushed off the recommendation, uncertain whether it reflected the consensus position of the Biden administration, these people said. But in subsequent weeks, Washington reinforced the warning in multiple conversations with Kyiv, including by national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who traveled to Ukraine's capital in March, and other senior U.S. defense and intelligence officials.\nInstead of acquiescing to the U.S. requests, however, Ukraine doubled down on the strategy, striking a range of Russian facilities, including an April 2 attack on Russia's third-largest refinery 800 miles from the font.\nThe incidents have exacerbated tensions in a strained relationship as Kyiv waits to learn whether Congress will pass a long-stalled $60 billion aid package while Russia's forces pierce Ukrainian positions across the front lines. The long-range Ukrainian strikes, which have hit more than a dozen refineries since January and disrupted at least 10 percent of Russian oil refinery capacity, come as President Biden ramps up his reelection campaign and global oil prices reach a six-month high.\nAdvertisement\nU.S., Ukrainian and European officials spoke about the diverging views between Washington and Kyiv on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive dispute. A spokesman for Zelensky declined to comment.\nDefenders of Ukraine's strategy accuse the White House of prioritizing domestic politics over Kyiv's military goals. 'It sounds to me that the Biden administration doesn't want gas prices to go up in an election year,' Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) told Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during a hearing last week.\n'While Russia is attacking Ukrainians' oil and gas and energy sector, why shouldn't the Ukrainians attack the Russian oil and gas and energy sector?' Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.) asked during a separate recent hearing.\nU.S. officials say the rationale behind their warnings is more nuanced than critics suggest.\nAdvertisement\nKeeping global energy markets supplied to help cool inflation is a priority for the administration, officials acknowledge. But it's also important for sustaining support for the Ukrainian war effort in Europe. 'An increase in energy prices risks dampening European support for Ukraine aid,' a senior U.S. official said.\nThe military benefit of Ukraine's bombing campaign is also of questionable value, U.S. officials say.\n'Ukraine is better served in going after tactical and operational targets that can directly influence the current fight,' Austin told lawmakers.\nThe concern among U.S. military planners is that the strikes do little to diminish Russia's war-fighting abilities and have resulted in a massive Russian counterattack on Ukraine's electricity grid that hurts Ukraine far more than the refinery attacks hurt Russia.\nAdvertisement\n'Drone attacks do not destroy entire refineries and usually do not even destroy individual units, but only damage them,' Sergey Vakulenko, an oil industry expert, wrote in an analysis for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'The Ust-Luga and Ryazan refineries were both back in operation a few weeks after being attacked.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIn recent weeks, Russia has unleashed a barrage of exploding drones and missiles on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, leaving millions without power and raising fears that the attacks could bring Ukraine's economy to a halt. The attacks destroyed a power plant in the Kyiv region and damaged Ukraine's biggest hydroelectric power plant and multiple thermal power plants.\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said the attacks were in direct response to Ukraine's drone strikes on refineries and other infrastructure deep within its territory.\nAdvertisement\nPreviously, the Kremlin had been focusing its attacks on Ukraine's industrial capacity, an effort that some U.S. officials say was having limited impact.\nNow Ukrainian officials are in desperate need to protect their cities, causing further strain over air defense resources between Kyiv and the West. Last week, Zelensky dispatched his top diplomat, Dmytro Kuleba, to Brussels, where NATO foreign ministers gathered to commemorate the military alliance's 75th anniversary. Kuleba's chief demand was for Western countries to donate more Patriot batteries, a U.S.-designed air defense system that costs more than $1 billion.\n'I'm sorry to spoil the birthday party, but who can believe that the mightiest military alliance in the world cannot find seven batteries of Patriots to provide them to the only country in the world that is fighting ballistic attacks every day?' Kuleba said he told his Western counterparts in an uncharacteristically harsh tone.\nAdvertisement\nU.S. opposition to the refinery attacks has angered officials in Kyiv, who view the strikes as fair game given Russia's relentless attacks inside Ukraine. They view the attacks as necessary to raising the cost of Russian aggression and reinforcing that Russian society won't be safe until the war ends.\nThey also view the attacks as necessary given their shrinking supply of artillery needed for challenging Russian positions on the front lines. The transfer of U.S. weaponry to Ukraine has slowed in recent months as the Biden administration pushes Congress to pass aid for Ukraine in a measure that remains unpopular among a key faction of Republicans in the House.\nOthers have said U.S. concerns about higher energy prices because of the refinery attacks are unfounded, noting that the latest increases are due to OPEC Plus production cuts and instability linked to Israel's war with Hamas. 'There is a small geopolitical premium on crude attached to Middle East violence,' said Tom Kloza, head of energy analysis at the petroleum price reporting company OPIS. 'Most of the move to higher prices can be attributed to OPEC Plus production cuts.'\nAdvertisement\nCritics say the Biden administration's public messaging on the attacks has been inconsistent, causing confusion among supporters of Ukraine in Congress and abroad.\nWhen asked about the refinery attacks this month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested that the Biden administration doesn't support Ukrainian strikes inside Russia regardless of the target. 'We have neither supported nor enabled strikes by Ukraine outside of its territory,' he said.\nAustin's response last week to lawmakers, however, expressed a preference for Ukraine to target Russian air bases and other military infrastructure inside Russia rather than oil refineries.\nMeanwhile, another senior Pentagon official, Celeste Wallander, suggested that the key distinction the Biden administration is concerned about is Ukraine hitting military versus civilian targets. 'The issue on attacking critical infrastructure is when those are civilian targets, we have concerns because Ukraine holds itself to the highest standards of observing the laws of armed conflict, and that's one of the elements of being a European democracy,' she told a House panel last week.\nAdvertisement\nThe U.S. positions all stand in contrast to Washington's allies in Europe, who have barely disguised their pleasure with the Ukrainian campaign. 'The Ukrainian people [are] acting in self-defense, and we consider that Russia is the aggressor,' French Foreign Minister St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 said when asked about the strikes during a news conference with Blinken.

Critics say it creates the impression of benefit at the expensive of more effective efforts.","summary":"I\u00d1APARI, Peru \u2014 At the entrance to its sprawling tract of virgin Amazon rainforest, the Peruvian timber company Maderacre turns ancient hardwood trees into flooring on an industrial scale.\nBeside the vast, modern facility, a reddish dirt road leads into the jungle where workers harvest wood that takes centuries to mature.\nwood that takes centuries to mature.\nAs it systematically removes the oldest trees from this stunning wilderness, Maderacre might seem an improbable seller of carbon credits, the financial instrument that in theory allows consumers and corporations to 'offset' their greenhouse gas emissions from air travel, ride-hailing apps, fashion purchases and other pollution-producing activities.\nAdvertisement\nThe company isn't earning credits by planting trees to absorb carbon dioxide. The offsets it sells are based on a hypothetical: An estimate of how many existing trees it prevents from being cut down.\nThere's a logic to this. Maderacre argues that unlike its neighbors \u2014 illegal loggers and homesteaders \u2014 it's carrying out selective, sustainable logging on its 1,000-square-mile timber concession that maintains the forest's ecological balance.\nBut the approach, known as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, or REDD+, raises questions about how to protect the world's forests, which sequester billions of tons of carbon, and about the booming carbon credit market. As the window to avoid catastrophic climate change closes, scientists are questioning the intricate methodologies used to calculate this lucrative counterfactual, known as 'avoided deforestation.'\nSome warn that it might actually be accelerating the climate crisis, as consumers, instead of curbing their emissions, buy credits that do not deliver on their green promises.\nThe stark contrast between Maderacre's lush concession and the barren land around it makes the benefits of offsets seem obvious. Pressing up against the forest's perimeter is a patchwork of dusty fields cleared by unregulated deforesters in a chaotic rush to settle this remote region.\nHousehold brands such as Shell, Southwest Airlines, Disney and Gucci all have used credits generated this way.\nSouthwest stressed that it offered credits to passengers on an optional basis but was not using them as part of its net zero strategy. Shell declined to comment. Disney and Gucci did not respond to requests to comment.\nAccording to S&P Global Commodity Insights, REDD+ represents nearly a third of the voluntary carbon market, worth $2 billion in 2021 but predicted to hit as much as $40 billion a year by 2030.\nBut Britaldo Soares, the professor at Brazil's Minas Gerais Federal University who created the software used by Maderacre, calls REDD+ a 'climate scam.'\n'This is a logging concession,' he said. He developed his Dinamica EGO program to measure the impact of government policies, he said, not to calculate credits. That's the equivalent, he said, of 'predicting the future with a crystal ball.'\nBarbara Haya, who heads the Carbon Trading Project at the University of California at Berkeley, said REDD+ projects around the world are generating 'phantom' credits.\nThe reason, she said, is simple: 'Everyone at the table benefits from more credits. There's over-crediting every which way you turn. It's systematic.'\nBy 'everyone,' she means project developers, the certification companies who set the rules, and the third-party auditors who determine whether a project is preventing forest loss.\nThe latter two, she stressed, have an incentive to approve projects, because rejecting them could deter others from contracting their services.\nWith some projects generating millions of credits, each representing a metric ton of carbon and trading for about $1.40 \u2014 sometimes significantly more \u2014 the temptation to exaggerate avoided emissions is powerful.\nVerra, the nonprofit that holds a 70 percent share of the global carbon project verification market, has to date issued 1.23 billion credits. But it isn't paid only for certification. The group also gets 20 cents per credit sold. Haya calls that a conflict of interest.\nDoubts exist around the baselines, the predictions of deforestation that would occur without a carbon concession. These are calculated in various ways, including projections from historical forest loss and comparisons with other parts of the forest.\n'Maybe they're deliberately exaggerated,' said Erin Sills, an environmental economist at North Carolina State University. 'But it's also perhaps because project developers are trying to predict the future. That's never possible.'\nThen there's 'additionality,' the concept that for emissions to have been avoided, the revenue generated by carbon credits must make the difference between the forest being saved or destroyed.\nAdditionality is difficult to calculate because most carbon projects are layered onto preexisting uses of the land: sustainable logging such as Maderacre's, ecotourism, Brazil-nut gathering \u2014 even protected areas with bans on extractive activities. Many should already have safeguards, such as security guards or perimeter fencing.\nAdvertisement\nSills is one of eight researchers who examined dozens of forest carbon concessions in Africa, Asia and Latin America. In a paper published last year in Science they found most reduced far less deforestation than was claimed.\nOf the 89 million carbon credits that the projects generated, they concluded, only 5.4 million represented genuine reductions in emissions.\nMaderacre had generated nearly 9.7 million credits by late 2021 for buyers including Canada's Scotiabank and the gas-guzzling Dakar Rally. The researchers said they found no evidence that the effort had achieved the deforestation claimed. (Scotiabank declined to comment; the Dakar Rally did not respond to a request for comment.)\nThat analysis is backed by Soares. 'Since it's already a [timber] concession and they have the obligation of conserving it,' he said, 'there's no additionality at all.'\nNelson Kroll, a manager at Maderacre, disagrees. 'Timber is timber, not oil or gold,' he said. 'A business based just on logging can't pay for everything you need to conserve the forest.'\nVerra acknowledges that calculating avoided emissions is complex and imperfect but disputes the researchers' conclusions. The organization stresses that the 'voluntary' carbon market was created by the private sector, pushed by consumer demand, to plug a gap left by governments' failure to set compulsory offset standards in the U.N. climate negotiations.\n'The best hasn't happened, but the good's done a lot of good,' Verra spokesman Joel Finkelstein said. The group constantly updates its methodologies, sometimes in response to harsh criticism from academics and environmentalists.\n'The science 15 years ago was very different to the science now,' Finkelstein said. 'At every point, we've been aiming for the best standard.'\nOn Maderacre's concession, squawking red and blue macaws swoop overhead as capuchin monkeys frolic in the canopy. The jaguar population is so dense that the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance runs a research project on the alpha predator.\nBut on the neighboring plots, Cebu cattle dot brown fields of low-quality pasture. Small, in many cases failed and abandoned, plantations of teak \u2014 not native to the Amazon \u2014 break up the terrain. Columns of smoke tower on the horizon.\nThe ecocide has been driven by the Interoceanic Highway. The 1,600-mile road, completed in 2011, was intended to connect Brazilian commodities to Peru's Pacific ports to feed China's insatiable economy.\nLittle freight now passes along the highway. Former Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo, who launched the highway with Brazilian President Luis In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, is now in pretrial detention, accused of taking a $25-million bribe in return for contracts to build it.\nYet the road has, literally, paved the way to destruction for this corner of the Amazon. Maderacre has at least kept the deforestation from overwhelming its concession.\n'The deforestation's real, and someone has to do the work,' said Kroll, a forestry engineer who previously worked as an Amazon park guard.\nHe stresses that Maderacre harvests one tree per hectare every 30 years, and takes only shihuahaco trunks with diameters more than 75 centimeters, a stricter standard than the legal minimum of 51 centimeters.\nAdvertisement\n'This isn't a timber concession. It's a nature concession,' Kroll said. 'Until we find ways for living forests to be economically competitive, they're going to continue being decimated.'\nSills believes sweeping change is needed.\n'We rely on these offsets to reduce our own footprints, but the result is net higher emissions,' she said. 'The climate's the real loser.'","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Simeon Tegel","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/33RFJXYDQGMGN75AXTAYZICJ7A.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":3.13443,"_id":"10471c6826cadb2eae6af1b76f2a7e49"},{"title":"Russia ramps up weapons production, using mass quantity to outgun Ukraine","author":"Mary Ilyushina","published_date":"2024-04-19 05:00:20","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/19/russia-weapons-production-ukraine-war","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Russia has managed to overcome its initial losses in Ukraine by putting factories into overdrive to make older but reliable weapons and ammunition.","summary":"Russia has ramped up military production by replenishing stocks of standard weapons and ammunition and probably can sustain its onslaught in Ukraine for at least the next two years, analysts say \u2014 a sobering assessment for Kyiv, which is short on weapons and soldiers and losing ground on the battlefield.\nWhile the Kremlin is struggling to expand capacity and to develop modern arms that could improve its army's battlefield performance, it has capitalized on its overwhelming advantage in numbers of soldiers, its ability to arm them with old but reliable weaponry and a willingness to endure heavy casualties.\nBy recalibrating its economy on a war footing, forcing existing facilities to work in overdrive to produce or refurbish older equipment, and buying parts from Iran, China and North Korea, Russia has made a surprising recovery from its early losses in Ukraine.\nAdvertisement\n'Russia is not producing more of its modern fighting equipment,' said Nikolai Kulbaka, a Russian economist. 'But it has been making a lot more of simpler working equipment, rifles, shells, mass weapons for mass soldiers.'\nAs Western military aid for Kyiv has slowed in recent months, including in the United States, Russian forces have retaken the initiative in Ukraine, where they can now fire artillery and deploy drones at a far higher rate than the Ukrainians.\nRussia has rearmed its forces by refurbishing existing gear \u2014 much of it dating to the Soviet era. Replacement parts from China, North Korea and Iran are of inconsistent quality, experts said, but procuring them has demonstrated Moscow's ability to circumvent sanctions.\nThe Soviet-era equipment, including missiles and guided aerial bombs, has compensated for Russia's failure, at least so far, to produce and deploy new, advanced weapons such as the T-14 Armata tank that theoretically could rival the U.S.-made Abrams and German-made Leopards that the West has given Ukraine.\nAdvertisement\nU.S. officials initially believed the war in Ukraine had seriously degraded Russia's military. But Gen. Christopher G. Cavoli, the top U.S. commander in Europe, testified in Congress this month that Moscow now had more soldiers than at the start of its invasion, and that its armed forces have 'shown an accelerating ability to learn and adapt to battlefield challenges both tactically and technologically.'\nLate last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin approved a record increase in military spending for 2024, planning to spend around $115 billion, nearly one-third of the country's total annual budget and double the amount allocated for the military in 2021, the year before the invasion of Ukraine.\nIn recent months, top Russian officials, including Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, have claimed record numbers, reporting to Putin that the military-industrial complex has quadrupled production of armored vehicles, quintupled the supply of tanks and boosted manufacturing of drones and artillery shells by nearly 17 times.\nAdvertisement\nThese numbers, including a claim that 1,500 tanks were built in 2023, cannot be verified because the government does not disclose statistics about military production and the costs of the war and because the military often uses creative accounting, conflating new and rebuilt materiel, to show positive results.\n'My impression is that Shoigu's numbers and the figure of 1,500 tanks supplied over 2023 is technically correct, but it also includes refurbished stuff,' said Michael Gjerstad, land warfare analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a London-based think tank. 'There could also be a percentage of tanks that are being cannibalized and their parts used to make other tanks, which could also be added into the statistics.'\nGjerstad said he believes Russia can manufacture up to 330 tanks a year but is actually building half that. Still, Russia managed to replenish about 1,140 tanks that it is estimated to have lost in 2023 by dusting off and refurbishing old armor taken from storage.\nAdvertisement\nExperts note that the supply of existing gear is limited and that a key challenge for Russia is to develop capacity to build new fighting vehicles when it runs out of old models to upgrade.\nThe last new hull for the T-80 tank was built decades ago. Instead, Russia has gutted and refurbished hundreds that were made more than 50 years ago. But in the fall, Russian military commanders ordered a renewal of production at Omsktransmash, short for Omsk Transport Engineering Plant, where the T-80 is built.\n'This is the task at hand,' Alexander Potapov, the CEO of Omsktransmash's parent company, tank maker Uralvagonzavod, told the state-run Zvezda news outlet, at the time.\nIn 2019, the plant's engineers told state media that it takes about a month to remodel one tank.\nBut Pavel Aksenov, a military expert and defense correspondent for the BBC's Russian service, said the effort so far had yielded nothing. 'They have not been able to restart this serial manufacturing,' Aksenov said. 'It is a lot easier to boost the rates of existing production.'\nAdvertisement\nIt is similarly unlikely that Russia can supply its army with more modern hardware, like the T-14 Armata tank, which debuted with an array of new fighting vehicles at the 2015 Victory Day parade and infamously got stuck during rehearsals.\nIn early 2023, Russian state media published reports citing unnamed military officials that the Armata had been tested on Ukrainian front lines, prompting speculation it would soon be supplied to units there.\nBut last month, the head of Russia's defense manufacturer, Rostec, Sergei Chemezov, said the Armata will not be deployed in Ukraine because of its high cost.\n'Of course, it is much superior to other tanks in terms of functionality, but it is too expensive,' Chemezov said, according to state media. 'Therefore, the army is unlikely to use it now. It's easier to buy T-90.'\nAdvertisement\nNeither the manufacturer, Uralvagonzavod, nor officials have disclosed the cost of the tank, but in 2011, Russian experts estimated it to be around $7.9 million, compared with about $3.6 million for the T-90S modification.\nAksenov said there is no proof that production of the Armata was ever finalized.\n'They didn't have enough time to nail it down before the war,' he said. 'And although it was logical to begin that level of modernization, because Soviet technology is very outdated, and the invasion showed this, a war requires a different approach.'\n'You need reliable equipment steadily supplied to the front line, one that is well-known to the troops, has no childhood diseases and plenty of spare parts to fix it,' Aksenov continued.\nGjerstad said Russia has sought to offset supplies of advanced Western equipment to Ukraine by prioritizing quantity and allocating better tanks to better trained units while supplying older T-55 and T-62 machines to units composed of conscripts and ex-convicts.\nAdvertisement\n'Would you rather have three Fords or one Cadillac,' Gjerstad said. 'That's been the Russian thinking \u2026 it's been like a crutch for them.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIn Ukraine, drones \u2014 or unmanned aerial vehicles \u2014 are even more vital than tanks.\nTo increase supply, Russia struck a deal with Iran to set up a factory for Shahed drones in Tatarstan, about 500 miles east of Moscow, and has pushed for a major increase in production of Russia's Lancet self-detonating drone, manufactured by a subsidiary of Russian arms giant Kalashnikov Concern.\n'They've been converting old shopping centers into drone production facilities, where they were apparently able to scale up the production quite a bit,' said Fabian Hinz, a drone expert with IISS.\n'Russia doesn't have to become the most innovative army in the world,' Hinz added. 'If they managed to get a few systems that work well, like the Lancet, and then they managed to just brutally force through production, that's already dangerous enough.'\nAdvertisement\nTo circumvent sanctions, Russia has forged new supply chains to obtain Western components for high-tech military equipment, with parts routed through Turkey, China and Kazakhstan, experts said, as the West has struggled with enforcement.\nA recent report by the Kyiv School of Economics concluded: 'Russia continues to be able to acquire large amounts of the inputs that it needs for its military production.' Imports of priority goods are down just 10 percent since sanctions were imposed, the report found.\nRussia also has sought basic raw materials. Officials in the Baltics last month called for banning sales of manganese ore, a key component in steel and alloy production, after Estonian media reported that supplies to Russia had surged \u2014 often via Estonian and Latvian ports.\nRussia has also managed to acquire supplies of nitrocellulose, a compound needed to produce explosives such as artillery shells, according to a report by Ukraine's Center for Defense Strategies, including from Germany, Taiwan and China.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"world","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Mary Ilyushina","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6T5APEJAGX4OC3JPDYHVOYFNTA_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":3.048387,"_id":"81bb64bff0a6012b31600dc170da5967"},{"title":"Unprecedented wave of narco-violence stuns Argentina city, testing president's tough-on-crime agenda","author":"Isabel Debre","published_date":"2024-04-21 05:03:02","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/21/narcotics-gangs-prisons-argentina-rosario/6e17483c-ff9c-11ee-87ac-20f7e67cbe29_story.html","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"A river port city in Argentina was once well-known as the birthplace of soccer superstar Lionel Messi and revolutionary Eduardo 'Che' Guevara","summary":"ROSARIO, Argentina \u2014 The order to kill came from inside a federal prison near Argentina's capital. Unwitting authorities patched a call from drug traffickers tied to one of the country's most notorious gangs to collaborators on the outside. Hiring a 15-year-old hit man, they sealed the fate of a young father they didn't even know.\nAt a service station on March 9 in Rosario, the picturesque hometown of soccer star Lionel Messi, 25-year-old employee Bruno Bussanich was whistling to himself and checking the day's earnings just before he was shot three times from less than a foot away, surveillance footage shows. The assailant fled without taking a peso.\nIt was the fourth gang-related fatal shooting in Rosario in almost as many days. Authorities called it an unprecedented rampage in Argentina, which had never witnessed the extremes of drug cartel violence afflicting some other Latin American countries.\nAdvertisement\nA handwritten letter was found near Bussanich's body, addressed to officials who want to curb the power drug kingpins wield from behind bars. 'We don't want to negotiate anything. We want our rights,' it says. 'We will kill more innocent people.'\nShaken residents interviewed by The Associated Press across Rosario described a sense of dread taking hold.\n'Every time I go to work, I say goodbye to my father as if it were the last time,' said 21-year-old Celeste N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who also works at a gas station.\nThe string of killings offer an early test to the security agenda of populist President Javier Milei, who has tethered his political success to saving Argentina's tanking economy and eradicating narco-trafficking violence.\nSince taking office Dec. 10, the right-wing leader has promised to prosecute gang members as terrorists and change the law to allow the army into crime-ridden streets for the first time since Argentina's brutal military dictatorship ended in 1983.\nAdvertisement\nHis law-and-order message has empowered the hardline governor of Santa Fe province, which includes Rosario, to clamp down on incarcerated criminal gangs that authorities say orchestrated 80% of shootings last year. Under the orders of Governor Maximiliano Pullaro, police have ramped up prison raids, seized thousands of smuggled cellphones and restricted visits.\n'We are facing a group of narco-terrorists desperate to maintain power and impunity,' Milei said after Bussanich was killed, announcing the deployment of federal forces in Rosario. 'We will lock them up, isolate them, take back the streets.'\nMilei won 56% of the vote in Rosario, where residents praise his focus on a problem largely neglected by his predecessors. But some worry the government's combative approach traps them in the line of fire.\nAdvertisement\nGangs started their deadly retaliations just hours after Pullaro's security minister shared photos showing Argentine prisoners crammed together on the floor, heads pressed against each other's bare backs \u2014 a scene reminiscent of El Salvador President Nayib Bukele's harsh anti-gang crackdown.\n'It's a war between the state and the drug traffickers,' said Ezequiel, a 30-year-old employee at the gas station where Bussanich was killed. Ezequiel, who gave only his first name for fear of reprisals, said his mother has since begged him to quit. 'We're the ones paying the price.'\nEven Milei's supporters have mixed feelings about the crackdown, including Germ\u00e1n Bussanich, the father of the slain gas station worker.\n'They're putting on a show and we're facing the consequences,' Bussanich told reporters.\nAdvertisement\nA leafy city 300 kilometers (180 miles) northwest of Buenos Aires, Rosario is where revolutionary Ernesto 'Che' Guevara was born, Messi first kicked a soccer ball and the Argentine flag was first raised in 1812. But it most recently won notoriety because its homicide numbers are five times the national average.\nTucked into a bend in the Paran\u00e1 River, Rosario's port morphed into Argentina's drug trafficking hub as regional crackdowns pushed the narcotics trade south and criminals started squirreling away cocaine in shipping containers spirited down the river to markets abroad. Although Rosario never suffered the car bombs and police assassinations gripping Mexico, Colombia and most recently Ecuador, the splintering of street gangs has fueled bloodshed.\n'It's not close to the violence in Mexico because we still have the deterrence capacity of the government in Argentina,' said Marcelo Bergman, a social scientist at the National University of Tres de Febrero in Argentina. 'But we need to keep an eye on Rosario because the major threats come not so much from big cartels but when these groups proliferate and diversify.'\nAdvertisement\nDrug traffickers keep a tight grip over Rosario's poor neighborhoods full of young men vulnerable to recruitment. One of them was V\u00edctor Emanuel, a 17-year-old killed two years ago by rival gangsters in an area where street murals pay tribute to slain criminal leaders. No one was arrested.\n'My neighbors know who's responsible,' his mother, Ger\u00f3nima Ben\u00edtez, told the AP, her eyes shiny with tears. 'I looked for help everywhere, I knocked on the doors of the judiciary, the government. No one answered.'\nA fearful existence is all Ben\u00edtez has ever known. But now, for the first time in Argentina, warring drug traffickers are banding together and terrorizing parts of the city previously considered safe.\nImprisoned gang leaders in Latin America have long run criminal enterprises remotely with the help of corrupt guards. But according to an indictment unveiled last week, incarcerated gang bosses in Argentina have been passing instructions on how to kill random civilians via family visits and video calls.\nAdvertisement\nCourt documents say the bosses paid underage hit men up to $450 to target four of the recent victims in Argentina's third-largest city. The killing of Bussanich, two taxi drivers and a bus driver in less than a week in March, federal prosecutors say, 'shattered the peace of an entire society.'\nStreet emptied. Schools closed. Bus drivers picketed. People were too terrified to leave their homes.\n'This violence is on another level,' 20-year-old Rodrigo Dominguez said from an intersection where a dangling banner demanded justice for another bus driver slain there weeks earlier. 'You can't go outside.'\nPanic was still palpable in Rosario last week, as police swarmed the streets and normally bustling bars closed early for lack of customers. A diner managed by Messi's family, a draw for fans, reported quiet nights and less profit. Women in one neighborhood said they carry 22\u2010caliber pistols. Anal\u00eda Manso, 37, said she was too scared to send her children to school.\nAdvertisement\nPope Francis last month said he was praying for his countrymen in Rosario.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAssaults and public threats continue. This month, a sign appeared on a highway overpass warning Argentine Security Minister Patricia Bullrich that gangs would extend their offensive to Buenos Aires if the government doesn't back down.\nAuthorities have sought to reassure the public by sending hundreds of federal agents into Rosario. The AP spent a night with police last week as officers patrolled neighborhoods logging suspicious activity and setting up checkpoints.\nGeorgina Wilke, a 45-year-old Rosario officer in the explosives squad, said she welcomes federal intervention, including the military, to get crime under control. 'We've been hit very hard,' Wilke said.\nOmar Pereira, the provincial secretary of public security, promised the efforts represent a shift from failed tactics of the past.\nAdvertisement\n'There were always pacts, implicit or explicit, between the state and criminals,' Pereira said, describing how authorities long looked the other way. 'What's the idea of this government? There is no pact.'\nBut experts are skeptical a tough-on-crime approach will stop drug traffickers from buying control over Argentina's police and prisons.\n'Unless the government fixes its problems with corruption, the crackdown on prisons is unlikely to have any long-term effect,' said Christopher Newton, an investigator at Colombia-based research organization InSight Crime.\nFor years, Rosario's 1.3 million residents have watched warily as presidents and their promises come and go while the violence endures.\n'It's like a cancer that grows and grows,' said Ben\u00edtez from her home, its windows protected by wrought-iron bars.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Almudena Calatrava,Isabel Debre","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NS76PUX7TQI65B5MED36M7F6FE.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":3.048387,"_id":"7dd0c4dfb9909bfe46bc8af838305e58"},{"title":"The South has few unionized auto plants.

But he remembers reading good things about unions fighting for the eight-hour work day and against child labor.\nThat's why Collins plans to vote yes when employees at his Volkswagen factory decide this week whether to join the United Auto Workers. And he thinks many of his co-workers will do the same \u2014 possibly making their factory one of the few auto plants in the South to unionize.\nAdvertisement\nOf 26 Volkswagen workers who stopped to talk to a Washington Post reporter outside the factory gates this month, more than two-thirds said they planned to vote yes in the historic ballot that will test the UAW's strategy of organizing a dozen automakers' southern factories.

A yes vote, even in red Tennessee, could help shore up Biden's support among union voters across the United States, including those still dubious about the improved economy. Biden's staunch support of union workers has earned him the UAW's endorsement and assistance on the campaign trail from its fiery president, Shawn Fain.\nTennessee Republicans have seized on that relationship in their efforts to thwart the unionization drive. In an impromptu news conference next to the factory this month, local Republicans warned that workers in this right-leaning county would be aligning themselves with the Democrats by voting yes.\n'I hope that the Tennessee workers will recognize that the UAW represents the party of President Joe Biden, and their values and political contributions, which are completely inconsistent with the people of southeast Tennessee,' state Sen. Bo Watson told attendees.\nAdvertisement\nThe conservative editorial page of the Chattanooga Times Free Press has carried similar messages, as has a mysterious website that workers say appeared recently, stillnouaw.com, which features photos of Biden and Fain and a social media post from former president Donald Trump attacking the UAW president. During a visit to Chattanooga last week, Republican Gov. Bill Lee cautioned that joining the union would be 'a big mistake.'\nSome conservative VW workers say they wish politicians would butt out.\n'I really don't appreciate what our local leaders have said about the UAW. I think they should have stayed out of it,' Ethan Triplett, a VW worker who votes Republican, said as he arrived for his shift. 'I've seen what the UAW can do for all the plants up north and everything. \u2026 And I feel like they can do some good down here.'\nTriplett and others said their main complaints include the factory's inflexible sick-day policies and its tendency to haul in workers for compulsory overtime shifts on Saturdays. They also want better retirement and health-care benefits.\nThe election stakes are high for the UAW and its new president. The union scored big contract wins after striking against Ford, General Motors and Stellantis last year, but union membership has fallen precipitously in recent decades and continued to drop by 3.3 percent last year, to 370,000 workers. A team of UAW staffers has decamped to Chattanooga to help run the election drive, working on laptops at the union hall of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), where the UAW is renting space.\nAlthough this would be the UAW's first foray in the South at a foreign auto plant, both GM and Ford have UAW factories in Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas. Those had an easier path to unionization through procedures included in the automakers' national agreements with the union.\nVW says it is remaining neutral on the unionization effort. The union has disputed that, accusing the company of destroying union materials in a factory break room and other union-busting behavior. The company refutes the allegations, saying it is standard VW procedure to clear break rooms of all stray materials every day.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe factory is VW's only plant worldwide that isn't represented by a union or a similar body that advocates for workers. 'We respect our employees' right to decide who represents them in the workplace and have throughout this process,' Volkswagen said in a statement about the Chattanooga vote, adding that it is proud of the working conditions and pay it offers.\nThe average production worker in Chattanooga will earn more than $60,000 this year before overtime and bonuses, with hourly wages ranging from $23.40 to $32.40, the company said. Skilled team leaders earn up to $42.25 an hour. Since 2009, VW has invested more than $4.3 billion in the factory, making it one of the biggest employers in this picturesque city on the Tennessee River, in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.\nCharles Wood, head of the local chamber of commerce, said he worries that unionization could cause VW to shift more investment to its factory in Puebla, Mexico. That plant is unionized, but its workers earn less, making it a cheaper place to produce.\n'The risk for Chattanooga is we become less competitive long-term,' he said, adding that VW has played a huge role in helping the region recover from factory closures and tough economic times that started in the 1960s.\nAdvertisement\nSarah Roberts, who works in the factory's logistics department, said she plans to vote no, because she developed negative views of unions while growing up in Michigan. Her father, an automotive engineer, worked stints in various auto factories, trying to improve their manufacturing processes, she said. 'Out of all the plants he's been in, every one that has been under the UAW for more than 10 years is now shut down,' she said.\nAmong some conservative workers, the UAW's endorsement of Biden is not helping the union's case.\nMembers of a worker committee helping organize the drive say some workers have bashed the Biden endorsement. Kelcey Smith, one of dozens on the committee, said he heard a colleague tell a union meeting a few months ago that some people on the factory floor were upset about it.\n'He believed that it was having an effect on some of the minds of some of the workers as far as voting for the union was concerned,' Smith said in an interview. UAW staffers at the meeting advised workers to reassure colleagues that they can vote for whomever they like.\nMost workers who spoke with The Post said they are focusing more on workplace issues than politics.\nThe union 'can support whoever they want,' said Krantzsy Boursiquot, a worker who described himself as apolitical and a nonvoter. Like others, he is most concerned about mandatory overtime on Saturdays, which the company sometimes calls with only two days' notice, and managers' refusal at times to approve sick days.\n'I feel like, as they're pushing for excellence every year, coming up with a new model every year, trying to increase profits for their shareholders, they should have that same energy when it comes down to their employees. And they don't,' Boursiquot said.\nVolkswagen spokesman Michael Lowder said the company has several channels for employee feedback and takes worker input seriously.\nGathering on a recent evening at the IBEW union hall, workers on the unionization organizing committee said they are pushing for stronger benefits.\nAdvertisement\nYolanda Peoples, who used to belong to the UAW when she worked at a now closed General Motors factory in Doraville, Ga., says she wants better health-care coverage that will reduce her out-of-pocket costs for medication. She would also like a defined-benefit pension instead of the 401(k) that VW provides.\n'The 401(k) is based on the stock market \u2026 and whether it's up or down,' she said. 'I want more stability.'\nVW contributes 4 percent of an employee's pay to the 401(k) if the worker contributes 5 percent, VW spokesman Lowder said. The company also contributes 5 percent of each employee's paycheck to a separate defined contribution plan, with no employee contribution required, he said.\nRobert Soderstrom, who builds car doors, hopes a union can help protect workers from having to do the jobs of two people when someone calls in sick. 'Oftentimes we won't have a full crew,' he said. 'If we're a man short, they'll be like, well, Robert, today you're working two [jobs] \u2026 they're not slowing the line down.'\nOutside the factory gates, Justin DeLong stopped briefly to voice his support for the UAW, saying that many of his relatives in Upstate New York are union workers.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jeanne Whalen","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NY2NZ6DP2K2JAY3JMGER3VDHO4_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":2.9759467,"_id":"44ea004fc87818e8cee117be7f6781f2"},{"title":"Trump on Jewish voters, calls for Gaza cease-fire: Post readers react","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-17 20:52:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/17/climate-change-trump-gaza-readers-react","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Post readers respond to articles on climate change, Trump's comments on Jewish voters and calls for a cease-fire in Gaza.","summary":"Regarding the April 10 news article 'European court rules Switzerland climate inaction violated human rights':\nEvery year, 218 million people are affected by climate-related disasters, resulting in at least 70,000 deaths. Despite this, our preparations remain inadequate.\nClimate change not only causes natural disasters but also creates global health emergencies. Wildfires burn in California, and Canada faces a high risk. Other disasters around the world this year have already claimed hundreds of lives. Why are we still unprepared?\nThe World Health Organization director general authored a new official report, titled 'Climate Change and Health.' This report acknowledges climate change as a critical health issue and proposes a structured approach to address it. As young physicians and global health researchers, we urge governments to prioritize health in their climate policies, enhance data collection and monitoring, and standardize protocols for capacity building.\nAdvertisement\nThe pandemic exposed gaps in our emergency response capacity. We call upon the governments to strengthen health-care capacity, preparing the health-care systems to act as pillars of sustainability in the face of climate change. The time to prepare is now.\nShreenik Kundu and Ayla Gerk , Montreal\nShreenik Kundu and Ayla Gerk, Montreal\nThe writers are PhD students at McGill University with fellowship studies at the Program in Global Surgery and Social Change at Harvard Medical School.\nThe writers are PhD students at McGill University with fellowship studies at the Program in Global Surgery and Social Change at Harvard Medical School.\nAt the most fundamental level, the world's struggle to make progress combating climate change is a product of humankind's most tragic flaw: We are incapable of protecting ourselves from ourselves. In the same vein, we might be unable to exhibit the required understanding, cooperativeness and selflessness needed to overcome the effects of climate change.\nSince the discovery of climate change a half-century ago, the world's reaction has been appalling. The response from those in the best position to do something about it, such as world political leaders and the barons of industry, has ranged from inadequate to nonexistent. For far too long, it seems the prospect of the end of humanity has paled in significance when compared with the continuation of the status quo, with its profits and comforts. The urgency of the situation is finally taking hold, but is it happening too late? Precious time has been wasted.\nAdvertisement\nPerhaps the world's best hope for survival would be the use of cutting-edge science and technology to, for example, remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. The nature of the process would be analogous to the extraction of salt from the ocean, but immensely more complex. A major advantage of such a solution is that it would be less affected by the proclivities of human behavior. Even in an advanced country such as the United States, a significant number of people still believe the whole thing is a 'hoax,' and business as usual still reigns. It really does feel like, once again, we can't help ourselves \u2014 but this time, the consequences could be fatal for the entire human species.\nHarry Flickinger , Gaithersburg\nHarry Flickinger, Gaithersburg\nRegarding the April 10 article 'U.N. climate chief presses for faster action, says humans have 2 years left \u2018to save the world'':\nAdvertisement\nWhile the thought of 'two years left' seems depressingly pessimistic to me as a college student, it's important that we don't lose faith and focus on solutions. Although this article is more concerned with carbon emissions on a global scale, it is crucial that we look inward at our own domestic responsibility in reducing our emissions. The United States has yet to pass legislation for large-scale emissions reductions, such as a carbon fee to encourage polluters to turn to more renewable energy and a dividend distributed to every citizen to cushion the result of the fee.\nWhile Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University, worries this two-year warning will be ignored, it is my hope that it can be a call to action. While issues of climate change seem overwhelming to many citizens, our nation is based on the power of the ballot to prioritize the greatest threats to our future. November is coming.\nCourtney Hand , Williamsburg, Va.\nCourtney Hand, Williamsburg, Va.\nWhat Donald Trump doesn't understand about Jewish voters\nRegarding Philip Bump's April 10 analysis, 'Browbeating Jewish voters hasn't yet worked for Trump':\nAdvertisement\nDonald Trump's statement that Jews who don't vote Republican don't love Israel is a waste of breath. I am a Jew, and I love Israel. It's Benjamin Netanyahu whom I don't like or trust. There is mounting evidence that the Israeli prime minister is holding on to power for the same reason Mr. Trump wants to return to power: to keep out of the courtroom. The last time I voted for a Republican was in November 1990. But if you're wondering, I'm not voting for any current Republican, and I still love Israel.\nRobert Bronstein , New York\nRobert Bronstein, New York\nDonald Trump might be surprised to learn that Jewish voters, even those of us who are strong supporters of Israel, have strong feelings about other priorities as well. We care about education, the economy, women's health care, gun safety, foreign affairs, the environment, crime and, yes, even immigration. We are very aware that if Mr. Trump wins and the Republicans take the House and Senate, we will likely lose any progress we have made on these issues.\nAdvertisement\nHow do we know this? Mr. Trump has developed a track record since his surprising win in 2016. His overriding concern, as he seeks the presidency for the third time, seems to be avoiding convictions in his many criminal cases and, if he wins, destroying his enemies. We have a long history of democracy and freedom in this country. When countries lose that, it never works well for the Jewish people. There's a track record for that, too.\nElliott Miller , Bala Cynwyd, Pa.\nElliott Miller, Bala Cynwyd, Pa.\nThe problem with an immediate cease-fire\nRegarding the April 9 op-ed by Jordanian King Abdullah II, French President Emmanuel Macron and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, 'Three nations, one message: A permanent Gaza cease-fire now':\nBefore Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel sought a two-state solution. Under the Oslo accords, Israel wanted a two-state solution. Former U.S. ambassador Dennis Ross recounted in his book 'The Missing Peace: The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace' the proposed solution in 2000 that would have given the Palestinian Authority 95 percent of what they wanted. Then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak agreed, but Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestinian Authority, walked away. The current leader of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, does not want to live in peace with Israel, and Hamas wants to destroy Israel.\nAdvertisement\nThe proposed cease-fire will not be permanent until both sides respect each other's right to exist. Israel is threatened with hostile neighbors and acts accordingly. Are the authors of this op-ed willing to commit troops and resources to ensure that Israel is secure? With a secure Israel, a rational prime minister could be elected to build a two-state solution. What commitments will the authors and the United Nations make to provide effective, peace-loving government(s) for the Palestinians?\nRobert Finkelstein , Reston, Va.\nRobert Finkelstein, Reston, Va.\nJordanian King Abdullah II, French President Emmanuel Macron and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi have observed that 'Protecting civilians is a fundamental legal obligation for all parties and 'the cornerstone' of international humanitarian law. Violating this obligation is absolutely prohibited.' With all due respect, this statement is both inaccurate and misleading.\nAdvertisement\nYes, the protection of 'noncombatants' is a fundamental principle of the Law of Armed Conflict. However, it is not the cornerstone. Historically, the LOAC has recognized that civilian deaths and the destruction of civilian property will often occur in the course of armed conflict. The principal purpose of the LOAC has thus been to mitigate, not eliminate, this loss of civilian life and property by regulating the means and methods by which conflict might be lawfully conducted. Accordingly, a commander must refrain from an attack in which the anticipated incidental civilian harm would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained.\nThus, while the protection of civilians is indeed a fundamental consideration in conducting a military operation, this factor does not take priority over mission accomplishment. A warfighter, in developing an operation plan, cannot do so on the basis that, legally, his primary concern must not be the military necessity of accomplishing his mission, but rather the protection of the enemy's civilian population. To contend that this is the case would be to turn the LOAC on its head.\nDavid E. Graham , Charlottesville\nDavid E. Graham, Charlottesville\nAdvertisement\nThe leaders of Egypt, France and Jordan all support an immediate cease-fire, which is counterintuitive to the universally supported right of Israel to defend itself. Hamas publicly claims its members will repeat the Oct. 7 attack until Israel no longer exists.\nThe call for releasing hostages is laudable. However, bear in mind that Hamas wishes to exchange the people they kidnapped for criminals and murderers held in Israel's prisons. Will released prisoners carry out another Oct. 7?","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/746PTWHV2MI65BVW5LI4V2ILFE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":2.9690084,"_id":"84ba4ce69c7f5d5aa8e497ad7554f79b"},{"title":"Octopuses aren't meant to be pets","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-18 19:30:03","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/18/octopus-pets-smartphones-bicycling-books-baseball","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Plus, Post readers on smartphones, bike lanes, access to books and baseball","summary":"Regarding the April 14 news article 'Their son wanted an octopus. They ended up with 50 more.':\nThe story of the Oklahoma family that yielded and finally conceded to their child's irrational need to own a pet octopus only to learn later 'he' was a 'she' and also pregnant with 50 eggs triggered me in so many ways. Removing and selling octopuses for profit is an irresponsible act rather than a lifelong lesson taught.\nInstead, why not embrace and encourage their son's passion for marine science in a more sustainable manner? I realize they live in a landlocked state \u2014 and I'm not sure where the closest aquarium is \u2014 but maybe do some research and visit one as frequently as feasible? See whether they have a volunteer program and enroll your child? I'm sure there's an app where you can raise and nurture your own digital octopod.\nAdvertisement\nThere were so many lessons that could have been taught here instead of capitulating to your kid and worrying that you'd be 'the worst father' if you didn't indulge him. Teaching that it's cruel and inhumane to trap a wild animal (or any living being for that matter) in a tank for your enjoyment could have been a lesson to respect the world around you.\nOr flip the script on him with something along the lines of 'How would you like being in a glass tank if a space alien came down to earth and scooped you up and stuck you in a tank to be their pet?'\nMaybe if such lessons were taught early in life, we'd live in a much different world.\nRobert Pousman , Healdsburg, Calif.\nRobert Pousman, Healdsburg, Calif.\nIt was distressing to read the uncritical account of a boy's whimsy leading one of the ocean's most fascinating sentient creatures to be trapped in a tank in his bedroom, giving birth to two dozen surviving octopuses that were then relegated to individual plastic containers before being held captive in their own communal tank. Anyone who has seen the amazing Oscar-winning documentary 'My Octopus Teacher' would wonder why indulging the child's enthusiasm would be worth so abusing a magnificent wild creature. Surely this boy, like the Monterey Bay Aquarium official who was quoted, could better learn about octopus life by watching videos.\nAdvertisement\nAnd what a contrast to an article on the same day \u2014 'A silent killer stalks sea turtles. A small town is trying to stop it.' \u2014 about a Venezuelan community's valiant effort to save endangered turtles in their native habitat.\nLaura Ingersoll , Washington\nLaura Ingersoll, Washington\nPerhaps smart(phone) advice\nI could not agree more with George F. Will's April 7 op-ed 'Want smart kids? Ban smartphones in schools.' The contrast between today's experience of childhood and adolescence and mine in the 1970s is striking.\nLike all reminiscences, mine is surely somewhat predisposed to positive experiences, but I do clearly remember playing outdoors as much as I was allowed, which included near-constant, in-person interaction with peers and some adults. This necessitated developing some basic social skills, sometimes the hard way, as well as engaging in copious amounts of physical activity, from which one occasionally hurt themselves. We were not 'bubble-wrapped.' From these experiences, one learned to handle oneself.\nAdvertisement\nWhen I walk around my neighborhood, the streets are deserted of children and adults, with dog-walkers the lone exception. Though I rarely go inside schools now, I often see schoolchildren waiting at bus stops in the morning. Every one of them is studying their phones while ignoring their nearby counterparts. I know that at the bus stops of my youth, we talked with one another. Did we discuss issues of great import? Probably never. But we were developing our ability to converse live with individuals with different personalities and from different backgrounds.\nMr. Will and author Jonathan Haidt are correct when they suggest that the ubiquity of smartphones and limitless access to the internet have curtailed the development of adolescents mentally, and I would go them one further and suggest that there has also been a corresponding impact on physical fitness, as evidenced by the pervasiveness of childhood obesity.\nDaniel W. Keiper , Falls Church\nDaniel W. Keiper, Falls Church\nA dangerous D.C. decision\nRegarding the April 13 Metro article 'District hits brakes on divisive bike route':\nAdvertisement\nThe decision by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and the D.C. Council to cancel the proposed bike lanes on Connecticut Avenue NW is disheartening and dangerous.\nFew drivers obey the 25-mph speed limit north of the bridge over Rock Creek. For their own safety, riders of bikes and scooters use the sidewalks, many of which are narrow.\nFor a frequent pedestrian from the bridge north through Woodley Park, Cleveland Park and near Chevy Chase Circle, this decision is terrifying. Pedestrians cannot hear bikes or scooters, and their riders weave among older residents and families on their way to the National Zoo and perhaps to some of the businesses that influenced this shortsighted choice.\nFor safety's sake, I hope the council will restore plans for the bike lanes we were promised.\nJody Beck , Washington\nJody Beck, Washington\n\u2018The capability to uplift people'\nRegarding Reginald Dwayne Betts's April 16 op-ed, 'I was a teen in Virginia prison. Books were my lifeline.'\nAdvertisement\nThough I commend Mr. Betts's portrayal of the transformative power of literature amid incarceration, it's vital to address the systemic issues within the prison system. He rightly emphasizes the resilience literature can instill, yet we must confront the broader issues of limited access to education and rehabilitation programs, disproportionately harsh sentencing and inadequate support for reintegration into society.\nWhile literature offers peace, many individuals in prison lack access to reading materials, exacerbating feelings of isolation.\nAs an avid reader, I found the author's narrative to be powerful and thoughtful. While I have not experienced the challenges of being imprisoned, I feel like I can connect to the belief that literature holds the capability to uplift people, regardless of their situation. We live in a world where access to knowledge is taken advantage of, more people are seen with a phone in their hand than a book. Reading is not just a source of intellectual enrichment but also a means of self-discovery.\nAdvertisement\nMr. Betts's narrative underscores the importance of diverse perspectives in the discourse on criminal justice reform.\nIsabella Heilbronn , Boston\nIsabella Heilbronn, Boston\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nHere's the pitch\nI hope every Nationals pitcher quoted in The Post's April 13 Sports article 'Seeing the game through pitchers' eyes,' which was about where pitchers focus their gaze before throwing specific pitches, is outright lying. Please tell me this is a clever disinformation campaign. Otherwise, they might as well announce their pitches to the batter. I understand that two requirements for landing a spot in Major League Baseball are (1) excellent vision and (2) the ability to remember an incredible amount of detail, especially about pitchers. Any sharp-eyed batter who has had the benefit of reading this article is going to be one huge step closer to 'guessing' what's coming.\nAdvertisement\nThomas M. Sneeringer , Washington\nThomas M. Sneeringer, Washington\nTroubled bridges over water\nRegarding the April 11 Metro article, 'Inside the massive three-step cleanup of Baltimore's Key Bridge':\nThe eyes of the world have been focused on the collapse of the Key Bridge, sealing off Baltimore's harbor. Among those eyes are people who bear the United States ill will and who could find the disaster a cost-effective way to harm our economy. Worse, one of our strategic military triad lies vulnerable.\nMost of our East Coast harbors have entrances from the Atlantic Ocean spanned by huge bridges. For instance, New York's harbor has the Verrazzano and the Bayonne bridges rising over the front and back entrances. More ominous for our security is Submarine Base New London on the Thames River in Groton, Conn. There, twin truss bridges and the Amtrak lift bridge, if dropped, would seal those subs in port at the 22-slip base just as are the eight unlucky freighters now trapped in Baltimore. The United States has only about 70 submarines worldwide, so a few out of service would present a significant loss.\nAdvertisement\nAt a cost only a tiny fraction of the loss in productivity and security, excavation should begin immediately to deepen the shipping channels under all such bridges by an additional 50 feet or more. The Baltimore entrapment results from what is probably 10 to 20 feet of rubble raising the channel clearance from 50 to perhaps 30 feet. With the additional 50-foot depth, the ruins of a fallen bridge would lie below the 48-foot draft of supermax container ships and our submarines. Bridge abutments could be strengthened as needed by the deepening. The bridge wreckage could then be removed piece-by-piece between vessel transits.\nLet us hope this unlikely concern does not remind us of our Sept. 10, 2001, conviction that planes would always stay away from tall buildings.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6QJE6FNRG5GONAU4YBZYGS6URI.jpeg&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":2.9690084,"_id":"b9dfaa60f170a4a3ef6b9fcc964cb9fe"},{"title":"Tradwives and misogynists, a match made in 2024","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-16 19:50:41","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/16/tradwives-nick-adams-dc-taxes-bowser-budget","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Plus, higher taxes for D.C. residents, saving the Circulator bus and preserving young pitchers' arms.","summary":"It was with wonder and great interest that I read Monica Hesse's April 11 Style column, 'Tradwives, stay-at-home girlfriends and \u2018a thing called ease.'' As the president of a college for women, I found myself wondering why so many people are entranced by the spectacle of young women making a highly questionable choice \u2014 though it's absolutely their choice to make \u2014 instead of lifting up the many women who are, in fact, striving to change their lives by getting an education and tackling the travails of the world.\nThe only mentions of higher education came in an anecdote about a teenage girl who would rather husband-hunt than go to college and Ms. Hesse's obligatory dig about the cost of tuition: 'If college weren't so ghastly expensive here, maybe that one lady's daughter wouldn't be so keen on the patriarchy as a route to leisure that bypasses the long, uphill road to financial independence.' But there is no better road to intellectual freedom and ease of life than education.\nU.S. women's colleges know and address this every day. We serve young women who are eager to lead despite messages that they lack the value or the resources to be successful. More than 93 percent of our students receive financial aid to go to college, and many women's colleges serve the most financially vulnerable young people in the nation. Yet we endeavor to equip young women to pursue their educational ambitions in support of a more just world.\nAdvertisement\nTo be clear: I don't object to the suggestion that what many young women \u2014 or really, all people \u2014 want today is more leisure or a sense of ease. I and my students would like a nap, too. What keeps us awake? A deep sense of purpose. We recognize that the same world that prevents 'ease' needs us to change it; that the miseries women face in the world will not go away while we rest. We know we have a purpose in this world and that this purpose is to fashion a better experience for us all. Women don't have to compromise their own sense of self to achieve that.\nMary Dana Hinton , Roanoke\nMary Dana Hinton, Roanoke\nThe writer is president of Hollins University.\nThe writer is president of Hollins University.\nWas it intentional irony that the April 11 Style section paired 'Nick Adams wants you to man up,' a profile of the misogynistic provocateur, with Monica Hesse's column on the appeal and pitfalls of the tradwife lifestyle?

How ironic and insulting that while women are the ones under policy assaults such as the resurrection of Arizona's ancient ban on abortion, The Post chose to devote space to another con man tapping into anger.\nNaomi Salus , Washington\nNaomi Salus, Washington\nSlow down those pitches\nAs a longtime baseball observer and fan, I read Chelsea Janes's April 11 Sports analysis, 'No easy fix after rash of injuries to pitchers,' with interest.\nWith the increasing emphasis on pitch velocity, spin rates and other measures of force, Major League Baseball teams are effectively 'killing their young.' Potentially great pitching careers are being sacrificed at the altar of money as pitchers try to master throws such as the sweeper.\nAdvertisement\nAs a result, professional baseball risks becoming a niche sport like thoroughbred racing, in which horses are driven to the point of exhaustion and ghastly injury for the entertainment of gamblers, with whom Major League Baseball and other professional sports leagues have aligned themselves.

The fragile balance between the competing golf tours might be sustainable. But when it comes to the environment, golf is anything but.\nAcres of land are cleared of forests or fields to be turned into grassy lawns that are ecological dead zones. Swaths of fairways and greens sequester little carbon and fail to support the food chain or pollinators. Courses require massive quantities of water, competing with people and agriculture for scarce resources even in the most drought-prone parts of the world. Polluting and toxic weed killers and chemical fertilizers flow into groundwater and streams, endangering wildlife and people. The carbon footprint for manicuring golf courses with armies of gas-powered equipment is huge.\nAdvertisement\nGolfers say they enjoy 'being in nature,' but that's like comparing a water park wave pool to the ocean.

It provides an invaluable service to tourists and residents alike who want to get around the National Mall at a reasonable price or to Georgetown conveniently from Union Station.\nDon't shut down routes, raise prices or eliminate the Circulator altogether. Just advertise it more. So many residents are unaware of its routes or their convenience. Get fliers out to all the hotels that tourists frequent. Get information to the public in general. People love a bargain, and at $1 per ride, the Circulator is the best bargain in D.C.\nAdvertisement\nKathleen Wood , Washington\nKathleen Wood, Washington\nTax rich D.C. residents like me\nTaxes support thriving communities where people want to live. They fund quality schools and reliable public transportation, in addition to providing food and shelter for people who have hit hard times. Right now, D.C. faces major budget pressures that jeopardize these vital programs and services. But lawmakers can meet this moment by raising taxes on wealthy people, including me.\nI came to the city more than a decade ago as a student at George Washington University (Raise High!) and fell in love with D.C. I enjoy a car-free life with convenient access to friends, stores and cultural activities. D.C. Minyan provides a robust Jewish community. Playing softball on the National Mall never gets old. I can't imagine living anywhere else. But as a frequent cheerleader for D.C., I have never even considered discussing my relatively low tax burden as a draw to encourage friends and family to move here.\nAdvertisement\nMy financial situation is not out of the ordinary for White residents of D.C. An Urban Institute study found that as of 2016, White households in D.C. had a net worth 81 times greater than that of Black households and 22 times that of Latinx households.\nOur tax system does little to correct the historic injustices that have contributed to this wealth inequality. Instead, tax preferences and loopholes protect and further concentrate wealth.\nFor example, D.C.'s property tax system uses a single rate for residences, meaning I pay the same property tax rate as someone who owns a small studio far away from public transit and other amenities.\nAnd Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) has now proposed an increase to the sales tax, which takes a larger percentage of income from low- and middle-income earners than high-income earners. Combined with Ms. Bowser's proposal to halt the planned increase to D.C.'s earned-income tax credit, which helps people with low incomes keep more of what they earn, this would raise the effective tax rate on D.C. residents with the lowest incomes relative to the current baseline.\nAdvertisement\nRaise taxes on me and other wealthy residents instead. I say this with confidence that the marginally higher taxes I would pay would not materially affect my quality of life.\nBut the investments the District could make in public services with a little more of my tax money would be life-changing for others. By taxing D.C.'s concentrated wealth, the D.C. Council can ensure that child-care workers are paid fairly, rental assistance programs are fully funded and transformative initiatives such as the earned-income tax credit aren't gutted. I can afford to pay more in taxes so everyone can have their basic needs met.\nWe all agree D.C. faces major budget pressures and needs more revenue, so let's find a way to raise it. Why not increase the tax rate on capital gains \u2014 profits from selling assets such as stocks that overwhelmingly flow to the top 1 percent? And why not increase taxes on homes valued at more than $1.5 million, instead of taxing them at the same rate as lower-value homes?\nAdvertisement\nBefore being disrupted by business lobbyists, D.C.'s Tax Revision Commission laid out other proposals to raise revenue that, unlike the mayor's proposals, wouldn't put the burden on D.C. residents who are already struggling. We all contribute to the strength of D.C.'s economy, but only a few households see the most benefits. The D.C. Council should make the wealthy pay more, so D.C. can be a place where everyone can share in the growth and enjoy a good life.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S4SVBYGJTWVJDIOAIUVRU2SIEM.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":2.966365,"_id":"06f6deff9a0c327190297aac6cbaa114"},{"title":"Taylor Swift's new album leaked, but it was only half the story","author":"Samantha Chery","published_date":"2024-04-19 21:31:02","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2024/04/19/taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-album-leak","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"The day before Taylor Swift's released 'The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology,' 17 of its songs were scattered across the internet.","summary":"The frenzy surrounding Taylor Swift's new album 'The Tortured Poets Department' kicked off a day early, as the singer became one of the most recent victims of a song leak.\nWhat was purported to be the entire album spread online Thursday, origin unknown. Some fans spent the day refusing to listen to the 17 illicit tracks. Others were fooled by artificial intelligence-generated fakes, or frustrated by social media sites that seemed to delete leaked tracks as soon as they were posted.\nCountless others found and devoured the runaway songs. Premature reviews and amateur analyses of the album flooded fan sites despite pleas from devoted Swifties to wait for the official release.\nMaybe they should have. Swift dropped 'Tortured Poets' as planned at midnight, which confirmed that the leaked tracks were indeed real. But two hours later, she made the surprise announcement that it was actually a double album and released another 15 tracks. The leak was barely half the album.\nAdvertisement\nWas this a win or loss for Swift? It's hard to say. It was at least the fourth leak of her music in a decade, despite her efforts to quash the phenomenon. But a leak today might mean something very different than it did before the advent of the streaming age.\ndespite her efforts to quash the phenomenon. But a leak today might mean something very different than it did before the advent of the streaming age.\n'We're living in the attention economy now,' said Ted Cohen, an adviser for streaming platforms. 'At the end of the day, it increases awareness.'\nCohen recalled a famous industry quote: 'If your artist isn't being pirated, your artist isn't popular.' Some managers in the early 2000s 'literally would use tracking of music piracy to correlate fan interest in an artist,' he recalled.\nTaylor Swift's new, double album, 'The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology,' dropped on April 19. It includes 31 new songs about love, loss, griefand more. (Video: Allie Caren, Sarah Hashemi, Emily Yahr/The Washington Post)\nLabels sometimes intentionally leaked music to invite public controversy, he added. But leaks don't carry quite the same allure anymore now that listeners overwhelming stream music rather than buy albums .\n.\nAdvertisement\nDigital leaks have been around since the \u201890s, when software evolved to a point where songs could be easily uploaded. In 1993, Depeche Mode's new CD 'Songs of Faith and Devotion' leaked in online chatrooms, via audio files that took about 30 minutes each to download through a dial-up connection, Pitchfork reported. In 2002, Eminem's critically acclaimed 'The Eminem Show' leaked weeks early and ended up on bootleg CDs.\nuploaded.

And if they can get it, and they can get it for free because it's been leaked, that's something attractive to a rabid fan,' said Ali Aydar, who worked as a senior director of technology at Napster from 1999 to 2002 \u2014 the year the popular file-sharing company filed for bankruptcy amid a flood of copyright infringement lawsuits. Aydar said the first lawsuit was filed by Metallica, after the band discovered one of their demos had hit radio stations after being leaked to Napster.\nSkip to end of carousel\nThe Style section\nThe Style section Style is where The Washington Post covers happenings on the front lines of culture and what it all means, including the arts, media, social trends, politics and yes, fashion, all told with personality and deep reporting.

In 2020, Dua Lipa moved the release date of her album 'Future Nostalgia' up by one week after some of her songs leaked early online. 'Songs that were never meant to come out get leaked,' she said in an interview years later.

You work with your team. It's a whole creative thought process, so everything is literally flushed down the toilet,' she said. 'To go and leak someone's hard work \u2026 is always devastating.'\nSwift has also experienced her fair share of song leaks over the years. She said in a 2010 Rolling Stone interview that she cried after learning 'Mine,' a track from her third studio album 'Speak Now,' was leaked 12 days early. Her team decided to rush the song to iTunes.\n'Every day that the album doesn't leak is a victory,' the president of Big Machine Label Group told Billboard in 2012, as the label prepared to released Swift's fourth album, 'Red.' It leaked days ahead of its release date.\nSo did her fifth album, '1989,' in 2014. And albums six ('Reputation') and seven ('Lover') spilled, too, mere hours before their official drops.\nAdvertisement\nSwift has clamped down on plays of her prereleased music over the years. Dancers in her 'End Game' music video had to perform choreography to 'click tracks' in lieu of the actual music, she revealed in a behind-the-scenes video.\n'I remember when I did a song with her for her album, I was in San Francisco and they sent someone with a locked briefcase with an iPad and one song on it,' Ed Sheeran told Brazilian media outlet Capricho in 2017. 'They asked if I like it and I was like \u2018Yeah' and then they took it back.'\nSwift has important allies in her war against leaks: a significant portion of her fan base not only refuses to listen to them, but they also police the internet and implore others to do the same.\n'It was the first time I've ever had an album leak without it trending on Twitter \u2014 because my fans protected it.' Swift told NPR after the '1989' leak in 2014. 'Anytime they'd see an illegal post of it, they'd comment, \u2018Why are you doing this? Why don't you respect the value of art? Don't do this.''\nAdvertisement\n'Taylor's fans are very protective of her vision,' said Georgia Carroll, a fan studies researcher who wrote her PhD thesis on Swift's fandom. 'The narrative becomes \u2018real fans wouldn't listen to leaks' and \u2018real fans will support Taylor and wait until it's actually out,' with critiques and attacks on those who do admit to listening.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nSome Swift-related Reddit pages limited discussions of leaked tracks and moderators threatened to ban users who attempt to share the files. On X, the search phrase 'taylor swift leak' turned up without results \u2014 most likely because the site blocked the phrase.\nThe 'Tortured Poets' leak was also novel for colliding with the new phenomenon of AI-generated audio. As news of the leak spread Thursday, many would-be pirates were tricked into downloading what sounded like machine-generated tracks posing as Swift songs.\nThat might have cut back on the number of downloads for the actual leak, but it also created some comparisons between the AI tracks and the real music.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Samantha Chery,Herb Scribner,Pranshu Verma","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G44TNKXALCNAITYNVJ4NYRJIMQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":2.966365,"_id":"d4e2dfe34cad96a7ca7f54d1f4bd37fa"},{"title":"How Trump has become angrier and more isolated on Truth Social","author":"Derek Hawkins","published_date":"2024-04-22 09:00:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2024/trump-truth-social-posts","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Here on his company's social network Trump is offering followers an intimate view of what his second term could look like: isolated, vitriolic and vengeful.","summary":"One of the worst Senators in the United States Senate is, without question, Bill Cassidy, A TOTAL FLAKE, Republican though he may be.

But on Biden's recent Pennsylvania trip, he faced chants of 'Genocide Joe' and 'You're fired.'","summary":"As President Biden visited his childhood home in Scranton, Pa., last week, pro-Palestinian protesters gathered nearby chanting, 'Genocide Joe has got to go!' That night, at his hotel, a group of similarly minded demonstrators banged drums, played loud music and used a loudspeaker until 12:15 a.m., yelling slogans including, 'Wake up, sleepy Joe!' and 'I am your nightmare, Biden!'\nAt a another site where Biden was speaking in Scranton, a very different group of demonstrators assembled, these backing Donald Trump. They held signs reading 'Joe Biden: You're Fired' and waved flags bearing the former president's name. Asked by a local news host about the proliferation of pro-Trump signs across Pennsylvania, Biden bristled: 'Well, you haven't been driving in the right places, pal. \u2026 He has no presence here.'\nHe has no presence here.'\nAt other times, Biden faced much friendlier terrain during his three - day swing through Pennsylvania, as large pro-Biden crowds materialized and supporters shouted, 'Four more years' or 'We love you, Joe.' One group held a sign reading 'Scranton Loves Joe!'\n-day swing through Pennsylvania, as large pro-Biden crowds materialized and supporters shouted, 'Four more years' or 'We love you, Joe.' One group held a sign reading 'Scranton Loves Joe!'\nAdvertisement\nThe question for Biden, as he throws himself in earnest into winning a state that means an enormous amount to him personally and politically, is how all these roiling sentiments will play out in November, in Pennsylvania and across the country. In many ways, Pennsylvania is a microcosm of the United States \u2014 a Democratic operative once famously described it as two metropolitan areas with Alabama in between \u2014 and strategists will be paying close attention to the state's Democratic and Republican primaries Tuesday for clues on which party has momentum.\n'Look, you're my ticket to the White House: you, Pennsylvania,' Biden told a group of campaign workers in Philadelphia on Thursday. 'No, it's not hyperbole. You're the ticket to the White House.'\nPolls show the race essentially tied between Biden and Trump, and both campaigns expect the state \u2014 which went for Trump by 0.72 percent in 2016 before swinging to Biden by 1.17 percent in 2020 \u2014 to come down to the wire in 2024.\nIn a recent memo on Pennsylvania, Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez stressed that Democrats have won statewide races there in 2018, 2020 and 2022, as voters turned sharply against Trump' policies from abortion to election denialism.\nAdvertisement\nBut Biden's visit highlighted his challenge as an incumbent at a time when many voters are worried about the economy and the country's direction, while others oppose his position on Gaza, and the nation overall is deeply polarized. Speaking to supporters in Scranton on Tuesday, Biden mused about the level of animus he has faced around the country.\n'I've never thought I'd see a time when I'm going through a neighborhood, or a rural town that's in the West, and see big signs that have a Trump sign in the middle that says \u2018F Biden,' and having a little kid standing with his middle finger \u2014 7 years old, 8 years old,' Biden said. 'Well, I promise, it happens all the time. It's not who we are.'\nDavid Urban, a Republican strategist who led Trump's successful effort to flip Pennsylvania in 2016, said his travels through the state have convinced him that Biden is struggling with its residents, many of whom blame him for the high cost of living and for policies they see as hostile to the local energy industry.\n'The current president is pushing a big rock up a hill, trying to convince people things aren't as bad as they are,' Urban said.\nLast week, Biden was pushing hard.\nAdvertisement\nHe unleashed a populist speech in Scranton. He embraced unions while addressing steelworkers in Pittsburgh. He made stops at Sheetz and Wawa, a nod to the hometown convenience stores whose respective merits are hotly debated, as well as to the kind of retail politicking aides say will be pivotal to helping the 81-year-old president connect with skeptical voters.\nAnd Biden ended his trip Thursday by visiting a majority-Black neighborhood in Philadelphia, where he accepted an endorsement from family members of his most prominent third-party rival, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nAs Biden's birthplace and the largest battleground state \u2014 home to a crucial 19 electoral college votes \u2014 Pennsylvania looms large in the president's personal and political backstory. It's a state both Democrats and Republicans view as crucial to victory, and it stands as a key a test of whether everyday Americans believe his performance as president warrants another term.\nAdvertisement\nThat's a big part of the reason Biden has spent so much time in Pennsylvania, which has the added benefit of being close to both Washington and his home state of Delaware.\nLike Biden, who has already traveled to the state a handful of times this year, Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has also prioritized Pennsylvania. His aides and allies see it as a central pillar in their push to knock down Democrats' venerated 'blue wall' of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 as Trump did in 2016 but not in 2020.\nWith a population of about 13 million consisting of large urban centers, fast-changing suburbs, millions of blue-collar workers and vast rural stretches, Pennsylvania reflects many of the trends upending the nation's political landscape. Since 1960, no Democrat has won the presidency without carrying the state.\nAdvertisement\nAt a recent rally ahead of his criminal trial in New York, Trump told a large crowd in Schnecksville, Pa., that Biden is responsible for high inflation, global instability and a general malaise hanging over the country.\n'All of America knows that the real blame for this nightmare lies with one person: Crooked Joe Biden,' Trump said. 'That's why the people of Pennsylvania are going to tell Crooked Joe, \u2018You're fired. Get out. You're fired.''\nBiden's swing through the state offered a glimpse at how he will respond to such attacks, as aides noted that he made a point of addressing several constituencies that helped propel him to the White House in 2020.\nOn Tuesday, the president visited his childhood home after giving a speech contrasting his view on taxes with that of Trump, saying he represents the scrappy values of Scranton while Trump reflects the money-focused morals of Mar-a-Lago in Florida. His pitch to the United Steelworkers union Wednesday featured a populist pledge to protect American industry from unfair foreign competition, including by tripling tariffs on Chinese-made steel if necessary. He also took a jab at Trump, joking that the former president \u2014 who was in New York facing a court trial \u2014 was 'busy right now.'\nAdvertisement\nHis speech at the Martin Luther King Jr. Recreation Center in Philadelphia on Thursday targeted the city's large population of Black voters. John White Jr., a former state representative and civil rights leader, introduced Biden by praising his record of boosting 'Black livelihoods,' and the president was accompanied around town by Mayor Cherelle Parker (D).\nThroughout the trip, Biden played up his personal connection to the state, where first lady Jill Biden grew up \u2014 she often mentions her attachment to Philadelphia sports teams \u2014 and where the Bidens had their first date. He talked about launching his 2020 campaign in Pittsburgh and turning to Philadelphians to bolster his Senate campaigns over the years. He said he had been dubbed Pennsylvania's 'third senator' because of how often he was on the news in Philadelphia, which shares a media market with his hometown of Wilmington.\nAt the same time, the Biden campaign unleashed a blitz of advertising targeting key groups in the state, including Black residents and Hispanic voters from Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, as well as a ramped-up ground operation aimed in part at holding down Trump's margins in rural and exurban parts of the state. The Trump campaign's on-the-ground presence is more limited than Biden's effort, which now includes more than a dozen offices and a mix of paid staff and volunteers.\nAdvertisement\nThat advantage in fundraising and campaign infrastructure will pay dividends for Biden down the road, said Brendan McPhillips, a senior campaign adviser who managed Biden's 2020 race in Pennsylvania and the successful campaign of Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) in 2022.\n'The gap is huge between what the president's campaign has been doing and is doing right now, versus Trump, who has come into the state once or twice for very brief visits,' McPhillips said, adding that the Biden campaign plans to open another dozen Pennsylvania offices, including in some Trump-friendly areas, in the coming months.\nBut for Trump's allies, the negative emotions sparked by Biden during his visit suggest he will struggle to hit his marks in the parts of the state where he needs a strong turnout to overcome Republicans' dominance in rural counties.\nAdvertisement\n'This '24 race feels way more like '16 than '20,' Urban said. 'The antipathy toward Biden \u2014 I won't say it's the same as it was toward Clinton, but it's definitely present. The chants of \u2018FJB' are louder than they've ever been.'\nLike Hillary Clinton, Biden has faced public blowback from progressive voters. His support for Israel's military campaign in Gaza, in particular, has cost him support from key voting groups, including many young people, Arab Americans and some Black voters.\nIn Pennsylvania, organizers are aiming to convince some 40,000 voters to write in 'uncommitted' rather than voting for Biden during Tuesday's primary. Given Pennsylvania's tight margins, even a small number of defections in November could tip the race.\nBiden's team hopes the state's voters are listening more to other voices, like those of the Kennedy family members who gathered to support him in Philadelphia on Thursday.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Toluse Olorunnipa","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SAKBL7A7CWJBO5JFLP37P52ZXE.JPG&w=1440","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":2.8307376,"_id":"26c70ae879cc8db458c83472f5090344"},{"title":"Chatbots' flaws aren't stopping tech giants from putting them everywhere","author":"Will Oremus","published_date":"2024-04-16 13:39:09","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/16/chatbots-flaws-arent-stopping-tech-giants-putting-them-everywhere","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Meta is the latest to expand its AI tools\u2014and see them go awry.","summary":"Happy Tuesday!

Wadhwa, a former Washington Post opinion contributor whose latest venture is a robotics start-up called Vionix Biosciences, thought he'd give it a spin.\nWithin minutes, the bot had infuriated him. Wadhwa first asked it who he was, then what he's famous for, and finally what he's 'infamous' for, he told The Tech 202 by phone Monday. In response to the last question, the bot described a 2014 blog post accusing Wadhwa of plagiarism, complete with a byline, date and formal citation. As you may have guessed at this point, the blog post doesn't exist.\nAdvertisement\nBy now, such 'hallucinations' are a familiar problem for AI chatbots. My colleague Pranshu Verma and I reported last year on a similar episode in which OpenAI's ChatGPT fabricated a sexual harassment scandal about law professor Jonathan Turley . Since ChatGPT's release in late 2022, there have been countless reports of it and other 'generative AI' tools from industry stalwarts such as Microsoft and Google spouting misinformation, showing bias and giving inappropriate responses.\nPranshu Verma and I reported last year on a similar episode in which OpenAI's ChatGPT fabricated a sexual harassment scandal about law professor Jonathan Turley.

And on Monday, the New York Times reported that the company is approaching Instagram influencers in the United States on a project called 'Creator AI' that would let an AI avatar trained on their voice interact with their fans on their behalf.\nNew York Times reported that the company is approaching Instagram influencers in the United States on a project called 'Creator AI' that would let an AI avatar trained on their voice interact with their fans on their behalf.\nAdvertisement\nFor a company that has prided itself on AI research but fallen behind rivals Microsoft, Google and OpenAI on commercialization of the latest language and image models, the moves represent an ambitious leap toward integrating AI into people's everyday interactions. Meta envisions people asking its chatbots questions, using it to create images or just chatting with it, the company said when it announced Meta AI in September.\nGiven what we know about chatbots so far, it's a leap of faith.\nGiven what we know about chatbots so far, it's a leap of faith.\nAI chatbots can dazzle with their ability to converse on a wide range of topics and generate images of whatever people dream up (with some limits). But what the industry calls 'hallucinations' \u2014 responses that aren't grounded in reality \u2014 have come to seem more like a feature than a bug. Lately, companies including Microsoft, Google, OpenAI and now Meta have tried to patch the problem by connecting AI models to the web and letting them search for information and cite their sources, with mixed results. Meanwhile, attempts to train chatbots to shed offensive biases picked up from their training data often fall short or go too far.\nAdvertisement\nMeta isn't the only company forging ahead with chatbot integrations despite the risks. Last year, its rival Snapchat launched My AI, billed as a friendly conversation partner, and my colleague Geoffrey A. Fowler quickly found it gave teens inappropriate advice. Google and Microsoft are increasingly embedding AI language tools into their search engines and productivity tools, even as Microsoft's have been used to generate pro-Nazi memes and Google's showed a penchant for overcorrecting to avoid racial stereotypes. Elon Musk 's X recently put its Grok AI tool to work writing trending headlines \u2014 several of which quickly turned out to be false. Even Amazon has released an AI chatbot for shopping, which my colleague Shira Ovide reviewed as 'dumb as rocks.' (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\nGeoffrey A.

'Already in India, WhatsApp is being used to influence the elections, being used to stir up hatred, misinformation,' he said. 'Now imagine an AI chatbot that people trust, which produces very credible-sounding references. \u2026 This is dangerous.'\nDespite the downsides, tech giants see AI chatbots as strategically important, said Matt Navarra, a U.K.-based social media consultant and industry analyst.\nDespite the downsides, tech giants see AI chatbots as strategically important, said Matt Navarra, a U.K.-based social media consultant and industry analyst.\nAdvertisement\n'What looks set to happen is that most of the platforms, whether it be TikTok or X, Instagram or Facebook, will all have their own versions of an AI system chatbot where you can engage with it to get answers to problems or find information or perform searches,' Navarra said. While people might find the features 'gimmicky' for now, they give the tech companies another way to glean users' personal data, keep them on the platform, and use those interactions to further train their AI systems for future applications, which they hope will someday be 'more meaningful.'\nIn the meantime, he said, we can expect 'many more headlines' about biases and inappropriate responses, as those problems aren't likely to be solved anytime soon.\nOur top tabs\nSocial media's tools for tracking political ads are falling short, report finds\nThe tools social media companies have developed to help people track political advertising on their platforms are all 'plagued by missing data, bugs, shoddy features, and unacceptable shortfalls,' a new report has found. My colleague Gerrit De Vynck reports on the findings from Mozilla, the maker of the Firefox web browser, and CheckFirst, a Finnish internet transparency organization.\nOver the past several years, companies like Meta, Snapchat, TikTok and Google have built 'ad repositories' meant to allow researchers and journalists to see who is paying for political ads on those platforms.

Tools from Google had 'bare minimum data and functionality,' while those from Apple's app store, LinkedIn, Meta and TikTok had 'big gaps in data and functionality.' No platform was 'ready for action,' the report said.\nThe tools have been an important data source for activists and researchers as billions of people head to the polls this year around the world, including in the United States and India.\n'Our research shows most of the world's largest platforms are not offering up functionally useful ad repositories,' said Claire Pershan , Mozilla's E.U. advocacy lead.

And in the context of all of those debates, what ended up being like a very important element that often drove what policies made it into the legislation and what policies didn't was the score that scorekeepers assigned a particular policy change, and the score is essentially like a cost estimate. It's like over 10 years, either how much revenue is a particular tax change going to generate for the government or how much cost is a particular spending program going to cost.\nAdvertisement\nBut it struck us, me and my co-founders, Danny Yagan, who's an economist at Berkeley, the former chief economist of the OMB, and Martha Gimbel, who was a senior staffer at the CEA in both the Biden administration and in the Obama administration--it struck us that for a lot of policies that we would like to see ultimately legislated, things like a more generous child tax credit, the right way to evaluate them wasn't a 10-year cost estimate, because when you invest in kids, it takes a long time for those investments to pay off.\nAnd so part of what we're trying to do with The Budget Lab is develop the infrastructure to create a more holistic analysis of both the costs and benefits of different types of policy changes.\nMS. RAMPELL: Larry, when you were in government, did you see the need for something like this? How did the existing scoring process that Natasha just laid out affect or constrain the kinds of policies you would recommend or that were feasible?\nAdvertisement\nDR. SUMMERS: Look, if you're a business, you don't get to make an investment project without bringing to your board the costs and benefits of the project, what it's going to cost, what subsequent cash flows are going to be, what its impact on your strategy is going to be in a comprehensive way.\nWe've been making progress in the economics profession at bringing that kind of thinking to the public sector, but we've got a long way to go. People on the right side of the political spectrum, the conservative side of the political spectrum, have been working to incorporate ideas like that if you cut taxes, maybe, possibly, there will be more entrepreneurship into scoring for a long time. But we've never had any ways of recognizing that if you educate kids, you're less likely to need to imprison them, that if you give people preventive healthcare, you're less likely to have to give them heart transplants down the road, that if you invest money in the IRS, the IRS will collect money--collect more money and you won't have to raise taxes.\nSo there's been a big gap, and it's always the case. If you go back to the whole idea of GDP figures, academics in universities were doing them, and then once the concept was proved out, the government started doing it as a routine thing.\nAdvertisement\nAnd that's why what Natasha's doing here is so hugely important. It's both going to inform current debate, and it's going to establish procedures and practices that will ultimately come to be incorporated in the standard work of government. So this is social science's version of laboratory science, where the abstract science of today becomes the drug treatments of tomorrow.\nMS. RAMPELL: So, Natasha, there are, to be fair, a few of these alternative scoring outfits, some of them politically aligned with certain groups, some of them also trying to be neutral arbiters akin to the CBO, but obviously separate from the CBO. I'm wondering what you make of that. I mean, my fear is that there's a risk of sort of undermining the CBO as--the Congressional Budget Office, for those listening--as a neutral arbiter, you know, that there is the risk of sort of emboldening those who want to fight with the rap, which does happen, right? Like, when there is an inconvenience score for a health care bill showing that it will cause a lot of people to lose health insurance, or when there's an inconvenience score for a bill that costs a lot of money, how do you maintain the usefulness of the Congressional Budget Office as a neutral arbiter while still doing this sort of supplemental or alternative kind of analysis that you are working on?\nDR. SARIN: Yeah. And I want to say sort of explicitly that CBO and the Joint Tax Committee and also their sort of counterparts within the executive branch, the Office of Tax Analysis at Treasury, and the Office of Management and Budget folks within the White House, they do kind of like yeoman's work trying to produce these cost estimates. And it's not easy to do. It's in time-constrained ways.\nAdvertisement\nUltimately, the reason that they're not doing this sort of cost-benefit analysis that Larry laid out that maybe corporate executives do is because that's not their remit. They've been tasked with something very particular, and I've been really interested, sort of, of recent in kind of the origins of scorekeeping and how it arose over the course of the last several decades. And it was in response to concerns about short-term deficits and budget rules and the rules that govern processes like reconciliation, which require them to derive these, like, very precise short-run cost estimates.\nI think sort of what Danny and Martha and I bring to the table with respect to this particular sense of, like--I would think about it more as supplemental than as alternative types of analysis--is we're trying to do a translation exercise that I think is pretty important.\nIn the economics profession--and Danny and I are both economists who spend time in our sort of academic lives working on exactly these questions. In the economics profession, there's been a ton of interest in applied work that is able to trace out over the long run, over the medium term, what particular policy interventions are delivering in terms of benefits. If you invest in health care, if you invest in emissions reduction, what are you actually seeing over time?\nAdvertisement\nThe challenge is that there hasn't been much of a translation effort to make that type of information particularly useful or particularly well suited for policy analysis by policymakers, and I think that that kind of translation is a very useful role to play. But it has to be, Catherine, as you described in sort of a central focus of our work, is that it's scientific in its concerns. And it's very much focused on sort of being on the level with respect to not putting a thumb on the scale with particular choices or particular assumptions that we're making, and in fact, we're elucidating all of our choices and our assumptions and all of our models. They're open source. This is about democratizing and innovating on the budget process, and that means allowing people to make their own choices with respect to what they think some of these elasticities are or what the evidence tells us.\nMS. RAMPELL: So--\nDR. SUMMERS: Catherine, Natasha was--\nAdvertisement\nMS. RAMPELL: Oh. Yeah, go on, Larry.\nDR. SUMMERS: Natasha was my student. So I'm going to brag on her a bit by saying three things. First, there wasn't always a Congressional Budget Office. The reason we have one was that Alice Rivlin started doing work estimating the long-term costs of programs at the Brookings Institution, and then it took hold in government. Natasha is taking that work and is today's Alice Rivlin, carrying this kind of thing to a next level and the next approach by building in all the feedback effects.\nAnd second, I understand the argument you made. It's the argument that the NFL referees made when video replay got invented, but ultimately, people decided that with video replay, refs got better. And there got to be more confidence, not less confidence, in the integrity of football.\nAdvertisement\nAnd the last thing I'd say is I was in on some of the planning meetings for all of this. I've got the honor of being one of the advisors to this project, and something Natasha absolutely insisted on was that this project could only happen if there were people who had served prominently in both Democratic and Republican administrations who would have roles as advisors and fiduciaries of the project.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBut so you're right to worry about what you're worried about, frankly, Natasha has been all over it.\nMS. RAMPELL: Okay, fair enough, Larry.\nAnd actually, the reason why I'm delving into--why we are all delving into these nuts and bolts of how you evaluate policies and what criteria you use to determine their cost, for example, is that we are going to have a major overhaul of the U.S. Tax Code next year. As I'm sure viewers out there know, a large portion of the Trump era tax cuts are expiring, and there's going to be a bit of a free-for-all, I guess I would say, for what replaces it, what gets extended, what new tax breaks go in or come out. And I'm curious, Larry. What is your best prediction of how much of that set of tax cut extensions is likely to happen, A, and be paid for, B?\nDR. SUMMERS: Depends on what happens in the election. The Trump tax cuts will do very differently if Donald Trump is president of the United States, God forbid, than if he isn't.\nBut I can tell you some things I'm pretty sure of. I'm pretty sure that it was a dumb idea to cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent when the Business Roundtable's idea was that it should only be cut to 25 percent. I'm pretty sure that some of the tax cuts that took the form of subsidies to companies that are making huge money, but somehow never show any reported U.S. profits--I'm pretty sure that those tax cuts are mistakes. So my guess is that there will be some of it that is extended. I hope that a lot of that will be paid for.\nLook, on net, we need to be raising taxes in the United States of America. Nobody wants to say it. Nobody who's looking to be in office will say it. But what does the government do? It takes care of old people. There are going to be vastly more old people in the future than in the past. It buys services like health care and education. They go up much more rapidly than the prices of television sets or shirts. It keeps our national--it keeps our nation secure. Defense spending is going up fast. So we need to be raising taxes, not just to cover for any new tax cuts, but also to hold off the huge accumulation of debt that we are suffering.\nIf your viewers take only one thing away from this show, I hope it's this idea.\nMS. RAMPELL: So, Nastha--\nDR. SUMMERS: Borrowing money and running a budget deficit is not an alternative to raising taxes or cutting spending. It's a way of deferring doing those things and making them harder.\nMS. RAMPELL: So, Natasha, Larry just sort of picked on some Republican proposals, cutting the corporate tax, other kinds of measures that limit our ability to raise revenue. To be fair, President Biden has also pledged not to raise taxes on the bottom 90 percent of Americans, those making $400,000 or less, which does also limit our ability to both levy new kinds of taxes but also raise revenue in general. Do you think in retrospect that pledge was a mistake?\nDR. SARIN: I guess what I'd say, Catherine, is that I've heard versions of this comparison between Republicans--44 sitting Republican senators and over 200 members of Congress have signed a pledge that says no new taxes ever. And Democrats, where you see coming out of the Biden administration, $5 trillion of revenue raisers from this most recent Green Book.\nAnd, like, I take the point very deeply that the universe that we're talking about with respect to these tax increases, it's much of what Larry described on the corporate side and also making sure that we are aligned with respect to our commitment to minimum tax rate on multinationals, no matter where they profit and no matter where they decide to book income.\nAnd on the individual side, it's very focused on things like raising the capital gains tax rate for the highest earners, things like--and hopefully, we'll get a chance to talk about it--making sure we're able to invest in the IRS to be able to collect taxes from those at the very top of the distribution. And so it strikes me as like a totally reasonable premise to have the view that as you start to deliver the tax increases that Larry is totally accurate in describing that we desperately need, given our fiscal situation, the place to start is with wealthy corporations and those at the very top of the distribution who have the greatest ability to pay. And so, in that sense, I have a lot of sort of deep empathy for various versions of what's come out of the Biden administration over the course of the last several months, and I would hope to see much of it legislated.\nI will also say that something that I'm worried about that Larry started to describe is that the contours of the 2025 debate are going to be set by what is expiring. So, like, the debate's going to be like how much of the expiring provisions do we actually let expire versus how many of them do we decide to keep, and depending on where you are in the political spectrum, you have different views on the answer to that question.\nI worry that we're not going to embrace the importance of using this as a real moment to think seriously about deficit reduction because we are in a fiscal situation where, to Larry's point, we're no longer--we're currently no longer sustainable, but our unsustainability is only going to grow over time because of demographic pressures and other pressures on greater spending needs that the country's going to face over the years to come.\nMS. RAMPELL: Larry, what do you think of the kinds of revenue-raising tax proposals that have come out of this administration? So I'm thinking things like some significant changes to the capital gains tax or a billionaire minimum tax. What do you make of those kinds of ideas, and could you talk through what some of them are for our audience?\nDR. SUMMERS: The spirit and general direction is right. Many of the specifics are right. It's nuts that people who made more than $10 million a year don't even get noticed when they don't file a tax return because of insufficiency with the IRS. It's nuts how easy it is for an entrepreneur to earn huge sums, start a company that's worth $20 billion, borrow money against that company to buy that--against that stock to buy a yacht, bequeath that stock to his kids, and nobody ever pays any taxes anywhere along the road. And the Biden administration's doing the right thing by trying to close that. It's crazy how easy it still is for companies to put their money in the Cayman Islands, and the Biden administration's on the right side of that.\nBut even great, dedicated, thoughtful people sometimes go to places they probably shouldn't venture, and I think the ideas that are in the Biden budget under the label \"billionaires tax\" about taxing people whose stocks have gone up in value but who actually haven't gotten any money because they haven't sold the stock and they haven't borrowed against the stock, I think that's a plan that may destroy too many family businesses, it doesn't correspond to most people's idea of fairness. And I actually think that's--sorry to say it--a place where academic thinking wasn't stopped by adults. So I don't support that particular line of thought. But the general direction and general impulse, I think is very much a right and proper one.\nMS. RAMPELL: We actually have a question from an audience member. Suzanne Bartholomae from Iowa asks, how can tax policy be used to reduce wealth inequality? Which I think is related to all of the things we're talking about. It's not just some of the objectives of tax policy or not only about raising revenue. There are equity concerns presumably. Natasha, do you want to try to tackle that? How can tax policy be used to reduce wealth inequality?\nDR. SARIN: Yeah. It's kind of a big question and it has like several answers, I would say, and one of the precepts driving some of the reform proposals that Larry and I have made in the past and that Kim Clausing and I made in a piece that we wrote ahead of the 2025 debate were exactly oriented around, like, how do you get more equity in the tax code?\nAnd I think there are several levers, but I'll just say three. One is that currently in this country, we have like a two-tiered tax system, because if you're a wage earner who, you know, has W-2 income, your tax liabilities are automatically withheld. So your tax compliance yesterday on Tax Day was 100 percent mechanically.\nIf you're someone who earns income in opaque ways, which is disproportionately people at the very top of the distribution, you have the option kind of to decide whether or not you want to fulfill your civic duty.\nAnd so from an equity perspective, from a revenue-raising perspective, there's a ton of money there because it turns out that 3 percent of GDP on an annualized basis, that's about $700 billion a year that's owed to the IRS is uncollected. But from an equity perspective, making sure that the same set of rules apply no matter how you earn your income or no matter where you are in the wealth distribution strikes us as like super first order.\nI also think that much of what Larry is describing with respect to sort of the general ethos of not living in a society where if you happen to be handed assets from your family or happen to be handed shares of a profitable business that your family has started and you are using, ultimately deploying those assets in your own lifetime, but there's no taxes that are ever assessed because of the nature of how we have a step up in basis upon the transfer of those particular assets, that's like fundamentally unfair. And it creates sort of inequities that persist across generations, because it's not just inequities that are in society today. It actually allows people to build up dynastic wealth in ways that ultimately no tax revenue is ever borne from. So that also has to be first order, not just from a revenue-raising perspective, but also from the perspective of equity.\nAnd last thing I'll say is that, currently, if you have--the current nature of our tax system is such that if you're a large multinational that has at your disposal, the tools and the tax planners that can help you figure out where you want to locate profits in order to minimize your tax liability, that's sort of available to you in a way it's not available to companies that are domiciled in the United States exclusively or small companies. And that's another layer of inequity. It's different types of tax treatment depending on what type of corporation you are or how you organize yourself.\nThe same thing is true with respect to partnerships. They get to organize themselves in ways that the rest of us aren't able to and are able to take advantage of tax opportunity or lowering their tax liabilities and tax loopholes that allow them access to preferential treatment.\nAll of these rules need to be changed, not just because we're going to raise a lot of money to meet our pressing revenue needs, but also because we're going to create a more equal society.\nMS. RAMPELL: So that's a great segue into another big topic that I wanted to make sure we got to, which is the enormous investment in the Internal Revenue Service that came as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act that passed a couple of years ago. Larry, I know you have been on record as supporting the $80 billion invested in the IRS. So has Natasha. So have I, frankly. How do you think that money has been spent--or how well do you think it's been spent to date? What in your view has the agency done well? What gives you pause, if anything?\nDR. SUMMERS: I'd give the IRS so far on its expenditure of that money an incomplete. There are some very promising plans, and they've done some good things, but I don't think we really yet know just how effective it is going to be. There is enormous potential in this area.\nMy hope would be that the IRS can stay focused. Natasha and I are generally in agreement, but a place where I don't agree with Natasha and don't agree with the IRS is this idea that they should be working hard to develop a system to help fill out the tax returns of middle-income people and lower-income people. Let TurboTax do that. They already do it and largely give it away free or at very low cost, and until the IRS has figured out how to audit the rich people who are paying in returns, tax the people who are using abusive tax shelters, answer the phone consistently, I think they need to avoid mission creep.\nAnd I think the Biden administration has not been good about avoiding mission creep, which is an important part of keeping the IRS focused on collecting the taxes that are owed and providing decent, reasonable, legitimate service to taxpayers with questions or taxpayers who want to file.\nBut overall, the main problem with the $80 billion is that it's not $120 billion because there's enormous potential to absorb resources in collecting more.\nMS. RAMPELL: Natasha, I want to make sure--we only have a couple minutes left--that I wanted to make sure that you got a chance to respond to that. What role do you think the IRS should be playing in terms of facilitating Americans' ability to file their taxes?\nDR. SARIN: You know--and Larry is right. This is an area in which we disagree. The average American spends 12 hours and $200 filing their taxes. In countries like Australia and Sweden, you fulfill your tax obligations by saying yes to a text message that you receive, and so I think it is sort of first order for the IRS as they think about enforcement efforts, think about high-end enforcement efforts. Larry and I, like, are very much aligned that that needs to be a focus.\nBut thinking about how to better serve the American people through investments in programs like Direct File, which again, this was a pilot program, it sort of started late in filing season. It started in March, but 100,000 taxpayers were able to fulfill their tax obligations directly with the IRS, able to get assistance with respect to tax questions directly from the agency.\nWork that I did and we put out in The Budget Lab last week suggests that the IRS today has the information that it needs to pre-fill 40 percent of American taxpayers' tax returns. That type of decrease in tax burden would be huge and meaningful for the American people, and it's within reach.\nThe thing that I'm worried about--Larry's worried it's 80, not 120. I'm worried that the 80 has actually become 60. And as you go forth in this political process where ultimately the IRS is subject to a whole host of criticisms that are deeply unfair and sort of standard fare, I guess, in our political discourse, you're going to see these investments decrease, not increase. And I think it really needs to be first order for policymakers to realize that when they make those choices to defund the agency, they're making choices to decrease the equity of our Tax Code, but they're also making choices to hurt their constituents with respect to the types of services they're able to receive.\nMS. RAMPELL: Well, on that note, I think we can all look forward to the IRS or maybe AI doing our taxes for us at some point in the future. But unfortunately for today, we are out of time. So we will have to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us, Natasha Sarin and Larry Summers. Appreciate it.\nDR. SARIN: Thanks, Catherine.\nMS.

That's preposterous.\nPrices clearly are not exclusively a function of the wages being paid to or denied to workers. The issue is more nuanced, which is not the case with this portrayal.\nRobert Braxton , Fairfax\nRobert Braxton, Fairfax\nNot so distasteful after all\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization Bear Spray depicted in Michael Ramirez's wonderful April 6 editorial cartoon, 'NATO's 75th anniversary,' has been a solid sales success, particularly in Poland and the Baltic nations.

Williams, Fairfax Station\nThat's what we get for hiring the Big Bopper to write about women's basketball\nWhen I read the lead of the April 8 Sports article 'As good as it gets,' about South Carolina's defeat of Iowa, I wondered whether I was looking at a parody.\nAdvertisement\nWas the sentence 'Raven Johnson skipped over to Dawn Staley, toothy smile beaming, ponytail bobbing behind her, for a moment of celebration' intended as a joke? 'Skipped'? 'Toothy smile'? 'Ponytail bobbing'? This is how The Post introduced a winning player on the winning basketball team in the NCAA finals? Was the article trying to minimize her contribution or her achievement? It's hard to even imagine an equivalent sentence to describe a male basketball star in a similar situation. This lead did no honor to Johnson, women's basketball or The Post.\nPriscilla Rope , Washington\nPriscilla Rope, Washington\nTake a gander at how we goose the stats\nFor the past several months, The Post has routinely equated sports records in men's and women's college basketball by reporting that women's players and coaches have broken long-standing men's college basketball records. I'm puzzled, therefore, by several articles' continued insistence that Virginia and Purdue were the first two No. 1 seeds to lose to No. 16 seeds in the NCAA tournament. For one example, see the April 8 Sports article 'Purdue's path parallels Virginia's 2019 title run,' which reported that last season, Purdue 'became the second top seed,' after Virginia in 2018, 'to lose to a No. 16 seed in the NCAA tournament.' In 1998, the top-seeded Stanford University women lost on their home court to the 16th-seeded Harvard University squad. Consistency would dictate you treat that loss as relevant to both men and women if you treat other records in that manner. Put differently, the old legal maxim is highly appropriate in this instance: What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.\nAdvertisement\nRichard B. Rogers , Kingstowne\nRichard B.

After reading the article several times, I believe the reporter intended 'sanctioned' to mean the Jordanian government has allowed the demonstrations to continue, while trying to manage public opinion and emotions about the Israel-Gaza conflict and deter or prevent violence during such demonstrations.\nThe political situation in Jordan concerning the Israel-Gaza conflict is complex, and the government's approach to the demonstrations is nuanced. The word 'sanction' and its derivatives have opposing definitions; the word can denote either approval or disapproval. Dictionaries commonly define 'sanction' (whether as a noun or as a verb) to mean basically: (1) an official approval, permission or ratification; or (2) a legal enforcement action or an economic or military coercive measure designed to enforce a law or standard (for example, a threat or fine designed to penalize a nation that has violated an international law, as in 'economic sanctions').\nIn this case, it might have been better to avoid the word 'sanctioned' and use instead a word such as 'allowed' or a phrase such as 'cautiously allowed' to describe the government's decision to allow the protest(s) to occur amid a complex political situation.\nAdvertisement\nPlease stop using the inherently ambiguous term 'sanction' (and its derivatives) unless the context is very clear. Clearer words, such as 'approved' or 'allowed' or 'tolerated,' or 'banned' or 'discouraged,' would serve readers better.\nBrooks J. Bowen , Potomac\nBrooks J. Bowen, Potomac\nOur journalism is beyond compare\nIf there was ever the need for an illustration or an explanatory graphic, it was with the April 3 news article 'German soccer rethinks jersey font after some compare it to Nazi symbol.' How many readers have both a clear and accurate idea what the symbol for the Schutzstaffel, or SS, looked like? The only way to fully understand the story is to see that symbol alongside the design for the jersey. This is clearly a case where readers would have been better served with a visual exploration of the resemblance than a mere description or a single immaterial photo online. Readers should not have to visit Google to understand articles in The Post.\nAdvertisement\nCarol Burnett, Arlington\nCarol Burnett, Arlington\nDoubly singularly wrong\nI read with interest the March 30 Free for All letter 'A disconcerting effort,' about the rising misuse of the term 'concerted effort' to describe exertions by one person. For my part, I object to a term in another letter on that page: 'complete stranger.' Versus an incomplete or partial stranger?\nMadeline Wetzlar , Ellicott City\nMadeline Wetzlar, Ellicott City\nMultitudinously wrong\nI was in complete agreement with Michael Miller's April 9 letter on immigration until the following sentence: 'With the exception of Native Americans ... we are all ... descendants of immigrants coming to this country for a better life.' The sentiment is lovely, but it ignores the tens of millions of Americans descended from enslaved Africans.\nTed Hochstadt , Pimmit Hills\nTed Hochstadt, Pimmit Hills\nThe sun is setting on scientific literacy\nIn a country where too many people believe in the bankrupt concept of scientific orthodoxy, I have to call The Post out for the April 10 headline 'A quest to prove Einstein right, beyond a shadow of doubt' [news]. Experimental physicists don't set out to prove a theory correct. Of course, many experiments verify predictions of theories, but that's not where the thrill is. No, we get the buzz, and the Nobel Prizes, when we find a theory's flaws and prove them wrong.\nAdvertisement\nIn response to the online headline, 'Why this eclipse could really show Einstein was correct,' the general theory of relativity is supported by a preponderance of evidence gathered in experiments performed by thousands of physicists and has culminated in the observation of gravitational radiation and an entirely new form of astronomy through gravitational observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, perhaps the coolest experiment in the past 40 years.\nExperimentalists are not in the business of pandering to the egos of theorists. We have more fun than that.\nRansom Stephens , Ashland, Ore.\nRansom Stephens, Ashland, Ore.\nReaders need to know\nRecent news reports in The Post have left me wanting a summary article about security clearances and classified documents to have as an ongoing resource.

Butler, Frederick\nWe're going down\nI am a public school librarian in Howard County. I love newspapers and encourage my students to read them for unbiased, reliable content. I advocate print journalism because the printed paper sends signals about the value of stories depending on their placement in the paper. Editorials and op-ed pieces are grouped together and clearly labeled, making it very clear when you are reading opinion vs. a news article. I lament the loss of the quality local reporting we had in Howard County as the Baltimore Sun staff has been dramatically reduced.\nAdvertisement\nAnd I am worried about the downsizing at The Post. I am worried that the paper's quality and credibility are in jeopardy when typos, such as the four I noticed in a single week, start appearing. They speak to a problem in the process. If your editing practices were recently revised, or affected by the buyouts that took place late last year, it might not be for the best.\nI hope The Post can stay alive and continue to contribute the crucial oversight provided by journalists. I am not a letter-to-the-editor kind of person; as a teacher, I know mistakes happen. But this string of mistakes was surprising and a bit alarming.\nLynn Rashid , Ellicott City\nLynn Rashid, Ellicott City\nDope floats\nThe April 8 front-page article 'Trump floats plan to end war' struck me as strange. I read the article looking for a plan. True, the first paragraph used the word 'plan,' and the second paragraph talked of a 'proposal.'\nBut the article included no plan or proposal. Rather, it recapitulated what Donald Trump allegedly has been telling his advisers in private; he wants Ukraine to give up substantial amounts of territory to pave the way for peace. That's it. That's the plan.\nIt's hardly a secret that Trump opposes any additional aid to Ukraine; he's been making that clear to one and all in Congress, a message House lawmakers have taken to heart in blocking President Biden's aid package, putting Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-La.) job at risk. It's well known that Trump would let Russian President Vladimir Putin work his will in Ukraine. Has Trump changed his mind? The article didn't say.\nThen we have that word 'float.' But there was no evidence in the story that Trump has floated anything, in the sense of sounding out what foreign policy experts or lawmakers think of a substantial proposal. The whole report rested on what Trump's advisers say he now thinks. Until Trump says it out loud and puts some meat on the bones, it's not a plan; it's gossip.\nSeems to me The Post placed a nonstory in the slot usually reserved for that day's most important news.\nElliot Carlson , Silver Spring\nElliot Carlson, Silver Spring\nWe coulda been a contender\nRegarding Ty Burr's April 3 Style Perspective, 'Can anyone fill Brando's boots?'\nCan any article about Marlon Brando \u2014 whether about his acting career or the 'boots' he left behind and that remain unfilled \u2014 be taken seriously if it doesn't mention his performance in Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now'?

Quality schools, safe streets, and, most importantly, a government that works,' said Wendell Felder, a Ward 7 advisory neighborhood commissioner who's held several roles in District government.\n'Everybody wants to be able to call their council person and get a real person on the line,' said Ebony Payne, a neighborhood commissioner on the western side of Ward 7.\nAdvertisement\nThe redistricting, coupled with longtime Democratic council member Vincent C. Gray's announcement in December that he would not seek reelection, has transformed the political landscape in Ward 7. But no one from the crowded field has emerged as a clear front-runner, even as those in the district say it's an important time for them to have a decisive leader. Ward 7, they say, has struggled with crime and lagging economic development and education indicators. And it stands to be affected the most by the debate over the future of the RFK Stadium complex.\n'This is why the race is so polarizing: The stakes are tremendous,' said Delia Houseal, 1st vice chair of the Ward 7 Democrats and an advisory neighborhood commissioner. 'Ward 7 is either second [to last] or last in a lot of different indicators, whether those are health-related indicators, social-related indicators, education-related indicators, crime-related indicators \u2014 the list goes on and on and on.

And Felder is among the most politically wired candidates as the former chairman of the Ward 7 Democrats.\nIn such a packed field, even the campaign signs seem to be competing for attention along Ward 7's key intersections and corridors. Making matters more interesting, three of the candidates have similar-sounding names, leading to some talking-point shticks to help voters remember who they are, as if in a radio jingle.\n'My name is Ebony Payne, and I'm running for D.C. Council \u2014 that's Ebony with a \u2018Y,'' Payne said in a video advertisement released Thursday, aiming to distinguish herself from Thompson and, perhaps to a lesser extent, former Ward 7 neighborhood commissioner Ebbon Allen.\ncommissioner Ebbon Allen.\nAdvertisement\nOthers in the race include Villareal \u2018VJ' Johnson, who served five terms as a neighborhood commissioner in the ward; Denise Reed, who worked in the office of former D.C. Council Chairman David Clark; Nate Fleming, who won elected office previously as the District's 'shadow representative' in the U.S. House to Congress and was a legislative director for the council; and small business advocate Roscoe Grant.\nPayne has raised nearly $180,000 since November, including matching funds from D.C. taxpayers, and has also outspent her opponents, helping her keep pace with other top candidates that observers note have longer track records of service in the community. Thompson, for her part, raised more than $160,000 with matching funds; Felder, Rasheed and Brown also have a notable fundraising edge over the remaining candidates.\nPatricia Stamper, an advisory neighborhood commissioner in Deanwood, called this year's Ward 7 campaign a 'generational race,' believing that in such a period of transition for the ward, whoever pulls off the win could shape the community's agenda for years to come. If you ask Stamper, that person should be Thompson or Felder, the two she believes have the strongest track records of service in the ward and whom she has supported with donations this year.\nAdvertisement\nLisa Rice, a Ward 7 advisory neighborhood commissioner, said she was rooting for Rasheed or Brown, even though as an independent she wouldn't be voting in the primary. She said she liked the fire they brought in challenging Gray four years ago, a more difficult campaign against an incumbent, and appreciated their approach to public safety and the root causes of crime, showing they'd given the issue 'deep thought.'\nBut Rice, who is leading a ballot initiative to bring ranked-choice voting and open primaries to D.C., said a top concern was that the winner of the Democratic primary could end up advancing with very limited support.\nWith so many platforms for voters to consider, others have wondered whether an endorsement from Gray could shake up the race, or offer clarity for those who might be struggling to choose.\nhave wondered whether an endorsement from Gray could shake up the race, or offer clarity for those who might be struggling to choose.\nAdvertisement\nChuck Thies, Gray's spokesman, said the outgoing council member hasn't decided whether he will back a candidate, but said he's watching the debates virtually and consulting with those who have been paying close attention to the race \u2014 including Thies, who says he reports back to Gray after attending candidate events.\nThies, a longtime political consultant, said he thinks it's a contest between Rasheed, Felder, Thompson and Payne \u2014 calling the latter two candidates' first name similarities a 'disaster' of a campaign hurdle. ('The first thing people should know is my name is Eboni-Rose, not Ebony,' Thompson later told The Washington Post).\nThies called Felder the closest to an 'establishment' candidate in the field because of his previous roles in the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development and as a community relations rep for Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D). But there was a catch, he said, that has caused some trouble for him: Felder told the ACLU in a recent questionnaire that he would advocate for Congress to overturn legislation passed by the D.C. Council if he disagreed with it.\nAdvertisement\nFelder faced immediate backlash online after the ACLU's questionnaire published, creating easy fodder for critics and awkward positions for some of his baffled supporters. He sought to clarify his remark later in statements posted to social media, adding that he would first 'pursue amendments or revisions' to legislation he didn't like. 'However, if a bill's reversal is necessary to safeguard the well-being and rights of D.C. residents, I would not hesitate to urge Congress to intervene,' Wendell said in the April 7 statement. 'This action, although significant, underscores the broader issue of D.C.'s need for statehood \u2014 an issue I have tirelessly advocated for.'\nApril 7 statement. 'This action, although significant, underscores the broader issue of D.C.'s need for statehood \u2014 an issue I have tirelessly advocated for.'\nBut at the forum in Hill East a week later, Felder addressed the questionnaire once again in his closing statement: 'I just want to clear the record: under no circumstances do we support [congressional interference],' he said, adding that it was a 'reflective response to a hypothetical question.'\nOther candidates have taken shots at Payne as the race has heated up, painting her as the big-money candidate but a relative newcomer to Ward 7 politics. At a March forum, Rasheed homed in on an ad that Payne released calling for harsher penalties for people who kidnap dogs, questioning why she was focusing on dogs when people were dying; Payne said dog-nappings were traumatic for dog owners as well. Felder took aim at the ubiquity of Payne's campaign materials around the ward, questioning if her expenditures were adequately documented.\nAdvertisement\n'I think you're just upset that I'm running a better campaign than you,' Payne retorted.\nThe Hill East forum was tamer by comparison, illustrated by an area of consensus. When the 10 candidates were asked to raise their hand if they thought Bowser's fiscal 2025 budget proposal was 'good,' none of them did.\nHaving spent weeks collecting signatures and knocking on doors, candidates had no problem identifying areas of concern shared across the ward. While Ward 7's neighborhoods are somewhat less starved for commercial development than in years past, many residents are keenly aware that their economy still lags behind most other sectors of the city, from the median income to the unemployment rate, as the cost of housing has skyrocketed across the region. And the candidates have been pressed repeatedly on their proposals to drive down crime and rapidly improve traditional public schools facing declining enrollment.\nAdvertisement\nIn the 2021-2022 school year, according to data compiled by the D.C. Policy Center, less than half of all students who live in Ward 7 attended school within the ward \u2014 the lowest percentage among all eight wards. Several candidates tied the ward's literacy rates to its poor economic outcomes: According to last year's statewide assessments, just 19 percent of students in Ward 7 traditional public and charter schools are proficient in reading \u2014 compared with 71 percent in D.C.'s more affluent Ward 3.\nAsked at the Hill East candidate forum how he would try to strengthen Ward 7's schools, Brown, a former high school math teacher, said the city's leaders have spent time debating who should have control over the school system instead of focusing on needed improvements. He also said school funding levels and the allocation of resources should be determined by the individual needs of each school, community and its students \u2014 a line that drew applause.\n'I'm of the belief we should take politics out of the school system and allow our teachers, faculty, staff and administrators the opportunity and autonomy to teach what's important to our students on a daily basis,' Brown said. 'Not politicians, and not anyone else who has ulterior motives.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThompson, the school board president, has said she does not support mayoral control 'as it exists today,' believing that parents have a difficult time advocating for and resolving concerns about their children's education in the existing government structure, which does not allow the State Board of Education to change policy.\nAnd amid citywide concerns about truancy, Thompson emphasized the need for children to have safe passage to school: 'I have a lot of access to kids as the state board president, and they've told us that they actually do not feel safe traveling to school, and they used to get to do it online during the pandemic so why should they go?'\nWhen Payne, Thompson, Brown, Rasheed and Felder were asked if they supported a professional football stadium at the RFK complex, Rasheed was the only one to fully raise her hand \u2014 although she has said she would not prioritize taxpayer funds for the stadium itself. Felder equivocated, repeating a call to create a task force composed of the stadium's surrounding neighborhoods. Payne, who told residents that her opposition to an NFL stadium at RFK is 'a big reason why I'm running,' called Felder out at a separate candidate forum later that day, asserting that he hadn't been clear on his position on the stadium.\n'What I've come to know as a leader, I don't make decisions that may impact thousands of lives until I have all the facts,' Felder said in response to Payne's challenge. 'And where we are with the stadium, we're not there yet.'\nMidway through the Hill East forum, D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) grabbed a seat, hoping to get an early read on who might join him on the council. In deep-blue D.C., the winner of the Democratic primary is all but assured a victory in the general election.

On Tuesday, in his hometown of Scranton, Pa., he told would-be voters 'when I look at the economy, I look at it through the eyes of Scranton, not through the eyes of Mar-a-Lago.'\nAdvertisement\nThen, on Wednesday, he told steelworkers in Pittsburgh they had built and strengthened America's middle class, and that his worldview comes 'from Scranton, from Pittsburgh, from a thousand working, middle-class neighbors all across America.'\nEven Thursday, when Biden received a political endorsement from America's most famous political family, the Kennedys, he talked about how their most celebrated members were champions of the middle class.\nFor the second election in a row, Biden's campaign has gone all-in on his middle-class roots, particularly as he tries to win Pennsylvania voters who may be turned off by Trump. In 2020, Biden won the state by about 80,000 votes, but there are signs the coalition that put him in the White House has begun to fracture.\nLeaning into his middle-class upbringing also becomes a shorthand for what Biden has said is a clear difference in the values of the two presidential candidates. As Biden was traipsing through the keystone state, Trump was in New York in a trial about whether he made hush money payments to an adult film actress. Biden only obliquely referenced the trial this week, but his values-based message allowed him to draw a contrast without ever saying the words 'trial' or 'felony' or 'Stormy.'\nAdvertisement\nFollow all of Cleve's reporting here and follow him on X here .\nFollow all of Cleve's reporting here and follow him on X here.\nFrom the courts\nThe first week of Trump's hush money trial comes to a close\nWe're almost there: Five alternates still need to be seated today as the historic criminal trial of former president Donald Trump enters its fourth day.\nWe're almost there: Five alternates still need to be seated today as the historic criminal trial of former president Donald Trump enters its fourth day.\nTwelve jurors \u2014 seven men and five women \u2014 plus one alternate were sworn in on Thursday, hours after New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan dismissed two jurors who had been sworn in earlier this week.

People had walked for miles to be there. Soon the governor pulled up in his SUV. Women danced, and an emcee raised his hands to the sky.

Water sources are drying up.

In times of hardship, camels produce more milk than cows.\nMany cite an adage: The cow is the first animal to die in a drought; the camel is the last.\n'If there was no climate change, we would not even bother to buy these camels,' said Jonathan Lati Lelelit, the governor of Samburu, a county about 240 miles north of Nairobi.

They were also those judged by local officials to be the most in need. They had stories of near-total cattle losses, of walking miles to find water, of violent run-ins with a neighboring tribe as they strayed farther from their territory in search of grazing space for their faltering livestock.\nStill, many said the plight of one person stood out: Dishon Leleina.\nLeleina, 42, had been wealthy by the standards of this region before the drought. He had two wives and 10 kids, and had been surrounded by an abundance of cows for nearly as long as he could remember. He even sacrificed bulls \u2014 with a stab to the back of the head \u2014 on each of his wedding days.\nBut when one rainy season failed, then another, then another, his stock of 150 cows plummeted over several years as never before. A few dozen were raided by the bordering Pokot tribe. And more than a hundred withered away \u2014 going skinny in the midsection, swelling in other areas. Some would go to sleep at night and never wake up. Some would arrive at last at a water source, drink lustily and collapse to their death. Several times, including after losing his best milking cow, Leleina roared at the sky in fury. By the time the rains resumed last year, he had seven cows left.\n'I had one status' before the drought, he said. 'And now I have another.'\nWhat hadn't changed was his daily routine; he moved in step with his livestock, often walking miles per day. But now he had cut back to one meal per day \u2014 as did many other pastoralists. He lost weight. Several times, he fainted. Even on the day of the camel distribution, as the event stretched into late afternoon, almost nobody was seen eating or drinking.\nAs the number drawing began, Leleina pressed into the crowd. An organizer with a sheet of paper recorded who would take which camel home. Some of the camels were big, some small, some muscular, many slender, and as soon as people pulled numbers \u2014 73, 6, 27 \u2014 they darted off to find their animal in the crowd.\nThen it was Leleina's turn. He reached into the hat.\n'Number 17,' he said.\nCamel recipients, including Leleina (center, in green), crowd around a checklist keeping track of the animals and their new owners.\nHe walked toward the camels, scrap of paper in hand, and tried to use his wooden staff to poke a few of the animals, which were bunched together, obscuring the numbers painted at the base of their necks. Leleina squinted into the sun. He went in another direction. He prodded a few more animals. And then he found her: a skinny camel with a medium build, a rich tuft of longer fur on its hump.\nHe gave her a pat.\nIt would be dark soon, and Leleina still needed to guide his new camel home \u2014 several miles through the powdery dirt and shrub land. But even in this harsh place, Camel 17 could manage to find a snack.\nShe darted over to an acacia tree, pulling flowers into her mouth, working her tongue around two-inch thorns.\nAn animal built for drought The camel is sometimes described as an animal designed by committee, what with its hodgepodge of features \u2014\nanimal designed by committee, what with its hodgepodge of features \u2014 Camel features\nthe thin legs of a whippet,\nthe rippled midsection\nof a horse,\nthe neck of a stunted giraffe.\nthe thin legs of a whippet,\nthe rippled midsection\nof a horse,\nthe neck of a stunted giraffe.\nthe thin legs of a whippet,\nthe rippled midsection of a horse,\nthe neck of a stunted giraffe.\nBut among mammals, the camel is almost singularly equipped to handle extremes.\nCamels can go two weeks without water, as opposed to a day or two for a cow. They can lose 30 percent of their body weight and survive, one of the highest thresholds for any large animal. Their body temperatures fluctuate in sync with daily climate patterns. When they pee, their urine trickles down their legs, keeping them cool. When they lie down, their leathery knees fold into pedestals that work to prop much of their undersides just above the ground, allowing cooling air to pass through.\nOne recently published paper, perhaps straying from science to reverence, called them a 'miracle species.'\n'They're unparalleled in terms of domestic animals.'\n\u2014 Piers Simpkin, the Nairobi-based global livestock adviser for Mercy Corps\nAnd yet in much of Africa \u2014 for much of human history \u2014 their attributes haven't been needed. For centuries, they've resided primarily in the driest outer ring of the continent, while cows \u2014 outnumbering camels in Africa 10 to 1 \u2014 reigned in the lush river plains, in the highlands. Kenya, where the landscape can turn from green to reddish and back in an hour's drive, has long been a middle ground: a place where some tribes use camels and more use cows, with identities forming around that choice. Because of that, neighboring tribes see the consequences of using one animal vs. the other. That has seemingly transformed Samburu County \u2014 an area the size of New Jersey that is home to the Samburu tribe \u2014 into an experiment on how livestock fare, and how humans respond, in a warming climate.\nThe experiment started about a half-century ago, according to Louise Sperling, a scholar who conducted fieldwork in Samburu in the 1980s. The Samburu were among the most 'specialized and successful' cattle-keepers in East Africa, she wrote in one account, but they were increasingly mixing with and marrying members of a nearby tribe, the Rendille \u2014 camel-keepers.\nOver the subsequent decades, they also noticed changes in traditional weather patterns. Fewer rainy seasons. Less predictability. And most importantly: more frequent droughts.\nUptake was gradual. Cows still overwhelmingly outnumbered camels. And cows still defined the Samburu identity, used in celebrations or as dowries.\nBut then came the longest series of failed rainy seasons on record in the Horn of Africa.\nThe drought started in 2020 and held its grip for three years. An international team of scientists said a drought of this severity had been 100 times more likely because of climate change. In Samburu, the smell of rotting cattle carcasses spread across this county of roughly 310,000 people. Malnutrition spiked, including among children and the elderly. The Kenyan government and the World Food Program had to step in with aid.\nAnd yet the level of need wasn't equal.\nNoompon Lenkamaldanyani, a single mother of four, lost 18 of her 20 cows and fell short on milk, but she noticed her camel-owning neighbors were willing to step in and offer help.\nLekojde Loidongo said he and his family 'didn't suffer much,' as all 22 of their camels continued to produce milk.\nEven Leleina, the new owner of Camel 17, said he noticed how the animals fared differently. He'd owned three camels before the drought hit. They all survived.\nIf he had any regrets, it was that he hadn't moved earlier. His father, who died in 2021, had been an early adopter of camels.\n'In the future,' Leleina said, echoing a conclusion shared by others, 'I foresee having more camels than cows.'\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nBecause of these realizations, there has been very little backlash to the government's camel program, which started eight years ago. Some are also obtaining their own camels by trading cattle at markets. Pastoralists \u2014 people who move with their livestock herds \u2014 are often described as among the most vulnerable people in the world to climate change, and their fortunes can swing based on the decisions they make about which animals to keep.\nA 2022 research paper published in Nature Food, analyzing a huge belt of land across northern sub-Saharan Africa, noted increased heat stress and reduced water availability in some areas and said milk production would benefit from a higher proportion of camels, as well as goats, which are also more climate-resilient than cows. Camel milk is a comparable substitute for cow's milk. It tends to be lower in fat and higher in certain minerals, said Anne Mottet, the lead livestock specialist at the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Many say it has a saltier taste.\nCamel vs cattle\nCow vs. camel milk production impacts\nFeed needed (kg)*\nWater needed (kg)*\nCO2 emissions (kg)*\n*for producing one metric ton of milk\nCows\nCamels\nCow vs. camel milk production impacts\nFeed needed (kg)*\nWater needed (kg)*\nCO2 emissions (kg)*\nCows\n*for producing one metric ton of milk\nCamels\nCow vs. camel milk production impacts\nFeed needed (kg)*\nWater needed (kg)*\nCO2 emissions (kg)*\nCows\nCamels\n*to produce one metric ton of milk\n'We're just following the trends of the drought,' said Lepason Lenanguram, another camel recipient in Samburu. 'People want camels now. The culture is changing.'\nThe Samburu governor said he believes 'totally' that shifting to the camel is the right move. He noted that Samburu \u2014 with large swaths far removed from the electrical grid and without running water \u2014 had contributed relatively little to global greenhouse gas emissions. By far the greatest source of emissions in rural areas like Samburu is methane, a byproduct of the cow's complex digestive process. Camels emit far less methane.\nThe program gives away only one camel per person. But it can still build up peace of mind, said the director of the governor's press service, Jeff Lekupe, who was on-site when the camels were distributed. With even one camel, a family has better chances of having milk during a drought. And then there is a 'ripple effect,' he said. The camel gives birth. The population grows.\n'So that next time,' he said, 'the need for the WFP will be minimal.'\nGetting acclimated to Camel 17 For Leleina, Camel 17 \u2014 a female \u2014 symbolized the start of a rebuild, but it didn't begin well. Arriving at her new home \u2014 a circular property, ringed by branches and thorns, a mile from the closest unpaved road \u2014 the animal quickly started tussling with one of the three other camels. They bit one another. They made noises. They locked necks, and they only stopped when Leleina roped the legs of the other camel as a way to keep her from moving.\na female \u2014 symbolized the start of a rebuild, but it didn't begin well.

They bit one another. They made noises. They locked necks, and they only stopped when Leleina roped the legs of the other camel as a way to keep her from moving. That night, Leleina put a mat on the floor outside his hut and felt too nervous to go to sleep. He'd heard stories about other camels darting off \u2014 something that almost never happened with a cow \u2014 or feeling uneasy in new surroundings; a neighbor's camel had escaped and been mauled by a lion. So Leleina trained his eyes on Camel 17 for hour after hour as she brayed.\nEventually the sun rose. Camel 17 was still there.\n'The camel might have been thinking about where it came from,' Leleina said.\nIn the morning, more at ease, he let the newest addition to his herd go off. She needed to eat. The job of following her fell to Leleina's 9-year-old daughter, and after the camel had been out for a while, Leleina decided to join her. So he set off in the direction of a red-rock table mountain, crunching through the scrub, occasionally coming upon bones, and moving closer to an area that he knew had foliage for camels and was free of predators. He heard nothing for five minutes, then 10, and then shouted his daughter's name.\n'Nashenjo,' he shouted.\nThen a minute later:\n'Nashenjo!'\nHe heard an animal noise.\n'The camels are not far from here,' he said.\nIn a circle of trees, he saw not only Camel 17, but a half-dozen other camels \u2014 craning their necks from branch to branch. A few of the camels were his. Others belonged to a neighbor. It was a critical mass of camels in a place that had once belonged almost entirely to cattle, and the ranks only figured to grow. A day earlier, at the same time of the distribution, a neighbor's camel had gone into labor. Leleina's neighbors had crouched at the camel's side, pulling out the healthy baby by the legs.\nLeleina sat down at the base of a tree and watched the animals eat. Camel 17 was still skinny, but that was understandable, he said. She needed time to recover. Her trip to get here had been 100-odd miles, seven days, three stops for water, and even in that journey he saw why she was suited for her new home.\n'She's a survivor,' he said.","rights":"washingtonpost.com","rank":83,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Chico Harlan","media":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/74ORXAMBLINX5V42A5FK7ROCOM.jpg&w=1200","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@WashingtonPost","_score":2.2136157,"_id":"e04bc0544f97f840e280e22b0d5ca6f5"},{"title":"Internet data centers are fueling drive to old power source: Coal","author":"Antonio Olivo","published_date":"2024-04-17 10:05:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2024/data-centers-internet-power-source-coal","clean_url":"washingtonpost.com","excerpt":"Virginia data centers that process nearly 70 percent of global digital traffic need more electricity.
