The longest-enduring standardized college admissions test in the nation, the SAT has faced decades of controversy over bias and criticism for reducing aspiring college students to a test score. It has also been denounced as part of the high barrier to entry into the so-called American meritocracy.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, when dozens of the most prestigious universities in the nation suspended their standardized testing requirement, some were hopeful of a new era of more equitable college admissions.\nBut this year, many of these institutions have done an about-face on their test-optional policies. At the same time, at least 1,825 US colleges and universities, or more than 80% of four-year schools, will still not require testing for 2025 admissions, according to FairTest, the National Center for Fair & Open Testing.\nThe splintering of admissions policies post-pandemic has reinvigorated debate around the necessity of the SAT.\nCriticism has dogged the SAT for years. The exam, whose acronym originally stood for 'Scholastic Aptitude Test,' was developed in the 1920s by Princeton-based eugenicist Carl Brigham, who believed immigration was diluting American intelligence and adapted US Army mental tests to determine whether similar exams could measure innate student intelligence. (Brigham retracted some of his views several years later.)\nThe College Board, the educational non-profit that designs and administers the exam, told CNN the SAT has been 'completely overhauled' since the 1920s and now measures how well a student has learned specific content, not inherent aptitude.\nBut the test's legacy \u2014 one steeped in racism and classism \u2014 has raised questions about the need for high-stakes testing at all. The National Education Association has noted that the SAT, and its counterpart the ACT, can factor too heavily in the college admissions process.\n'It's important that we don't overly rely on them because they're not holistic. They are one snapshot on one day and it can determine whether or not you get into college,' NEA's Director of Policy Daaiyah Bilal-Threats told CNN.\nMost colleges have no plans to reinstitute their pre-pandemic testing requirements.\n'Test-optional policies continue to dominate at national universities, state flagships, and selective liberal arts colleges because they typically result in more applicants, academically stronger applicants and more diversity,' said FairTest Executive Director Harry Feder in a February statement, after some Ivy League schools announced they would reinstitute their testing requirements.\nA strong emphasis on high SAT scores has also spurred the rise of a lucrative test prep industry in the United States, which is estimated to grow by about 7% to almost $50 billion by 2027, according to a report in October 2023 from market researcher Technavio.\nDiscrepancies with standardized testing appear to be symptomatic of the inequality endemic to the education system. Some experts point out that doing away with the SAT as an admissions component, like many universities did at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, does little to remedy systemic inequity. In fact, it can bring the disparity into starker focus.\nWealthier students may have access to prestigious internships, schools with better-funded clubs and sports, as well as music and arts programs \u2014 all elements of the quintessential college application.\n'(Students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds) don't have any of these fancy extracurriculars. They haven't played in a fancy jazz band. They don't do fancy internships. They don't work as volunteers in Guatemala. And yet some of them will be very capable students,' said Daniel Koretz, a testing policy expert at Harvard's Graduate School of Education. He says the question is: How do schools find these students?\nAccording to Koretz, the SAT's longevity can be attributed to its efficacy in predicting how a student will perform in college.\nA study published in January by Harvard's Opportunity Insights center found that standardized tests are more effective predictors of performance than high school grades.\nCritically, the study also found that students from different socioeconomic backgrounds who have similar test scores have 'virtually identical' college GPAs.\nWeeks after the study was released, several schools that had been test-optional for nearly four years officially reversed their stances. Yale and Dartmouth announced in February they were reinstating a testing requirement and were quickly joined by private and public institutions, including Brown, Georgetown, Harvard, the University of Florida and the University of Texas at Austin.\n'SAT/ACTs can be especially helpful in identifying students from less-resourced backgrounds who would succeed at Dartmouth but might otherwise be missed in a test-optional environment,' Dartmouth wrote in a statement in February.\n'With an abundance of high school GPAs surrounding 4.0 \u2026 an SAT or ACT score is a proven differentiator that is in each student's and the University's best interest,' UT Austin said in March.\nEducation experts who spoke to CNN say the SAT is necessary because there is no 'standard' American education.\nIndividual schools may have different grading criteria. Some schools weigh grade point averages differently. An A+ in an AP class in one district is equivalent to a 4.0 GPA. In another, it could be 5.0, 4.5 or 4.2.\nEven within the same school and subject, some teachers might grade more or less leniently than others.\nCollege admissions officers simply don't have the ability to account for all of these minute discrepancies, experts told CNN, so standardized tests will likely stick around unless US education becomes standardized in other ways.\n'Anytime you have a system as big as ours and in the absence of that kind of standardization in the K-12 system, schools are going to find value in finding ways to compare students. It doesn't have to be the SAT necessarily, but something standardized like it,' said Ethan Hutt, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's School of Education.\nThis lack of standardization reaches back to the early days of US education. Throughout the 1800's, there was little tracking of student achievement, and grades and written tests weren't common.\n'In the 19th century, schools \u2026 would gather parents and townspeople, and the teacher would basically put on an exhibition with the class,' said Hutt. 'They would ask students questions and to recite things (they had learned).'\nOral examinations were the norm until 1845, when education reformer and then-Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education Horace Mann instituted a written test to gauge the level of student instruction across Boston-area public schools.\nA college education was exceedingly rare, as the system was designed to favor wealthy White men funneled from elite private schools in the Northeast to prestigious private universities also in the Northeast.\n'Often, it would consist of either colleges accrediting certain high schools and saying, \u2018OK, any graduate of (Phillips Exeter Academy) is automatically given entrance to Harvard,' or they would send out professors to do exams at individual schools,' said Hutt.\nFirst administered in 1926, the SAT was an attempt to broaden the university candidate pool.\nThree legislative milestones indirectly expanded the influence of the SAT. First, the 1944 Servicemen's Readjustment Act, commonly known as the GI Bill, gave returning soldiers the funds to pursue higher education. Between 1944 and 1951, more than two million veterans enrolled in college.\nSecond, the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibited colleges and universities that received federal money from discriminating against applicants according to 'race, color, or national origin.' Eight years later, Congress would pass another landmark legislation \u2014 Title IX \u2014 a law that prohibited institutions from discriminating on the basis of sex. These laws, at least in theory, sought to even out the playing field for college admissions.\nBetween 1945 and 1995, the percent of Americans older than 25 who had earned a bachelor's degree had increased from about 5% to 23%, according to the Census Bureau. And as higher education grew more attainable, the SAT became the most important exam some Americans would ever take.\nThe College Board continually revamps and redesigns both its SAT scoring metrics and exam content. For decades, the test consisted of two multiple-choice sections: math and verbal reasoning. Each section was worth a total of 800 points, making a perfect score 1600.\nIn 2005, the College Board added an 800-point writing section to the exam alongside its math and verbal reasoning sections. The test, scored out of 2400 instead of 1600, was also 45 minutes longer. About nine years later, the SAT reverted to a 1600-point essay-optional model before entirely scrapping the essay section in 2021.\nOn March 9, the College Board administered its first fully digital SAT exam. At around two hours, the test, which was taken by over 200,000 students on a test-taking app, is much shorter than its predecessors. It's also adaptive, meaning the questions in the second half of the reading and math sections are adjusted based on the student's performance on the first half.\nPart of the push to redesign comes from competition with the Iowa-based ACT, which has been administered since 1959 but has since become the preferred exam in many parts of the country.\n'When the ACT started getting so much more traction and because it was shorter, the SAT really wanted to maintain its market share, and so it made a number of changes for that reason,' said Rachel Rubin, a higher education policy expert and co-founder of Massachusetts-based educational consulting company Spark Admissions.\nAlthough the SAT has seen a slight slump in the number of test takers, with 1.9 million students sitting for the exam in 2023 compared to 2.2 million pre-pandemic, the College Board's exam still reins supreme. Only about 1.4 million students took the ACT in 2023, compared to 1.7 million in 2019.\nWorking through a history of bias The SAT's analogy section, a fixture of the exam until 2005, had long been criticized for presupposing that test-takers come from certain cultural backgrounds. An infamous example from the 1980s exam included 'regatta,' which is a sporting event consisting of boat races that is almost exclusively common in wealthy Northeast communities.\n'For many years the SAT \u2026 was crafted by people who were almost entirely White, were overwhelmingly male, and were largely educated in colleges and universities from the Northeast,' said Jack Schneider, the head of UMass Amherst's Center for Education Policy. 'The assumptions that they made about the things that any well-educated person should know were in many ways biased against communities of color, low-income communities, and communities where languages other than English were the predominant language.'\nSchneider acknowledges that eliminating bias from the SAT is incredibly difficult because 'we live in a biased society.'\nthat eliminating bias from the SAT is incredibly difficult because 'we live in a biased society.' The College Board told CNN it has also done away with its esoteric vocabulary in the past decade.\n'Starting in 2014, we said let's measure all the most common things that are most useful in college and that students are more likely to encounter in their high school classrooms,' said College Board CEO David Coleman, noting this applies both to the math curriculum and the mastery of vocabulary.\nIn recent years, the College Board has implemented cost-saving initiatives for eligible test-takers to promote equity, such as waiving the $60 registration fee and offering college application fee waivers, which can save applicants as much as $90 per school . It has partnered with education non-profit Khan Academy since 2015 to provide free test prep materials.\n$90 per school . It has partnered with education non-profit Khan Academy since 2015 to provide free test prep materials. The SAT School Day program, which launched in 2014, allows students to take the test on a weekday rather than on a designated weekend at a potentially unfamiliar testing center. The College Board say a majority of students use the program, which 'has been shown to lead to higher college-going rates for low-income and rural students.'\nColeman says administering the test in a familiar environment can reduce the stress inherent to the SAT experience. He added that the shorter digital exam is also aimed at accommodating different types of test-takers.\n'(The older version of the SAT) can feel like it's designed for young people who are very quick, and it's a great error to confuse quick and smart,' Coleman said. 'The digital exam gives kids 160% more time per question \u2026 to make sure they can finish the exam without feeling out of breath.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Eva Rothenberg","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2021-06-16t000000z-117125532-rc2c1o93fd3j-rtrmadp-3-health-coronavirus-usa.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":6.5179825,"_id":"e17fb36d45074fccfe5d873139c2a3b4"},{"title":"How Mark Zuckerberg is reimagining the classroom","author":"Clare Duffy","published_date":"2024-04-15 10:00:29","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/15/tech/meta-quest-vr-education","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Imagine hopping on a school bus and being transported to an immersive, educational tour of the inside of the human body \u2014 and no, not on a fictional episode of 'The Magic School Bus.'

This is the kind of experience that Meta hopes to enable for students, digitally, through its Quest virtual reality headsets.\nLater this year, Meta will launch new software for educators that aims to make it easier to use its VR headsets in the classroom. The tools will let teachers manage and program multiple Quest headsets at once, give them access to a range of education-related apps and provide greater oversight and control of how students are using the devices.\nBringing VR into more classrooms could enable new kinds of learning opportunities, such as allowing high school drama students to feel like they're having an immersive, real-time experience watching Shakespeare performed at the Globe Theatre in the 17th century. But VR also creates thorny questions about digital safety and the potential harm to humans who are having more digital interactions and fewer in-person ones, as well as questions about whether incorporating the technology in classrooms would really improve learning.\n'You will be able to teach biology and chemistry without having to have a fully equipped laboratory in the future \u2026 you will be able to walk the streets of Ancient Rome with students,' Meta's President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg, who has overseen the Quest for education initiative, told me in an interview conducted via virtual reality ahead of the announcement.\nThe push to make VR more accessible for teachers and students is part of Meta's long-term, multi-billion dollar bet on the so-called metaverse: The company believes that in the coming years, humans will use virtual reality headsets to spend increasing amounts of time working, learning and interacting in a digital version of the world.\nOne selling point, according to Meta, is that VR enables things that would be impossible in the real world because of limitations like time, space and gravity. For example, when I interviewed Clegg, I was sitting in an office in Manhattan and he was in one in London, and yet thanks to VR, it felt sort of like we were sitting at a desk together. (I say 'sort of' because the bodies people inhabit in Meta's virtual world still look like leg-less video game avatars that vaguely resemble their human user.)\nStill, it remains unclear just how useful virtual reality is in helping students learn better.\n'I think that (VR) is one area that really would benefit from having some additional research,' said Vincent Quan, an education researcher and co-executive director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab. 'With technology, sure, it can have a lot of promise, but at the same time, it can also be a lot of hype, and I think it's important to rigorously evaluate these types of technologies \u2026 sometimes you don't know if it's just flashy and innovative and cool versus actually impactful.'\nQuan, who in 2020 was part of a group of researchers who published a broad review of studies on the impact of education technology, said the findings on whether classroom tech leads to improved learning are mixed \u2014 and are dependent on what tools are used and how. Meta, meanwhile, points to early studies on the benefits of VR, such as a PwC report from 2022 that found that students who received a 'soft skills' training in VR felt more engaged than those who were trained in a more traditional learning environment.\nClegg said the new Quest features are simply a response to requests from teachers who are already using the devices, as well as a growing crop of developers building educational apps for the headsets.\nCNN reporter Clare Duffy interviews Meta President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg in virtual reality, using a Meta Quest 3 headset, alongside Meta spokespeople, on Wednesday, April 10, 2024.\nCNN reporter Clare Duffy interviews Meta President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg in virtual reality, using a Meta Quest 3 headset, alongside Meta spokespeople, on Wednesday, April 10, 2024.\nClare Duffy/CNN via Meta Quest 3\nNew Mexico University is using the headsets to teach criminal justice students to investigate virtual crime scenes, and Morehouse College has developed a 'digital twin campus' to teach students a range of subjects through VR, both through a partner program with Meta to test educational applications of the technology.\n'They want this technology to be available to them out of the box, they don't want to mess around, wasting time individually configuring each of them, and of course, crucially, they want full, complete visibility and control about what students are experiencing,' Clegg said of the feedback from educators who have used the devices that informed the new Quest education software offering.\nFor students aged 13 to 17, Clegg added that the new software includes special protections, such as blocking access to the Meta Quest app store so they can use only applications that are pre-programmed by teachers on the devices.\nQuestions about VR in the classroom\nThe cost to incorporate VR headsets in the classroom could be a hurdle to adoption for the many schools already struggling with limited resources. While cheaper than some other headsets on the market, Meta's Quest 3 devices still start at $499 each.\n'Sometimes with these new ed tech tools, they seem really promising, they seem in theory like they should level the playing field,' Quan said. However, 'the kids who would most benefit from additional instruction, they don't have the resources of the infrastructure to utilize the technology or they don't really know about the technology, so they don't end up utilizing it and then it actually makes the inequality gap widen.'\nClegg acknowledged that cost is 'always, candidly, an issue when you have new technology being introduced into education.'\n'It costs something, so any cost of course is more burdensome for those who have fewer means,' he said. However, he added that experiences like being able to virtually take students to 'a museum rather than having to spend the expense of actually transporting them to your nearest museum \u2026 I think it could make many really valuable education experiences much cheaper' in the long term.\nI also asked Clegg about concerns that having a classroom full of students wearing headsets and interacting in a digital world rather than talking face-to-face \u2014 or conducting a virtual biology lab instead of engaging with the physical world \u2014 could to some people feel a bit dystopian. He disagrees.\n'I think in years to come, we will look back and think it was somewhat dystopian that we instructed rows of children to sit in silence behind desks staring at pages in a book and I think we will actually think, wow, that earlier generation they were basically consigned to this really joyless way of learning,' Clegg said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"tech","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Clare Duffy","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap23270728090740-copy.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":6.509522,"_id":"4a1f4f8f43f97e7bce5563b31bdb2fc9"},{"title":"Gov.\u00a0Ron DeSantis signs education bill limiting book challenges","author":"Carlos Suarez","published_date":"2024-04-16 22:41:23","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/desantis-education-book-challenges-reaj","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill Tuesday that limits the number of books and classroom materials that can be challenged in school districts.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Less than a year after signing a law that led to the removal of hundreds of books from public school shelves, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill Tuesday that amends the state's law to limit the number of books and classroom materials that can be challenged in school districts.\nThe bill, which goes into effect on July 1, states that Florida residents without children in a school district 'may not object to more than one material per month' and instructs the state's Board of Education to adopt changes to implement the decision.\nThe provision does not limit the number of challenges a parent with a child enrolled in a Florida school district can file or include a penalty if the law is violated.\nDeSantis on Tuesday acknowledged that some school districts in the state may have gone too far in removing titles from classrooms.\n'You have some people who are taking the curriculum transparency, and they are trying to weaponize that for political purposes,' he said at an event in Jacksonville, Florida. 'That involves objecting to normal books, like some of the books that I saw in the teacher's lounge, these classic books.'\nIn the first half of the 2023-2024 school year, Florida had the highest number of bans compared to other states, a report released Tuesday by the literary and free expression advocacy group PEN America found.\nThere were 4,349 instances of book bans in 23 states and 53 public schools from July to December 2023, but PEN America says 3,135 of those bans impacted 11 school districts in the Sunshine State.\nMore than 1,600 cases were from a single school district, Escambia County Public Schools, which is facing a lawsuit in connection to the book removals, CNN previously reported.\nIn February, during a news conference near Orlando, the governor called on Florida's Department of Education to 'take appropriate action to prohibit bad actors in school leadership positions from intentionally depriving students of an education by politicizing the book review process.'\nHe called the idea that Florida bans books a 'false narrative.'\nBut across the state, school board meetings have become a battleground between parents who want certain books removed and those who wish to have them remain available to students. Meanwhile, Florida teachers and educators have struggled to navigate a slate of laws signed by the governor that expand so-called 'parental rights' in schools.\nIn 2023, DeSantis signed HB 1069, which restricts sexual education and classroom 'instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in Pre-K through 8th grade.'\nThe legislation also allows parents and citizens to petition for classroom books and instructional materials that include 'pornography' or describe sexual conduct to be removed. Individual school districts are responsible for creating processes 'to handle all objections' and provide resolutions, the law states.\nSince the law went into effect last year, residents have swiftly objected to a number of books, and individual school districts were left to develop a process to determine whether the challenged material would be restricted to a certain age group or removed from schools altogether.\nDespite the removal of hundreds of books from school shelves in the last school year, DeSantis maintains Florida does not ban books in schools, but he has acknowledged that 'some people have abused this process.'\n'If you're somebody who doesn't have a kid in school and you're gonna object to 100 books, no, I don't think that's appropriate,' DeSantis said at a news conference in February.\nSabrina Ba\u00eata, manager of PEN America's Freedom to Read program and a lead author of Tuesday's report, said the findings should be a red alert for those who care about American values and free expression.\n'Book bans are targeting narratives about race and sexual identities and sexual content writ large, and they show no sign of stopping. The bans we're seeing are broad, harsh, and pernicious \u2013 and they're undermining the education of millions of students across the country,' Ba\u00eata said in a statement.\nWhen it comes to how many books are banned at public schools, Florida takes the lead, followed by Wisconsin, which had 481 bans in three school districts; Iowa with 142 bans in three districts and Texas with 141 bans in four districts. Kentucky and Virginia reported at least 100 bans, according to the PEN America report.\nAfter analyzing the book ban instances, PEN America found several trends regarding the content of the books and the people involved or impacted by the bans.\nBooks that discuss sex, abortion or rape are among the most censored after claims that their content considered sexually explicit or 'obscene' \u2013 a category of speech that is not protected under the First Amendment, according to the report. PEN America said there is no consistent legal definition of what is considered sexually explicit from state to state, 'leading to confusion about what is and is not allowed.'\nOther books that continue being targeted are those discussing race, racism and LGBTQ+ themes, especially transgender identities and experiences, PEN America said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Carlos Suarez,Nicole Chavez,Denise Royal","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-ap24107753748573-20240416214639141.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.3403697,"_id":"65f5cda8ac1111a6e5fffbdc093006fa"},{"title":"Biden administration to announce expanded Title IX protections while reversing Trump-era guidance","author":"Donald Judd","published_date":"2024-04-19 09:02:08","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/19/politics/biden-title-ix-protections-trump-era-guidance","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The Biden administration on Friday will announce changes to Title IX, expanding protections for LGBTQ+ and pregnant students while overhauling controversial Trump-era guidance around how schools\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 The Biden administration on Friday will announce changes to Title IX, expanding protections for LGBTQ+ and pregnant students while overhauling controversial Trump-era guidance around how schools should handle sexual assault cases.\n'Our nation's educational institutions should be places where we not only accept differences, but celebrate them \u2013 places that root out hate and promote inclusion, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because our systems and institutions are richer for it,' Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said on a call Thursday previewing the changes to Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination at federally funded schools.\nThe final rule \u2013 which is slated to take effect on August 1 \u2013 requires schools to protect students from all sex discrimination, including sexual violence and sex-based harassment, expanding that definition to include discrimination based on pregnancy or pregnancy-related conditions like childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or recovery from pregnancy.\nThe rule also prohibits discrimination 'based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics in federally funded education programs,' according to a fact sheet shared with CNN Thursday, formalizing a previously proposed rule from the administration that would strengthen Title IX protections for transgender students.\nIt also aims to prevent retaliation against students or employees who've reported sex discrimination.\nThe new Title IX regulations will also reverse guidance under the Trump administration that narrowly defined sexual harassment and investigation requirements critics said could discourage victims from reporting sexual assault and harassment on college campuses.\nPer the administration fact sheet, Friday's rule prohibits 'all forms of sex-based harassment, including sexual violence and unwelcome sex-based conduct that creates a hostile environment by limiting or denying a person's ability to participate in or benefit from a school's education program or activity.'\nThe Trump-era changes received significant backlash from victim advocacy groups, which argued the regulations would discourage survivors from reporting sexual assault and harassment. Under the Trump rules, colleges and universities are required to hold live hearings with cross-examinations of both parties. Then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos argued that guidance issued under the Obama administration had denied due process to those accused of harassment or assault and the new rules would give more rights to those accused.\nThe new rule will allow investigators or decisionmakers to assess parties' credibility in either a live hearing, as mandated under the Trump administration, or during an individual meeting with a party or witness and with questions proposed by each party in lieu of cross examination.\nBut at least one change to Title IX instituted under Trump remains: a provision that prohibited schools from engaging in disciplinary measures like suspending students from sports teams while a Title IX investigation is still pending.\n'Removing a respondent from participation in any program or activity before the respondent has been deemed responsible under Title IX is burdensome for the respondent, is inconsistent with not holding the respondent responsible during the pendency of the proceedings, and so we retain that provision as part of the of the required equity for all parties under Title IX,' a senior administration official said Thursday.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Donald Judd,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1833521670.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.289102,"_id":"eec43b24919fca1a1c0a9b2a20f3ffab"},{"title":"A lawmaker proposed a bill that would ban DEI in medical schools.

She earned a master's in religious studies in 2017, with dreams of teaching at a college. But she couldn't find any jobs in her field when she graduated and struggled to find jobs in other areas where she lacked experience.\nEvans, who now works as a director of youth programs and communications at a church north of Pittsburgh, feels trapped by her debt, for which she pays $940 a month.\n'It just feels like you're treading water your whole life \u2026 I can't travel, I couldn't really have a family because I couldn't afford it. It's just a slog.'\nEvans is far from alone.\nDozens of people who responded to a CNN prompt on social media this week said their student debt has hammered their credit score and drained their income. Many who responded said they were nearing retirement age but couldn't imagine being able to stop working, saying they would take their debt to their grave.\n'Cost is the No. 1 issue when people say they're not going to pursue postsecondary education,' said Courtney Brown, who has been leading the Gallup Lumina study for the past four years.\n'When people have this debt, not only are they not having children, they're not buying homes, they're also not starting their own businesses,' Brown said in an interview. 'And that will be a problem \u2014 we need our local businesses, we need innovation, and that's another thing that's going to hurt us.'\nOne in 3 students in the United States currently enrolled in college or other post-high-school program say they have considered stopping their coursework over the past six months, the Gallup Lumina poll found. Among those, 31% blame the cost \u2014 the third-most cited factor behind emotional stress and personal mental health reasons.\n'People want to get a degree \u2014 it's not that they don't value it,' said Brown, the vice president of impact and planning for the Lumina Foundation, a nonprofit that aims to increase participation in education beyond high school. 'I think they're increasingly frustrated, not only because it costs so much but it's confusing to understand how much it costs.'\nonly because it costs so much but it's confusing to understand how much it costs.' Spiraling tuition costs have begun to change the narrative around the value of a college degree. In 2015, more than half \u2014 57% \u2014 of Americans had 'a great deal' or 'quite a lot' of confidence in higher education, according to a separate Gallup study. Last year, that figure hit a new low of 36%. That Gallup study didn't focus on the cause of the eroding confidence, but it said that rising costs 'likely play a significant role.'\nPart of the problem is the scale of the higher education system in the US, where hundreds of nonprofit colleges are competing for enrollment and talent, and a large proportion of upper- and middle-class parents are willing to pay top dollar \u2014 or even go into debt themselves \u2014 to give their kids the best education possible.\nSome critics of the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness plans say that wiping out the debt doesn't fix the root cause \u2014 and in fact could encourage universities to raise tuition even further.\nThe White House has forgiven a staggering $153 billion in federal student loan debt, giving a financial lifeline to millions of borrowers.\nWhen Josh, who lives in Oregon and asked CNN not to publish his last name, received an email from the Department of Education last week, he said his first reaction was, 'What the heck do they want now?'\nBut he soon learned there was good news: He'd qualified for loan forgiveness.\n'To read the words that I now qualified, having reached the number of monthly payments \u2026 I was just blown away,' he said. 'I can't begin to describe how it feels to have this glimmer of hope that 24 years of struggle is possibly coming to an end.'\nJosh says he's not allowing himself to get his hopes up just yet, noting that there are already two lawsuits challenging Biden's SAVE plan. But in moments when he lets himself imagine his life without debt, he dreams of finally buying a home with his husband.\nAs striking as Biden's $153 billion in forgiven debt is, it is less than 10% of the trillion-plus dollars in outstanding federal debt.\nSince 2007, borrowers who work for the government or a nonprofit have been able to lighten their debt load through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. But not all public sector workers are eligible.\nworkers are eligible. Amy Coody, a social worker at a maximum-security women's prison in Wetumpka, Alabama, says she is ineligible for the PSLF program because she's employed through a third-party contractor rather than directly by the state.\n'Even though I'm in the prison and dealing with the inmates, they said that that's not public service,' she said in an interview. 'I've been paying on my loans for 21 years, and I'm never going to be able to retire at this rate.'\nBorrowers who took private loans or moved their debt to private lenders to consolidate it also aren't eligible for loan forgiveness.\nThat's an acute frustration for Ralph Davis, a 64-year-old chiropractor from Savannah, Georgia. Davis said he doesn't begrudge anyone lucky enough to have their debt wiped away. But he can't help see 'sort of an essential unfairness' within the Biden programs.\nDavis graduated from chiropractic college in 1986, with about $30,000 in debt from federal student loans. At the time, he was advised to consolidate those debts through a private lender. He later amassed $40,000 in debt trying to get an additional degree through a for-profit college, though he eventually gave up on the degree when the college kept changing the curriculum to move the finish line forward.\nBut because Davis consolidated his debt through a private lender, he's not eligible for federal forgiveness programs.\nHe isn't bitter about it, and he's not counting on a magic wand to come and zap his debt away. But he conscious of being left out, resigned to the reality that it may take nine more years before he can finally pay off his loans.\nfinally pay off his loans.

But even when the means exist to defray that cost, applicants and families have to fight their way through endless bureaucracy to find out the actual price (colleges have a sticker price, but most charge a discount rate).\nThen they need to sort out what kind of aid is available. And that's when would-be college students encounter the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, better known as the FAFSA.\nBefore 2024, the FAFSA was a Frankenstein's monster, with all kinds of different forms grafted together to create a confusing and demoralizing process that left far too many eligible students unable to access their aid. This year, the Department of Education rolled out major revisions that are, in fact, much better \u2014 but only if they work. Right now, they don't.\nThanks to a late release and numerous technical errors, submissions are about half a million students, or 27%, lower than last year. It's a crisis for colleges and universities staring down the barrel at much smaller class sizes next fall. It's a disaster for kids who just want to go to college.\nRelated article Why students are freaking out about the FAFSA this year\nRelated article Why students are freaking out about the FAFSA this year Some history: Federal financial aid in the United States dates back to 1965, but for decades standards varied widely, with individual institutions determining eligibility in a hodgepodge of ways, and often requiring applicants pay an application fee to each institution. A series of reforms in the 1980s and 1990s resulted in a set of national standards for determining eligibility for grants and loans. The FAFSA, a single free form that every school accepted, was released in 1992.\nThat was a great idea, but over time, the FAFSA morphed into a monstrous document, 108 questions long, many of them difficult to answer without research and some are not even relevant for determining eligibility.\nIt took hours to fill out and for many students \u2014 especially those from marginalized backgrounds, the very people who needed aid the most \u2014 required professional help from school college counselors or other mentors. The FAFSA Simplification Act, passed with broad bipartisan support, cut the maximum number of questions from 108 to 36 but gave the Department of Education until 2024 to implement the changes. Which is to say, right now.\nIt's been, to put it gently, a fiasco. Normally the FAFSA comes out in October of the previous year; this time students couldn't access it until December 30, and even then it's been plagued with technical bugs. The Biden administration blames the problems on changes to the financial aid formula, the complexity of changing a system based on millions of lines of computer code more than forty years old and missed deadlines with the outside vendor, General Dynamics, responsible for operating the new system. Lawmakers from both parties have condemned the delays and the Government Accounting Office has launched two separate investigations.\nThere are two big problems that result from this delay. First, students can't make decisions about which college to attend without the full financial picture and they can't get that picture until their FAFSA is fully processed.\nMeanwhile, deadlines for admissions decisions are here; most schools' dates are April 15 or May 1. Colleges can push back those deadlines, though that will make it extremely difficult to forecast budgets for the fall.\nAnd even though the new form is in fact much easier and faster than the old one, taking successful users about 15 minutes once they have their tax information assembled and if they don't encounter technical errors, many of the students who need aid the most are about to graduate and lose the support structure provided by schools. Sure, students can get help in the summers, but many won't, and doors of opportunity will close.\nSo even if next year seems likely to be better, there's no denying that this new FAFSA rollout has been a disaster. But that poses to all of us involved in higher education a bigger question. Why do we do it this way?\nThe answer is complicated. One of the hallmarks of the Biden administration's approach to college affordability has been to implement technical and organizational improvements. That's largely because, blocked by the six Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices and Republican attorneys general from around the country, Biden hasn't been able to make any sweeping changes in how people pay for college or how much it costs. Instead, his administration has found ways to optimize existing programs, whether forgiving $153 billion in debt or reworking the FAFSA.\nYes, the FAFSA update was mandated by Congress, but the debt-forgiveness programs were too, yet languished under a Trump Administration that seemed disinterested in good governance. So the Biden approach has been refreshing, except that incremental changes are only good if they make people's lives easier incrementally. This year, the Department of Education's failure to upgrade FAFSA smoothly has made things harder.\nThe story of how we ended up here isn't just about partisan politics, though \u2014 it's also structural. Need-based programs like financial aid (but also Medicaid, disability support and other social supports) are designed around what I call a bureaucracy-of-suspicion. The assumption built into these programs is that people will seek benefits for which they don't qualify, and that it's better to deny 100 eligible users rather than to give a single extra penny to someone who might be ineligible. So we get means testing. We get administrative burdens. We get Frankenstein's bureaucratic monsters that keep eligible people from getting the resources they need, all so that, in theory, no one gets away with an extra dollar or two for education.\nWhen it comes to college costs, there could be a better way. Public higher education could, and should, offer a high quality and low or no cost pathway to a college degree. This used to be true. Many red, blue and purple states currently offer free college to some or all residents \u2014 albeit usually after filling out a FAFSA.\nWe should applaud the successful Biden administration initiatives to incrementally ease the financial burdens of higher education and hold them accountable, demand better, when they fail. But we don't have to think incrementally. Instead, we must work towards universal systems for all.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook Because the hardest thing about getting into college should be getting into college.

About 1.4 million students in the U.S. took the ACT in 2023, a small increase from the year before, but the numbers have not returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nWhat's happening: ACT Inc., the Iowa-based nonprofit behind the eponymous college entrance exam, has been having a tough time. About 1.4 million students in the U.S. took the ACT in 2023, a small increase from the year before, but the numbers have not returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nThe company recorded a net loss of $12 million in fiscal year 2022, $6 million in 2021 and $60.5 million in 2020.\nLast week, the company announced that it would partner with California-based private equity firm Nexus Capital Management and move its test into a for-profit company.\nACT Inc. says that this cash infusion will help expand and enhance services beyond testing. 'At this moment in time, 40% of students leaving high school on average are going straight to the workforce,' ACT CEO Janet Godwin told CNN. 'I think Nexus sees with ACT the absolute need that our nation has to make sure that we are developing talent for the needs of our employers.'\nGodwin, who will retain her position, declined to share the monetary details of the deal with Nexus but said it would bring 'opportunities for inorganic growth' like mergers and acquisitions, strategic portfolio investments and access to new talent.\nit would bring 'opportunities for inorganic growth' like mergers and acquisitions, strategic portfolio investments and access to new talent.\nIt is 'a very persistent misconception' that ACT is in 'economic duress,' she said.\n'We had impacts with Covid when schools were shut down and we weren't able to operate at the scale that we typically do. But since 2021, we've been growing our revenues and we've rebounded very significantly.'\n'We had impacts with Covid when schools were shut down and we weren't able to operate at the scale that we typically do.

People need to be able to trust that there's a fair evaluation process so nothing gets distorted.'\nNonprofit companies are subject to regulatory oversight and disclosure requirements, which help ensure that transparency and maintain public confidence.\ntransparency and maintain public confidence.\nA company owned by private equity can obfuscate what the company actually does to the public and potentially to regulators.\nregulators.\nThe ACT will become a 'public benefit corporation,' which means it is supposed to take the public good and shareholder interests into account. Still, that does not exempt it from taxes or from distributing its profits to its new owners.\nNexus Capital Management's portfolio also includes Savvas Learning Company, which specializes in designing K-12 curriculums.\n'If a private equity firm has input in the testing but they also own a company that develops the curriculum, they have control over the entire process,' said Azani Creeks, a senior research and campaign coordinator at the Private Equity Shareholder Project.\n'They have a lot of control in ways that are not transparent. With something as important as college admissions testing you want that transparency. Nonprofits have to share a lot of information with the public, private equity-owned structures don't,' she added.\nACT says it will not immediately raise test prices and that current, nonprofit ACT will retain a minority interest in the company and continue its research on education and the workplace.\nGodwin told CNN that she has heard and understands the concerns, but that ACT partnered with Nexus because of its 'track record of working in education in a transparent way' and with the intention of creating long-term value instead of chasing profit.\nCritics remain skeptical.\n'We should be worried about industries where there are a lot of government subsidies available, where consumers often are not well informed, and where there's a lot of market power for firms,' said Constantine Yannelis, an associate professor of finance at University of Chicago Booth School of Business. 'I think the testing industry is unfortunately one of those industries where all three of those factors apply pretty strongly.'\nA lot of colleges that are state-owned and receive government subsidies use the ACT to admit students and to administer aid, he said. 'I worry that profitability could come at the expense of students, and particularly students coming from lower income families.'\nA broad problem: It's not just the ACT that's going the way of private equity.\nA broad problem: It's not just the ACT that's going the way of private equity.\n'This is a story about the fact that testing is going downhill in the US,' said Rebecca Winthrop, a senior fellow and director of the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution. 'All of these companies are actively shifting how they think about their products and the roles of testing. They're losing money because people are questioning their merits.'\nThat means they need to expand.\nPrivate equity investment in education services amounted to $2.09 billion across 31 deals in the quarter to June 20, 2023, surpassing the $1.42 billion recorded in the second quarter of 2022, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data.\nPrivate equity firms 'come into industries that are already suffering from a lack of funding,' said Creeks. 'All of these issues with standardized testing predate private equity. They've had a lack of funding and support and so sometimes private equity is the only viable option. That's why I really support government regulation and increased funding for funding.'\n'come into industries that are already suffering from a lack of funding,' said Creeks.

Instead, he said, there are indications 'that it is likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence.'\n'Right now, given the strength of the labor market and progress on inflation so far, it's appropriate to allow restrictive policy further time to work and let the data and the evolving outlook guide us,' the Fed chief said.\nInterest rates are currently nestled at a 23-year high after the Fed launched an aggressive rate-hiking campaign two years ago, reports my colleague Bryan Mena.\nInflation is down considerably from a four-decade peak reached in the summer of 2022, but recent inflation reports have shown persistent price pressures in services and housing.\nHigher borrowing costs, coupled with elevated prices for essentials, have forced many Americans to cut back.

Here are some of the policies Trump says he would enact if elected for a second term.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump, now the presumptive Republican nominee, has made a number of promises on the campaign trail, including rolling back car pollution rules, building 10 new cities and appointing a special prosecutor to investigate President Joe Biden and his family. While some of Trump's plans are lacking in detail, here are some of the policies he says he would enact if elected for a second term. Trump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal last month and making a trip to the southern border on February 29, where he touted his previous hard-line immigration policies. In a Des Moines Register op-ed published roughly a week before winning the Iowa caucuses in January, Trump vowed to use the 'Alien Enemies Act to remove known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States.' 'We will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement \u2014 including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS,' he wrote. In a video posted on Truth Social in late February before his border visit, Trump also promised to 'carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.' After the Israel-Hamas war began last October, Trump also promised to terminate the visas of 'Hamas' sympathizers.' 'We'll get them off our college campuses, out of our cities and get them the hell out of our country, if that's OK with you,' he added. Trump announced plans in a September 2023 campaign video to close the Department of Education and send 'all education and education work and needs back to the states.' 'We want them to run the education of our children, because they'll do a much better job of it,' he added. The former president has also promised to 'put parents back in charge and give them the final say' in education. In a January 2023 campaign video, the former president said he would give funding preferences and 'favorable treatment' to schools that allow parents to elect principals, abolish teacher tenure for K-12 teachers, use merit pay to incentivize quality teaching and cut the number of school administrators, such as those overseeing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Trump also said in that campaign video that he would cut funding for schools that teach critical race theory and gender ideology. In a later speech, Trump said he would bring back the 1776 Commission, which was launched in his previous administration to 'teach our values and promote our history and our traditions to our children.' The former president said he would charge the Department of Justice and the Department of Education with investigating civil rights violations of race-based discrimination in schools while also removing 'Marxists' from the Department of Education. A second Trump administration would pursue violations in schools of both the Constitution's Establishment and Free Exercise clauses, which prohibit the government establishment of religion and protect a citizen's right to practice their own religion, he said. Last November, Trump promised to replace the Affordable Care Act, known colloquially as Obamacare, in a series of posts on Truth Social. A Trump-backed effort to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in 2017 after three Republicans senators joined with Democrats to vote against the bill. 'Getting much better Healthcare than Obamacare for the American people will be a priority of the Trump Administration,' he said. 'It is not a matter of cost, it is a matter of HEALTH. America will have one of the best Healthcare Plans anywhere in the world. Right now it has one of the WORST!,' he continued. He also doubled down on his vow during a speech in early January. Trump also vowed in a June 2023 campaign video to reinstate his previous executive order so that the US government would pay the same price for pharmaceuticals as other developed countries. Some of the former president's pharmaceutical policies were overturned by Biden. Trump has promised to use the Department of Justice to attack critics and former allies. In several videos and speeches, the former president also laid out plans to gut the current justice system by firing 'radical Marxist prosecutors that are destroying America.' 'I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,' Trump said in June 2023 remarks. 'I will totally obliterate the Deep State.' Trump said in a campaign video last year that he would reinstate a 2020 executive order to remove 'rogue' bureaucrats and propose a constitutional amendment for term limits on members of Congress. To address what he labeled the 'disturbing' relationship between technology platforms and the government, the former president said in a January 2023 video that he would enact a seven-year cooling off period before employees at agencies such as the FBI or CIA can work for platforms that oversee mass user data. Trump added in multiple campaign releases that he would task the Justice Department with investigating online censorship, ban federal agencies from 'colluding' to censor citizens and suspend federal money to universities participating in 'censorship-supporting activities.' In a September 2023 speech at the Family Research Council's Pray Vote Stand Summit in Washington, DC, Trump also touted plans to continue appointing conservative judges. 'I will once again appoint rock-solid conservative judges to do what they have to do in the mold of Justices Antonin Scalia; Samuel Alito, a great gentleman; and another great gentleman, Clarence Thomas,' he said. Trump has also pledged to 'appoint U.S. Attorneys who will be the polar opposite of the Soros District Attorneys and others that are being appointed throughout the United States.' In a September 2023 speech in Washington, DC, Trump also announced that he would appoint a task force to review the cases of people he claimed had been 'unjustly persecuted by the Biden administration.' Trump noted that he wanted to 'study the situation very quickly, and sign their pardons or commutations on day one.' It's a move that could lead to potential pardons of many rioters from the January 6, 2021, insurrection \u2013 which he suggested he would do at a CNN town hall in May 2023. * Only promises on judge appointments and congressional term limits are similar to prior campaigns Trump said in two February 2023 campaign videos that if 'Marxist' prosecutors refuse to charge crimes and surrender 'our cities to violent criminals,' he 'will not hesitate to send in federal law enforcement to restore peace and public safety.' Trump added that he would instruct the Department of Justice to open civil rights investigations into 'radical left' prosecutors' offices that engaged in racial enforcement of the law, encourage Congress to use their legal authority over Washington, DC, to restore 'law and order' and overhaul federal standards of disciplining minors to address rising crimes like carjackings. Addressing policies made in what Trump calls the 'Democrats' war on police,' the former president vowed in a campaign video that he would pass a 'record investment' to hire and retrain police, strengthen protections like qualified immunity, increase penalties for assaulting law enforcement officers and deploy the National Guard when local law enforcement 'refuses to act.' The former president added that he would require law enforcement agencies that receive money from his funding investment or the Department of Justice to use 'proven common sense' measures such as stop-and-frisk. Trump has continued his attacks against member countries of NATO, a European and North American defense alliance. At a South Carolina rally last month, Trump said he would not abide by the alliance's collective-defense clause and would encourage Russia to do 'whatever the hell they want' if a member country didn't meet spending guidelines. 'NATO was busted until I came along,' Trump said. 'I said, \u2018Everybody's gonna pay.' They said, \u2018Well, if we don't pay, are you still going to protect us?' I said, \u2018Absolutely not.' They couldn't believe the answer.' The former president has also previously pledged to end the war in Ukraine, though he's offered no details on how he would do so. 'Shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,' Trump said at a New Hampshire campaign event last year, adding in another speech that it would take him 'no longer than one day' to settle the war if elected. Trump further addressed his strategy of stopping the 'never-ending wars' by vowing to remove 'warmongers,' 'frauds' and 'failures in the senior ranks of our government,' and replace them with national security officials who would defend America's interests. The former president added in a campaign video that he would stop lobbyists and government contractors from pushing senior military officials toward war. In addition, Trump has said he would restore his 'wonderful' travel ban on individuals from several majority-Muslim countries to 'keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country' after Biden overturned the ban in 2021. Trump said in multiple campaign videos that he would spearhead an effort to build so-called 'Freedom Cities' to 'reopen the frontier, reignite American imagination, and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people, all hardworking families, a new shot at home ownership and in fact, the American Dream.' In his plan, the federal government would charter 10 new cities on federal land, awarding them to areas with the best development proposals. The former president said in a campaign video that the Freedom Cities would bring the return of US manufacturing, economic opportunity, new industries and affordable living. In the March 2023 video, Trump added that the US under a second Trump administration would lead in efforts to 'develop vertical-takeoff-and-landing vehicles for families and individuals,' not letting China lead 'this revolution in air mobility.' The former president said these airborne vehicles would change commerce and bring wealth into rural communities. At the same rally in South Carolina, Trump pledged to impose 'stiff penalties on China and other trade abusers.' 'It's called you screw us, and we screw you,' Trump said. Under his proposed 'Trump Reciprocal Trade Act,' the former president said if other countries impose tariffs on the US, the country would impose 'a reciprocal, identical' tariff right back. It was the same pledge Trump made in a campaign video in 2023: to impose the same tariffs that other countries may impose on the US on those countries. The goal, the former president said then, is to get other countries to drop their tariffs. As part of a larger strategy to bring jobs back into the US, Trump also said he would implement his so-called 'America First' trade agenda if elected. By setting universal baseline tariffs on a majority of foreign goods, the former president said Americans would see taxes decrease as tariffs increase. His proposal also includes a four-year plan to phase out all Chinese imports of essential goods, as well as stopping China from buying up America and stopping the investment of US companies in China. Trump also said in February that he would consider imposing a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports if he's reelected. The former president has particularly focused on China, vowing in a January 2023 campaign video to restrict Chinese ownership of US infrastructure such as energy, technology, telecommunications and natural resources. Trump also said he would force the Chinese to sell current holdings that may put national security at risk. 'Economic security is national security,' he said. ``\nFormer President Donald Trump, now the presumptive Republican nominee, has made a number of promises on the campaign trail, including rolling back car pollution rules, building 10 new cities and appointing a special prosecutor to investigate President Joe Biden and his family.\nWhile some of Trump's plans are lacking in detail, here are some of the policies he says he would enact if elected for a second term.\nTrump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal last month and making a trip to the southern border on February 29, where he touted his previous hard-line immigration policies.\nIn a Des Moines Register op-ed published roughly a week before winning the Iowa caucuses in January, Trump vowed to use the 'Alien Enemies Act to remove known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States.'\n'We will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement \u2014 including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS,' he wrote.\nIn a video posted on Truth Social in late February before his border visit, Trump also promised to 'carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.'\nAfter the Israel-Hamas war began last October, Trump also promised to terminate the visas of 'Hamas' sympathizers.'\n'We'll get them off our college campuses, out of our cities and get them the hell out of our country, if that's OK with you,' he added.\nTrump announced plans in a September 2023 campaign video to close the Department of Education and send 'all education and education work and needs back to the states.'\n'We want them to run the education of our children, because they'll do a much better job of it,' he added.\nThe former president has also promised to 'put parents back in charge and give them the final say' in education. In a January 2023 campaign video, the former president said he would give funding preferences and 'favorable treatment' to schools that allow parents to elect principals, abolish teacher tenure for K-12 teachers, use merit pay to incentivize quality teaching and cut the number of school administrators, such as those overseeing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\nTrump also said in that campaign video that he would cut funding for schools that teach critical race theory and gender ideology. In a later speech, Trump said he would bring back the 1776 Commission, which was launched in his previous administration to 'teach our values and promote our history and our traditions to our children.'\nThe former president said he would charge the Department of Justice and the Department of Education with investigating civil rights violations of race-based discrimination in schools while also removing 'Marxists' from the Department of Education. A second Trump administration would pursue violations in schools of both the Constitution's Establishment and Free Exercise clauses, which prohibit the government establishment of religion and protect a citizen's right to practice their own religion, he said.\nLast November, Trump promised to replace the Affordable Care Act, known colloquially as Obamacare, in a series of posts on Truth Social. A Trump-backed effort to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in 2017 after three Republicans senators joined with Democrats to vote against the bill.\n'Getting much better Healthcare than Obamacare for the American people will be a priority of the Trump Administration,' he said.\n'It is not a matter of cost, it is a matter of HEALTH. America will have one of the best Healthcare Plans anywhere in the world. Right now it has one of the WORST!,' he continued. He also doubled down on his vow during a speech in early January.\nTrump also vowed in a June 2023 campaign video to reinstate his previous executive order so that the US government would pay the same price for pharmaceuticals as other developed countries. Some of the former president's pharmaceutical policies were overturned by Biden.\nTrump has promised to use the Department of Justice to attack critics and former allies. In several videos and speeches, the former president also laid out plans to gut the current justice system by firing 'radical Marxist prosecutors that are destroying America.'\n'I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,' Trump said in June 2023 remarks. 'I will totally obliterate the Deep State.'\nTrump said in a campaign video last year that he would reinstate a 2020 executive order to remove 'rogue' bureaucrats and propose a constitutional amendment for term limits on members of Congress.\nTo address what he labeled the 'disturbing' relationship between technology platforms and the government, the former president said in a January 2023 video that he would enact a seven-year cooling off period before employees at agencies such as the FBI or CIA can work for platforms that oversee mass user data.\nTrump added in multiple campaign releases that he would task the Justice Department with investigating online censorship, ban federal agencies from 'colluding' to censor citizens and suspend federal money to universities participating in 'censorship-supporting activities.'\nIn a September 2023 speech at the Family Research Council's Pray Vote Stand Summit in Washington, DC, Trump also touted plans to continue appointing conservative judges.\n'I will once again appoint rock-solid conservative judges to do what they have to do in the mold of Justices Antonin Scalia; Samuel Alito, a great gentleman; and another great gentleman, Clarence Thomas,' he said.\nTrump has also pledged to 'appoint U.S. Attorneys who will be the polar opposite of the Soros District Attorneys and others that are being appointed throughout the United States.'\nIn a September 2023 speech in Washington, DC, Trump also announced that he would appoint a task force to review the cases of people he claimed had been 'unjustly persecuted by the Biden administration.' Trump noted that he wanted to 'study the situation very quickly, and sign their pardons or commutations on day one.'\nIt's a move that could lead to potential pardons of many rioters from the January 6, 2021, insurrection \u2013 which he suggested he would do at a CNN town hall in May 2023.\n* Only promises on judge appointments and congressional term limits are similar to prior campaigns\nOnly promises on judge appointments and congressional term limits are similar to prior campaigns Trump said in two February 2023 campaign videos that if 'Marxist' prosecutors refuse to charge crimes and surrender 'our cities to violent criminals,' he 'will not hesitate to send in federal law enforcement to restore peace and public safety.'\nTrump added that he would instruct the Department of Justice to open civil rights investigations into 'radical left' prosecutors' offices that engaged in racial enforcement of the law, encourage Congress to use their legal authority over Washington, DC, to restore 'law and order' and overhaul federal standards of disciplining minors to address rising crimes like carjackings.\nAddressing policies made in what Trump calls the 'Democrats' war on police,' the former president vowed in a campaign video that he would pass a 'record investment' to hire and retrain police, strengthen protections like qualified immunity, increase penalties for assaulting law enforcement officers and deploy the National Guard when local law enforcement 'refuses to act.'\nThe former president added that he would require law enforcement agencies that receive money from his funding investment or the Department of Justice to use 'proven common sense' measures such as stop-and-frisk.\nTrump has continued his attacks against member countries of NATO, a European and North American defense alliance. At a South Carolina rally last month, Trump said he would not abide by the alliance's collective-defense clause and would encourage Russia to do 'whatever the hell they want' if a member country didn't meet spending guidelines.\n'NATO was busted until I came along,' Trump said. 'I said, \u2018Everybody's gonna pay.' They said, \u2018Well, if we don't pay, are you still going to protect us?' I said, \u2018Absolutely not.' They couldn't believe the answer.'\nThe former president has also previously pledged to end the war in Ukraine, though he's offered no details on how he would do so. 'Shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,' Trump said at a New Hampshire campaign event last year, adding in another speech that it would take him 'no longer than one day' to settle the war if elected.\nTrump further addressed his strategy of stopping the 'never-ending wars' by vowing to remove 'warmongers,' 'frauds' and 'failures in the senior ranks of our government,' and replace them with national security officials who would defend America's interests. The former president added in a campaign video that he would stop lobbyists and government contractors from pushing senior military officials toward war.\nIn addition, Trump has said he would restore his 'wonderful' travel ban on individuals from several majority-Muslim countries to 'keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country' after Biden overturned the ban in 2021.\nTrump said in multiple campaign videos that he would spearhead an effort to build so-called 'Freedom Cities' to 'reopen the frontier, reignite American imagination, and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people, all hardworking families, a new shot at home ownership and in fact, the American Dream.'\nIn his plan, the federal government would charter 10 new cities on federal land, awarding them to areas with the best development proposals. The former president said in a campaign video that the Freedom Cities would bring the return of US manufacturing, economic opportunity, new industries and affordable living.\nIn the March 2023 video, Trump added that the US under a second Trump administration would lead in efforts to 'develop vertical-takeoff-and-landing vehicles for families and individuals,' not letting China lead 'this revolution in air mobility.' The former president said these airborne vehicles would change commerce and bring wealth into rural communities.\nAt the same rally in South Carolina, Trump pledged to impose 'stiff penalties on China and other trade abusers.'\n'It's called you screw us, and we screw you,' Trump said.\nUnder his proposed 'Trump Reciprocal Trade Act,' the former president said if other countries impose tariffs on the US, the country would impose 'a reciprocal, identical' tariff right back.\nIt was the same pledge Trump made in a campaign video in 2023: to impose the same tariffs that other countries may impose on the US on those countries. The goal, the former president said then, is to get other countries to drop their tariffs.\nAs part of a larger strategy to bring jobs back into the US, Trump also said he would implement his so-called 'America First' trade agenda if elected. By setting universal baseline tariffs on a majority of foreign goods, the former president said Americans would see taxes decrease as tariffs increase. His proposal also includes a four-year plan to phase out all Chinese imports of essential goods, as well as stopping China from buying up America and stopping the investment of US companies in China.\nTrump also said in February that he would consider imposing a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports if he's reelected.\nThe former president has particularly focused on China, vowing in a January 2023 campaign video to restrict Chinese ownership of US infrastructure such as energy, technology, telecommunications and natural resources. Trump also said he would force the Chinese to sell current holdings that may put national security at risk. 'Economic security is national security,' he said.\n``","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/trump-promises-card.jpg?c=original","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnn","_score":5.5481977,"_id":"1b3690ae870335e5dc405a73a35e33d6"},{"title":"The five biggest book publishers in the US are suing Iowa over its book ban law","author":"Nicole Chavez","published_date":"2024-04-18 21:41:49","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/18/us/publishers-fight-iowa-book-bans-reaj","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Several publishing houses joined bestselling authors and Penguin Random House this week in a federal lawsuit challenging an Iowa state law that bans certain books in schools and limits teachings on\u2026","summary":"Several publishing houses joined bestselling authors and Penguin Random House this week in a federal lawsuit challenging an Iowa state law that bans certain books in schools and limits teachings on sexual orientation and gender identity.\nHachette Book Group, HarperCollins Publishers, Macmillan Publishers and Simon & Schuster, all members of the 'Big Five' publishers in the US, announced they will join a lawsuit originally filed in November.

In video from WCBS, pro-Palestinian protesters could be seen clashing with police and some had lit small fires. One woman could be seen being led away in handcuffs.\nFour people were arrested overnight during protests at Columbia, the NYPD said. Police did not specify what charges were filed and gave no additional details about the arrests.\nDuring Wednesday's protests, Columbia closed the gates to campus, only allowing individuals with Columbia IDs to enter. Many of the pro-Palestinian protesters affiliated with Columbia camped on the campus overnight.\nShafik wrote a letter to the NYPD on Thursday asking for the department's help to 'remove these individuals.'\n'The actions of these individuals are in violation of University rules and policies,' the president wrote. 'The University provided multiple notices and warnings and informed the encampment participants that they must disperse or face immediate discipline.'\nThe president told students she authorized the NYPD to break up the encampment, according to an email obtained by CNN. Shafik wrote she authorized the move 'out of an abundance of concern for the safety of Columbia's campus.'\n'I took this extraordinary step because these are extraordinary circumstances,' Shafik wrote. 'The individuals who established the encampment violated a long list of rules and policies.'\nNYPD officers used bullhorns to tell protesters they would be arrested unless they dispersed immediately. Large crowds of Columbia students on the perimeter chanted, 'Shame on you' and, 'The students united will never be defeated.'\nShortly after 2 p.m., a group of at least 200 protesters moved to an area about two blocks away from the school campus near the NYPD staging site and police said they would soon disperse the crowd, CNN witnessed. Officers in helmets, carrying batons, were seen lining up in the street surrounding the group.\nIn the past, the office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has declined to prosecute or deferred prosecution cases where large numbers of people were arrested as part of civil disobedience.\nVideo footage online appears to show NYPD officers clashing with protesters outside the university on Thursday morning. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority Thursday posted a message on social media warning riders buses in the area are delayed because of a protest at the university.\nIsra Hirsi, the daughter of Rep. Ilhan Omar, was among those arrested Thursday, a police official told CNN. The official said Hirsi is being processed and will likely receive a summons for a criminal trespass charge then be released from custody.\nHirsi, an organizer with Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine, said earlier Thursday she and two other students at Barnard College \u2013 located across the street from Columbia University \u2013 were suspended for participating in pro-Palestinian protests.\nIn a statement on X, Hirsi said she has 'never been reprimanded or received any disciplinary warnings' in her three years at the college.\n'I just received notice that I am 1 of 3 students suspended for standing in solidarity with Palestinians facing a genocide,' Hirsi said.\nBarnard is an official college of Columbia University, but also an independently incorporated educational institution.\nWhen asked about the suspensions, a Barnard College spokesperson said the college 'does not provide information about confidential student conduct proceedings,' and referred CNN to a message sent to the college community.\nShafik and the university have been criticized for how their officials have handled antisemitic, Islamophobic and anti-Arab harassment incidents on campus.\nDuring the the House Committee on Education and the Workforce hearing, Shafik said the core of the university's mission is to 'ensure that all members of our community may engage in our cherished traditions of free expression and open debate,' quoting from the school's rules of university conduct.\n'We believe that Columbia's role is not to shield individuals from positions that they find unwelcome, but instead to create an environment where different viewpoints can be tested and challenged,' Shafik added. However, she acknowledged that freedom of speech has been used to justify chants and language that has made students feel unsafe.\nLast fall, a Columbia student who was hanging posters on campus in support of Israel was assaulted. Days later, a mobile 'doxxing' billboard drove outside the entrance of Columbia displaying the names and faces of students who a conservative nonprofit said were linked to a statement blaming Israel for the Hamas terror attack.\nUniversity leaders had issued a statement condemning 'disturbing antisemitic and Islamophobic acts, including intimidation and outright violence.'\nThe university has also faced criticism for hiring a professor who allegedly expressed support for Hamas on social media following the October 7 terror attack on Israel. That professor has been fired, Shafik said Wednesday.\nColumbia did not immediately respond to a request for comment on when the professor's termination takes effect.\nCNN's Matt Egan and Ramishah Maruf contributed to this report.\nCNN's Matt Egan and Ramishah Maruf contributed to this report.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Shimon Prokupecz,John Miller,Emma Tucker","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/h-16195341.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":5.088705,"_id":"ac41b3f1abb700137a5bd29b5e8e5566"},{"title":"China sees foreign threats \u2018everywhere' as powerful spy agency takes center stage","author":"Nectar Gan","published_date":"2024-04-22 00:38:44","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/21/china/china-spy-agency-public-profile-intl-hnk","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Under leader Xi Jinping, China's secretive Ministry of State Security has morphed from a shadowy organization into a highly visible presence in public life.","summary":"Editor's Note: Sign up for CNN's Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country's rise and how it impacts the world.\nSign up for CNN's Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country's rise and how it impacts the world. Hong Kong CNN \u2014\nHong Kong CNN \u2014 In a slick video marking the National Security Education Day, China's top spy agency has a stern message for Chinese people: foreign spies are everywhere.\nAs ominous music plays, a broad-faced, beady-eyed man disguises himself as a street fashion photographer, a lab technician, a businessman and a food delivery driver \u2013 he even sets up an online honey trap \u2013 to glean sensitive state secrets in various places and industries.\n'In the sea of people, you may have never noticed him. His identity is changeable and his whereabouts are hard to find,' a narrator says. 'They are everywhere, cunning\u2026 and sneaky, and they may be right here in our lives.'\nEventually, Chinese police catch the spy in a dramatic ambush after state security authorities receive multiple tip-offs from the public.\n'They can disguise as anyone. But among the crowds you and I together are protecting national security,' the narrator concludes. 'We 1.4 billion people are 1.4 billion lines of defense.'\nThe three-minute video is the latest propaganda push by China's powerful civilian spy agency, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), to mentally arm the Chinese public against what it sees as the growing threat of foreign espionage.\nUnder Xi Jinping, China's most authoritarian leader in decades, the country's notoriously secretive spy agency has drastically raised its public profile and broadened its remit.\nFrom a shadowy organization without any discernable public face, the MSS has been transformed into a highly visible presence in public life.\nIn Chinese cities, posters and slogans promoting national security are now a common sight on sidewalks, subway trains, campuses and billboards. On social media, the ministry commands a massive following with near-daily commentaries, short videos or even comic strips sounding the alarm about supposedly ubiquitous threats to the country.\nAccording to the MSS, foreign spies are omnipresent and infiltrating everything \u2013 from mapping apps to weather stations. The ministry has also posted details of what it claims are espionage activities carried out by American and British spy agencies, and detailed how Chinese nationals studying or working abroad have allegedly been recruited by the CIA.\nLast week, as part of a documentary to mark National Security Education Day, the MSS revealed that a Chinese scientist convicted of selling state secrets to a foreign intelligence agency was executed in 2016. The documentary did not explicitly mention which country, but its images show an American flag and the US Capitol building.\nThe MSS' transformation is part of Xi's sweeping pivot to ramp up national security in the face of heightened geopolitical tensions and mounting domestic challenges.\nAs US-China relations fray, the MSS has undertaken significant efforts to provide guidance to other government agencies and broader society, said Xuezhi Guo, a professor of political science at Guilford College in the US.\n'These endeavors aim to foster anti-espionage awareness and enhance security measures in light of the evolving landscape of espionage threats,' he said. 'The goal is to empower Chinese citizens and entities with the knowledge and skills required to bolster their vigilance and preempt espionage activities effectively.'\nThe emphasis on external threats also helps Beijing deflect criticism at home over its own policies by shifting blame onto 'foreign forces' \u2013 a playbook the Chinese government has repeatedly applied during periods of public discontent, most recently over protests in late 2022 against Xi's hardline measures to prevent Covid.\nAnd the spy agency's extending reach is a sign of the increasing securitization of Chinese life and society under Xi, where 'an incredibly wide array of issues can be viewed as threats to national security,' said Sheena Chestnut Greitens, director of the Asia Policy Program at the University of Texas at Austin.\nThe MSS was born out of a reassessment of China's national security needs in the early 1980s, as the country emerged from decades of political upheaval and self-imposed isolation under Chairman Mao Zedong to embrace market reforms and open up to the world.\nIt was founded in 1983 by merging an intelligence department of the ruling Chinese Communist Party and a counterespionage unit in the police force. It oversees intelligence and counterintelligence both within China and overseas, with provincial and municipal branches extending throughout the country.\nIt is often likened to a combined CIA and FBI, though the MSS long operated under a heavier veil of secrecy, without an official website or any publicly listed contacts or spokesperson.\nBut China's spy agency has gradually stepped out of the shadows as Xi makes national security a key priority.\nIn 2015, the MSS established its first public point of contact by setting up a hotline and a website to encourage people to report any suspected threats to state security. In the same year, China designated April 15 as National Security Education Day.\nAnd in 2020, the ministry started to churn out promotional materials \u2013 from posters to animations \u2013 under a dedicated office named the National Security Propaganda Studio.\nThe following year, the MSS gave an unprecedented written Q&A to state media, introducing its role and recruitment channels to the public for the first time. Later in the year, an official in charge of the spy agency's educational and propaganda work showed up on the prime-time news program of state broadcaster CCTV \u2013 a rare appearance that was noted by state media.\nThe most drastic move came last August when the agency made its social media debut: it launched an official account on WeChat, China's most popular social app, with a rallying call for 'all members of society' to join its fight against foreign infiltration. Its posts regularly rack up hundreds of thousands of views and are widely shared by state media outlets.\nAnd this year, the ministry dialed up its multimedia activity. In January, it launched a comic strip series called 'Shenyin Special Investigation Squad,' featuring a team of five secret police officers hunting down foreign spies \u2013 plots it said were inspired by real-life counterespionage operations.\nIn one installment, a group of foreign-looking characters are tracked by the secret police as they try to extract strategic rare earth metals under the guise of survey work for real estate development; in another, an undercover MSS agent gets a job at a consulting firm to investigate its suspicious deeds, including its connections with experts in key sensitive fields.\n'MSS' decision to establish a social media presence is an anomaly given its traditionally low profile,' said Greitens at the University of Texas, who has studied China's security apparatus.\nOne reason for the change may be the minister of state security, Chen Yixin, who was appointed in late 2022, according to Greitens.\nChen is widely seen as a trusted aide of Xi, having served under him for years when Xi was a provincial official in Zhejiang province. And he has a track record of using social media to drive home the official message.\n'Chen has been saying for years that new media are important to guide public opinion on the party's political-legal and national security work. So, part of this appears to be him putting his personal stamp on the Ministry's work,' Greitens said.\nIn addition, China's National Security Commission \u2013 a powerful body headed by Xi \u2013 approved a document on enhancing public education around national security work last May, which 'seems to provide high-level cover for MSS' course of action here,' she added.\nThe MSS's warnings appear aimed at a wide variety of targets.\nIn one post from last year, the agency said it had discovered hundreds of 'illegal' weather stations that were spying for foreign countries, including around sensitive sites such as military bases, defense companies' property and major grain-producing regions.\nIn another, the agency warned against commentaries that seek to 'denigrate' the Chinese economy through 'false narratives' that promote China's decline \u2013 calling such criticism an attempt to attack its socialist system and 'strategically contain and suppress China.'\n'Things that might have previously been considered purely scientific or purely in the realm of business and economics now have this securitized layer to them,' Greitens said. 'Whether it's the collection of data, or market research by a foreign consulting firm.'\nLast May, CCTV reported state security authorities had raided several offices of Capvision, an international consultancy firm with headquarters in Shanghai and New York. It came after authorities raided the Beijing office of US firm Mintz Group, which specializes in corporate due diligence, while detaining five of its local staff, and questioned employees at the Shanghai branch of American consultancy firm Bain.\nThe broad scope of threats on the MSS' radar is closely linked to Xi's 'comprehensive national security concept,' an overarching framework that includes more than 20 components to state security. It covers everything from politics, economy, defense, culture and ecology to cyberspace, big data and artificial intelligence, and extends from the deep sea and the polar regions to space.\nChina has also broadened its already sweeping counterespionage law, casting a wider net over what the state deems as potential acts of spying.\nIt now encompasses 'a much broader range of activities, including what some in the foreign business community perceive as ordinary, everyday business behaviors,' said Guo at Guilford College. 'This expansion also extends to the state's authority to investigate and seize electronic devices, computers, and digital assets, raising heightened concerns about cybersecurity.'\nChina's heightened focus on national security stems not only from what it sees as a deteriorating international environment \u2013 especially its great-power rivalry with the US, but also concerns about the slowing Chinese economy. The property crisis and unpaid salaries have already sparked sporadic protests, and a worsening economic downturn could risk triggering further domestic unrest.\nThrough the emphasis on national security, Guo said, Xi strategically redirects part of the criticism and blame for his policy failures onto external forces.\nThe MSS' propaganda and education campaigns \u2013 as well as its generous cash rewards for national security tip-offs \u2013 have spurred enthusiasm online for catching foreign spies.\nOn Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, influencers have rushed to produce short videos teaching their followers how to identify spies. In the comment sections, users shared their own experiences of reporting or encountering a suspected spy.\nOn Xiaohongshu, China's Instagram-like platform, a young woman caused a stir last year after she called the MSS' hotline to report her boyfriend as a suspected spy. The blogger had been encouraged to do so by commentators after she said in an earlier post that her boyfriend could not remember the exact lyrics and tunes of China's national anthem. 'Ladies, is it normal if your boyfriend can't sing the national anthem?' she asked in the post.\nGreitens noted that past examples from other countries have shown over-encouraging or incentivizing citizens to report on potential security threats can backfire.\n'The tendency is to over-report,' Greitens said. 'What happens then is you can actually get lots of false positives in a system that can end up having a really corrosive long-term effect \u2026 the potential effects for Chinese citizens and foreign businesses could really start to accumulate quickly.'\nThe relentless warnings from the MSS and its expanding powers have already raised alarms in the international business community, at a time when the Chinese government is trying to woo foreign investment to help revitalize a slowing economy.\nLast month, a day after Xi hosted a group of American executives in Beijing and less than a week after the annual China Development Forum attended by about 100 global CEOs, the MSS released a dramatic video warning the public to stay vigilant against foreign consultancy firms working as a cover for foreign intelligence services.\nThe six-minute 'micro movie,' which the agency says is based on real events, shows a consultancy working on behalf of an unidentified foreign spy agency to steal commercial secrets from a Chinese company seeking to go public abroad \u2013 and gleaning sensitive information about government industrial subsidies and the Chinese air force.\nExperts say such videos risk undermining Beijing's central message that China is trying to lower barriers for foreign business and investment.\n'This is indicative of the conflicting messages coming from the top, as well as an unreasonable overemphasis on national security issues that is driving foreign investors away,' said James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based partner at American law firm Perkins Coie LLP.\n'The ambiguity of the laws and lack of judicial oversight to prevent the security agencies from overreaching, creates much uncertainty for foreign companies.'\nFollowing China's crackdown on the consulting industry, most foreign consultancies have adjusted to the new environment, with some moving potentially controversial due-diligence or fact-finding work outside of mainland China, Zimmerman said.\n'Some that remain in China are getting called in for \u2018tea,'' he added, referring to a euphemism for police questioning. 'Not because they are under investigation, but to have a chilling effect and as a reminder that they, too are being watched by the security agencies.'\nSince starting his unprecedented third term in power in late 2022, Xi has repeatedly urged officials to balance development and security, calling security 'the foundation of development.' But the highly visible warnings and raids by the MSS have fueled concerns among foreign businesses that, should the two appear to conflict, security will take precedence.\nThe MSS is 'driven more by politics than reality or good common sense,' Zimmerman said. 'But this is China with Xi Jinping characteristics.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Nectar Gan","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/mss-short-video-about-foreign-spies-copy.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":5.0186276,"_id":"f600597b7018137340bfdfabec2e911b"},{"title":"Opinion: To combat antisemitism, start by following the law","author":"David Schizer","published_date":"2024-04-17 20:21:22","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/17/opinions/israel-gaza-columbia-antisemitism-hearing-schizer","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"For those who are not motivated by principle to stop this antisemitic misconduct, I have a simple message for you: You have to do it anyway because you need to follow the law, writes David Schizer.","summary":"Editor's Note: David Schizer is dean emeritus and Harvey R. Miller Professor of Law and Economics at Columbia Law School, co-chair of Columbia University's Task Force on Antisemitism and author of 'How to Save the World in Six (Not So Easy) Steps: Bringing Out the Best in Nonprofits.'\nDavid Schizer is dean emeritus and Harvey R. Miller Professor of Law and Economics at Columbia Law School, co-chair of Columbia University's Task Force on Antisemitism and author of 'How to Save the World in Six (Not So Easy) Steps: Bringing Out the Best in Nonprofits.' CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 In 26 years as a faculty member at Columbia University, I have never seen the ugly face of antisemitism expose itself as it has this year. Universities must now reckon with how hate has manifested in environments dedicated to education and the exchange of ideas. As a co-chair of the university's task force on antisemitism, I welcomed the opportunity to share what my university has learned as one of the witnesses at Wednesday's congressional hearing on antisemitism at Columbia.\nWe are making progress in reversing the antisemitic tide, but there is still more to do. Indeed, we saw the vitriol on display just last month, when anti-Zionist students hosted online an unauthorized speaker who made the outrageous statement that 'there is nothing wrong with \u2026 being a fighter in Hamas.' Never mind that the US and European Union have designated Hamas a terrorist organization. Is there really 'nothing wrong' with the mass rape, murder and abduction of Israeli civilians the group carried out on October 7?\nThere have also been direct attacks on students. In the fall, one of my students who wears a kippah told me he was approached by a fellow student who said, 'F\u2013k the Jews.' Another told me of being spat upon at a protest. A student wearing a shirt with an Israeli flag was surrounded by protesters, pinned against a wall and told to 'keep f\u2013king running' when he broke free.\nMany Jewish and Israeli students have also felt unwelcome in student groups having nothing to do with the Middle East. Why should they have to disavow Zionism to be in a dance group or an affinity group for LGBTQ students? This sort of pressure \u2013 signaling that Jews are accepted only if they reject a core part of their religion and identity \u2013 sounds like old-fashioned bigotry from long ago. It is simply unacceptable.\nAt the same time, I have been inspired to see many non-Jewish Columbia students, professors and administrators going the extra mile to champion a welcoming environment for Jews, Israelis and everyone else. It was very moving when the leader of the law school's student senate posted a statement in October urging that 'every single student in our law school deserves to feel safe and know that they belong.'\nThis is a central value of our university. Indeed, it is a moral imperative. But unfortunately, some faculty, staff and students have fanned the flames. Others have tried to stay out of what they consider a mere political disagreement about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict even when this mistreatment of Jews and Israelis rises to the level of harassment and discrimination.\nFor those who are not motivated by principle to stop this misconduct, I have a simple message for you: You have to do it anyway because you need to follow the law. By following four legal principles, universities can prevent discrimination against Jews and others while also protecting free speech and academic freedom.\nFree speech is not a free lunch. Everyone must have the right to express their views, regardless of their viewpoint. State universities are obligated to follow the First Amendment, while private universities like Columbia typically choose to follow it. But under these free speech principles, people are not free to express themselves at any place, at any time and in a way that limits others from expressing their views or from exercising their rights as students to engage in the university's main mission of teaching, learning and research.\nFree speech is not a free lunch.

But under these free speech principles, people are not free to express themselves at any place, at any time and in a way that limits others from expressing their views or from exercising their rights as students to engage in the university's main mission of teaching, learning and research. So although protests are important, they cannot disrupt classes or other activities. When protests were regularly held inside one of the schools at Columbia, a student I know had to endure heckling for her pro-Israel views as she walked through them just to get to class. Likewise, pro-Palestinian protesters made it harder to hear the speakers \u2013 at an event promoting constructive conversations about the war in Gaza, no less!\nTo protect everyone's right to speak and learn, Columbia recently adopted a 'speakers' corner' approach, which allows protests in designated locations but bans them in academic buildings, dorms, libraries and dining halls. Violators first get a warning that will not remain on their record, and then the penalties become more severe.\nThou shall not discriminate. Under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, universities cannot tolerate a hostile learning and work environment for Jews, Israelis or any other protected class. This rule is not supposed to shield students from opinions they do not share \u2013 that would impede the university's educational mission \u2013 but it should protect them from ethnic slurs (like 'F\u2013k the Jews'), as well as stereotyping and calls to violence.\nThou shall not discriminate.

Unfortunately, some Columbia faculty and students asserted that all veterans of the Israel military are dangerous and should be barred from campus. Since most Israelis are required to serve in the military, this blatant stereotyping slings mud at nearly all Israeli students, faculty and staff.\nCalls for violence against a protected class are also problematic, although deciding what actually is a call for violence can be hard. 'Gas the Jews' (a chant that reportedly was heard at another university) clearly is, while 'free Palestine' clearly is not. But what about 'globalize the intifada' or 'from the river to the sea'? Many Jewish students hear these chants as calls for violence, while many who use them say they are not.\nactually is a call for violence can be hard.

Many Jewish students hear these chants as calls for violence, while many who use them say they are not. Under federal antidiscrimination rules, the answer can turn on whether the focus is on the audience's reaction or the speaker's intent . So which is it? In recent years, as the task force noted in our report, universities have often deferred to the audience, for instance, when Black, female or transgender students registered concerns in discussions of, for instance, policing, affirmative action, sexual assault and transgender rights. In other words, language is considered a call for violence when those audiences reasonably say that they hear it that way.\naudience's reaction or the speaker's intent . So which is it?

While there are policy justifications for either approach \u2013 that is, to prioritize either impact or intent \u2013 inconsistency is not justifiable. Universities cannot use one approach for Jews and another for other identity groups.\nBe consistent. Indeed, Title VI does not just ban discriminatory harassment and a hostile environment; it also bans inconsistent treatment of different identity groups. The statute does not authorize an 'oppression Olympics,' in which identity groups jockey for a favored position. The statute guarantees them the same rights.\nBe consistent. Indeed, Title VI does not just ban discriminatory harassment and a hostile environment; it also bans inconsistent treatment of different identity groups. The statute does not authorize an 'oppression Olympics,' in which identity groups jockey for a favored position. The statute guarantees them the same rights. This principle is also why it's problematic to add a definition of antisemitism to a university's antidiscrimination rules and then consider whether acts fit that definition or not. Some actually have criticized our task force for not doing this, but it would have been a legal misstep. Title VI does not ban 'antisemitism,' but a hostile environment and discriminatory harassment, concepts that apply to all protected classes. Developing bespoke versions just for Jews \u2013 for instance, establishing an act as hostile only when it violates a particular definition of antisemitism \u2013 isn't acceptable.\nRules are not made to be broken. To protect speech and stop discrimination, universities need more than just the right words on a page. Their rules need to be enforced. Unfortunately, Columbia initially fell short in this effort after October 7.\nRules are not made to be broken. To protect speech and stop discrimination, universities need more than just the right words on a page. Their rules need to be enforced. Unfortunately, Columbia initially fell short in this effort after October 7. For example, at first the staff charged with managing protests did not try to stop ones that were not authorized. Instead, the goal was just to avoid escalation. This hands-off approach made more sense in the past when protests targeted university administrators. When I was a law school dean years ago, I knew that being the target of protests came with the job. But protests this year have been different, affecting not just administrators but other students, who are in a very different position.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook So the response to unauthorized protests has become more proactive. Students are told that they are breaking the rules and given a chance to stop. If they don't, their names are taken and disciplinary action is initiated.\nOur task force has also recommended an easier process for filing complaints about rule violations, additional time to investigate them and the release of aggregate information about our disciplinary processes (to show that the university is taking infractions seriously). The university has worked to implement these and other ideas.\nOf course, the mission of a university is not merely enforcing rules but providing an education. Over time, opening minds with facts and analysis is the best defense against antisemitism and other bigotry. But to allow this educational process to flourish, we need to build it on a foundation of laws that are respected and enforced.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Opinion David Schizer,David Schizer","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap24108675625277.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":4.980059,"_id":"beb9ef6deccde8085cd4a338e24c0e9e"},{"title":"Eric Schmidt Fast Facts","author":"Editorial Research","published_date":"2024-04-17 18:30:07","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2013/05/14/us/eric-schmidt-fast-facts/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Read CNN's Fast Facts about Eric Schmidt and learn more about the former CEO of Google and executive chairman of Alphabet.","summary":"Here is a look at the life of Eric Schmidt, former executive chairman of Alphabet, the parent company of Google.\nBirth date: April 27, 1955\nBirth date: April 27, 1955 Birth place: Washington, DC\nBirth place: Washington, DC Birth name: Eric Emerson Schmidt\nBirth name: Eric Emerson Schmidt Father: Wilson Schmidt, a professor\nFather: Wilson Schmidt, a professor Mother: Ellie Schmidt\nMother: Ellie Schmidt Marriage: Wendy Boyle (1980-present)\nMarriage: Wendy Boyle (1980-present) Children: Sophie and Alison\nChildren: Sophie and Alison Education: Princeton University, B.S., 1976; University of California, Berkeley, M.S, 1979 and Ph.D., 1982\nEducation: Princeton University, B.S., 1976; University of California, Berkeley, M.S, 1979 and Ph.D., 1982 Was a member of President Barack Obama's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.\nServes on the boards of many organizations, including the Broad Institute and the board of trustees at the Mayo Clinic.\n1983-1997 - Works for Sun Microsystems, Inc.\n1983-1997 - Works for Sun Microsystems, Inc.

Christine Cornell/Pool/Reuters After being dark on Wednesday \u2013 as is expected for the duration of the expected six-week trial \u2013 the court will resume jury selection today with a new panel of 96 prospective jurors, looking for the remaining five jurors along with six alternates.\nHere are the takeaways from day 2 of the Trump hush money trial:\nWe have (more than half) a jury: So far four men and three women have been selected to serve on the jury. A man originally from Ireland who works in sales in New York City was appointed as the jury foreperson, who essentially serves as the panel spokesperson. Five of the seven have a college degree or higher education. Two men on the panel are lawyers.

The woman was the only one of the 18 jurors questioned who said she wasn't aware of the other charges. None of them shared particularly strong views about Trump or politics. Trump's lawyers scrutinize jurors' social media: Trump's side asked the judge to remove five jurors for cause, pointing to alleged anti-Trump social media posts and trying to argue that the jurors were unfairly biased against the former president. When the former president's attorney Todd Blanche was questioning the jurors, he asked them one-by-one what they thought of Trump, outside of the case. He then tried to argue before the judge that many of the jurors' answers that they didn't have an opinion of Trump did not align with their social media. Judge Juan Merchan was generally skeptical, but he did agree on two counts that the jurors should be struck. As for the three jurors Merchan did not strike: Trump's side used its peremptory challenges to remove all of them anyway. After Tuesday, both Trump's team and the district attorney's office have four peremptory challenges remaining each.\nTrump's lawyers scrutinize jurors' social media: Trump's side asked the judge to remove five jurors for cause, pointing to alleged anti-Trump social media posts and trying to argue that the jurors were unfairly biased against the former president.

'It pushes up funding costs in the rest of the world, thereby exacerbating existing fragilities and risks.'\nIt's the second time this week the IMF has fired a shot across the bows of the US government. On Tuesday, it said public spending and borrowing was contributing to an overheating of the US economy, making it harder for the Federal Reserve to defeat inflation.\nHigher interest rates make it more costly for households and businesses to service their loans, which can lead to defaults that cause losses at banks and other lenders, increasing financial instability.\nfinancial instability.

On Tuesday, Treasury yields touched fresh highs for the year after Fed chair Jerome Powell signaled that official interest rates could stay high for a while yet because of persistent inflation in the United States.\nUS consumer prices have been propped up by debt-fueled government spending \u2014 including pandemic stimulus \u2014 which has boosted households' spending power and turbocharged economic growth.\nLoose US fiscal policy, in addition to increasing the country's already hefty debt burden, could make 'the last mile' of getting inflation back down to the Fed's target harder to achieve, the IMF said.\nthe IMF said. The Washington-based agency is also worried that, if US inflation stays high, it could dash investors' hopes for interest rate cuts, leading to a selloff of financial assets, including stocks and government bonds around the world.

A resulting fall in the price of bonds would raise their yields. 'Under this scenario, financial conditions would broadly tighten,' Tobias Adrian, director of the IMF's monetary and capital markets department, wrote Tuesday in a blog accompanying the agency's Global Financial Stability Report. 'Globally, borrowers would find it harder to service debt, given higher bond yields,' he added.\nAccording to Gaspar, the problem could be especially acute in low-income countries, where constraints on public finances are 'particularly severe.' 'High and volatile interest rates make the situation worse,' he said.\nThere are risks for the United States too. According to the IMF, investors are demanding higher returns to hold US Treasuries, reflecting their concerns over sustained inflation, the uncertain future path of monetary policy and additional debt issuance in the world's biggest economy.\n'The risk premium on (US) government debt has increased in recent times and may remain high in a context in which debt levels are elevated,' the agency's chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters Tuesday.\nThat means that even if the Fed cuts interest rates later this year \u2014 the IMF's central scenario \u2014 US government funding costs may not fall by the same margin, he added.\nThat would place further pressure on the government's finances, leaving less money for public services or for absorbing future adverse shocks to the economy, such as financial meltdowns, pandemics or wars.\nThe US government's interest costs on a common measure soared to $659 billion in fiscal year 2023, which ended on September 30, according to the Treasury Department. That's nearly double what it was in fiscal year 2020.\nAnd according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-profit, in fiscal year 2023, the government spent more to service its debt than it did on each of housing, transport and higher education.\nin fiscal year 2023, the government spent more to service its debt than it did on each of housing, transport and higher education.

Sara Kennedy recalled being told. 'Liver, heart. All of your major organs. They were gone.'\n'He had nothing,' said Kennedy's brother, Marvin.\nAnother inmate suffered a similar fate. Arthur Stapler was 85 when he died five months after Kennedy Jr. at the Brookwood Baptist Medical Center in Birmingham. He had been housed at Hamilton Aged and Infirmed Center, which is also run by the Alabama Department of Corrections.\n'It's like a horror movie that I can't wake up from,' said Stapler's son, Billy, who learned about the missing organs after hiring a private pathologist to perform an autopsy on the body.\nIt was only after contacting the University of Alabama at Birmingham \u2013 which is among the providers that conducts autopsies for the prison system \u2013 that Stapler's family received what they were told were his brain and heart in plastic viscera bags. The lungs and some other internal organs came back in pieces, but not all were returned.\nWith more than 26,000 inmates, Alabama's severely overcrowded and understaffed prisons are the target of a US Justice Department lawsuit that alleges the state not only fails to prevent violence and sexual abuse behind bars but does not protect inmates from excessive force by prison staff or provide safe conditions.\nAlabama's men's prisons are also the country's deadliest, with a homicide rate in 2019 more than seven times higher than the national average, according to a report by the non-profit Equal Justice Initiative.\nAnd the state's mass incarceration nightmare does not appear to end with death.\nThe state Department of Corrections and the University of Alabama at Birmingham now face disturbing allegations from the families of five inmates whose organs were removed and reportedly kept without consent, according to lawsuits filed last week in Montgomery County Circuit Court. A lawyer for the families alleged the organs were retained for teaching purposes.\n'It's the wild, wild west. There's no governance,' Lauren Brinkley-Rubinstein, an associate professor at the Duke University School of Medicine and an expert on prison standards, said of the allegations involving the handling of inmate organs in the prison system.\n'It's like, the provision of health care. No standards. What that health care should look like, who has bodily autonomy and who doesn't, and who, when someone dies, acts as next of kin to people who are incarcerated \u2013 all those things are just undefined. There's no standard and there's no oversight.'\nThe Alabama Department of Corrections is the largest law enforcement agency in the state, with 28 facilities and nearly 2,000 officers.\nThe University of Alabama at Birmingham Heersink School of Medicine bills itself as one of the nation's top academic medical centers for research, education and clinical care. It houses one of America's largest academic hospitals.\nUnder an agreement between two state institutions with divergent missions, UAB said it conducts autopsies for the corrections department, which is 'responsible for obtaining proper authorizations from the appropriate legal representative of the deceased.'\n'The authorization forms not only provide permission for the autopsy, but also specifically include consent for the removal of organs or tissues for diagnostic or other testing including final disposition,' said UAB in a statement, adding that privacy laws prevented comment on specific autopsies.\nA case of finger-pointing has broken out between the university and the corrections department on the issue of who ultimately authorizes autopsies.\nUAB also said it doesn't comment 'on pending or threatened litigation,' but it complies with laws governing autopsies and is responding to 'incorrect and misleading assertions' about the procedures it performs for the corrections department.\n'UAB only conducts autopsies after obtaining consent or authorization from the appropriate state official,' the statement said.\nThe Alabama Department of Corrections also declined comment on pending litigation but said it does not authorize or perform autopsies. UAB has maintained that corrections authorizes inmate autopsies.\n'Once an inmate dies, the body is transported to the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences or (the University of Alabama at Birmingham) for autopsy, depending on several factors, including but not limited to region and whether the death is unlawful, suspicious, or unnatural,' the corrections department said in a statement.\nBirmingham attorney Lauren Faraino said the families she represents in the five suits insisted to her that none of the inmates were organ donors, nor were their families asked for authorization to retain the organs. At least two other lawsuits were being prepared, she said.\nInstead, the attorney said, UAB's own autopsy authorization form \u2013 which CNN has obtained \u2013 empowers a prison warden to give consent 'without limitations' for the autopsy as well as the final disposition of an inmate's organs. She said that means UAB gets to keep and dispose of the organs as it sees fit unless told otherwise.\nUnder an autopsy agreement between corrections and the UAB Board of Trustees dating to around 2005, the warden signs off as the 'legally designated representative and therefore am legally entitled to grant permission for the completion of an autopsy and the removal of organs or tissues for further study on said inmate.'\n'l do, therefore, give my permission for the performance of an autopsy including the removal of organs or tissues from said inmate for diagnostic or other testing, including final disposition thereof,' reads the autopsy authorization form.\nThe lawsuits cite a 2017 UAB Division of Autopsy publication that said 23% of the division's yearly income from 2006 to 2015 derived from corrections department autopsies. The corrections department pays UAB $2,200 per autopsy and $100 per toxicology test, according to the suits.\nIn 2023, Alabama prisons reported a record high 325 deaths, according to the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law & Justice, a non-profit criminal justice reform advocacy group.\nThe law center reported 1,045 deaths in state prisons from April 2019 \u2013 when the DOJ released a report on prison conditions \u2013 through the end of last year, citing Alabama Department of Corrections figures and Appleseed data.\n'Defendants' appalling misconduct is nothing short of grave robbery and mutilation,' the lawsuits said. The state institutions are accused of fraud, conspiracy, negligence, unauthorized donations of body parts, unjust enrichment, failing to notify next of kin when retaining organs and other counts.\nAn Alabama law passed in 2021 requires medical examiners to notify next-of-kin if they will retain a deceased person's organs to determine identification or the cause or manner of death. They also need the approval of next-of-kin to keep organs for research or other purposes.\nA bill now making its way through the state legislature would make a violation of that law a Class C felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\n'If organs are being removed for donation for medical education, research or any other purpose without appropriate authorization that is both a legal failing and a moral failing,' said Brendan Parent, a lawyer and director of the transplant ethics and policy research program at NYU Langone.\n'There's no reason to believe that a warden of a prison has ownership or property rights to a body just because the person was incarcerated. And so the laws that exist protecting the family's right to represent the donation wishes, and to represent the burial wishes or laying to rest wishes, those remain.'\nIn its statement, UAB insisted it 'does not harvest organs from bodies of inmates for research.' Its pathology program is accredited by the College of American Pathologists and staffed by physicians certified by the American Board of Pathology, UAB said.\n'The dead are voiceless. And so that creates both a major sort of gap in bringing these stories to light,' Parent said.\n'It's incredibly sad but makes sense that there isn't nearly enough oversight or attention to this because of the vulnerability and lack of representation of the rights of these individuals.'\nA 2019 report by the Justice Department and the Alabama US Attorney's offices did not mention issues with missing organs but said the state corrections department did not have a reliable system of tracking in-custody deaths.\nFederal investigators identified at least 30 deaths that were not disclosed to the Justice Department. The report also found Alabama Department of Corrections did not maintain a centralized repository for all autopsies and did not have a way to identify patterns in causes of death.\nA group of UAB medical students questioned the ethics of the school's retention of some inmate organs without consent as far back as 2018, a year before the scathing federal report on overall prison conditions.\nIn a letter to the UAB hospital ethics committee and medical school administrators in July 2018, a group of medical students wrote to 'express our concern regarding the consent process for use of organs from incarcerated individuals in our preclinical education.'\n'Our concern is not with the practice of autopsy, but with the process of consent for the retention and use of tissue samples,' the medical students wrote in the letter.\n'Wardens can limit the autopsy to a strict determination of cause of death, with no tissues retained for research or education. However, by the Division of Autopsy director's assessment, wardens always sign \u2018no limitations' on the form that initiates the request for autopsy. If our understanding is correct, neither the patient, nor their family, has consented to or been directly informed of the retention of tissues for teaching, education, or research.'\nFaraino called the letter and other records of meetings with school officials 'concrete evidence that the students are using some of these organs for training in medical school.'\n'We can all agree that we want doctors who are trained and who have access to these organs to perfect their craft,' Faraino said. 'What we don't want is for doctors and pathologists to be mining bodies without family permission.'\nTwo of those UAB medical students spoke with CNN, saying pathology lab instructors acknowledged that many teaching samples came from inmates, particularly because of the more dramatic pathology of the prisoners. The students asked not to be named for fear of repercussions to their careers.\n'It's plainly and obviously wrong,' one student said. 'There is no understanding of medical ethics in which this is permissible.'\nA disproportionate number of organ samples were from deceased prisoners, the students said. Those samples included brief bios indicating the person died in a correctional facility and some health history.\n'We are benefiting from medical inequity,' one student said. 'These people are dying sicker, dying with less care and they look sicker, their bodies look sicker and we get to learn from that. That's supposed to be a win for us?'\nThe students said the university ethics committee ultimately dismissed their concerns.\nA September 2018 response from the ethics committee said organs are 'used for the secondary purposes of teaching future physicians and thereby benefits future patients. If such uses are disallowed, these specimens would only be disposed of, serving no useful purpose.' The committee concluded there is 'no evidence that deceased prisoners are treated unfairly as compared with non-prisoners in the autopsy procedure.'\n'It is hard to see any lack of ethicality in the retention and teaching uses of once-removed organs,' the response said.\nUAB in their statement said the medical students' concerns were 'informed by inaccurate data and information.' A panel of medical ethicists reviewed and endorsed UAB's protocols for autopsies on incarcerated persons, the university said.\nUAB said its pathologists in 'some cases' keep organs for further testing to determine an accurate cause of death. UAB said it does not use inmate organs to teach medical students.\n'We felt ashamed,' one medical student said. 'All of us carried it for years.'\nAnother added, 'It has continued to follow me all these years, wondering if I should or could have done more.'\nThe families question why the organs were missing for most of the inmates, and what UAB did with those organs after the work was completed.\nOn April 13, 2023, inmate Jim Kennedy Jr. died at the age of 67 in an Alabama prison, where he was serving a sentence of 300 years for rape, sodomy and kidnapping. A prison chaplain notified his family of the death about four days later, according to the lawsuit.\nA funeral director told family members his internal organs were missing. Only the eyes remained.\nMarvin Kennedy, who held power of attorney over his brother's affairs, said the family had not authorized the retention of the organs.\n'They made the decisions for you or represented you without your permission in different areas,' Marvin Kennedy said of UAB and prison officials. 'And that's really what really hurts.'\nSara Kennedy demanded answers from UAB and prison officials. 'I had a lot of questions,' she said.\nWhen she reached a UAB autopsy department on the phone to ask that her brother-in-law's organs be returned, she secretly recorded the six-minute conversation.\n'We've never had this request done before,' the supervisor told her in the recorded call.\n'To have the organs back?' she asked.\n'Yeah, we've never.'\n'Who buries somebody without their organs?'\n'Well, we do it all the time.'\n'We don't want to do it \u2026 We don't want to do that.'\n'Now, I will tell you this \u2026 UAB is a teaching institution and any teaching institution that does autopsies, keeps their organs.'\n'Well, we did not. We did not and Junior did not want that \u2026 We have not agreed with the prison for his body to be turned over for no study. And we want those organs back,' Sara Kennedy told the supervisor.\nStapler died on September 23, 2023. He had been housed at Hamilton Aged and Infirmed Center, where he was doing 10 years for child sex abuse. The cause of death was listed on his autopsy report as congestive heart failure.\nThe private pathologist hired by his son discovered he had 'an empty cavity' in place of his organs.\n'There was nothing there,' Billy Stapler said.\nStapler also reached the UAB autopsy department supervisor by phone and arranged for some of his father's organs to be returned.\n'I'm asking where's the rest of his organs? And he tells me that they possibly got thrown away,' Billy Stapler recalled. 'And I'm like, how do you throw away organs? \u2026 Why did you even take them out of him?'\nAnthony Perez Brackins, 36, who was serving a 21-year sentence for armed robbery, died at Limestone on June 28, 2023, according to his mother, Susie Duncan, and sister, Letesha Brackins. The cause of death was listed as an accidental drug overdose.\nAfter an autopsy at UAB, Duncan and Brackins said, a funeral home informed the family that the body had been 'emptied' of all organs. Duncan said her son was cremated without his organs. He was not an organ donor and UAB did not ask for her consent to keep the organs, according to Duncan.\nWhen Brackin's family contacted UAB to demand the return of his organs, a UAB employee told a relative it was 'too late now,' according to the lawsuit.\nKelvin Moore was 42 when he died on July 21, 2023, at Limestone. His family said he was serving a sentence of life without parole for convictions for attempted murder and attempted burglary. A chaplain informed his mother of the death three days later, telling her the cause was a fentanyl overdose, the lawsuit said.\nWhen his family received his body, the mortician discovered most of his internal organs were gone. Relatives later picked up a red viscera bag with what UAB said were his organs. Moore was laid to rest with the bag.\n'I call it thievery. I call it barbarism,' said one of Moore's brothers, Simone.\nSimone Moore remembered the words of his 82-year-old mother, Agolia: 'She said, \u2018You can't even die no more. Even in death, people robbing you and disrespecting you. Robbing you of your organs. Even in death.'

Sara Kennedy recalled being told. 'Liver, heart. All of your major organs. They were gone.'\n'He had nothing,' said Kennedy's brother, Marvin.\nAnother inmate suffered a similar fate. Arthur Stapler was 85 when he died five months after Kennedy Jr. at the Brookwood Baptist Medical Center in Birmingham. He had been housed at Hamilton Aged and Infirmed Center, which is also run by the Alabama Department of Corrections.\n'It's like a horror movie that I can't wake up from,' said Stapler's son, Billy, who learned about the missing organs after hiring a private pathologist to perform an autopsy on the body.\nIt was only after contacting the University of Alabama at Birmingham \u2013 which is among the providers that conducts autopsies for the prison system \u2013 that Stapler's family received what they were told were his brain and heart in plastic viscera bags. The lungs and some other internal organs came back in pieces, but not all were returned.\nWith more than 26,000 inmates, Alabama's severely overcrowded and understaffed prisons are the target of a US Justice Department lawsuit that alleges the state not only fails to prevent violence and sexual abuse behind bars but does not protect inmates from excessive force by prison staff or provide safe conditions.\nAlabama's men's prisons are also the country's deadliest, with a homicide rate in 2019 more than seven times higher than the national average, according to a report by the non-profit Equal Justice Initiative.\nAnd the state's mass incarceration nightmare does not appear to end with death.\nThe state Department of Corrections and the University of Alabama at Birmingham now face disturbing allegations from the families of five inmates whose organs were removed and reportedly kept without consent, according to lawsuits filed last week in Montgomery County Circuit Court. A lawyer for the families alleged the organs were retained for teaching purposes.\n'It's the wild, wild west. There's no governance,' Lauren Brinkley-Rubinstein, an associate professor at the Duke University School of Medicine and an expert on prison standards, said of the allegations involving the handling of inmate organs in the prison system.\n'It's like, the provision of health care. No standards. What that health care should look like, who has bodily autonomy and who doesn't, and who, when someone dies, acts as next of kin to people who are incarcerated \u2013 all those things are just undefined. There's no standard and there's no oversight.'\nThe Alabama Department of Corrections is the largest law enforcement agency in the state, with 28 facilities and nearly 2,000 officers.\nThe University of Alabama at Birmingham Heersink School of Medicine bills itself as one of the nation's top academic medical centers for research, education and clinical care. It houses one of America's largest academic hospitals.\nUnder an agreement between two state institutions with divergent missions, UAB said it conducts autopsies for the corrections department, which is 'responsible for obtaining proper authorizations from the appropriate legal representative of the deceased.'\n'The authorization forms not only provide permission for the autopsy, but also specifically include consent for the removal of organs or tissues for diagnostic or other testing including final disposition,' said UAB in a statement, adding that privacy laws prevented comment on specific autopsies.\nA case of finger-pointing has broken out between the university and the corrections department on the issue of who ultimately authorizes autopsies.\nUAB also said it doesn't comment 'on pending or threatened litigation,' but it complies with laws governing autopsies and is responding to 'incorrect and misleading assertions' about the procedures it performs for the corrections department.\n'UAB only conducts autopsies after obtaining consent or authorization from the appropriate state official,' the statement said.\nThe Alabama Department of Corrections also declined comment on pending litigation but said it does not authorize or perform autopsies. UAB has maintained that corrections authorizes inmate autopsies.\n'Once an inmate dies, the body is transported to the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences or (the University of Alabama at Birmingham) for autopsy, depending on several factors, including but not limited to region and whether the death is unlawful, suspicious, or unnatural,' the corrections department said in a statement.\nBirmingham attorney Lauren Faraino said the families she represents in the five suits insisted to her that none of the inmates were organ donors, nor were their families asked for authorization to retain the organs. At least two other lawsuits were being prepared, she said.\nInstead, the attorney said, UAB's own autopsy authorization form \u2013 which CNN has obtained \u2013 empowers a prison warden to give consent 'without limitations' for the autopsy as well as the final disposition of an inmate's organs. She said that means UAB gets to keep and dispose of the organs as it sees fit unless told otherwise.\nUnder an autopsy agreement between corrections and the UAB Board of Trustees dating to around 2005, the warden signs off as the 'legally designated representative and therefore am legally entitled to grant permission for the completion of an autopsy and the removal of organs or tissues for further study on said inmate.'\n'l do, therefore, give my permission for the performance of an autopsy including the removal of organs or tissues from said inmate for diagnostic or other testing, including final disposition thereof,' reads the autopsy authorization form.\nThe lawsuits cite a 2017 UAB Division of Autopsy publication that said 23% of the division's yearly income from 2006 to 2015 derived from corrections department autopsies. The corrections department pays UAB $2,200 per autopsy and $100 per toxicology test, according to the suits.\nIn 2023, Alabama prisons reported a record high 325 deaths, according to the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law & Justice, a non-profit criminal justice reform advocacy group.\nThe law center reported 1,045 deaths in state prisons from April 2019 \u2013 when the DOJ released a report on prison conditions \u2013 through the end of last year, citing Alabama Department of Corrections figures and Appleseed data.\n'Defendants' appalling misconduct is nothing short of grave robbery and mutilation,' the lawsuits said. The state institutions are accused of fraud, conspiracy, negligence, unauthorized donations of body parts, unjust enrichment, failing to notify next of kin when retaining organs and other counts.\nAn Alabama law passed in 2021 requires medical examiners to notify next-of-kin if they will retain a deceased person's organs to determine identification or the cause or manner of death. They also need the approval of next-of-kin to keep organs for research or other purposes.\nA bill now making its way through the state legislature would make a violation of that law a Class C felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\n'If organs are being removed for donation for medical education, research or any other purpose without appropriate authorization that is both a legal failing and a moral failing,' said Brendan Parent, a lawyer and director of the transplant ethics and policy research program at NYU Langone.\n'There's no reason to believe that a warden of a prison has ownership or property rights to a body just because the person was incarcerated. And so the laws that exist protecting the family's right to represent the donation wishes, and to represent the burial wishes or laying to rest wishes, those remain.'\nIn its statement, UAB insisted it 'does not harvest organs from bodies of inmates for research.' Its pathology program is accredited by the College of American Pathologists and staffed by physicians certified by the American Board of Pathology, UAB said.\n'The dead are voiceless. And so that creates both a major sort of gap in bringing these stories to light,' Parent said.\n'It's incredibly sad but makes sense that there isn't nearly enough oversight or attention to this because of the vulnerability and lack of representation of the rights of these individuals.'\nA 2019 report by the Justice Department and the Alabama US Attorney's offices did not mention issues with missing organs but said the state corrections department did not have a reliable system of tracking in-custody deaths.\nFederal investigators identified at least 30 deaths that were not disclosed to the Justice Department.

Read more opinion on CN CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Tennessee's House of Representatives plans to take up a bill that would allow some teachers to carry guns in the classroom, just days after the measure was approved by the state Senate. A similar law that could put guns in the hands of teachers has been approved by lawmakers in Iowa, and presumably other states could choose to follow suit.\nIt's the latest proof that \u2014 a full year after the devastating mass shooting at The Covenant High School in Nashville that killed six people \u2014 our state's political leaders are no closer to providing meaningful, viable solutions to address our state's tragic gun violence problem.\nThe Covenant High School in Nashville that killed six people \u2014 our state's political leaders are no closer to providing meaningful, viable solutions to address our state's tragic gun violence problem. Guns are still the leading cause of death in children and teens in America, and Tennessee continues to be plagued by one of the highest rates of violence perpetrated with firearms in the country. The Republican supermajority that controls our state's General Assembly, tragically, have reneged on their responsibility to pass meaningful gun safety legislation.\nIf Republicans have failed to make inroads in combating senseless gun violence, it cannot be because they are unaware of the seriousness of the problem. The magnitude of our gun violence problem was made clear to residents of Tennessee and the entire nation last March after a shooter armed with a weapon of war carried out the massacre at The Covenant School. Among the dead were three children, 9-year-olds Hallie Scruggs, Evelyn Dieckhaus and William Kinney.\nHere's what Republican lawmakers could do instead of passing measures that would introduce even more guns into our public spaces, and now potentially our classrooms: They could listen to some of the parents who have been appalled at the idea that the adults to whom they have entrusted their children's care at school every day might be carrying loaded guns.\nOne such mom, Beth Gebhard, whose son attended The Covenant School told me after the shooting that quick action by her son's teacher might have saved his life that day, as well as the lives of all of the other children in the class. But it's not because the teacher confronted the shooter with a gun. Far from it.\n'My son was in a second-grade classroom close to where the children were slain. The children heard the intensely loud, repeated shots,' Beth told me.\n'I know the primary reason he's still alive is that his teacher \u2014 under extreme duress \u2014 was able to follow her training to lock the classroom door, pull down the shades, shepherd the children to the safe corner of the room and be there with them, helping them to follow her breathing and to stay silent so the Nashville police officers could do their work.'\nBeth knows that guns belong in the hands of trained professionals who are best equipped to meet the threat posed by a gunman. Putting firearms into the hands of classroom teachers and administrators every day is simply asking for more heartache and tragedy.\nHere's some more wisdom that Tennessee lawmakers could glean from parents: Immediately following The Covenant School massacre, grieving parents lined the streets and the entrance to the Tennessee State House, demanding common sense gun safety laws. Students walked out of schools across Nashville and Memphis making similar demands. We've seen a groundswell of similar protests in recent days, as parents and students raise their voices in opposition to the measure being considered in the House that could put guns in the hands of their teachers.\nRelated article Van Jones: Going home, I encountered a huge problem\nRelated article Van Jones: Going home, I encountered a huge problem Their sentiments are echoed across the country. A strong majority of Americans favor stricter gun safety laws in the US, according to a Gallup poll, and a similar majority of teachers believe arming them would make schools less safe, according to research by the Rand Corporation. In Tennessee, a wide majority \u2014 about three-quarters of registered voters \u2014 want red flag laws, according to polling last year from Vanderbilt University.\nThere is one more group that Tennessee lawmakers should consult with before passing a measure that could make our gun violence problem even worse: The members of the law enforcement community who are directly tasked with keeping schools safe.\nThe National Association of School Resource Officers (NASRO) also opposes arming teachers, and their research data aligns with the fears of teachers and school staff. Among other warnings, NASRO reports that a law enforcement officer could mistake an armed teacher for an assailant and that discharging weapons in a school is an 'extremely risky action' that could result in wounding or killing innocent children and staff.\nTheir data also indicate that an armed teacher is more likely to interfere with first responders' actions than to stop a school shooter. Besides all of the data indicating the dangers of arming teachers, the training outlined in the proposed bill is insufficient to prepare teachers to safely carry and operate a weapon in the event of a mass shooting.\nUnfortunately, rather than heeding wise counsel on the subject of reducing gun violence, our legislature has frequently resorted to reactive and even anti-democratic tactics.\nTennessee state Rep. Justin Jones, Rep. Gloria Johnson and I responded to the pleas of our constituents and the mourners outside and inside the State House last year, joining them in peaceful protest against a conservative majority that refused to listen.\nHowever, on that day and every day since, the majority party lawmakers appear to answer to a different constituency \u2014 the Tennessee Firearms Association and the National Rifle Association. And they responded to our efforts to represent the grieving people of Tennessee by expelling Jones and me \u2014 two Black men \u2014 from our duly elected offices.\nAlthough our municipal governments promptly reinstated us and our constituents voted us back into office, the supermajority in the Tennessee State House is still trying to silence us. Despite the retribution politics that dominate the Republican agenda, we refuse to be silent. We will not sit still and be quiet while our children and communities are ravaged by gun violence.\nArming teachers increases the likelihood of shootings in schools, increases the chance that students will have access to guns and erodes trust in educators. A teacher with a handgun is unable to stop a shooter with a military-style weapon, and teachers aren't able to respond in the ways trained law enforcement agents can. Adverse impacts \u2014 including fatal outcomes \u2014 will disproportionately fall on already marginalized populations such as disabled and Black students.\nAccording to the national teachers' union the American Federation of Teachers, more than three in four teachers oppose putting guns in the hands of educators and school staff, stating that schools would be more dangerous if staff were armed. Most parents, as well as students, oppose arming teachers.\n'Arming teachers is not the answer to school shootings \u2014 it's a dangerous next step in the gun lobby's \u2018guns everywhere' agenda. We need to vote these reckless politicians out and elect lawmakers who will fight for the common sense, research-backed gun safety laws that Tennesseans deserve,' says Angela Ferrell-Zabala, executive director of Moms Demand Action, the anti-gun violence group founded after another horrific school mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in December 2012.\nAs parents tell me time and again, guns in classrooms simply are not the answer. 'Can you imagine what would have happened if my son's teacher left the classroom with a handgun to confront the shooter with military-grade weapons?' Beth asked me. 'Not only would she have been killed, but she would have left terrified 8-year-olds alone \u2014 many likely crying and some following her \u2014 alerting the shooter to their presence. I have no doubt my son wouldn't have survived.'\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook This moment requires our highest reasoning and the best of our efforts. It requires elected officials to do everything we can to end the gun violence epidemic plaguing our communities, our state and our nation.

Democratic State Rep. Justin J. Pearson explains why that's a bad idea.","summary":"Editor's Note: Tennessee Rep. Justin J. Pearson is a Democrat and former community activist in Memphis.

Read more opinion on CN CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Tennessee's House of Representatives plans to take up a bill that would allow some teachers to carry guns in the classroom, just days after the measure was approved by the state Senate. A similar law that could put guns in the hands of teachers has been approved by lawmakers in Iowa, and presumably other states could choose to follow suit.\nIt's the latest proof that \u2014 a full year after the devastating mass shooting at The Covenant High School in Nashville that killed six people \u2014 our state's political leaders are no closer to providing meaningful, viable solutions to address our state's tragic gun violence problem.\nThe Covenant High School in Nashville that killed six people \u2014 our state's political leaders are no closer to providing meaningful, viable solutions to address our state's tragic gun violence problem. Guns are still the leading cause of death in children and teens in America, and Tennessee continues to be plagued by one of the highest rates of violence perpetrated with firearms in the country. The Republican supermajority that controls our state's General Assembly, tragically, have reneged on their responsibility to pass meaningful gun safety legislation.\nIf Republicans have failed to make inroads in combating senseless gun violence, it cannot be because they are unaware of the seriousness of the problem. The magnitude of our gun violence problem was made clear to residents of Tennessee and the entire nation last March after a shooter armed with a weapon of war carried out the massacre at The Covenant School. Among the dead were three children, 9-year-olds Hallie Scruggs, Evelyn Dieckhaus and William Kinney.\nHere's what Republican lawmakers could do instead of passing measures that would introduce even more guns into our public spaces, and now potentially our classrooms: They could listen to some of the parents who have been appalled at the idea that the adults to whom they have entrusted their children's care at school every day might be carrying loaded guns.\nOne such mom, Beth Gebhard, whose son attended The Covenant School told me after the shooting that quick action by her son's teacher might have saved his life that day, as well as the lives of all of the other children in the class. But it's not because the teacher confronted the shooter with a gun. Far from it.\n'My son was in a second-grade classroom close to where the children were slain. The children heard the intensely loud, repeated shots,' Beth told me.\n'I know the primary reason he's still alive is that his teacher \u2014 under extreme duress \u2014 was able to follow her training to lock the classroom door, pull down the shades, shepherd the children to the safe corner of the room and be there with them, helping them to follow her breathing and to stay silent so the Nashville police officers could do their work.'\nBeth knows that guns belong in the hands of trained professionals who are best equipped to meet the threat posed by a gunman. Putting firearms into the hands of classroom teachers and administrators every day is simply asking for more heartache and tragedy.\nHere's some more wisdom that Tennessee lawmakers could glean from parents: Immediately following The Covenant School massacre, grieving parents lined the streets and the entrance to the Tennessee State House, demanding common sense gun safety laws. Students walked out of schools across Nashville and Memphis making similar demands. We've seen a groundswell of similar protests in recent days, as parents and students raise their voices in opposition to the measure being considered in the House that could put guns in the hands of their teachers.\nRelated article Van Jones: Going home, I encountered a huge problem\nRelated article Van Jones: Going home, I encountered a huge problem Their sentiments are echoed across the country. A strong majority of Americans favor stricter gun safety laws in the US, according to a Gallup poll, and a similar majority of teachers believe arming them would make schools less safe, according to research by the Rand Corporation. In Tennessee, a wide majority \u2014 about three-quarters of registered voters \u2014 want red flag laws, according to polling last year from Vanderbilt University.\nThere is one more group that Tennessee lawmakers should consult with before passing a measure that could make our gun violence problem even worse: The members of the law enforcement community who are directly tasked with keeping schools safe.\nThe National Association of School Resource Officers (NASRO) also opposes arming teachers, and their research data aligns with the fears of teachers and school staff. Among other warnings, NASRO reports that a law enforcement officer could mistake an armed teacher for an assailant and that discharging weapons in a school is an 'extremely risky action' that could result in wounding or killing innocent children and staff.\nTheir data also indicate that an armed teacher is more likely to interfere with first responders' actions than to stop a school shooter. Besides all of the data indicating the dangers of arming teachers, the training outlined in the proposed bill is insufficient to prepare teachers to safely carry and operate a weapon in the event of a mass shooting.\nUnfortunately, rather than heeding wise counsel on the subject of reducing gun violence, our legislature has frequently resorted to reactive and even anti-democratic tactics.\nTennessee state Rep. Justin Jones, Rep. Gloria Johnson and I responded to the pleas of our constituents and the mourners outside and inside the State House last year, joining them in peaceful protest against a conservative majority that refused to listen.\nHowever, on that day and every day since, the majority party lawmakers appear to answer to a different constituency \u2014 the Tennessee Firearms Association and the National Rifle Association. And they responded to our efforts to represent the grieving people of Tennessee by expelling Jones and me \u2014 two Black men \u2014 from our duly elected offices.\nAlthough our municipal governments promptly reinstated us and our constituents voted us back into office, the supermajority in the Tennessee State House is still trying to silence us. Despite the retribution politics that dominate the Republican agenda, we refuse to be silent. We will not sit still and be quiet while our children and communities are ravaged by gun violence.\nArming teachers increases the likelihood of shootings in schools, increases the chance that students will have access to guns and erodes trust in educators. A teacher with a handgun is unable to stop a shooter with a military-style weapon, and teachers aren't able to respond in the ways trained law enforcement agents can. Adverse impacts \u2014 including fatal outcomes \u2014 will disproportionately fall on already marginalized populations such as disabled and Black students.\nAccording to the national teachers' union the American Federation of Teachers, more than three in four teachers oppose putting guns in the hands of educators and school staff, stating that schools would be more dangerous if staff were armed. Most parents, as well as students, oppose arming teachers.\n'Arming teachers is not the answer to school shootings \u2014 it's a dangerous next step in the gun lobby's \u2018guns everywhere' agenda. We need to vote these reckless politicians out and elect lawmakers who will fight for the common sense, research-backed gun safety laws that Tennesseans deserve,' says Angela Ferrell-Zabala, executive director of Moms Demand Action, the anti-gun violence group founded after another horrific school mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in December 2012.\nAs parents tell me time and again, guns in classrooms simply are not the answer. 'Can you imagine what would have happened if my son's teacher left the classroom with a handgun to confront the shooter with military-grade weapons?' Beth asked me. 'Not only would she have been killed, but she would have left terrified 8-year-olds alone \u2014 many likely crying and some following her \u2014 alerting the shooter to their presence. I have no doubt my son wouldn't have survived.'\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook This moment requires our highest reasoning and the best of our efforts.

The videos \u2014 which can be made from photorealistic faces, as well as cartoons or artwork \u2014 are complete with compelling lip syncing and natural face and head movements.\nIn one demo video, researchers showed how they animated the Mona Lisa to recite a comedic rap by actor Anne Hathaway.\nOutputs from the AI model, called VASA-1, are both entertaining and a bit jarring in their realness. Microsoft said the technology could be used for education or 'improving accessibility for individuals with communication challenges,' or potentially to create virtual companions for humans. But it's also easy to see how the tool could be abused and used to impersonate real people.\nRelated article OpenAI will now let you create videos from verbal cues\nRelated article OpenAI will now let you create videos from verbal cues It's a concern that goes beyond Microsoft: as more tools to create convincing AI-generated images, videos and audio emerge, experts worry that their misuse could lead to new forms of misinformation. Some also worry the technology could further disrupt creative industries from film to advertising.\nFor now, Microsoft said it doesn't plan to release the VASA-1 model to the public immediately. The move is similar to how Microsoft partner OpenAI is handling concerns around its AI-generated video tool, Sora: OpenAI teased Sora in February, but has so far only made it available to some professional users and cybersecurity professors for testing purposes.\n'We are opposed to any behavior to create misleading or harmful contents of real persons,' Microsoft researchers said in a blog post. But, they added, the company has 'no plans to release' the product publicly 'until we are certain that the technology will be used responsibly and in accordance with proper regulations.'\nMicrosoft's new AI model was trained on numerous videos of people's faces while speaking, and it's designed to recognize natural face and head movements, including 'lip motion, (non-lip) expression, eye gaze and blinking, among others,' researchers said. The result is a more lifelike video when VASA-1 animates a still photo.\nFor example, in one demo video set to a clip of someone sounding agitated, apparently while playing video games, the face speaking has furrowed brows and pursed lips.\nThe AI tool can also be directed to produce a video where the subject is looking in a certain direction or expressing a specific emotion.\nWhen looking closely, there are still signs that the videos are machine-generated, such as infrequent blinking and exaggerated eyebrow movements. But Microsoft said it believes its model 'significantly outperforms' other, similar tools and 'paves the way for real-time engagements with lifelike avatars that emulate human conversational behaviors.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Clare Duffy,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1475203706-20240419201140979.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":4.1684017,"_id":"ca16ac282492162c69b24e8f472bbb4b"},{"title":"Dozens detained as NYPD breaks up pro-Palestinian protest at Columbia University","author":"Emma Tucker","published_date":"2024-04-18 18:15:37","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/18/us/nypd-disperses-pro-palestinian-protest-columbia-university/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"At least 30 people were detained by New York Police Department officers, CNN witnessed, as police entered Columbia University on Thursday to disperse a pro-Palestinian protest that began a day earlier\u2026","summary":"At least 30 people were detained by New York Police Department officers, CNN witnessed, as police entered Columbia University on Thursday to disperse a pro-Palestinian protest that began a day earlier as the university's president testified before a House committee about the school's response to antisemitism.\nColumbia President Nemat 'Minouche' Shafik was in Washington, DC, testifying to the House education committee, as the protesters \u2013 including students, faculty and others \u2013 gathered in upper Manhattan early Wednesday morning, setting up tents and signs.\nLater that afternoon, competing rallies of pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups grew.\nSeveral people waving Palestinian flags had verbal confrontations with police officers, who had begun boxing the protesters in with barricades, CNN affiliate WCBS reported Wednesday.

It will also ensure that polluters are charged for the clean-up of contamination involving these chemicals.\nThe two designated chemicals, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), belong to a larger class of per- and polyfluoroalkyl compounds (PFAS) considered 'forever chemicals' because they take a long time to break down in the environment and in the human body.\nThis class of chemicals helps repel water and oil and was used in products like Teflon and firefighting foam for decades. While manufacturing was largely phased out due to health concerns, the chemicals can still be found in hundreds of household items and in drinking water systems and are thought to be in the blood of 98% of the human population.\nThe final rule classifies these two chemicals as hazardous substances, meaning that studies have shown that they are a threat to human health and can cause cancer and birth defects. Exposure to 'forever chemicals' has been linked to cancers, heart and liver disease and immune and developmental damage to infants and children, according to the news release.\n'Designating these chemicals under our Superfund authority will allow EPA to address more contaminated sites, take earlier action, and expedite cleanups, all while ensuring polluters pay for the costs to clean up pollution threatening the health of communities,' Michael S. Regan, administrator of the EPA, said in a news release.\nIn addition to the final rule, the EPA issued a separate enforcement policy that emphasizes that the agency will target companies that have contributed significantly to the manufacturing and release of these chemicals into the environment.\n'For far too long, the unchecked use and disposal of toxic PFAS have wreaked havoc on our planet, contaminating everything from our drinking water to our food supply,' Dr. David Andrews, deputy director of investigations and a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group, said in a statement. 'Urgent action is needed to clean up contaminated sites, eliminate future release of these pollutants and shield people from additional exposure.'\nEnvironmentalists say the EPA's announcement is a good start, but groups like the U.S. PIRG Education Fund and Environment America Research and Policy Center have called on the EPA to ban the entire class of PFAS chemicals. There are more than 12,000 forms of PFAS chemicals in the environment.\n'No one should have to worry in 2024 about whether their well water, farm produce or even clothing is contaminated with toxic chemicals, but unfortunately that's the reality for millions of Americans,' Lisa Frank, executive director of Environment America Research and Policy Center's Washington office, said in a statement. 'This announcement is a critical step toward getting PFAS out of our waterways and making polluters pay. Now, we need to turn off the tap on toxic PFAS everywhere.'\nThe EPA said this ruling is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's larger efforts to safeguard communities from PFAS contamination. The designation comes just weeks after the EPA announced new limits for 'forever chemicals' in drinking water in the United States.\nCNN's Jen Christensen contributed to this report\nCNN's Jen Christensen contributed to this report","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"science","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Mira Cheng,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap199891206147.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":4.059283,"_id":"93c473ae3b3cbce50c2cb03bcee5c856"},{"title":"Chibok girl rescued after 10 years in Boko Haram captivity","author":"Stephanie Busari","published_date":"2024-04-19 13:07:07","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/19/africa/nigeria-chibok-girl-rescued-intl","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The Nigerian army says it has rescued one of the missing Chibok schoolgirls abducted by militant Islamic group Boko Haram a decade ago.","summary":"Lagos, Nigeria CNN \u2014\nLagos, Nigeria CNN \u2014 The Nigerian army says it has rescued one of the missing Chibok schoolgirls abducted by militant Islamic group Boko Haram a decade ago.\nLydia Simon was rescued along with her three children by troops conducting an operation in the northern Borno State, the military said Thursday, adding that she was five months' pregnant at the time of her rescue.\nThe army didn't specify how or when the rescue happened, only saying it was 'recent.' CNN has contacted the military for comment.\nOf the 276 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram in 2014, more than 100 have eventually regained their freedom. The fate of more than 80 girls remains unknown, according to figures from Amnesty International.\nThe mass 2014 abduction sparked a global social media campaign #BringBackOurGirls, which called for their release as well as more government action to protect girls' education.\nBoko Haram, whose purpose is to institute Sharia, or Islamic law, has waged a 15-year insurgency battle in northern Nigeria and kidnapped thousands of people.\nBut the abduction of the Chibok girls remains the highest-profile example of the group's targeting of schools.\nThe latest rescue of a Chibok student was announced a day after the Nigerian army said it had 'successfully overrun a Boko Haram/Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) stronghold in Borno State following air raids and ground combat in the vast Sambisa forest that has served as an enclave for extremist groups for years.\nSurvivors of the Chibok kidnapping recently shared their harrowing experiences in captivity with CNN on the 10th anniversary of their abduction.\nOne of them Amina Ali, 27, was forced to marry a Boko Haram fighter, spending two years in captivity, before escaping. She is studying and working toward a bright future for herself and her 8-year-old daughter, whom she told CNN has been stigmatized and labeled a 'child of Boko Haram.'\nAnother survivor, Hannatu Stephen, 26, who was freed in 2017, lost a leg during an air raid by the Nigerian military on a Boko Haram hideout. Six of her friends were killed in the bombing, she said.\nTwenty-seven-year-old Hauwa Ishaya, who was 16 when she was abducted, said she was beaten by her captors and pressured to take a Boko Haram husband, which, she said, she managed to evade. Ishaya was also reunited with her family in 2017 after spending three years as a 'slave,' treating injured Boko Haram fighters.\nKidnappings and raids on schools have persisted across northern Nigeria since 2014, with more than 1,600 students kidnapped and nearly 200 others killed, according to a report by Save the Children.\nCriminal gangs are also exploiting the vulnerabilities exposed by extremist groups, leading to a rise in the kidnapping-for-ransom industry, the report found.\nOn March 7, more than 100 students, mostly girls, were reportedly taken by criminal gangs from a school in Kuriga, in northwest Nigeria. Two days later, 15 more children were abducted from a boarding school in Sokoto state, also in the northwest, according to Human Rights Watch.\nStephanie Busari reported from Lagos, Michael Rios wrote from Atlanta.

A university spokesperson confirmed that Massad was under investigation for allegedly making discriminatory remarks, as Shafik noted in her Wednesday testimony. Massad told CNN the investigation was 'news' to him and he was not aware of it prior to Wednesday.\nWhen asked at the hearing if Massad, a tenured professor, faced any disciplinary action, Shafik responded he had been 'spoken to' by the head of his department of Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies and his dean.\nShafik said she did not participate in those discussions but that Massad was told the language he used in his piece 'was unacceptable.'\nMassad told CNN no one said anything to him along those lines and he had not been reprimanded in any way.\n'I was shown solidarity by my chair and deans based on the death threats that I received and the campaign targeting me,' he said in an email to CNN.\nCNN reached out to his department chair and to the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to confirm Massad's statements.\nThe department chair did not respond, while the dean, Amy Hungerford, referred the inquiry to a university spokesperson who did not offer any comment.\nInitially, Shafik said Massad was no longer chair of the Academic Review Committee at Columbia and that he 'does not have a leadership role.' But when Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik pointed out that he's still listed as the chair of the committee on a Columbia site, Shafik said she 'wasn't sure.'\nMassad told CNN he remains chair of the committee that oversees all areas of Arts and Sciences, which covers five different schools within Columbia, until his one-year term expires in a few weeks. 'No one has contacted me at all from the university with regards to my current chairmanship,' he said, adding that he intends to remain a member of the committee next year for a three-year term.\n'Professor Massad has chaired his final meeting of the academic review committee,' a different Columbia spokesperson told CNN. The spokesperson did not respond when asked by CNN to clarify if that meant he had been removed.\nCNN reached out to other professors who were criticized during the hearing, as well.\nMohamed Abdou, who Shafik said expressed support for Hamas on social media following October 7, did not respond to a request for comment.\nColumbia Business School assistant professor Shai Davidai, who Shafik said was under investigation for harassment, told CNN that he has never spoken against students by name, only 'pro-Hamas' student organizations and professors.\n'They're investigating me for the entire reason this hearing was held in the first place.

Howard Memorial Scholarship would be replaced by the Reginaldo Howard Leadership Program, which 'will be open to all Duke undergraduates.'\nIn an announcement published on Duke's website, the university said it told current scholarship recipients that the transition was necessary 'due to the legal landscape related to race-based considerations in higher education.'\n'We are reimagining the Reginaldo \u2018Reggie' Howard Scholars program to expand the impact of Howard's legacy to many more Duke students with a commitment to leadership and social justice,' Duke University spokesman Frank Tramble said in a statement to CNN. 'The Reginaldo Howard Leadership Program will elevate the experience of our Black students by enriching their academic connections with faculty, providing funding for internships and research, strengthening community ties, and developing scholarly programming that highlights Black excellence through the Mary Lou Williams Center for Black Culture.'\nLast year, the Supreme Court struck down race-based college admissions.\nCraig Vincent, a former Reginaldo Howard Memorial scholar who graduated in 2016, told CNN Friday that he was disappointed in the university's decision to end the scholarship.\nThe scholarship, Vincent said, was critical to attracting talent to the university. He added that scholars have gone on to become CEOs, authors and have earned PhDs.\n'It felt a little bit like the university was reducing the scholarship down to the race of the people that were in it,' Vincent said. 'Where they kind of made the interpretation that this\u2026 was only a scholarship for Black students and there was nothing else unique or interesting about the folks that made up this pool and therefore they chose to eliminate it. That was very saddening to me.'\nWilton Alston, another former scholar who graduated from Duke in 1981, told CNN he initially felt 'anger, sadness and loss' about Duke ending the scholarship but ultimately decided to support the new leadership program.\n'I decided it made sense to give the leadership program a chance, and more importantly, engage in the future plans for developing the program,' Alston said.\nThe scholarship program targeted 'exemplary students of African descent' and paid full tuition, room and board for recipients, according to the program's website, which has now been archived.\nThe scholarship, established in 1979, was named after Duke's first Black student body president, who was killed in an automobile accident during his sophomore year.\nDuke isn't the only North Carolina college making changes or reevaluating diversity programs.\nEarlier this week, the University of North Carolina's Board of Governors, voted to repeal and replace the school's existing diversity and inclusion policy. The board oversees 16 public universities and one high school in the state.\nThe new policy \u2013 which goes to the full board for a final vote in May \u2013 will emphasize the university's commitment to 'non-discrimination and institutional neutrality,' Andrew Tripp, senior vice president for legal affairs for the university and board of governors, said during a committee meeting.\nThe Reginaldo M. Howard Memorial Scholars Program has supported 234 students since it was first created, Tramble said in the statement. Tramble said current scholars will still receive their scholarship until they graduate from Duke.\n'Under this new model, the redefined Reggie program will support hundreds of students each year through a variety of methods including need-based financial aid, leadership programming, and more,' Tramble said.\nThe removal of the scholarship at Duke also comes as diversity, equity and inclusion programs at colleges, along with race-based internships and scholarships, are being targeted by Republican lawmakers and conservative activists across the country.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Nicquel Terry Ellis,Kaylin C.

His new book, 'Life As We Know it (Can Be),' is available now in stores.\nDear River,\nThis is your fourth Earth Day, and so much has happened in your little lifespan that what started as an annual record of anger and regret has grown into a book full of hopeful solutions.\nThere are still dark days to be sure, and since you love animals so much , I can't bring myself to explain just how many of your favorites are on extinction's brink.\nso much , I can't bring myself to explain just how many of your favorites are on extinction's brink. But so much has happened that I wake with more wonder than worry; when disasters strike, I remember the advice of Mister Rogers, who taught me that every time there is a scary event on TV, 'Look for the helpers. There are always helpers.'\nAnd while technology in the hands of the soulless can divide us, it can also connect the helpers in ways that can save entire ecosystems.\nSo, on this Earth Day, kiddo, let's focus on a win.\nI recently stumbled upon an Earth repair success story in the wilds of South America. It stars a family of little monkeys with big white hair. They were snacking on fruit and nectar, bouncing through the forest overstory when we first locked eyes.\n'You guys have no idea how lucky you are,' I muttered at the Dr. Suess faces peering through my long lens.\nCotton-top tamarins are known locally as titis , and while only a few thousand remain in the shrinking forests of northwest Colombia, the family I saw is among the safest in the world thanks to one woman watching them with affection from below, hundreds of helpers watching monitoring them through a satellite from above, and a very long series of fortunate events.\n, and while only a few thousand remain in the shrinking forests of northwest Colombia, the family I saw is among the safest in the world thanks to one woman watching them with affection from below, hundreds of helpers watching monitoring them through a satellite from above, and a very long series of fortunate events.\nPreserving a rare and elusive creature\n04:14 - Source: CNN\n04:14 - Source: CNN The fate of the titis really began to turn when a woman I met in the jungle began her career as landscape architect, was hired to help build a zoo in Barranquilla and first fell in love with the cotton-topped titi. 'I mean, how could you not?' Rosamira Guillen laughed, gesturing up at the family above.\nWhen she learned that the illegal pet trade and slash-and-burn cattle ranching were erasing a species that lived only in her homeland of Colombia, her architect mind suddenly shifted from building zoos to rebuilding forests.\nAnd River, it didn't take long to understand that this job could not be done by dropping seeds from drones. It would take shovels and sweat and an intimate acre-by-acre knowledge of the ecology. It would take community organizing and youth education and economic development so the titi's human neighbors wouldn't need to cut down trees and poach animals to survive.\nBut to connect enough fragmented habitat for the remaining gene pool to thrive, she would need land. And the cooperation of cattle ranchers who do not share her love for toy-sized primates.\n'I would be happy to just hang out with the monkeys and in the forest than to have to interact with people,' she laughed as we bumped over dirt roads in her worn pickup, and described how wanton deforestation can change water cycles and trigger ecosystem crash.\n'In a country like Colombia, where there's so many challenges, people don't realize that if you screw up the forest we're all going to be screwed. The ranchers see us as romantic,' she laughed with grim resignation.\nBut still, Rosamira wanted to be a helper, and in a search for funding met an American super-helper named Charlie Knowles.\nAs the scion of a family that invented the small microphones used in everything from Apollo spacecraft to Richard Nixon's office to the iPhone, Charlie went into software and made enough of a fortune to retire at 34. Inspired by the story of biologist Laurie Marker who sold all her possessions and moved to Namibia to save cheetahs, Charlie told me he felt the same calling but knew that he had none of the skills required.\n'What are my core competencies?' he asked himself. 'I'm really good at throwing parties and raising money.'\nWith a cheetah borrowed from a petting zoo as a conversation starter, his first party raised $5,000, and with kindred souls from Silicon Valley, he set out to disrupt the world of nature philanthropy. 'I became really frustrated by the lack of transparency,' Charlie told me. 'I didn't feel I knew where my money was going or what the impact it was having.'\nSo \u2013 alongside Akiko Yamazaki, John Lukas \u2013 Charlie co-founded the Wildlife Conservation Network and instead of telling donors to simply write a check and trust the process, WCN set out to create venture capital for animals like the titi and helpers like Rosamira.\nThey created expos to connect philanthropists in wealthy American suburbs with data-proven, wilderness-restoring, boots-on-the-ground conservationists. And they helped those folks make their operations more efficient and effective and often expanded their original vision of what was possible.\nMore than 20 years later, Charlie tells me that WCN supports hundreds of projects around the world with raves from the likes of Jane Goodall and a rare perfect score of 100 from the watchdog Charity Navigator.\nOne million-dollar donation funded over 200 scholarships for kids to study conservation. Another donor personally installed over 50 solar power arrays around the world. And at an expo in 2006, the fate of the titis turned for the better when the Vargas family walked in.\n'I told my 12-year-old daughter, Kira, to go interview all the conservationists at the expo,' Chris Vargas told me. As another successful tech entrepreneur with a heart for wildlife and some money to give, he was searching for maximum bang for his buck.\n'And on the drive home. I said, \u2018Who is your favorite?' Mine was Rosamira. She's Steve Jobs and Jane Goodall all wrapped into one. Her energy, her passion, her clarity of purpose and her just sheer ingenuity,' Chris said. 'But I wanted my daughter's vote, without missing a beat she goes, \u2018Daddy, you know that that woman from Colombia? Rosamira? She was my favorite'. So we high fived.'\nFor 18 years, the Vargas family would support Rosamira as she revived her corner of Colombia, one tree at a time. But when she needed $1.2 million to buy nearly 1,000 acres of neighboring ranchland, Chris needed to find more helpers.\n'We thought, \u2018Why don't we just build a website? And build a technology that lets anybody in the world click on a map, pick an acre, pick ten acres, pick 50 acres, and get all that feedback one exactly what happened with your money.''\nCombining the eyes of a satellite and the hearts of nature lovers, Chris began an experiment in crowdsourced conservation he called ReWorld.\nFor a one-time donation of around $1,200, he promised to secure two-and-a-half acres of degraded Colombian forest, bring it back to life and preserve it for the titis forever. Thanks to real-time images from the satellite, the donors would be able to watch their hectare grow from scrub brush and dirt into trees that look like broccoli tops from the sky.\nRiver, after we watched the cotton-topped titis pass by, I followed Rosamira's team to a shady gully where I planted a tree dedicated to you and your sister, Olivia.

There are always helpers.'","summary":"This is Bill Weir's fourth letter on Earth Day to his young son. His new book, 'Life As We Know it (Can Be),' is available now in stores.\nDear River,\nThis is your fourth Earth Day, and so much has happened in your little lifespan that what started as an annual record of anger and regret has grown into a book full of hopeful solutions.\nThere are still dark days to be sure, and since you love animals so much , I can't bring myself to explain just how many of your favorites are on extinction's brink.\nso much , I can't bring myself to explain just how many of your favorites are on extinction's brink. But so much has happened that I wake with more wonder than worry; when disasters strike, I remember the advice of Mister Rogers, who taught me that every time there is a scary event on TV, 'Look for the helpers. There are always helpers.'\nAnd while technology in the hands of the soulless can divide us, it can also connect the helpers in ways that can save entire ecosystems.\nSo, on this Earth Day, kiddo, let's focus on a win.\nI recently stumbled upon an Earth repair success story in the wilds of South America. It stars a family of little monkeys with big white hair. They were snacking on fruit and nectar, bouncing through the forest overstory when we first locked eyes.\n'You guys have no idea how lucky you are,' I muttered at the Dr. Suess faces peering through my long lens.\nCotton-top tamarins are known locally as titis , and while only a few thousand remain in the shrinking forests of northwest Colombia, the family I saw is among the safest in the world thanks to one woman watching them with affection from below, hundreds of helpers watching monitoring them through a satellite from above, and a very long series of fortunate events.\n, and while only a few thousand remain in the shrinking forests of northwest Colombia, the family I saw is among the safest in the world thanks to one woman watching them with affection from below, hundreds of helpers watching monitoring them through a satellite from above, and a very long series of fortunate events.\nPreserving a rare and elusive creature\n04:14 - Source: CNN\n04:14 - Source: CNN The fate of the titis really began to turn when a woman I met in the jungle began her career as landscape architect, was hired to help build a zoo in Barranquilla and first fell in love with the cotton-topped titi. 'I mean, how could you not?' Rosamira Guillen laughed, gesturing up at the family above.\nWhen she learned that the illegal pet trade and slash-and-burn cattle ranching were erasing a species that lived only in her homeland of Colombia, her architect mind suddenly shifted from building zoos to rebuilding forests.\nAnd River, it didn't take long to understand that this job could not be done by dropping seeds from drones. It would take shovels and sweat and an intimate acre-by-acre knowledge of the ecology. It would take community organizing and youth education and economic development so the titi's human neighbors wouldn't need to cut down trees and poach animals to survive.\nBut to connect enough fragmented habitat for the remaining gene pool to thrive, she would need land. And the cooperation of cattle ranchers who do not share her love for toy-sized primates.\n'I would be happy to just hang out with the monkeys and in the forest than to have to interact with people,' she laughed as we bumped over dirt roads in her worn pickup, and described how wanton deforestation can change water cycles and trigger ecosystem crash.\n'In a country like Colombia, where there's so many challenges, people don't realize that if you screw up the forest we're all going to be screwed. The ranchers see us as romantic,' she laughed with grim resignation.\nBut still, Rosamira wanted to be a helper, and in a search for funding met an American super-helper named Charlie Knowles.\nAs the scion of a family that invented the small microphones used in everything from Apollo spacecraft to Richard Nixon's office to the iPhone, Charlie went into software and made enough of a fortune to retire at 34.

Protesters held banners that read 'No More Genocide For Profit' and 'We Stand with Palestinian, Arab and Muslim Googlers.'\nA Google spokesperson told CNN Thursday that the protests 'were part of a long-standing campaign by a group of organizations and people who largely don't work' at the company.\n'A small number of employee protesters entered and disrupted a few of our locations. Physically impeding other employees' work and preventing them from accessing our facilities is a clear violation of our policies, and completely unacceptable behavior.

Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.\nGoogle Cloud's contract with the Israeli government dates back to 2021, when the company announced that it had been chosen to provide 'public cloud services to help address the country's challenges within the public sector, including in healthcare, transportation, and education.'\nBut the protests followed a report in Time magazine earlier this month, citing an internal company document, that Israel's Ministry of Defense is a Google Cloud customer.\nAccording to Time, the ministry has its own secure entry point to Google-provided computing infrastructure, which would allow it to store and process data, and access artificial intelligence services. Earlier this year, the ministry also sought consulting assistance from Google to expand its Google Cloud access, Time reported.\nNo Tech for Apartheid said the article showed that Google had 'built custom tools' for the Ministry of Defense and had 'doubled down on contracting' with Israel's military since the war broke out.\nthat Google had 'built custom tools' for the Ministry of Defense and had 'doubled down on contracting' with Israel's military since the war broke out.

This work is not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services,' the spokesperson added.\nSeparately, Google confirmed that it is making an unspecified number of fresh layoffs as part of an internal reorganization. The job cuts will not be company-wide, and impacted employees will be able to apply for other open roles across Google.\nGoogle laid off hundreds of employees earlier this year, adding to a wave of job cuts in the tech and media industries, including at Amazon, Vice and the Los Angeles Times.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.

CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 In 1957, I moved to Berkeley, California: a bastion of American liberalism that squarely aligns with my progressive values, and a hub of American scholarship that nurtured my academic quest and professional growth. I came here for advanced studies in microbiology and genetics. Since then, I have lived, worked as a scientist and retired in this community.\nOver the 65 years that I have called this beautiful area home, I have occasionally encountered antisemitism, but these one-off incidents never succeeded in destroying my spirit. When I was four years old, Nazis burst into my bedroom and sent me and my family to Dachau, the first Nazi concentration camp. We were soon released and I was smuggled out of Germany by a Christian woman. After this harrowing experience, not much in the Bay Area could scare me.\nBut since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the hatred towards Jews that I have seen in Berkeley terrifies me more than anything I have experienced while living here. I am still reeling from being called a liar at a Berkeley City Council meeting, where I asked for a proclamation to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day and spoke about October 7.

Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. New York CNN \u2014\nNew York CNN \u2014 America's right-wing forces would have you believe that they are the courageous entities standing up for free speech.\nBut, as they try to claim that mantle, many of those same forces in media and politics are behind a disturbing wave of book bans sweeping the nation.\nPEN America, a non-profit organization committed to protecting free expression, published an alarming report Tuesday indicating that the 'book ban crisis' is only getting worse. The bans are 'speeding up,' the organization warned in its report, a troublesome trend that is impacting public school systems from coast-to-coast.\n'There were over 4,000 instances of book bans in the first half of this school year\u2014more than all of last school year as a whole. This is a marked increase in comparison to the last spring semester, in which PEN America recorded 1,841 book bans,' the group said in the report, aptly titled 'Banned in the USA.'\nThe bans started in haste in early 2021, birthed in the backlash to Nikole Hannah-Jones's 1619 Project at The New York Times. At the time, the concern among conservatives was that schools were using books to supposedly indoctrinate young students with critical race theory, an academic concept that became a culture war flashpoint and sparked hysteria in right-wing circles. Over time, the bans have grown to encompass other topics, notably gender ideology.\nThe censorship has been fueled by the right-wing media machine (which again, purports to be pro-free speech), with entities such as 'Libs of TikTok' targeting specific school systems and effectively waging pressure campaigns against administrators to take certain works off the library shelves.\nSome of the books removed from schools across the country include Margaret Atwood's acclaimed dystopian-novel - turned-Hulu-adaptation 'The Handmaid's Tale,' Amy Reed's novel 'The Nowhere Girls,' Rupi Kaur's NYT bestseller 'Milk and Honey,' Ta-Nehisi Coates's memoir 'Between the World and Me' and others.\n-turned-Hulu-adaptation 'The Handmaid's Tale,' Amy Reed's novel 'The Nowhere Girls,' Rupi Kaur's NYT bestseller 'Milk and Honey,' Ta-Nehisi Coates's memoir 'Between the World and Me' and others. 'Those who want to ban books are attempting to use obscenity law and hyperbolic rhetoric about \u2018porn in schools' to justify banning books about sexual violence and LGBTQ+ topics (and in particular, trans identities). In doing so, they have also disproportionately targeted books by women and nonbinary authors,' PEN America said. 'The movement to ban books also continues to focus on themes of race and racism by advancing rhetoric disparaging \u2018critical race theory,' \u2018woke ideology,' and efforts to ensure library collections are diverse and inclusive.'\nSuch brazen book bans \u2014 unprecedented in modern American history \u2014 is at its worst in the red states of Florida and Texas. In Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a law last year that led to the removal of books from public school shelves, more than 5,100 books were banned between July 2021 and December 2023, according to PEN America. In Texas, the number was more than 1,500, the group said.\nThe bans have also led to harassment against the authors who suddenly find themselves hurled into the information wars. Abdi Nazemian, a gay Iranian-American author, said during a press call organized by PEN America on Tuesday that 'nothing could have prepared' him for 'the experience of having my book banned.'\n'First and foremost, a heartbreak over the message it sends to young queer kids who deserve love and support. But also just the fear over all the online threats I've received,' Nazemian said. 'I've been called a pedophile and a groomer. I've been called filthy, indecent, profane, shady, slimy.'\nPEN America said Tuesday that there is one glimmer of hope: growing resistance to the bans. Every major publisher is now actively supporting a legal case to halt book banning in Iowa. And, across the country, ordinary people are getting involved to put an end to the trend.\nactively supporting a legal case to halt book banning in Iowa. And, across the country, ordinary people are getting involved to put an end to the trend. 'We see students at the forefront, leading protests, read-ins, marching to oppose censorship and educational censorship in particular happening and plaguing their schools and school libraries,' Kasey Meehan, the program director of PEN America's Freedom to Read, said Tuesday. 'And, of course, we're joined by incredible voices of authors and parents and other advocates that are leading efforts to be as coordinated, as well resourced, and as organized as those efforts to remove books in the first place.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Oliver Darcy","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap22190839242796.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":3.6263273,"_id":"825f6fedacd387a4f265b7cd1c275d36"},{"title":"A White author calculated just how much racism has benefited her.

As she details in the book, she grew up in an abusive household and an unfortunate accident left her mother unable to care for her. In college, McMillan juggled numerous jobs to support herself, and as a working journalist, she's had her own brushes with poverty.\nDespite those hardships, McMillan says the financial advantages she's experienced because of her race are undeniable. Her grandparents benefited from federal programs that largely excluded Black people, allowing them to build wealth that was then passed on to the next generation. That enabled her parents to help her pay to attend an elite university, which in turn opened doors to employment opportunities.\nBut, as she writes in the book, those advantages also come with a cost \u2014 not just to Black Americans, but White people like her.\nCNN's conversation with McMillan has been edited for length and clarity.\nCNN's conversation with McMillan has been edited for length and clarity. What made you want to write this book?\nWhat made you want to write this book? I work as a journalist and have gotten pretty good at understanding \u2014 at least structurally \u2014 how racism hits people who aren't White. I started to feel that just listening to people who aren't White talk about racism and how bad it was was not sufficient to fix the problem.\nIf we could fix racism just by having Black people tell us how bad it was, we would have fixed it by now. As a White American, I felt like I needed to take some responsibility for myself and understand how things were working on my end.\nWhat is the \u2018White bonus' you describe in the book, and how is it different from White privilege?\nWhat is the \u2018White bonus' you describe in the book, and how is it different from White privilege? The 'White bonus' is an estimate of the money a White person gets or saves because of White supremacy, public policies or private practices. For me, this was a really humbling exercise.\nI've been on food stamps and had a stranger live in the bedroom of my one bedroom apartment to save rent through those periods. But at the end of the day, my family has spent about $146,000 to help me out since I left home. That's money they're not required to spend by the government. That's extra money they have.\nAs I dug into my family's story, every time I started to peel back the layers, I thought, 'Would grandpa have had the money if he wasn't White?' Well, no. He became a banker around 1930 when across the whole United States, there were a quarter million bankers and only 80 of them were Black. Then he bought a house with a racial covenant (a clause in many 20th century property deeds that explicitly prohibited Black people from owning or occupying real estate).\nMy grandpa on my other side of the family was a millwright. That's a job that often was racially restrictive in practice for a long time. He got that job because he worked for his dad, who ran a welding business from his dad. (My great-grandfather) came up from the Ozarks in the early 1900's and got a job in the foundry at a General Motors plant outside of Detroit.\nFoundries are historically a site of racial segregation because it's the worst, most dangerous, poorly paid job in the factory, and Black workers were not allowed to get out of those departments. My great-grandfather was allowed to get out of that department, got some skills and training, and was able eventually to start a business and buy a house with a racial covenant.\nBoth blue collar and white collar parts of my family were able to build enough wealth because they got that opportunity.\nOur life experiences are shaped by a number of factors, race being just one of them. Can we really measure just how much our race has helped or hurt us?\nOur life experiences are shaped by a number of factors, race being just one of them. Can we really measure just how much our race has helped or hurt us? All these are back of the envelope estimates. They are bare minimums. I don't think there's a way to have a definitive number, but I think there's a way to have a meaningful number so that you can talk about this.\nAs long as we sit here and say we could never measure that, we don't get anywhere. We're just having these conversations about privilege that are like trying to grab onto a ghost. At least if we're talking about this in material terms, the argument is over the scale.\nWhen we talk about the advantages White people have had, we tend to think of people who are wealthy. Yet, the people you profile in the book aren't extraordinarily well-off by many standards. Why did you focus your book on the White middle and working class?\nWhen we talk about the advantages White people have had, we tend to think of people who are wealthy. Yet, the people you profile in the book aren't extraordinarily well-off by many standards. Why did you focus your book on the White middle and working class? The focus on the middle class started as an accident. I wanted to go up and down the class ladder and study how White advantage works through narrative, and then put everything into context. Frankly, I just was not successful in finding broke White people or really wealthy White people who were willing to talk to me.\nBut as the project moved forward, it just became really clear to me that the middle class is really the fulcrum for White advantage in the US. People in the middle class who were willing to talk to me understand how on the edge of falling into poverty they are.\nThe middle class doesn't have enough wealth to feel comfortable. They're always trying to game out how they and their family stay taken care of.\nThe middle class doesn't have enough wealth to feel comfortable. They're always trying to game out how they and their family stay taken care of, particularly in a society where we have allowed the safety net to be eviscerated.\nHow did you understand race before 'The White Bonus,' and how did writing the book change that?\nHow did you understand race before 'The White Bonus,' and how did writing the book change that? Before I wrote 'The White Bonus,' I understood racism as something that hurts people who aren't White. I understood racism hurts Black people, racism hurts immigrants, racism hurts brown people. I could cite incarceration rates, and I could tell you about police violence and all of these things. But I did not understand that racism was something that actually actively benefits me.\nIt's this thing that we all know, but that we pretend that we don't. White people actually do kind of know this, but the whole trick of American public discourse is that we never say that it's happening.\nNot even being able to articulate that that's what's happening just completely ruins our ability to accurately address it.\nToday, some White people in the US argue that they are being discriminated against by workplace diversity programs , affirmative action and other policies meant to address the legacy of racism. Given your reporting, do these feelings surprise you?\nI don't think it reflects reality. I also think the way that we usually talk about race in this country makes that a really predictable response.\nToday, some White people in the US argue that they are being discriminated against by workplace diversity programs, affirmative action and other policies meant to address the legacy of racism. Given your reporting, do these feelings surprise you?\nI don't think it reflects reality. I also think the way that we usually talk about race in this country makes that a really predictable response. Take the G.I. Bill (a post-World War II law that gave returning veterans free college, job training and other benefits). We created this benefit, that in practice, was only intended for White people. Maybe a few people of color were going to be able to access it and it was written as if it was colorblind, but everybody understood it was going to be implemented in a way that would benefit White people and nobody else. But we talk about benefits like that as if it is a natural right for an American to have.\nWhite people today do not understand \u2014 because this history has been hidden from them by previous generations \u2014 that somebody in their family got something because they were White.\nHistorically, the US has been a lot more honest about the fact that they are denying things to people because they are Black. But the inverse of that is also true. If you're denying something to one group of people because of their skin color, you're also by default giving it to the other group. White people do not have tools for that. This is the sort of stuff that, if we were teaching accurate history, would be part of the US history curriculum and it's not.\nThe idea that White people are now victims of racism appears to be a key pillar of Donald Trump's campaign . How might your book help White people see things differently?\nThe idea that White people are now victims of racism appears to be a key pillar of Donald Trump's campaign. How might your book help White people see things differently? As somebody who grew up in a community that was decimated by a raft of trade policies and an economic shift, people act like the only reason blue collar workers are mad is racism. That's not true.\nPeople are mad because they lost a path to the middle class that they could afford, and they're given this story that it's because of people who don't look like them.\nPeople are mad because they lost a path to the middle class that they could afford, and they're given this story that it's because of people who don't look like them.\nSo not only are they getting gaslit about their experience of losing this path to the middle class, but they're seeing people suddenly talk with sympathy about the abuse that people of color have experienced.\nThere's a lot of White people that are resentful because they've had stuff taken away from them and then told that they never got it in the first place. 'The White Bonus' is about coming up with another way to tell that story.\nIf White people benefit from anti-Black racism, as you've documented in your book, will they ever have an incentive to change these systems?\nIf White people benefit from anti-Black racism, as you've documented in your book, will they ever have an incentive to change these systems? We usually talk right about racism = bad for people of color, or racism = good for White people. That's one way to do it, but it's also true that racism impoverishes our democracy and undercuts our social safety net.\nFor most White people, unless you are Elon Musk, you or someone you love is going to need a social safety net. Maybe you are safe in your middle class position, but you're going to know some young person that can't afford higher education and ends up in a really bad spot. You're going to know somebody who needs medical care they can't afford, and they die because they can't get it. That stuff happens all the time, and we act like it's normal and it's not. That hurts a lot of White people.\nWhen you start looking at racism not just as something that only gives or only takes but as something that does both things, then you can ask yourself if it's worth being silent about it.\nI calculate $146,000 from my family that probably they had because of racism. I calculate $225,000 of money that I have had access to or equity I've gained probably because I was White. That's almost $400,000. But I also lost my mother because we didn't have public health care. And I had a really traumatic childhood because we didn't have public health care.\nMost of that money from my family and most of those bonuses I'm talking about with housing, I wouldn't need if we had affordable higher education. I wouldn't need them if we had affordable housing for everybody.\nI think there are enough White people now who understand that this isn't really working in our favor, but we don't have language for it.\nIn the book, you explore the assumptions we make in the US about who is 'deserving.' As your reporting details, when White people have historically received government help, they are assumed to have deserved it. Meanwhile, Black and brown people often have to prove they deserve those same public benefits. What did you take away from that?\nIn the book, you explore the assumptions we make in the US about who is 'deserving.' As your reporting details, when White people have historically received government help, they are assumed to have deserved it. Meanwhile, Black and brown people often have to prove they deserve those same public benefits. What did you take away from that? I came out of writing 'The White Bonus' really convinced that the idea of 'deserving' is a farce.\nThis idea of who deserves what is just about making sure that the people who already have something get to keep acquiring more, even when they don't need it. It just lets people hoard power and money, and I don't think that's helpful for most Americans. We have enough resources that folks don't need to be terrified of ending up without a house.\nI think it's really easy to point at striving, middle class families and all the effort that they put into making sure their kids can go to college and this and that. But we've basically created the Hunger Games to get into the middle class, and it doesn't have to be like that.\nWhen my grandparents got into the middle class, it was like stepping on an automatic sidewalk at the airport. My grandparents were not savvy financial investors. They weren't moving money around.\nWhen my grandparents got into the middle class, it was like stepping on an automatic sidewalk at the airport. My grandparents were not savvy financial investors. They weren't moving money around. They weren't gaming out return on IRAs for their five-year-old. They were just like, 'Alright, I'm going to take care of my family. I'm going to get paid, I'm going to have a pension.'\nAmerica was much more comfortable talking about that like a broad right when it was just White people that they thought were getting this. So this idea that some people deserve more than others when it comes to basic sustenance is silly.\nWhat do you hope readers will take away from this book?\nWhat do you hope readers will take away from this book? I hope that folks who have had to deal with families that fell down in supporting them in the way they would have liked can feel seen.\nI hope that readers who aren't White feel seen, too \u2014 that somebody out there who's White does see how this is happening. So much of the way that we look at race in this country is through this lens of oppression. That's important, but if we don't talk about the bonus, we're not seeing things accurately.\nWhat I want is for people to work to end racism because I think it's in all of our interests. It is great and important to show up to things like Black Lives Matter protests. But it's also important to do the hard, daily work in your community \u2014 talking to your friends and neighbors and trying to shift people's understandings so that we can all take care of each other.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Harmeet Kaur,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/tracie-mcmillan-lg-3-scaled.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":3.6246421,"_id":"ec8b35f63aa0eebd3763044fed3ea31f"},{"title":"What we know about the 7 jurors seated so far","author":"'S Jeremy Herb","published_date":"2024-04-18 11:53:41","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-04-18-24/h_714a02da23570de025e2dd4792b50a1b","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Seven jurors were seated in Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial Tuesday.

When asked about his hobbies, he said, \"I guess my hobby is my family.\" He has an IT business for training and consulting and attended one year of college. He told the court he finds Trump fascinating and mysterious. 'So many people are set off one way or the other and that is interesting,' the man said. 'Really, this one guy can do all of this, wow.' Trump 'makes things interesting,' the man said, but also didn't indicate any strong feelings about his politics. The fifth juror is a young Black woman who teaches English language in a public charter school system. She has a master's degree in education, is not married and doesn't have any kids. The juror said that as a person of color she has friends who have strong opinions on Trump, but she personally is not a political person. She said she tries to avoid political conversations and doesn't really care for the news. The juror did say she appreciates Trump's candor: 'President Trump speaks his mind and I'd rather that than someone who's in office who you don't know what they're thinking.\" She was also the only juror of 18 in the box Tuesday morning who said she wasn't aware that Trump is facing charges in other criminal cases. The sixth juror is a software engineer at a large broadcast company who recently graduated from college. She voiced no strong feelings about Donald Trump one way or the other and said, 'I will be fair and impartial.\" She is not married and has no kids, currently living with three roommates in Chelsea. The juror gets her news from The New York Times, Google, Facebook and TikTok. She asked the judge whether her sister's wedding on a Sunday in September would be a scheduling conflict. Merchan quipped, 'If we were still here in September that would be a big problem,' garnering laughs in the courtroom. The seventh juror is a civil litigator who is married with two kids and lives on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. Originally from North Carolina, he reads The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, New York Post and The Washington Post. He said he has \"political views as to the Trump presidency\" and that he thinks there were likely Trump administration policies he disagreed with. \"I don't know the man and I don't have opinions about him personally,\" he said. \"I certainly follow the news, I'm aware there are other lawsuits out there. But I'm not sure that I know anyone's character.\" 7 hr 32 min ago From CNN's Aditi Sangal Former President Donald Trump awaits the start of proceedings at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York on Tuesday. Mary Altaffer/Pool/AP Before Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial began, experts had deemed that selecting a jury would be a long and challenging task. But seven jurors had already been seated by the end of Day 2. Five more jurors, as well as six alternates, are required for jury selection to conclude. 'Remember, the tactic here from defense counsel for months and months, it was to delay this trial. This pace is absolutely antithetical to trying to delay that process. In other words, this defendant, Donald Trump, has the pacing of most defendants who are charged with the crime in New York City,' CNN chief legal analyst Laura Coates said Tuesday. Remember: For months now, Trump's team has pushed to delay the New York trial, as part of the former president's broader strategy of trying to push back all four of his trials until after the 2024 election. 7 hr 36 min ago From CNN's Kara Scannell, Jeremy Herb, Lauren del Valle, Julian Cummings and Laura Dolan Former US President Donald Trump attends the first day of his trial at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City on April 15. Angela Weiss/Pool/Getty Images Donald Trump has faced three civil trials in New York since he left the White House, but this is the first time he faces possible jail time. The former president is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, stemming from reimbursements made to his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen for hush money payments he made before the 2016 election to an adult film star alleging an affair with Trump. The former president has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair with Stormy Daniels. Each count represents a separate instance of the alleged misconduct, pointing to different business records associated with a series of repayments to Cohen (ledger entries, checks, stubs, invoices, etc.) that were allegedly falsified to conceal his criminal conduct. Penalty: The maximum penalty for each count is four years in state prison. However, the judge has discretion on how long any sentence should be and whether to allow any sentences to be served consecutively. He could also sentence Trump to probation. New York caps sentencing for this type of felony at 20 years. A president has no authority to pardon state crimes. 7 hr 40 min ago From CNN's Maureen Chowdhury Kara McGee speaks with CNN on Tuesday. Kara McGee, a juror dismissed from the hush money criminal trial, told CNN Tuesday she wasn't sure if she was being considered for the case against Donald Trump until she walked into the courtroom and saw the former president. \"So yeah, it was when we walked into the courtroom and saw him that it was \u2014 that I was sure, that it was definitely this case,\" McGee said. She said that Trump made eye contact with her, which she said was \"odd.\" McGee said that it was a fascinating experience because on the one hand, she was aware that \"this is history in the making and whatever the outcome of this is, everything going forward will be affected by it\" and at the same time she walked into the courtroom and saw Trump sitting there and realized, \"Oh it's just a guy ... he's just a dude.\" McGee said that she believes she was dismissed because of her answer to a question regarding additional things that may impact her ability to serve on the jury. McGee said she mentioned her work schedule conflicting with her being able to be in court from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. for an extended period of time. She said she was dismissed right after that question, even though they did not specify why she was dismissed. 7 hr 44 min ago From CNN's Kaanita Iyer Donald Trump's legal team is frustrated after one juror was dismissed for having a pro-Trump bias, CNN's Kristen Holmes reported. The former president's attorneys have been concerned about the political makeup of Manhattan and worried that they were not going to get anyone sympathetic to Trump, according to Holmes. The defense team is not optimistic that it is going to win this case outright, Holmes says, but they are trying to get at least one sympathetic juror to try and aim for a hung jury.

As the case goes to trial, catch up on the key people in the case below: 8 hr 19 min ago An exhaustive process is underway to seat 12 jurors , along with six alternates, for Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial. The judge released the questionnaire that will be presented to potential jurors, which contains multiple questions that could signal political views to the lawyers on both sides. Here's what potential jurors could be asked about: News consumption.\nAffiliations with groups like the Proud Boys, QAnon and Antifa.\nWhether they or anyone in their circle attended a Trump rally or an anti-Trump event.\nIf they've ever read books or listened to podcasts from Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and a key witness for the district attorney.\nIf they've read any of Trump's own books.\nIf they have views on whether a former president can be charged in state court.\nIf they have views on how Trump is being treated in this case. Why does this matter: The questions will be used for the judge to strike jurors at the outset, if they don't believe they can render a verdict fairly. They will also be used by lawyers for both sides to strike jurors for any reason \u2014 a key part of the jury selection process.\nProsecutors and Donald Trump's attorneys are reviewing the latest panel of 18 potential jurors after asking them about their feelings about the former president and whether they can remain fair in the trial.\nThere are currently five seated jurors in Trump's hush money criminal trial, after two empaneled jurors were excused today. Ultimately, 12 New Yorkers and likely six alternates will be selected.\nAttorneys on both sides can use peremptory strikes to dismiss potential jurors they don't want without providing a reason. Each side has four strikes left. They can also ask the judge to dismiss jurors for cause, which means they would not use a strike.\nMeanwhile, prosecutors say Trump violated his gag order seven more times, pointing to posts online and calling the situation \"ridiculous.\"\nCNN reporters are in the courthouse to bring you real-time updates. 7 hr 31 min ago Seven jurors were seated in Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial Tuesday.

'There is no level playing field in this election.'\nRelated article What to know about the world's biggest election\nRelated article What to know about the world's biggest election It echoed a similar rally more than 40 years earlier on the same spot, when opposition leaders fired up huge crowds to help change the course of the 1977 election \u2013 ending the 10-year rule of India's powerful third prime minister and political scion Indira Gandhi.\nGandhi had imposed a state of emergency, jailed key opposition leaders and curtailed civil freedoms. To some, India's future was perched on a needle point between autocracy and democracy. She lost the election and, in the eyes of many, India's democracy was saved.\nTo many supporters in the crowd three weeks ago, India is now at a similar crossroads with this high-stakes election deciding which path the country follows.\n'Our democracy is being murdered, India is becoming a dictatorship,' Hazari Lal Rajput, a resident from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, told CNN at the Ramlila Maidan.\nUnless there is a major upset, Modi's BJP is set to win its third straight five-year term thanks to his potent, populist mix of economic empowerment and Hindu nationalism.\nAccording to 2023 Pew research, about eight in 10 Indian adults have a favorable view of Modi, including 55% who have a very favorable view. Such levels of popularity for a two-term incumbent prime minister defy all modern conventions, both in India and throughout much of the democratic world.\nBut India's opposition leaders accuse Modi's right-wing government of becoming an electoral autocracy by attempting to rig the vote, weaponizing state agencies to stifle, attack and arrest opposition politicians, and undermining democratic principles ahead of elections, which began on April 19 and run until June 1, with results counted on June 4.\nThey also warn Modi's brand of Hindu nationalism is uncorking dangerous religious divides in a country with a long and tragic history of sectarian bloodletting.\nModi and the BJP have denied political interference, with one senior party leader saying it was a 'process of law' to take 'appropriate action against corruption.'\nTo counter the BJP, the opposition has formed a 27-member bloc \u2014 the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, or INDIA.\nBut so far that alliance has proved lackluster, observers say. It has been beset by ideological differences, has seen a host of defections to the BJP and, even with the election in full swing, has yet to even name a prime ministerial candidate.\n'What kind of a democracy can you have if you don't have a vibrant opposition, a robust opposition that can question the government?' asks Arati Jerath, an independent political commentator and journalist.\n'That's why it's not really a question of whether Modi wins or not, it's a question of keeping the opposition alive to fight another day so that democracy in India survives.'\nAmong those leading the charge for the opposition alliance is Rahul Gandhi, longtime face of the Congress and the latest member of his family to bid for power.\nHe is the son of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. His grandmother Indira was India's first female leader, and his great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the country's founding prime minister.\n'If the BJP wins these fixed elections and changes the constitution, the country will be on fire. Remember this,' Rahul Gandhi told the crowd in Delhi last month.\nThe BJP and its allies are gunning for a supermajority of more than two-thirds of the seats in India's parliament, the Lok Sabha. A rising fear among critics is that this would give the BJP the power to change India's constitution, which is rooted in the democratic principles of justice, liberty, equality and \u2013 crucially \u2013 secularism.\nThe BJP has repeatedly denied it has plans to change the constitution.\n'When I say that I have big plans, no one should be scared. I don't take decisions to scare or run over anyone, I take decisions for the wholesome development of the nation,' Modi said in an interview with Indian news agency ANI earlier this week.\nBut the party has already begun publicly pulling India's government away from its secular foundation and leading BJP figures have openly advocated for the country to be declared a Hindu nation.\n'There shouldn't be politics on the basis of religion in any country, they should talk about real issues. Until people's financial situation improves, there won't be any social reform,' said voter Mohammad Irfan at the opposition rally in Delhi.\nOpposition parties have found themselves facing a slew of legal and financial challenges in the run-up to this year's election.\nGandhi's Congress \u2013 the largest party in the INDIA alliance \u2014 has accused the BJP of 'tax terrorism' and crippling its ability to campaign after its accounts were frozen by the tax department, leaving it unable to use some $20 million in funds. It has also been landed with a $218 million tax bill.\nThen came the arrest of Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi chief minister and head of the popular Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).\nKejriwal's detention on graft allegations came after the announcement of the general election last month, sparking protests in the capital. Analysts say it's the first time in post-independence history that an Indian chief minister has governed from behind bars.\nKejriwal has denied the allegations, claiming they are politically motivated. He is just one of several prominent members of the opposition, including three other senior AAP leaders, that have also been arrested or investigated by state agencies in moves decried as political by their parties.\n'I think there are very serious concerns about how free and fair the elections are going to be in India this time around,' said Atishi, Delhi minister of education for the AAP, who goes by one name.\nReports have emerged of opposition party members being coerced into joining the BJP with the threat of arrest, while they were under investigation by state agencies. Other reports suggest politicians have had their probes dropped after switching sides.\nAtishi said she was also approached to switch to the BJP. 'Either you join the ruling party, and then the cases are closed or put into cold storage or if you don't, like the Aam Aadmi Party leaders, then the cases go ahead and you're arrested and put into jail,' she said, without specifically naming who approached her.\nCNN cannot independently confirm the incidents and has reached out to the BJP for comment.\nIn his interview with ANI, Modi denied any sliding of democracy under his rule and emphasized the independence of the Election Commission and state agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate, saying political leaders make up just 3% of cases.\n'Shouldn't we let the ED work independently when it is supposed to do so?' he said. 'I am convinced that corruption has destroyed the country. We should fight against corruption with our full strength.'\nAnalyst Jerath said a BJP-led campaign to weaken the opposition was part of Modi's 'scorched earth policy.'\n'Just wipe out whatever comes in your way so that this juggernaut can move on without any kind of challenge, without any obstruction,' she said.\nModi is enduringly popular, analysts say, appealing to both the poor and the affluent, especially among much of the roughly 80% of India's population who are Hindu.\nDuring his 10 years in power, he has launched a raft of welfare policies including free food handouts, housing, cheap gas cylinders for women and infrastructure projects.\nIndia is also the world's fastest-growing major economy and Modi's presence on the world stage \u2014 including hosting the G20 \u2014 has cemented the country as a modern global power, along with a history-making moon landing.\nAuthor Christophe Jaffrelot told CNN Modi makes people feel 'proud again of being Indian.'\n'There is a sense in India, a constant sense, of vulnerability, a lack of self-esteem. So to be recognized as a great power in spite of everything, (that) is attributed to him,' he said.\nThat does not mean there aren't key issues the opposition could rally around, analysts say, including the BJP's failure to increase education opportunities or improve health infrastructure \u2013 especially following the coronavirus pandemic, which hit India especially hard.\nYouth unemployment also remains a huge problem, close to 50% among 20-to-24-year-olds.\nBut the INDIA alliance has failed to capitalize on these weak spots, Jerath said.\n'They haven't been able to weave together a cohesive kind of campaign, come up with a catchy slogan that will fire the imagination of the voting public,' she said.\nCongress leader Gandhi is one of the few opposition figures considered to have the kind of star power and name recognition to stand against Modi.\nBut though he may have the name, Gandhi lacks leadership skills, some analysts say.\nRasheed Kidwai, journalist and author of '24 Akbar Road,' a history of the Congress party, said it's a winner-takes-all election and there is 'no silver medal in politics.'\n'The problem with INDIA alliance is there is nobody who has that kind of hunger, who has that kind of personal(ity), who has that kind of inner sense of belonging or ownership to go in this election. Rahul is doing it but is not a contender,' he said.\nGandhi recently completed a 6,713-kilometer (4,200-mile) walk across the country, starting in the violence-hit northeastern state of Manipur, to raise issues of poverty, unemployment, diversity and democracy with voters.\nDespite these efforts, the BJP has dominated the campaign narrative.\nA key gauge of opposition strength will be in those parts of India where the BJP has historically failed to make inroads.\nRegional opposition heavyweights, such as the West Bengal chief minister and All India Trinamool Congress head Mamata Banerjee and the south's Tamil Nadu chief minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin, will be vying to block a BJP takeover in their respective states.\nBut the only other major national party is the Congress, which has been the main opposition since 2014.\nCongress governed the country for much of the 77 years since independence, and while it was once a powerful political force with its legacy rooted in the formation of modern India, it now finds itself in the doldrums, dogged by infighting and accusations of corruption within the party.\n'In the Congress, the best and brightest are not fighting the election,' Kidwai said.\nAnalysts say that during a decade in opposition, Congress has failed to rebuild its organization and political machinery to effectively take on the BJP.\nThe Congress organization has 'decayed and almost died over the years, particularly in north India, and particularly in Uttar Pradesh, which is the largest, most populous state,' Jerath said.\n'There was a time after independence, and for many years after independence, that they used to say that you would find a Congress flag in every single village in India,' she said. 'That's no longer true.'\nStill, there is optimism from some.\nThe AAP's Atishi said that despite repeated attacks against her party, it has been able to defeat the BJP in Delhi again and again.\n'Democracy becoming an autocracy \u2026 That is what we are fighting against,' she said. 'I think that the people of India have always voted very sensibly, and we hope that they do so this time.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Rhea Mogul,CNN,Helen Regan","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2147820411.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":3.5277765,"_id":"5efe93aea3e7def3e4b45fd8ec970364"},{"title":"Opinion: As Trump trial opens, attorneys have to make deft first moves","author":"Norman Eisen","published_date":"2024-04-22 09:25:05","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/22/opinions/trump-criminal-trial-opening-statements-eisen","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"CNN legal analyst Norman Eisen will join the line Monday morning to witness opening statements in the first-ever criminal trial of a former American president.","summary":"Editor's Note: Norman Eisen is a CNN legal analyst and editor of ' Trying Trump: A Guide to His First Election Interference Criminal Trial .'

He served as counsel to the House Judiciary Committee for the first impeachment and trial of Trump. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 I will be joining the line Monday morning to witness opening statements in the first-ever criminal trial of a former American president.\nJournalists are to queue up in the long exterior entryway to the 17-story building at 100 Centre St. \u2013 its elegant pale yellow granite and limestone Art Deco facade is a sharp contrast to the faded and dark hallways. There's an air of sadness inside this building, the shadows of the countless thousands of criminal defendants who have been here before former President Donald Trump \u2013 all the way back to when the notorious Tombs prison stood on this spot.\nAt a little after 9:30 a.m. in the spartan wood-paneled courtroom 1523, where Justice Juan Merchan presides, the prosecution will tell the jury how they intend to prove that Trump committed 34 felony counts of document falsification \u2013 allegedly to cover up an illegal scheme 'to influence the 2016 presidential election' in the form of hush money payments to avoid a damaging scandal.\nOpening for the People will be one of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's big three who are leading this case: Matthew Colangelo, Susan Hoffinger and Joshua Steinglass.\nIt will likely be Colangelo, 48 years old and slight of build with graying hair. I've crossed paths with him over the years and he's a smart and effective advocate who has had a rich career in public service, including stints at the Justice Department and the Office of the New York State Attorney General. (For much more about Colangelo, and all the other players, see my new book.)\nColangelo, or whoever may be opening, needs to do three things: First, hammer home the seriousness of the case \u2013 that this was election interference, as I argued last week at CNN Opinion, not just hush money \u2013 because if the jury believes it's serious that makes them think twice about giving into any doubts they may have about Trump's guilt.\nRelated article Here are the key players in Trump's hush money trial\nRelated article Here are the key players in Trump's hush money trial Second, the prosecutor must build a bridge for the jury into Trump's brain in order to find the criminal intent required to convict on felony document falsification.\nThe DA will need to prove that the false records here at issue (ones saying the hush money repayments were attorney fees) were intended to hide another crime. Since Trump either will deny criminal intent on the stand or won't testify at all, the prosecution will need to explain to the jury that the way to get there is through other witnesses and through documents. It's also notable that the jury has two lawyers on it \u2013 the DA will be particularly focused on talking to those two jurors so they can educate the non-lawyer jurors on how this works.\nThird, the prosecution's opening needs to 'draw the sting' regarding the DA's more controversial witnesses \u2013 like former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, adult film actress Stormy Daniels, and former American Media CEO and National Enquirer publisher David Pecker \u2013 by acknowledging their foibles, while guiding the jury to accept their perspective.\nAs a trial lawyer, I always would rather the jury hear about any problems with witnesses from me first, together with the solution. Here that solution is corroboration, a vast amount of supporting and interlocking evidence.\nNext up to open for the defense will very likely be Todd Blanche. If lacking the star power of a Colangelo, he's also had a distinguished career as a federal prosecutor and top white-collar criminal defense lawyer.\nHis mission today is the flip side of the prosecution's: First, he will explain why the case doesn't matter \u2013 that it is about Trump wanting to conceal an embarrassing personal peccadillo and about some accountant that Trump didn't even know writing down imprecise words in his business records.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook If the DA wants to build a bridge for the jury into what Trump was thinking, Blanche wants to preemptively destroy it.\nPart of the way he'll do that is by attacking the critical witnesses who form the foundation for the prosecution's case. Blanche will surely look to preemptively demolish Cohen, and the other key witnesses such as Daniels and Pecker. Blanche will maintain that if you can't trust these witnesses then the bridge the prosecution sought to build falls into the gorge.\nAfter the openings, it will be on to the first witness, reportedly Pecker. But before that I'll be back to you with an evaluation of how both sides did for the next installment of my trial diary.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Opinion Norman Eisen,Norman Eisen","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2147854119.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":3.5056946,"_id":"43382c64a70756dba556edea98b5d8e3"},{"title":"\u2018Perfect landing spot.'

And the company has created more than 200,000 jobs in Vietnam, it added.\nAccording to the statement, Cook said Apple 'stands ready \u2026 to enhance cooperation and investment activities' in the Southeast Asian country.\nRelated article How booming Vietnam offers the US an alternative to China\nRelated article How booming Vietnam offers the US an alternative to China His visit highlights Vietnam's growing importance to global companies looking for alternatives to China as trade tensions between Beijing and the West have escalated in recent years.\nVietnam has been a 'major beneficiary' of moves by multinational companies to diversify their manufacturing hubs \u2014 a strategy known as 'China plus one' \u2014 says Thuy Anh Nguyen, a strategist at Dragon Capital, a local fund management firm that invests solely in Vietnamese companies.\nNguyen, whose firm manages $6 billion in assets, told CNN that labor costs in Vietnam's manufacturing sector are about half those in neighboring China.\nThat has helped Vietnam go from producing mostly 'low-value products' like textiles to more tech products like iPhones and iPads, she said. 'Those are higher-value items. That's how we move up the value chain.'\nVietnam pulled in more than $4.29 billion in foreign direct investment during the first two months of the year, up almost 39% from the same period in 2023, according to the country's Ministry of Planning and Investment. Most of the new investment went into the processing and manufacturing sector.\nIn recent years, fast-growing Asian economies like Vietnam and India have emerged as alternative locations for manufacturers as ties between Beijing and the West have frayed.\nVietnam is 'the perfect landing spot for tech companies to diversify outside China,' according to Dan Ives, a senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, who pointed to the high number of trained engineers in the country as one factor .\n. 'We're not just talking about (manufacturing of) low-cost electronics,' he told CNN. 'We're talking higher up the value chain\u2026 That was not even on the radar (of foreign companies) two years ago.'\nOnce enemies in war, the United States and Vietnam have grown increasingly close \u2014 the value of US imports of Vietnamese goods s\ufeffoared more than 360% in the decade to end-2023 to top $144 billion, according to US government data.\nIn September, the two countries formally upgraded their diplomatic ties to a 'comprehensive strategic partnership,' a symbolic yet highly important move that positions Vietnam as a destination for more US investment, including for critical technologies like semiconductor chips.\nIntel (INTC) has also taken note of Vietnam's rise. In 2021, the company committed $1.5 billion to a sprawling campus just outside Ho Chi Minh City, which it says will be its largest single assembly and test facility in the world.\nAt the same time, relations between the United States and China have deteriorated. A trade war between the two countries, which began in 2018 when Washington slapped tariffs on many Chinese imports, ratcheted up last year as both sides introduced tit-for-tat chipmaking export controls.\nexport controls. During the pandemic, meanwhile, China's strict zero-Covid policy scrambled global supply chains, demonstrating the risks of concentrating production in a single location.\nNotably, the world's biggest iPhone factory, located in central China and owned by Taiwanese manufacturing firm Foxconn, was forced to temporarily shut down in 2022 after workers revolted over fears of the spread of coronavirus.\nVietnam has another advantage, says Nguyen: A booming, educated, and youthful population. That's a big draw for foreign tech companies looking to hire workers for their factories, and find consumers for their products.\n'Vietnam has a population of 100 million people. If it was in Europe, it would be the biggest country,' she said, also noting that smartphone adoption in Vietnam was rapidly increasing.\nThe International Monetary Fund expects Vietnam's economy to growth 5.8% this year, much faster than the predicted global average of 3.2%. For 2025, the fund forecasts growth of 6.5% in Vietnam. That's not far off India's pace of expansion.\nof 6.5% in Vietnam. That's not far off India's pace of expansion. Still, Vietnam represents a far smaller market than India, which has also been wooing large foreign companies, including Tesla (TSLA), to set up factories in the country.\nFor now, Vietnam's attractiveness to foreign firms is 'more around supply than demand,' says Ives at Wedbush Securities, while, for India, it encompasses both.\nJuliana Liu contributed reporting.\nJuliana Liu contributed reporting.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"tech","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Anna Cooban,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2147845450.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":3.4952123,"_id":"a07e7cdcdff92d52e83dd8d835b9e6f9"},{"title":"Day 3 of Trump New York hush money trial","author":"'S Jeremy Herb","published_date":"2024-04-18 11:53:41","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-04-18-24/h_714a02da23570de025e2dd4792b50a1b","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Seven jurors were seated in Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial Tuesday.

Please scroll through the posts below to learn about the third day of Trump's trial in New York. 11 hr 48 min ago Seven jurors were seated in Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial Tuesday. Here's what we know about them: The first seated juror, who will be the foreperson on Trump's jury, is a man originally from Ireland. He works in sales and has some college education. He is married but doesn't have kids. He reads The New York Times and Daily Mail and watches some Fox News and MSNBC. The second juror is an oncology nurse who lives with her fianc\u00e9. She's a native New Yorker. She reads The New York Times and watches CNN. The third seated juror is a corporate lawyer. He's originally from Oregon. He gets his news from The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Google. He's a younger man who's never been married and doesn't have kids. The fourth juror is an older man originally Puerto Rico who's married with adult children and two grandkids. When asked about his hobbies, he said, \"I guess my hobby is my family.\" He has an IT business for training and consulting and attended one year of college. He told the court he finds Trump fascinating and mysterious. 'So many people are set off one way or the other and that is interesting,' the man said. 'Really, this one guy can do all of this, wow.' Trump 'makes things interesting,' the man said, but also didn't indicate any strong feelings about his politics. The fifth juror is a young Black woman who teaches English language in a public charter school system. She has a master's degree in education, is not married and doesn't have any kids. The juror said that as a person of color she has friends who have strong opinions on Trump, but she personally is not a political person. She said she tries to avoid political conversations and doesn't really care for the news. The juror did say she appreciates Trump's candor: 'President Trump speaks his mind and I'd rather that than someone who's in office who you don't know what they're thinking.\" She was also the only juror of 18 in the box Tuesday morning who said she wasn't aware that Trump is facing charges in other criminal cases. The sixth juror is a software engineer at a large broadcast company who recently graduated from college. She voiced no strong feelings about Donald Trump one way or the other and said, 'I will be fair and impartial.\" She is not married and has no kids, currently living with three roommates in Chelsea. The juror gets her news from The New York Times, Google, Facebook and TikTok. She asked the judge whether her sister's wedding on a Sunday in September would be a scheduling conflict. Merchan quipped, 'If we were still here in September that would be a big problem,' garnering laughs in the courtroom. The seventh juror is a civil litigator who is married with two kids and lives on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. Originally from North Carolina, he reads The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, New York Post and The Washington Post. He said he has \"political views as to the Trump presidency\" and that he thinks there were likely Trump administration policies he disagreed with. \"I don't know the man and I don't have opinions about him personally,\" he said. \"I certainly follow the news, I'm aware there are other lawsuits out there. But I'm not sure that I know anyone's character.\" 11 hr 50 min ago From CNN's Aditi Sangal Former President Donald Trump awaits the start of proceedings at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York on Tuesday. Mary Altaffer/Pool/AP Before Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial began, experts had deemed that selecting a jury would be a long and challenging task. But seven jurors had already been seated by the end of Day 2. Five more jurors, as well as six alternates, are required for jury selection to conclude. 'Remember, the tactic here from defense counsel for months and months, it was to delay this trial. This pace is absolutely antithetical to trying to delay that process. In other words, this defendant, Donald Trump, has the pacing of most defendants who are charged with the crime in New York City,' CNN chief legal analyst Laura Coates said Tuesday. Remember: For months now, Trump's team has pushed to delay the New York trial, as part of the former president's broader strategy of trying to push back all four of his trials until after the 2024 election. 11 hr 53 min ago From CNN's Kara Scannell, Jeremy Herb, Lauren del Valle, Julian Cummings and Laura Dolan Former US President Donald Trump attends the first day of his trial at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City on April 15. Angela Weiss/Pool/Getty Images Donald Trump has faced three civil trials in New York since he left the White House, but this is the first time he faces possible jail time. The former president is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, stemming from reimbursements made to his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen for hush money payments he made before the 2016 election to an adult film star alleging an affair with Trump. The former president has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair with Stormy Daniels. Each count represents a separate instance of the alleged misconduct, pointing to different business records associated with a series of repayments to Cohen (ledger entries, checks, stubs, invoices, etc.) that were allegedly falsified to conceal his criminal conduct. Penalty: The maximum penalty for each count is four years in state prison. However, the judge has discretion on how long any sentence should be and whether to allow any sentences to be served consecutively. He could also sentence Trump to probation. New York caps sentencing for this type of felony at 20 years. A president has no authority to pardon state crimes. 11 hr 57 min ago From CNN's Maureen Chowdhury Kara McGee speaks with CNN on Tuesday. Kara McGee, a juror dismissed from the hush money criminal trial, told CNN Tuesday she wasn't sure if she was being considered for the case against Donald Trump until she walked into the courtroom and saw the former president. \"So yeah, it was when we walked into the courtroom and saw him that it was \u2014 that I was sure, that it was definitely this case,\" McGee said. She said that Trump made eye contact with her, which she said was \"odd.\" McGee said that it was a fascinating experience because on the one hand, she was aware that \"this is history in the making and whatever the outcome of this is, everything going forward will be affected by it\" and at the same time she walked into the courtroom and saw Trump sitting there and realized, \"Oh it's just a guy ... he's just a dude.\" McGee said that she believes she was dismissed because of her answer to a question regarding additional things that may impact her ability to serve on the jury. McGee said she mentioned her work schedule conflicting with her being able to be in court from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. for an extended period of time. She said she was dismissed right after that question, even though they did not specify why she was dismissed. 12 hr 1 min ago From CNN's Kaanita Iyer Donald Trump's legal team is frustrated after one juror was dismissed for having a pro-Trump bias, CNN's Kristen Holmes reported. The former president's attorneys have been concerned about the political makeup of Manhattan and worried that they were not going to get anyone sympathetic to Trump, according to Holmes. The defense team is not optimistic that it is going to win this case outright, Holmes says, but they are trying to get at least one sympathetic juror to try and aim for a hung jury. Remember: A unanimous verdict is required for conviction. 12 hr 4 min ago From CNN's Lauren del Valle, Jhasua Razo and Gillian Roberts Former President Donald Trump's first criminal trial is expected to take six to eight weeks from start to finish. This trial, related to a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016, is the first of four ongoing criminal cases that are expected to head to trial for the presumptive 2024 GOP presidential nominee. Read more about the stages of the case, and what they mean here. 12 hr 19 min ago The identities of the jurors will remain anonymous, but are known to the attorneys on both sides. On Monday, former President Donald Trump's attorney Todd Blanche asked Judge Juan Merchan how attorneys will get the names of the jury pool. Merchan said he will give them copies of jury lists with just numbers and a single copy with names and numbers. He told the lawyers the jurors are not to be photographed. 12 hr 34 min ago From CNN's Amy O'Kruk and Curt Merrill Former President Donald Trump was first indicted in March 2023 by the Manhattan district attorney on state charges related to a hush money payment to an adult film star in 2016. As the case goes to trial, catch up on the key people in the case below: 12 hr 37 min ago An exhaustive process is underway to seat 12 jurors , along with six alternates, for Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial. The judge released the questionnaire that will be presented to potential jurors, which contains multiple questions that could signal political views to the lawyers on both sides. Here's what potential jurors could be asked about: News consumption.\nAffiliations with groups like the Proud Boys, QAnon and Antifa.\nWhether they or anyone in their circle attended a Trump rally or an anti-Trump event.\nIf they've ever read books or listened to podcasts from Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and a key witness for the district attorney.\nIf they've read any of Trump's own books.\nIf they have views on whether a former president can be charged in state court.\nIf they have views on how Trump is being treated in this case. Why does this matter: The questions will be used for the judge to strike jurors at the outset, if they don't believe they can render a verdict fairly. They will also be used by lawyers for both sides to strike jurors for any reason \u2014 a key part of the jury selection process.\nWhere things stand: The full 12-person jury has been seated in Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial.

Received wisdom is that he is hanging on as long as possible to avoid a catastrophic loss that could force his party into a decade of political irrelevance. The assumption is that the longer he leaves it, the better the chance he can turn public opinion around.\nThe problem for Sunak is that everything he does seems to backfire in some way.\nTake an example from this week: his world-leading smoking ban, which, if approved by parliament's upper house, will be a key part of his political legacy.\nIt was only voted through by MPs because it has the support of the opposition Labour Party. Members of his own cabinet \u2013 mostly those considered to be eyeing up his job \u2013 voted against the legislation. His two predecessors publicly ridiculed him. Former PM Boris Johnson told a Canadian audience: 'The party of Winston Churchill wants to ban [cigars]? Donnez-moi un break, as they say in Quebec. It's just mad.'\nLiz Truss, who had spent the week lobbing grenades at Sunak in the guise of promoting her new book, called the ban a 'virtue-signalling piece of legislation.'\nIn total, nearly half of Sunak's MPs failed to vote in favor of the plan, an astonishing open display of division for the Conservatives, who used to call themselves the natural party of government. Allies of Sunak deny it, but the idea that he has any authority over his party, his government or his country is increasingly laughable.\nHe seems to have bad luck. This week, for example, inflation fell and his flagship immigration policy took a step closer to becoming legislation. Instead of headlines championing these successes, the political agenda was dominated for days by the launch of Truss's book.\nSome of the bad luck he creates himself. Last month, his party's deputy chairman left the Conservatives to join rival right-wing party Reform UK. Lee Anderson was a key ally for the prime minister, as he represented something Sunak himself cannot.\nthe prime minister, as he represented something Sunak himself cannot. Anderson is a working-class former miner who is from a part of the country that traditionally votes for the opposition Labour Party. Indeed, Anderson used to be a Labour politician. Brexit, among other things, pushed many of these traditional Labour voters to the right, leading to many of them supporting the Conservative Party in 2019.\nSunak, a privately-educated multi-millionaire tech bro, doesn't immediately appeal to these voters for obvious reasons. However, Anderson was suspended from the Conservative Party after making comments about the Muslim mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, that Sunak clearly believed were beyond the pale. Shortly after this, Anderson made a high-profile defection to a party that is a large obstacle to the Conservatives performing well at the next election.\nOf course, Sunak could have chosen to not make Anderson, who has a history of saying controversial things and embarrassing those around him, deputy party chairman. But he did and now that decision looks ridiculous, as Anderson publicly campaigns against his former boss on a daily basis.\nSunak has a habit of keeping people around him who are likely to cause him pain. He had to sack his former home secretary, Suella Braverman, after she wrote an article for a newspaper criticizing the police without the approval of the PM. Following her dismissal, Braverman accused Sunak of 'betrayal' over migration policy.\nBraverman accused Sunak of 'betrayal' over migration policy. Over time, Sunak has been outflanked on the right by members of his own party so often that he no longer has any authority among the most Conservative voters. He is bizarrely seen as a soft Conservative compared to someone like Johnson, despite his personal politics on many issues being way to Johnson's right.\nThis stuff may all sound a little in the weeds, but over time, Sunak's authority has been heavily eroded. A former government official told CNN: 'The Conservatives just feel dead overall, there is nothing to be done to save it. There is no way back and it's coming across in every little thing. Rishi comes across as unlikeable and a bit weird and tetchy.'\nIt's hard to argue with that analysis. The polls never seem to improve. Every positive comes with a heavy caveat. Another example: Next week, his controversial policy of sending asylum-seekers to Rwanda while their claims are processed will, probably, finally pass parliament. The most immediate impact of the bill, however, has been a surge in the very same small boat crossings he is determined to halt \u2013 up 56% in the first three months of 2024, according to the EU's Frontex border agency.\nEuropean officials privately attribute this to people knowing the bill is likely to pass and that it's going to be harder to enter the UK. So they are rushing in now while they believe they still can. But the nuance of that will be lost on voters who want to see migration fall. They will just see a 56% increase and a new policy that has insufficient time to make a difference before the next election.\n56% increase and a new policy that has insufficient time to make a difference before the next election. This is probably what the next six months looks like for Sunak. He will try and offer tax cuts that won't be enough for the right of his party. He will make promises on red-meat right-wing issues that will be ridiculed as weak by people like Braverman and Truss.\nTruss, of course, is probably most famous for being the shortest-serving PM in history. Her legacy is forever tied to a comedy lettuce that a newspaper editor bet would outlast her (it did). When even she is openly making fun of you, things must be really bad.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Luke McGee,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231218145257-02-2024-uk-election.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":3.3693452,"_id":"be37b974f09a374e9494c3fb13a0b2f6"},{"title":"Jane Goodall is world-famous for her work with chimpanzees.

Shortly after this, Anderson made a high-profile defection to a party that is a large obstacle to the Conservatives performing well at the next election.\nOf course, Sunak could have chosen to not make Anderson, who has a history of saying controversial things and embarrassing those around him, deputy party chairman. But he did and now that decision looks ridiculous, as Anderson publicly campaigns against his former boss on a daily basis.\nSunak has a habit of keeping people around him who are likely to cause him pain. He had to sack his former home secretary, Suella Braverman, after she wrote an article for a newspaper criticizing the police without the approval of the PM. Following her dismissal, Braverman accused Sunak of 'betrayal' over migration policy.\nBraverman accused Sunak of 'betrayal' over migration policy. Over time, Sunak has been outflanked on the right by members of his own party so often that he no longer has any authority among the most Conservative voters. He is bizarrely seen as a soft Conservative compared to someone like Johnson, despite his personal politics on many issues being way to Johnson's right.\nThis stuff may all sound a little in the weeds, but over time, Sunak's authority has been heavily eroded. A former government official told CNN: 'The Conservatives just feel dead overall, there is nothing to be done to save it. There is no way back and it's coming across in every little thing. Rishi comes across as unlikeable and a bit weird and tetchy.'\nIt's hard to argue with that analysis. The polls never seem to improve. Every positive comes with a heavy caveat. Another example: Next week, his controversial policy of sending asylum-seekers to Rwanda while their claims are processed will, probably, finally pass parliament. The most immediate impact of the bill, however, has been a surge in the very same small boat crossings he is determined to halt \u2013 up 56% in the first three months of 2024, according to the EU's Frontex border agency.\nEuropean officials privately attribute this to people knowing the bill is likely to pass and that it's going to be harder to enter the UK. So they are rushing in now while they believe they still can. But the nuance of that will be lost on voters who want to see migration fall. They will just see a 56% increase and a new policy that has insufficient time to make a difference before the next election.\n56% increase and a new policy that has insufficient time to make a difference before the next election. This is probably what the next six months looks like for Sunak. He will try and offer tax cuts that won't be enough for the right of his party. He will make promises on red-meat right-wing issues that will be ridiculed as weak by people like Braverman and Truss.\nTruss, of course, is probably most famous for being the shortest-serving PM in history. Her legacy is forever tied to a comedy lettuce that a newspaper editor bet would outlast her (it did). When even she is openly making fun of you, things must be really bad.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Luke McGee,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231218145257-02-2024-uk-election.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":3.3504078,"_id":"13f3560fcd2d52fb02a07d51eea4776c"},{"title":"What is mezcal, and why is it so popular?","author":"Tobey Grumet Segal","published_date":"2024-04-15 14:43:21","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/health-fitness/what-is-mezcal","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Mezcal is a smoky twist on traditional tequila and there's a reason everyone is drinking it \u2014 here's everything you need to know to start sipping the popular spirit.","summary":"Mezcal is having a moment. And whether you're ordering this 500-year-old agave-based spirit at a bar or mixing cocktails at home, there's no denying that mezcal offers a fresh, nuanced and trendy twist on traditional tequila.\nFirst things first. What exactly is mezcal and what makes it so titillating to the average sipper? According to Marshall Minaya, beverage director of agave-forward cocktail den and restaurant Lolita in midtown Manhattan, mezcal is described simply as anything that can be distilled from the agave plant. 'As of now, to be donned \u2018mezcal' it must be produced in the following 10 states in Mexico: Oaxaca, Durango, Tamaulipas, Michoacan, Guanajuato, Guerrero, San Luis Potosi, Puebla, Zacatecas [and] Sinaloa,' Minaya says.\nYet, mezcal's real appeal comes from its complex, versatile and slightly smoky characteristics. 'Post-Covid, industry professionals and consumers alike wanted new, interesting, artisanal and culture-forward beverages. Mezcal delivers on all these fronts and more,' says wine/spirits educator and sommelier Erlinda A. Doherty.\nWhat is the difference between mezcal and tequila?\nTrying to wrap your head around the distinctions between these Mexican-born spirits? Though mezcal is produced across the country using any local agave, there are rules and regulations that differentiate the two as well \u2014 and it all comes down to raw ingredients and production methods.\n'All tequilas are mezcals, while not all mezcals are tequilas,' says Richie Barrow, group food and beverage general manager of Hero Bar in Nairobi, Kenya. 'Mezcal is the category of spirits made with the use of agave (some 40-plus varieties, including blue agave), while tequila is a spirit that must legally be made from a minimum of 51% blue agave and must come from one of five authorized states in Mexico. This is also part of mezcal's charm and gives it a vast variety of flavors depending on the area, elevation or altitude it might have come from.'\nAs for how they're crafted? 'Where mezcal traditionally involves roasting the agave hearts in underground pits, giving its characteristic smoky flavor, tequila utilizes industrial ovens or autoclaves for cooking the agave,' says Bruno Sanchez, director of food and beverage at The Alida in Savannah, Georgia. 'It also includes the usage of tahona once the hearts are roasted and other variances during the production.'\nLastly, mezcal must be produced following required small-batch regulations, while tequila is generally produced on a larger scale, using industrial and mechanized processes. Additionally, it's worth noting that tequila allows for additives, colorings and flavorings, while mezcal prohibits such additions, according to Doherty.\nAll of this should help explain why, in addition to its smoky profile, mezcal tends to be more savory and earthy \u2014 the irresistible bad boy of the region \u2014 while tequila generally offers a more sophisticated sip. According to Jose R. Rodriguez, general manager of COA at Dorado Beach in Puerto Rico, 'Tequila tends to be sweeter, smoother and fruitier \u2014 getting its complexity mainly from oak aging.'\nHow to choose a mezcal\nThe first thing to look for when buying mezcal at home is a proper birthright. 'I would suggest always making sure you are buying authentic mezcal, prioritizing bottles made from 100% agave, with a single variety or blend depending on your preference, and the usage of traditional methods. Ensure the mezcal carries certification labels like \u2018Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen' (DO) or \u2018Comisi\u00f3n Reguladora del Mezcal' (CRM) to guarantee quality and origin,' says Sanchez.\nYou'll also want to check on things like proof and price. 'We want to taste agave spirits the way the mezcaleros intended, instead of the cheapest, easiest way to be able to export it. Anywhere above 46% ABV is always a good sign. Price is also important. Anything below $30 retail is concerning, from the production and agriculture point of view,' says Cristhian Rodriguez, beverage director at elNico Restaurant and Bar in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.\nAnd, lest you forget, you'll want to figure out your individual preference when it comes to level of smokiness. 'What might be too smoky for you may not be too smoky for someone else,' says James Grant, director of mixology for the Fairmont Royal York. 'With mezcal, the fact that we can have such a huge range means that there is probably something for everyone.'\nEditors' favorite mezcals\nReady to get out there and join the mezcal revolution? Here are four of our favorite bottles you can nab right now.\nMezcal Amar\u00e1s Cupreata\nAmaras Crafted from a bunch of different species of agave from the subtropical forests of the Rio Balsas basin, this crystal-clear mezcal is low on the smoke scale, with a whiff of herbs and pepper at its nose, and a complex taste of pumpkin seeds and dark chocolate. This is the perfect spirit for mezcal beginners because it won't fight too hard with mixers. Plus, you'll be rewarded with a slightly spicy finish. This is our favorite mezcal to mix up a classic margarita, though we like to hold the sweeter triple sec to enjoy the ambient smokiness.\nFrom $67 at ReserveBar\nCatedral de mi Padre Espadin Mezcal\nReserveBar This mezcal, produced in Oaxaca, combines scientific research with tradition \u2014 building a plant laboratory next to the distillery to better cultivate agave plants. We love Catedral Espadin because its first note is slightly herbaceous with a touch of sweet agave, but you'll get a punch of jalape\u00f1o on that first taste, with a pleasing, lingering wallop of the smoke we expect. Our suggestion? Get out the Bloody Mary mix and make it a Maria for a more complex crowd-pleaser.\nFrom $69 at ReserveBar\nDos Hombres Joven Mezcal\nDos Hombres Breaking bad never tasted so good, especially when the dos hombres in question are Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. And you can join them in enjoying this Oaxacan-produced mezcal, blended from Espadin agave. The agave for their mezcal must grow for at least six years before it is cooked in earthen pits of hot stones for four days, then mashed by a traditional stone wheel. All this lends itself to a super-smooth, clear spirit that starts with a sweet, fruity nose. The taste itself is gently woody, giving way to a restrained campfire kick \u2014 taking us back to our first trip under the stars. We especially like mixing this mezcal with fresh grapefruit juice, lime and a splash of seltzer for a smoky take on a paloma.\nFrom $68 at ReserveBar","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"science","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Tobey Grumet Segal","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/best-mezcal-cnnu.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNUnderscored","_score":3.2555609,"_id":"f9872cb2aea9fe0f1d72d3e6a0d84083"},{"title":"Missed communications and blocked evacuation routes: New report details problems and heroism from Maui's disastrous wildfires","author":"Holly Yan","published_date":"2024-04-17 15:53:03","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/17/us/hawai-maui-wildfire-report/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"An investigation of the catastrophic Maui wildfires that killed 101 people, destroyed hundreds of homes and left $6 billion in damages reveals a spate of problems with emergency preparation and\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 An investigation of the catastrophic Maui wildfires that killed 101 people, destroyed hundreds of homes and left $6 billion in damages reveals a spate of problems with emergency preparation and coordination before and during the disaster.\nAmong them: Chief officers and some Maui Fire Department staff used 'WhatsApp' for situational awareness updates, but not everyone in the department used the app. And there was 'minimal' pre-positioning of staff and equipment after the National Weather Service issued a red flag warning prior to the four major wildfires breaking out on August 8, 2023.\nBut the new 84-page report produced by the Western Fire Chiefs Association also acknowledges the 'whole island's limited resources, which were extremely challenged by the scope and scale of the collective incidents.'\n'After conducting over 200 interviews and reviewing numerous data sets, it is clear that the four major wildfires pushed the (Maui Fire Department) to an unprecedented level of strain. Despite this, the collective actions by MFD and law enforcement saved many lives and property across the island,' the report says.\n'Nearly every staff member and vehicle resource of MFD on Maui was deployed. The emergency response system did not break but rather it found itself outmatched by the extreme weather and fire conditions. Staff members endured shifts of 36 hours or more and risked their lives in a valiant effort to stop the spread of the fires and save lives.'\nThe report was released one day before Hawaii's Attorney General Anne Lopez is expected to announce the first wave of findings from an investigation by her office and the Fire Safety Research Institute on Wednesday.\nBut already, the fire chief association's report has revealed a host of challenges \u2013 as well as 111 recommendations on how to help prevent or mitigate such disasters in the future.\nWhat the 84-page report found \u2013 'Calls and text messages serve as the primary communication methods to staff up vehicles,' the report says. 'Some staff members were not contacted and remained unaware of ongoing incident activities. Chief Officers and certain MFD staff utilize the \u2018WhatsApp' application for situational awareness updates, but its usage is not universal across the department.'\nThe report suggested creating an automated system to notify all staff of a major deployment and allow battalion chiefs to take command vehicles home 'so off-duty BCs can readily respond from their residence' during urgent events.\n\u2013 'There are no formal County inter-island or State mutual aid agreements among fire departments, resulting in a cumbersome and slow process for relocating equipment,' the report says. 'However, additional staffing during adverse times can really make a difference, especially for supporting firefighting operations.'\nThe report recommends creating a statewide mutual aid agreement as well as an 'inter-island engine fleet program, where the State procures and maintains a specified number of Type 3, Type 4-6 engines for shared use on each island. Standardizing the model/type ensures consistency in training and operations across islands.'\n\u2013 After the National Weather Service issued a red flag warning on August 5 for August 7-9, 'there was minimal upstaffing and pre-positioning of resources,' the report says.\n'Battalion Chiefs initiated upstaffing for some resources on the morning of August 8' \u2013 the day the four major wildfires ignited.\n'Battalion Chiefs initiated upstaffing for some resources on the morning of August 8' \u2013 the day the four major wildfires ignited. The report recommends creating an intelligence center 'to continually monitor current and predicted emergency events and facilitate the sharing of relevant data' and 'Upstaff and preposition appropriate resources based upon intelligence briefings.\n\u2013 The public's awareness and understanding of wildfire risks are also paramount. 'Like on the mainland, staff, policymakers, and the public may not see the escalating wildfire issues until an emergency incident unfolds, as observed in August,' the report says.\n'A myriad of studies since 2010 have delved into topics such as climate change, fuel conditions, and the growing workload demands for firefighters. Policymakers face the challenge of deciding whether public education alone will suffice or if there's a necessity for policy and enforcement changes to better address the wildfire problem.'\n\u2013 The report noted multiple challenges surrounding evacuations \u2013 including communication problems and obstacles that hindered or blocked evacuations.\n'On August 8, evacuation routes across the island were obstructed by downed power poles, trees, and wires, exacerbating pre-existing challenges with accessing and leaving areas,' the report says.\n'MFD requested law enforcement to facilitate evacuations over the radio. Although law enforcement was part of the ICS structure, lack of co-location at Incident Command Posts (ICP) was partly attributed to the dynamic nature of the incidents and available staffing.'\nThe report suggests working with law enforcement and state emergency management officials 'to identify key access routes and develop contingency plans.'\n'Upon identifying key access routes, collaborate with the Hawaiian Electric Company to relocate adjacent infrastructure, potentially underground, to enhance the safety of evacuation routes,' the report says.\nIn addition, the report says trying to communicate evacuations 'to a transient tourist population that speaks multiple languages poses a significant challenge.'\nIt recommends collaborating with state emergency management officials about evacuation notifications in multiple languages\nWhile questions remain, changes are already underway Seven months after the calamitous wildfires, it's still unclear what caused the most devastating inferno \u2013 the Lahaina fire \u2013 that killed 101 people and scorched thousands of acres.\n'That is still under investigation with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives,' Maui Fire Department Chief Brad Ventura said Tuesday.\nThe fire chief lauded his firefighters for saving many lives despite personal tragedy.\n'There were firefighters fighting the fires in Lahaina as they well knew their homes were burning down at that very moment,' Ventura said.\nVentura was the fire official who commissioned the independent, 84-page report focusing on his department's challenges and suggestions for improvement.\nThe after-action report praised the Maui Fire Department's initiative in trying to improve.\n'We commend MFD for their swift actions to address the issues identified in this AAR, rather than waiting for AAR recommendations,' the report says.\nFor example, the Maui Fire Department has already worked with law enforcement to review new evacuation software, made plans for upstaffing during red flag warnings and committed to a fleet replacement program, the report says.\n'We trust that this report will contribute to the recovery process, prompting actions and public policies that enhance preparedness for future major incidents.'\nCNN's Pete Burn contributed to this report.\nCNN's Pete Burn contributed to this report.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Holly Yan","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1623484398.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":3.247287,"_id":"9ca7a53996faf68203ff841910291cf6"},{"title":"Opinion: There's no excuse for \u2018death to America' chants, and Dearborn agrees","author":"Dean Obeidallah","published_date":"2024-04-15 19:11:54","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/15/opinions/death-to-america-chants-palestinian-rally-dearborn-obeidallah","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The response of Arab and Muslim leaders who vocally slammed the chant by a few attendees at a pro-Palestinian rally was vitally important, writes Dean Obeidallah.","summary":"Editor's Note: Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program 'The Dean Obeidallah Show.'

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 People at rallies are obviously capable of yelling out whatever they want. It's how leaders of the event and the community involved respond that is defining. That is why the response of local Arab and Muslim leaders who vocally slammed a 'death to America' chant by a few attendees at an April 5 rally in Dearborn, Michigan, was so vitally important.\nThis despicable chant was heard as part of an annual Al Quds Day (Jerusalem Day) event intended to show support for Palestinians. This year, given Hamas' brutal October 7 terrorist attack and the war in Gaza in response that has seen thousands of Palestinian civilians killed including an estimated 13,000 children, the utter devastation of large swaths of Palestinian homes and the onset of famine confirmed by USAID, passions were undoubtedly very high.\nBut still there is absolutely no place for a chant in Arabic of 'death to America' \u2014 nor for 'death to Israel' \u2014 that was started by one person who event organizers said was 'unaffiliated and unknown' to them.\nThe video of this chant was shared by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), whose executive director Steven Stalinsky wrote a February Wall Street Journal op-ed titled 'Welcome to Dearborn, America's Jihad Capital' that sparked a backlash. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said the op-ed was a 'really abhorrent' piece and 'total misrepresentation' of that community's Arab Americans and President Joe Biden declared that 'blaming a group of people based on the words of a small few is wrong' and 'can lead to Islamophobia and anti-Arab hate, and it shouldn't happen to the residents of Dearborn \u2014 or any American town.'\nSo when MEMRI circulated the rally video, it was especially telling that the leaders of Dearborn didn't attack the messenger. Instead, they denounced the horrible message of the chant at the Al Quds event.\nDearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud responded on social media to the video in which 'some attendees were chanting statements that were unacceptable and contrary to the heart of this city.' He added, 'Dearborn is a city of proud Americans; the hateful rhetoric heard on [April 5] does not reflect the opinion of the members of this community.'\nImad Hamad, the executive director of the American Human Rights Council in Dearborn, was at the rally and responded to the chant with a statement released on behalf of a group of Arab American and Muslim leaders. 'We, as a community, unequivocally denounce the inflammatory speeches and chants that emerged from that gathering\u2026 your messages of extremism do not resonate with us,' said the joint statement. 'In condemning these actions, we reaffirm our commitment to Dearborn as a city that embodies diversity and inclusivity.'\nOsama Siblani, a well-known Arab American activist in the area who was also involved with the AHRC statement and is publisher of the Dearborn-based Arab American News, wrote on Facebook, 'To the speakers who incited the despicable chants at the alQuds rally in Dearborn last Friday\u2026 Your pathetic ill speeches and the disgusting chants that you incited and invited are totally and unequivocally rejected by all Arab Americans and Muslims in Dearborn and everywhere.' He added, 'Dearborn is the Arab American capital and has no place for people like you. It is a diverse and a proud city and will continue to be a welcoming city that represents the hope and aspiration of all its residents regardless of their ethnicity, religion or color.'\nAnd the organization that sponsored the event, Al Quds Committee Detroit, responded that the comments were 'wrongful' and 'a mistake.' One of the organizers of the event, Sheikh Usama Abdulghani \u2014 who was born in Washington, DC, and educated in Iran on Islamic law \u2014 said in a video response that 'we were all quite surprised when on the (Al) Quds Day rally, someone who was in the rally started chanting \u2018death to America.'' He added, 'Why would somebody do that on this day?'\nAs someone active in both the Arab and Muslim American communities who has spoken at and attended hundreds of events in recent years, I've never heard anyone say or chant either 'death to America' or 'death to Israel.' And if anyone did, the backlash would be swift.\nCriticism of the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration \u2014 especially now given the horrific suffering his military has caused to innocent people in Gaza \u2014 is more than justified, it's demanded of all who value humanity. And the freedom to criticize Biden or any US president's policies with which a person doesn't agree is a cornerstone of our democratic republic.\nBut language that dehumanizes and creates a climate of hate or fear must be denounced as it was in Dearborn by Arab and Muslim American leaders.\nIt's also vital that hate peddled by foreign actors that can impact communities in the United States be loudly condemned, whether it's antisemitic speech from Iran or the demonization of Muslims and Arabs by Israeli extremists. That's why it was important that we saw the Biden administration condemn chants of 'death to Arabs' by thousands of right-wing Israelis in May 2023 as part of that nation's Jerusalem Day celebration. This annual event marks the day the Israeli military captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war. Last year's Jerusalem Day march featured thousands of Jewish supremacists taunting Palestinian Christians and Muslims with chants like 'may your village burn.'\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook While such vile chants by right-wing Israelis have been heard for years in Israel \u2014 even at sporting events \u2014 last year's Jerusalem Day rally was even more alarming given a member of Netanyahu's cabinet, national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who was convicted in 2007 of inciting racism against Arabs in Israel and supporting a terrorist organization with a sign at a protest, marched along with these hate-filled bigots. And the day after the rally marked by these despicable taunts that grabbed headlines, Netanyahu didn't denounce the hate but instead called the march 'a splendid day on which to celebrate our return to our eternal capital.'\nPassion and the Middle East conflict go hand in hand. But when that passion manifests as hate and dehumanization it must be loudly denounced. That is true regardless of who is the person or group peddling the toxic message. Dearborn leaders showed how to take a stand and not tolerate this kind of message in their own community.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Dean Obeidallah","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1923247729.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":3.247287,"_id":"3fc2a7cd4b226ba3a1709792845969c6"},{"title":"Promises Joe Biden has made so far in his campaign for a second term","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-20 13:13:05","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/04/politics/biden-campaign-promises-dg","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The president has made a number of promises on the campaign trail. Here are some of the policies Biden says he would enact if elected for a second term.","summary":"President Joe Biden's main pitch to voters ahead of November is simple: They should vote for him because he is not Donald Trump. In speeches and political events since his reelection campaign began in earnest earlier this year, Biden had said that his second term would essentially be a continuation of his first: 'Let's finish this job,' Biden said in a video announcing his reelection campaign last year. In making his case to voters, Biden has contrasted his own ideas of governance with Trump's stated plans to drastically alter how the federal government works, how executive power would be used and how America's role on the world stage will change if the former president wins a second term. Biden, meanwhile, has promised to protect American democracy, pass a federal law to codify the right to an abortion into law, preserve the country's international alliances and agreements and deliver on climate benchmarks. His ability to deliver on these promises even if he wins a second term, though, is not a certainty. Many of his more lofty ambitions would require congressional approval and action. In some of his most significant and enduring acts as president, Trump appointed three conservative nominees to the Supreme Court. The ensuing right-wing supermajority paved the way for the court's 2022 decision that overturned Roe. V Wade, which had enshrined the right to an abortion in federal law for nearly half a century. Biden has made the court's decision, and Trump's repeated promises to go further in restricting abortion access if he were to win in November, a centerpiece of his reelection campaign. 'Like most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right,' Biden said during his State of the Union address on March 7. '\u2026 But my predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. He's the reason it was overturned \u2014 in fact, he brags about it.' 'Look at the chaos that has resulted,' Biden added. During the speech, Biden promised to codify the abortion-related protections enshrined in Roe v. Wade into federal law if he wins a second term, but he acknowledged that would require the cooperation of a Democratic-controlled Congress. 'If Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again,' Biden said. Biden called for codifying Roe into law when he was running for president in 2020. While seeking office in 2020, Biden made ambitious climate-related promises, warning that climate change presents an existential threat to humanity. Some of those promises panned out: Biden's landmark legislative achievements, the bipartisan infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act, include hundreds of billions of dollars to encourage clean energy production and the manufacturing of electric vehicles. Pollution-falling emissions fell by 2% in the United States last year. Activists on Biden's left flank still think the president has not done enough \u2014 they want Biden to declare a climate emergency that would free up federal resources to confront climate change. Biden will need more time to fulfill some of his other pledges, including cutting emissions in half by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, and having a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. Biden said the 2020 race was a 'battle for the soul of the nation.' Now, he has made preserving democracy the focal point of his 2024 campaign \u2014 saying the value Americans place on a free and democratic society is the most important question of our country's time. He lays out the stakes in stark terms: If Trump wins a second term, the United States will face a crisis that could lead to the erosion of democratic norms. 'Not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault here at home as they are today,' Biden said during his State of the Union address last month. Today, he warned, there are 'forces taking us back in time.' Biden urged Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. The acts, which would have made Election Day a federal holiday, bolstered voting-related security measures, allowed all voters to request mail-in ballots and updated parts of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, were blocked by Senate Republicans in 2021. 'Pass and send me the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act,' Biden told Congress during his address, 'and stop denying another core value of America \u2014 our diversity across American life.' Biden has criticized Republican-led drives to ban certain books from public schools. 'Banning books \u2013 it's wrong,' he said in his State of the Union address. The United States, he said, shouldn't be erasing history. In the same speech, Biden also called for expanded pre-kindergarten for 3- and 4-year-olds, along with raises for teachers in public schools. He said he wants to continue making college more affordable by expanding access to Pell grants for working-class families, renewing a 2020 promise he made to double the grants' value. 'To remain the strongest economy in the world,' Biden said, 'we need the best education system in the world.' In some of his first actions as president, Biden worked to return the United States to the presence it held on the world stage before Trump became president. As president, Trump denigrated alliances like NATO and withdrew the United States from crucial international agreements, including the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accords. While running in 2020, Biden promised to undo damage wreaked by Trump on America's international partnerships. Biden has said he will continue to repair relationships that have faltered under Trump's control \u2014 and uphold American commitments to NATO and Ukraine. Trump, meanwhile, has said he would encourage Russia to do 'whatever the hell they want' to NATO-member countries who don't fulfill certain funding obligations. Biden frequently refers to those comments while speaking with supporters. 'The rest of the world is wondering what in the hell is happening to us,' Biden said at a campaign event in New York last month. 'And they're relieved, not because I'm so special but that I'm not Trump.' In an earlier Dallas fundraiser, Biden said the United States' international reputation was 'crushed when (Trump) was president.' 'Imagine what will happen if he's reelected,' Biden said. In 2022, Biden signed the most comprehensive gun-reform legislation in nearly 30 years. The law, passed shortly after a White supremacist massacred 10 people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket, allocated more than $750 million to help states implement crisis-intervention programs, closed certain loopholes in existing gun-control legislation and required more thorough reviews for people aged 18 to 21 who wanted to buy firearms. Biden has said he wants to go further. 'I'm demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,' Biden said at his State of the Union address. 'Pass universal background checks. None of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners.' He made a similar promise while running in 2020 but has not been able to get Congress' support. Biden has homed in on Trump's statements suggesting he would be open to cutting programs like Social Security and Medicare. In an interview with CNBC last month, Trump said: 'There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements,' Trump said on CNBC. Biden responded on X: 'Not on my watch.' He reiterated his vow to protect Social Security during his State of the Union address. 'Many of my Republican friends want to put Social Security on the chopping block,' Biden said 'If anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age I will stop them.' 'I will protect and strengthen Social Security and make the wealthy pay their fair share,' he added. ``\nPresident Joe Biden's main pitch to voters ahead of November is simple: They should vote for him because he is not Donald Trump.\nIn speeches and political events since his reelection campaign began in earnest earlier this year, Biden had said that his second term would essentially be a continuation of his first: 'Let's finish this job,' Biden said in a video announcing his reelection campaign last year.\nIn making his case to voters, Biden has contrasted his own ideas of governance with Trump's stated plans to drastically alter how the federal government works, how executive power would be used and how America's role on the world stage will change if the former president wins a second term.\nBiden, meanwhile, has promised to protect American democracy, pass a federal law to codify the right to an abortion into law, preserve the country's international alliances and agreements and deliver on climate benchmarks.\nHis ability to deliver on these promises even if he wins a second term, though, is not a certainty. Many of his more lofty ambitions would require congressional approval and action.\nIn some of his most significant and enduring acts as president, Trump appointed three conservative nominees to the Supreme Court. The ensuing right-wing supermajority paved the way for the court's 2022 decision that overturned Roe. V Wade, which had enshrined the right to an abortion in federal law for nearly half a century.\nBiden has made the court's decision, and Trump's repeated promises to go further in restricting abortion access if he were to win in November, a centerpiece of his reelection campaign.\n'Like most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right,' Biden said during his State of the Union address on March 7. '\u2026 But my predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. He's the reason it was overturned \u2014 in fact, he brags about it.'\n'Look at the chaos that has resulted,' Biden added.\nDuring the speech, Biden promised to codify the abortion-related protections enshrined in Roe v. Wade into federal law if he wins a second term, but he acknowledged that would require the cooperation of a Democratic-controlled Congress.\n'If Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again,' Biden said.\nBiden called for codifying Roe into law when he was running for president in 2020.\nWhile seeking office in 2020, Biden made ambitious climate-related promises, warning that climate change presents an existential threat to humanity.\nSome of those promises panned out: Biden's landmark legislative achievements, the bipartisan infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act, include hundreds of billions of dollars to encourage clean energy production and the manufacturing of electric vehicles. Pollution-falling emissions fell by 2% in the United States last year.\nActivists on Biden's left flank still think the president has not done enough \u2014 they want Biden to declare a climate emergency that would free up federal resources to confront climate change.\nBiden will need more time to fulfill some of his other pledges, including cutting emissions in half by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, and having a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.\nBiden said the 2020 race was a 'battle for the soul of the nation.' Now, he has made preserving democracy the focal point of his 2024 campaign \u2014 saying the value Americans place on a free and democratic society is the most important question of our country's time.\nHe lays out the stakes in stark terms: If Trump wins a second term, the United States will face a crisis that could lead to the erosion of democratic norms.\n'Not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault here at home as they are today,' Biden said during his State of the Union address last month. Today, he warned, there are 'forces taking us back in time.'\nBiden urged Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. The acts, which would have made Election Day a federal holiday, bolstered voting-related security measures, allowed all voters to request mail-in ballots and updated parts of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, were blocked by Senate Republicans in 2021.\n'Pass and send me the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act,' Biden told Congress during his address, 'and stop denying another core value of America \u2014 our diversity across American life.'\nBiden has criticized Republican-led drives to ban certain books from public schools.\n'Banning books \u2013 it's wrong,' he said in his State of the Union address. The United States, he said, shouldn't be erasing history.\nIn the same speech, Biden also called for expanded pre-kindergarten for 3- and 4-year-olds, along with raises for teachers in public schools.\nHe said he wants to continue making college more affordable by expanding access to Pell grants for working-class families, renewing a 2020 promise he made to double the grants' value.\n'To remain the strongest economy in the world,' Biden said, 'we need the best education system in the world.'\nIn some of his first actions as president, Biden worked to return the United States to the presence it held on the world stage before Trump became president. As president, Trump denigrated alliances like NATO and withdrew the United States from crucial international agreements, including the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accords.\nWhile running in 2020, Biden promised to undo damage wreaked by Trump on America's international partnerships. Biden has said he will continue to repair relationships that have faltered under Trump's control \u2014 and uphold American commitments to NATO and Ukraine.\nTrump, meanwhile, has said he would encourage Russia to do 'whatever the hell they want' to NATO-member countries who don't fulfill certain funding obligations. Biden frequently refers to those comments while speaking with supporters.\n'The rest of the world is wondering what in the hell is happening to us,' Biden said at a campaign event in New York last month. 'And they're relieved, not because I'm so special but that I'm not Trump.'\nIn an earlier Dallas fundraiser, Biden said the United States' international reputation was 'crushed when (Trump) was president.'\n'Imagine what will happen if he's reelected,' Biden said.\nIn 2022, Biden signed the most comprehensive gun-reform legislation in nearly 30 years.\nThe law, passed shortly after a White supremacist massacred 10 people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket, allocated more than $750 million to help states implement crisis-intervention programs, closed certain loopholes in existing gun-control legislation and required more thorough reviews for people aged 18 to 21 who wanted to buy firearms.\nBiden has said he wants to go further.\n'I'm demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,' Biden said at his State of the Union address. 'Pass universal background checks. None of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners.'\nHe made a similar promise while running in 2020 but has not been able to get Congress' support.\nBiden has homed in on Trump's statements suggesting he would be open to cutting programs like Social Security and Medicare.\nIn an interview with CNBC last month, Trump said: 'There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements,' Trump said on CNBC.

It was a swift warning that he would not tolerate any attempts to intimidate jurors \u2013 an issue that did not come up the rest of the day but will surely linger over the criminal trial, the first of a former US president.\nThe courtroom is dark on Wednesday \u2013 as is expected for the duration of the expected six-week trial \u2013 but jury selection will resume on Thursday with a new panel of 96 prospective jurors who could end up on the panel.\nHere are the takeaways from day 2 of the Trump hush money trial:\nSo far four men and three women have been selected to serve on the jury that will ultimately consider 34 counts of falsifying business records against Trump.\nA man originally from Ireland who works in sales in New York City was appointed as the jury foreperson, who essentially serves as the panel spokesperson.\nFive of the seven have a college degree or higher education. Two men on the panel are lawyers.\nAll but one juror empaneled Tuesday indicated that they're aware Trump is facing charges in other criminal cases. The woman was the only one of the 18 jurors questioned who said she wasn't aware of the other charges.\nNone of them shared particularly strong views about Trump or politics.\nWhen the attorneys finished questioning the first 18 jurors in a process known as voir dire, both sides were given the chance to ask the judge to dismiss jurors for cause.\nHaving jurors removed for cause is an important part of the process because each side is allowed to strike 10 jurors in total for any reason, in what are known as preemptory challenges. Jurors struck for cause by the judge do not count against those 10.\nRelated article How a trial works: Trump's first criminal case is in court\nRelated article How a trial works: Trump's first criminal case is in court Trump's side asked the judge to remove five jurors for cause, pointing to alleged anti-Trump social media posts and trying to argue that the jurors were unfairly biased against the former president.\nWhile the jurors in this case are anonymous to the public, the lawyers were given the identities of the first panel of 96 prospective jurors on Monday. That gave Trump's team the chance to mine their public social media postings to be ready for their challenges to the judge.\nWhen the former president's attorney Todd Blanche was questioning the jurors, he asked them one-by-one what they thought of Trump, outside of the case. He then tried to argue before the judge that many of the jurors' answers that they didn't have an opinion of Trump did not align with their social media.\nMerchan was generally skeptical, but he did agree on two counts that the jurors should be struck. One man had posted 'lock him up'on Facebook while Trump was president.\nAs for the three jurors Merchan did not strike: Trump's side used its preemptory challenges to remove all of them anyway. After Tuesday, both Trump's team and the district attorney's office have four preemptory challenges remaining each.\nTrump's courtroom conduct got him once again \u2013 briefly \u2013 in hot water with a judge.\nTrump was admonished for his conduct when Merchan brought in one of the jurors individually to discuss her social media posts raised by Trump's team, in which she videotaped celebrations in New York after Joe Biden won the 2020 election.\n'I very, very strongly believe that regardless of my thoughts about anyone or anything political, feelings or convictions, that the job of a juror is to understand the facts of a trial and to be the judge of those facts,' the juror said.\nAfter the juror left the courtroom, Merchan raised his voice and admonished Trump, saying he was was audibly speaking and gesturing in the direction of the juror.\n'Your client was audibly uttering,' Merchan told Blanche, raising his voice. 'I will not have any jurors intimidated in the courtroom.'\nThe moment passed without any further discussion, and the judge did not raise concerns about Trump's conduct when more jurors were brought in individually.\nBut it's a moment worth noting, as the judge has already expanded his gag order in the case barring Trump from speaking about witnesses, as well as family and staff of the district attorney's office and the court.\nAnd the district attorney is asking the judge next week to sanction Trump for violating that gag order, with $1,000 fines and a warning that future violations could result in imprisonment.\nThat hearing is next Tuesday, potentially just after the trial is underway.\nThe voir dire process, where the lawyers from both sides got 30 minutes to question potential jurors, previewed how the two sides are approaching the jury pool \u2013 and ultimately, the jury in the case.\nAssistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass walked the jurors through the case, while signaling how prosecutors will appeal to the jury at trial, noting that not all witnesses will remember events in the past the same and that witnesses might remember small details differently.\n'Can you be realistic and not hold witnesses to unrealistic standards?' he asked the jury pool, asking any to say if they can't accept that.\nHe said outright some witnesses 'have some edge,' describing them as a tabloid publisher, an adult film star and said Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen was convicted of federal crimes, including lying to Congress.\nSteinglass asked jurors whether they would be able to approach the testimony from a convicted felon with an open mind.\nHe also noted that witnesses have written books, made podcasts and participated in documentaries.\nHe made the point that while jurors can consider all this in assessing a credibility of the witness, it's not the only thing they should consider.\n'The question really is, as I keep saying, can you wait until you hear not only the witness testimony but the rest of the evidence of the case' before deciding whether to believe something, Steinglass asked.\nBlanche, meanwhile, spent nearly all of his time focused on how jurors view Trump. He asked jurors if they had favorable or unfavorable views of the former president.\nOne man went back-and-forth with Blanche repeatedly, while largely refusing to share his views on Trump, saying his views don't matter in a courtroom and that he could compartmentalize.\n'I'll say I'm a Democrat, so there you go, but I walk in there and he's a defendant and that's all he is,' the juror said.\nThe juror was later struck for cause by the judge on a challenge from Trump's team over his social media posts.\nOne of the things Merchan has emphasized this week is that the court schedule is fluid. But the judge is hoping to wrap up jury selection this week.\nAfter swearing in the seven jurors Tuesday, Merchan told them he hopes they can return next Monday for opening statements \u2013 but he emphasized that the schedule could always change and the court would be in touch.\nHe then swore in a new panel of 96 jurors Tuesday afternoon before dismissing them for the day, saving time logistically before they return Thursday morning.\nThose jurors will go through the same process that's played out over the past two days with the first panel of 96 jurors. The new panel will be asked if they think they cannot be impartial or if they have a conflict, and then undergo questioning first from the judge and then the lawyers on both sides.\nThere's no guarantee that will get us to a full jury of 12 jurors, plus six expected alternates: Only seven were selected out of the first panel of 96.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Jeremy Herb,Lauren Del Valle","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/06-gettyimages-2147853916.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":2.9715004,"_id":"679a7c7d9a1c2c9d817e7f2dd3d88e0c"},{"title":"NYPD arrested\u00a0over 100 people during a pro-Palestinian protest at Columbia University.

Here's what we know about the protest at Columbia and subsequent arrests so far:\nColumbia and subsequent arrests so far: The protests began Wednesday. Pro-Palestinian students, faculty and others set up tents and signs that morning on the campus in upper Manhattan on a day that Shafik, the university president, was in Washington, DC, to testify to a House committee over the school's response to antisemitism.\nThe encampment was organized by Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) \u2013 a student-led coalition of more than 100 organizations \u2013 Students for Justice in Palestine, and Jewish Voice for Peace, to protest what they describe as the university's 'continued financial investment in corporations that profit from Israeli apartheid, genocide, and military occupation of Palestine,' according to CUAD's news release.\n'The Gaza Solidarity Encampment was established to pressure Columbia to divest all funds, including the endowment, from corporations that profit from Israeli apartheid, genocide and military occupation in Palestine,' the release said.\nCNN sought comment from Columbia University and the university's Advisory Committee on Socially Responsible Investing for more information on their investments and for comment on the protest organizers' allegations.\nRy, a senior at Columbia who declined to provide his last name to protect his identity, told CNN he had been camping at the campus before arrests began.\n'We as students are using our privilege to stand for people who have been oppressed for far too long and we hope other universities take the call and do the same,' said Ry, who is a member of Jewish Voice for Peace.\nIsra Hirsi, the daughter of Rep. Ilhan Omar, was among those arrested Thursday, a police official told CNN. The official said Hirsi is being processed and will likely receive a summons for a criminal trespass charge then be released from custody.\nHirsi, an organizer with Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine, said earlier Thursday she and two other students at Barnard College \u2013 located across the street from Columbia University \u2013 were suspended for participating in pro-Palestinian protests.\n'Columbia has shown over and over again that they don't care about student rights, they don't care about student voices, they don't care about student safety,' protester Aidan Parisi told CNN affiliate WCBS.\nShafik wrote a letter to the NYPD on Thursday asking for the department's help to 'remove these individuals,' and said those students occupying the South Lawn of the university's Morningside Heights campus had been informed of their suspension.\n'The actions of these individuals are in violation of University rules and policies,' the president told police in the letter. 'The University provided multiple notices and warnings and informed the encampment participants that they must disperse or face immediate discipline.'\nIn an email to students obtained by CNN, Shafik said Thursday that she authorized the move 'out of an abundance of concern for the safety of Columbia's campus.'\n'I took this extraordinary step because these are extraordinary circumstances,' Shafik wrote. 'The individuals who established the encampment violated a long list of rules and policies.'\nCalling the protest a 'disturbance,' Adams said in a news conference Thursday evening that the protesters violated university rules and that 'NYPD officers moved in to ensure the safety of the campus, the students and the staff.' He added that, 'the NYPD assured there was no violence or injuries' during the protest.\n'The students that were arrested were peaceful, offered no resistance whatsoever and were saying what they wanted to say in a peaceful manner,' added John Chell, NYPD Chief of Patrol.\nMost of the people taken into custody will be summoned for trespassing, while two people were charged with trespass as well as obstruction of governmental administration, authorities said at the news conference.\nIn the past, the office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has declined to prosecute or deferred prosecution cases where large numbers of people were arrested as part of civil disobedience.\nThe arrests came a day after Shafik testified over the university's response to antisemitism during a House Committee on Education and the Workforce hearing. The university faced criticism for its handling of antisemitic incidents on campus and for hiring a professor who allegedly expressed support for Hamas on social media. That professor has been fired, Shafik said Wednesday.\nIn her testimony, Shafik said the core of the university's mission is to 'ensure that all members of our community may engage in our cherished traditions of free expression and open debate,' quoting from the school's rules of university conduct.\nShafik said the core of the university's mission is to 'ensure that all members of our community may engage in our cherished traditions of free expression and open debate,' quoting from the school's rules of university conduct.\nCompeting pro-Palestine and pro-Israel rallies grew into Wednesday afternoon as more protesters gathered after the hearing.\nSeveral people waving Palestinian flags shouted at police officers, who had begun boxing the protesters in with barricades, CNN affiliate WCBS reported.\nDuring Wednesday's protests, Columbia closed the gates to campus, only allowing people with university IDs to enter. Many of the pro-Palestinian protesters affiliated with Columbia camped on the campus overnight.\nwith university IDs to enter. Many of the pro-Palestinian protesters affiliated with Columbia camped on the campus overnight. Four people were arrested overnight during the protests, the NYPD said. Police did not specify what charges were filed and gave no additional details about the arrests.\nThe NYPD used bullhorns on Thursday to tell protesters they would be arrested unless they dispersed immediately. Large crowds of Columbia students on the perimeter refused to leave and chanted 'Shame on you!' and 'the students united will never be defeated.'\nShortly after 2 p.m. Thursday, a group of at least 200 protesters moved to an area about two blocks away from the school campus near the NYPD staging site and police said they would soon disperse the crowd, CNN witnessed. Officers in helmets, carrying batons, were seen lining up in the street surrounding the group.\nOnline video appears to show NYPD officers arresting pro-Palestinian protesters outside Columbia University early Thursday morning. Detained students were escorted off campus by the NYPD in zip tie handcuffs.\nIn a Wednesday letter to students, Columbia University officials said participation in the encampment and refusal to leave the campus would result in suspension for students involved.\n'If you are a Columbia student and you do not adhere to this final request by 9:00 p.m. today, April 17, 2024, the University will take the interim measure of suspending you pending investigation for possible violation of multiple University policies,' the university said in the letter.\n'During the suspension, you may not go to class or hand in work related to courses and therefore may not be able to complete your current courses. Your CUID will be deactivated, you will not have access to classrooms and other parts of campus and may not participate in University activities.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Dalia Faheid,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2147911086.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":2.9676094,"_id":"9938a15c2a344fe5354bf6f0a09a9e3c"},{"title":"Rick Santorum Fast Facts","author":"Editorial Research","published_date":"2024-04-19 18:03:19","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2013/05/13/us/rick-santorum-fast-facts/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Read Rick Santorum Fast Facts on CNN.com and learn more about the former Pennsylvania congressman and former presidential candidate.","summary":"Here's a look at the life of Rick Santorum, former Pennsylvania congressman.\nBirth date: May 10, 1958\nBirth date: May 10, 1958 Birth place: Winchester, Virginia\nBirth place: Winchester, Virginia Birth name: Richard John Santorum\nBirth name: Richard John Santorum Father: Aldo Santorum, a psychologist\nFather: Aldo Santorum, a psychologist Mother: Catherine (Dughi) Santorum, a nurse\nMother: Catherine (Dughi) Santorum, a nurse Marriage: Karen (Garver) Santorum (1990-present)\nMarriage: Karen (Garver) Santorum (1990-present) Children: Isabella, 2008; Patrick, 2001; Peter, 1999; Sarah, 1998; Gabriel, born and died in 1996; Daniel, 1995; Richard Jr., 1993; Elizabeth, 1991\nChildren: Isabella, 2008; Patrick, 2001; Peter, 1999; Sarah, 1998; Gabriel, born and died in 1996; Daniel, 1995; Richard Jr., 1993; Elizabeth, 1991 Education: Pennsylvania State University, B.A., Political Science, 1980; University of Pittsburgh, M.B.A., 1981; Dickinson School of Law, J.D., 1986\nEducation: Pennsylvania State University, B.A., Political Science, 1980; University of Pittsburgh, M.B.A., 1981; Dickinson School of Law, J.D., 1986 Religion: Roman Catholic\nReligion: Roman Catholic Member of the 'Gang of Seven,' a group that exposed and condemned scandals in Congress, when in the House of Representatives.\nFounded the Congressional Working Group on Religious Freedom.\nKnown for spearheading and helping to pass the welfare reform bill and a ban on partial-birth abortion.\n1981-1986 - Administrative assistant to Pennsylvania state Senator J.

'I think going into most of those cases people were like, \u2018Ooh, you're gonna get a lot of heat however it comes out.' That's the job.'\nAbout 15 months later, on April 4, 2023, Bragg and his team of prosecutors stepped into that white-hot spotlight by indicting Trump on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments delivered to quiet a sex scandal ahead of the 2016 president election. Bragg sat in in the courtroom as Trump was arraigned on the charges. After a little more than a year of legal wrangling, pundits' clashing over the strength of his case and a tabloid backlash to his progressive politics, Trump's criminal trial \u2013 the first of its kind for a former American president \u2013 is set to begin on Monday in New York City.\nBragg is now facing up to what many of his peers and other outside observers would describe as the textbook definition of a 'no-win' assignment. His decision to prosecute Trump came under immediate, searing scrutiny from all quarters. Democrats largely viewed him as brave, even if they worried over the political implications of the case, while Republicans immediately cast the 50-year-old Harlem native as a craven opportunist acting on what Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan described as 'blatant political animus toward former President Trump.'\nManhattan's first Black district attorney, Bragg carries an estimable legal resume but none of the blue-blood pedigree enjoyed by his two predecessors, Cy Vance Jr. and Robert Morgenthau, whose fathers served in presidential administrations. Morgenthau first won the job in 1974. Vance took over in 2010. Previous occupants Charles Seymour Whitman and Thomas Dewey went on to become governors of New York. Dewey twice won the GOP presidential nomination, though he fell memorably shy of the White House on both occasions.\nBragg, a Harvard-educated attorney, previously served in roles including assistant US attorney in the Southern District of New York; a top lawyer in the New York attorney general's office, as a civil rights lawyer; and as a professor and co-director of the New York Law School Racial Justice Project, where he represented family members of the late Eric Garner in a lawsuit against the city. Garner was killed in 2014 after a plainclothes police officer placed him in an unauthorized chokehold following a dispute over his allegedly hawking loose cigarettes.\nThough Bragg's ambitions are widely considered to be less lofty than some of his predecessors, the Trump trial will likely write both his political future and legacy. The landmark case will take on added significance because of its timing \u2013 in the midst of a presidential campaign, first among four criminal cases, at the state and federal level, facing Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.\nThe indictment stems from a $130,000 payment made by Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen \u2013 now the prosecution's star witness \u2013 to adult film star Stormy Daniels days before the 2016 election. In exchange, she agreed to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump.\nProsecutors allege Trump was involved in the coverup, involving falsified invoices, business records and checks to repay Cohen. The theory of the case is that Trump and his allies were motivated to stop Daniel's story from offending female voters and therefore they tried to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.\nThe former president and his allies blitzed Bragg ahead of the charges, in some cases stoking fear about civil unrest to follow.\nOne of his lawyers, Alina Habba, warned of 'mayhem' across the city following an indictment, telling CNN, 'If there are (security) concerns, that's rightfully so.' Though her prediction fell flat, Trump himself responded with a similarly dramatic take, warning in a late night social media post of 'potential death & destruction' upon his being charged.\n'I never thought anything like this could happen in America, never thought it could happen,' Trump said in a more restrained statement about the indictment. 'The only crime that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it.'\nBragg's office faced a surge in threats after the indictment, forcing his security detail to bring in additional assistance from the New York police department. Twice last year, the district attorney's office received letters with white powder containing messages. One said, 'Alvin: I'm going to kill you.' The other letter included imagines of Bragg and Trump and the words 'you will be sorry.'\nThe former president, who has a habit of showing up to court even when his presence is not required, will be mandated to attend the trial and is expected to regularly address its developments. Despite multiple warnings from the presiding judge, Bragg, whom Trump has previously called a 'degenerate psychopath' and 'thug,' is likely to be at the center of his animus.\nFor his part, Bragg, who is not speaking to reporters ahead of the trial, has projected confidence that the facts of the case, and not the characters involved, will vindicate his decision to bring it. He has attended every pre-trial hearing in the case in support of his team .\n. 'At its core, this case today is one with allegations like so many of our white-collar cases,' Bragg said last year when announcing the charges. 'Someone lied again and again to protect their interests and evade the laws to which we are all held accountable.'\nBragg took office on the same day New York City Mayor Eric Adams was sworn-in, on January 1, 2022. He immediately set out to deliver on a pair of campaign promises: to aggressively pursue Trump's alleged misdeeds and put in place a new, more progressive model of law enforcement in the district attorney's office.\nNeither went as planned.\nLess than a week after coming on the job, Bragg released a memo outlining new charging, bail, plea and sentencing policies. His policies, he said, were rooted in his own experience \u2013 being held at gunpoint six times in his life, three of them by overzealous police officers. But his plan faced immediate blowback from police union leaders and right-wing media. After an election that Adams, a former NYPD officer, won largely on the strength of a tough-on-crime message, Bragg's list of crimes he would not prosecute \u2013 misdemeanors related to marijuana and resisting arrest, among them \u2013 landed with a thud.\n'Safety is paramount. New Yorkers deserve to be safe from crime and safe from the dangers posed by mass incarceration,' Bragg tweeted during the ensuing maelstrom. 'We will be tough when we need to be, but we will not be seeking to destroy lives through unnecessary incarceration.'\nThough the furor surrounding the memo eventually died down \u2013 in part because Bragg walked back parts of it \u2013 the new DA's pledge to come down hard on Trump, who was being investigated on multiple fronts by his predecessor, was ramping up.\nBut that pledge faced an unexpected adversary. Two months into office, Bragg was confronted by two senior attorneys leading the Trump investigation. They wanted to move forward and seek charges from a grand jury investigating the accuracy of the Trump Organization's financial statements that were used to obtain loans. When Bragg refused to authorize them to seek an indictment they abruptly and noisily resigned, putting additional pressure on the new district attorney.\nThat April, Bragg told CNN, 'Investigations are not linear, so we are following the leads in front of us. That's what we're doing.'\nMonths later, after his lawyers won a conviction of two Trump Organization entities on a decade long tax fraud scheme, his prosecutors quietly honed their focus, moving away from the financial statements and to the hush money payments.\nDuring his campaign for district attorney, Bragg repeatedly boasted, particularly during the Democratic primary, that he helped sue the Trump administration 'more than a hundred times' in his previous capacity as the state's chief deputy attorney general.\nBragg also touted his leadership role in one of that office's highest-profile lawsuits, targeting the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which then-attorney general Barbara Underwood said had been 'functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests,' with a 'shocking pattern of illegality' that included illegal intermingling with Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\nTrump eventually paid $2 million of his own money to a group of charities, and the foundation was dissolved. The memories of that encounter, and Bragg's campaign rhetoric, though, has endured, with Trump's legal and public relations teams repeatedly arguing Bragg cannot be considered an impartial party.\nIn February, concerns about Trump's behavior before and during the trial, along with hundreds of threats to Bragg's office, led prosecutors to seek a gag order against the former president, whose words they argued would 'pose a significant and imminent threat to the orderly administration of this criminal proceeding.' Bragg is not covered by the order, but his staff of prosecutors are.\nJudge Juan Merchan largely accepted the request, hoping to put the brakes on Trump's 'inflammatory' language. But only days after an expanded order was issued, Trump lashed out again \u2013 this time aiming his ire at Cohen and Daniels, who is also expected to testify.\nThe pair, he said on his Truth Social site, are 'sleaze bags who have, with their lies and misrepresentations, cost our Country dearly!'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Gregory Krieg,CNN,Kara Scannell","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1479830860.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":2.8114765,"_id":"cfa85232c2920bf91a763813275d77a4"},{"title":"Experts say panic buttons can enhance school safety, but only 6 states require them","author":"Lauren Mascarenhas","published_date":"2024-04-20 09:01:40","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/20/us/panic-buttons-schools-us-states","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"In December 2021, the principal at Eagle Point Elementary School in Broward County, Florida, received an anonymous bomb threat. Using a silent panic alarm app on her phone, she alerted police and\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 In December 2021, the principal at Eagle Point Elementary School in Broward County, Florida, received an anonymous bomb threat. Using a silent panic alarm app on her phone, she alerted police and within seconds her image appeared on multiple screens in the Broward County Sheriff's Office.\nThe sheriff's office was able to immediately give her instructions to evacuate the school, and call the fire department and the bomb squad.\n'We were able to coordinate the whole thing within seconds,' Capt. Michael Riggio with the Broward County Sheriff's Office told CNN. Thankfully, the threat was unfounded. It was called in by an elementary school student as a joke, the sheriff's office said.\nThe school district, which serves more than 251,000 students, adopted a silent panic alarm system in the wake of the February 14, 2018, mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that claimed 17 lives.\nRelated article Gun violence is remaking America's classrooms\nRelated article Gun violence is remaking America's classrooms Florida has since raised the minimum age to buy firearms from 18 to 21 under a law that also allows for some teachers to be armed. Despite the impassioned pleas for more thorough gun reform that followed the Parkland shooting, the number of school shootings in the US has climbed steadily each year since 2018, with the exception of 2020, when many schools were closed due to Covid-19, according to CNN's analysis of events reported by the Gun Violence Archive, Education Week and Everytown for Gun Safety.\nFlorida adopted Alyssa's Law in 2020, named in honor of Alyssa Alhadeff, who was 14 when she was killed in the Parkland shooting. The law requires public schools to install a silent panic alarm system in schools that is directly linked to law enforcement. In the absence of gun reform, proponents of Alyssa's Law say a silent panic alarm system can reduce response time in the face of gun violence or a medical emergency.\nSince then, only a handful of states have followed suit. Five states \u2013 New Jersey, New York, Texas, Tennessee and Utah \u2013 have also approved legislation requiring or encouraging silent panic alarm systems in schools.\nSome schools have adopted apps that allow staff to report an emergency with a few clicks on their phones. Others have opted to provide staff with literal panic buttons, often attached to an ID badge that is always on their person. The panic buttons or apps can often send precise location information to law enforcement and initiate a school-wide alert or shelter in place notice.\nIn 2018, Alyssa's family founded Make Our Schools Safe, a nonprofit that advocates for the adoption of Alyssa's Law across the United States.\n'On February 14, I texted my daughter Alyssa. I told her to run and hide \u2013 that help was on the way, and then unfortunately, that help didn't get there fast enough,' Alyssa's mother, Lori Alhadeff, told CNN. 'Time equals life and if we can get help on the scene as quickly as possible, we know that we will save lives.'\nAlyssa's Law legislation has been introduced in Nebraska, Arizona, Virginia, Oregon, Georgia, Michigan, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Oklahoma, according to Make Our Schools Safe. There have also been several attempts to introduce legislation at the federal level.\n'They think it's a great idea,' Alhadeff said, 'but they want to know how it's going to be funded, so it is a budget concern. However, what I would say is this: We need to make school safety a top priority in every school district.'\nAlhadeff says her family's story and those of others who have lost loved ones to gun violence in schools often makes the difference when advocating for legislation. She recently traveled to Utah and spoke with Rep. Ryan Wilcox and other state legislators before they made the decision to add the panic button requirement to a state school safety bill, backed by $100 million in funding.\nFunding is generally built into the laws at a state level. Florida allocated $6.4 million in recurring funds to help schools implement panic button systems.\nBrent Cobb, CEO of Centegix, a company specializing in safety technology, told CNN the cost of outfitting a school with his company's panic button systems is about $8,000 a year.\nPanic button systems can be helpful, but they're just one of multiple safety measures, like perimeter security, that schools need to keep students safe, Mo Canady, executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers, a nonprofit group of school-based security professionals, told CNN.\nCanady says his early days working as a school resource officer in the US coincided with the 1999 Columbine High School massacre that killed 13 people in Colorado.\n'We didn't have this kind of technology at that time, so it was a bit of a guessing game,' he said. 'Now, if you hear shots fired, you know where they're exactly coming from, is the shooter moving somewhere else \u2013 this kind of technology can help us narrow down where we need to look.'\nCanady says there needs to be a structure in place so schools and law enforcement agencies know how to respond to reported emergencies.\n'The last thing we want to do is hand out a piece of technology without any policy or procedure in mind \u2013 \u2018just push it if you have a problem,'' he said.\nAlhadeff says the ultimate goal is to see Alyssa's Law implemented nationwide.\n'Think about our banks. Every bank has a panic button. Every federal office has a panic button. Why wouldn't we want to make panic buttons in every one of our schools across this country?' Alhadeff said.\nWhile panic button systems are often installed to protect staff and students from potential gun violence, the systems have more often been used in cases of medical emergencies, according to Centegix.\nThe company released a report in January showing of about 15,000 alerts sent within Texas schools, 98% were for 'everyday incidents related to health and behavioral emergencies.' The report cites incidents of cardiac arrest and seizures on campus, where a panic button was used to quickly get help.\nshowing of about 15,000 alerts sent within Texas schools, 98% were for 'everyday incidents related to health and behavioral emergencies.'

The Broward County school district opted for the SaferWatch app, according to Broward County Public Schools Chief Safety and Security Officer Jaime Alberti. The company told CNN it's used by 2,000 schools and 200 law enforcement agencies nationwide.\nIn Broward County, the app connects the sheriff's office to cameras in the schools. It also allows school staff to report emergencies to law enforcement and has an anonymous tip reporting function that is open to students and other community members in the district.\nAlberti says the district has an operation center that runs 24/7 to sift through and follow up on tips, for instance, of people threatening to commit an act of violence on campus. Many of those tips end up being false alarms, Alberti says, but the district's partnership with the Broward County Sheriff's Office allows them to investigate and follow up with the appropriate resources.\nCapt. Mike Riggio told CNN the tip reporting function has been critical for getting ahead of threats before they're acted on. The department's threat assessment unit has hired behavioral health licensed therapists to assess people who may want to commit acts of mass violence and connect them to mental health providers in the community.\n'I think there are still not a lot of places in the country that have quite the relationship we do,' Riggio said. 'In our real time crime center, we have sworn detectives and crime analysts who work together. And now that we have cameras when things happen, we're on those cameras right away. We have eyes into the school.'\n'You're at a school on the other side of the county, you hit that panic alarm, within 5 seconds, it's going off in our crime center,' he added.\nThat peace of mind is paramount in a community still healing from the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Alberti said.\n'It's still very present. It's still very painful,' he said. 'So we're double checking. We're triple checking. When I go to sleep at night, there's people up working to make sure that student threats are being handled.'\nFor schools operating without the extra bells and whistles of cameras or high-tech threat reporting \u2013 or even those without panic button technology \u2013 Alberti said the foundation of this safety partnership can be replicated just about anywhere.\n'Some things are free. Lock your doors. Stay aware of your surroundings. Those things are everybody's responsibility. We own the whole house. We don't just own a part of the house,' he said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Lauren Mascarenhas","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap20066749562994.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":2.8111668,"_id":"8e910b90a252ecab12784297e5b1ade0"},{"title":"What a buyer's agent will do for you when you're looking for a new home","author":"Jeanne Sahadi","published_date":"2024-04-22 10:30:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/22/success/buyers-agent-real-estate-obligations","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"An unprecedented $418 million settlement between the National Association of Realtors and groups of home sellers, which has yet to take effect, has left many people confused about how much they might\u2026","summary":"New York CNN \u2014\nNew York CNN \u2014 An unprecedented $418 million settlement between the National Association of Realtors and groups of home sellers, which has yet to take effect, has left many people confused about how much they might pay in commissions in the future.\n$418 million settlement between the National Association of Realtors and groups of home sellers, which has yet to take effect, has left many people confused about how much they might pay in commissions in the future. But no matter how things shake out, people will continue buying homes. And a majority of them will consider using the services of a buyer's agent.\nIf you plan to be among them, here is what you should expect from any licensed buyer's agent \u2013 legally, ethically and in terms of practical guidance \u2013 and how to choose one who best suits your needs.\nBuyer's agents essentially run point for Team You. From house hunting to closing, such agents have a fiduciary duty to represent only your needs in the home-buying process. 'They should always keep a buyer's best interests at the heart of the transaction,' said Amy Lessinger, president of RE/MAX, LLC. 'They put [your] interest ahead of their own.'\nFrom house hunting to closing, such agents have a fiduciary duty to represent only your needs in the home-buying process. 'They should always keep a buyer's best interests at the heart of the transaction,' said Amy Lessinger, president of RE/MAX, LLC. 'They put [your] interest ahead of their own.' That means a lot of things, including being shown homes that suit your stated needs and that are priced within the range of what you'd like to spend. That's not to say they might not show you something above your initial stated range, but they have to be transparent about why they're doing so. 'What would be a violation [of their duty] is if they only show you homes above your budget,' Lessing said.\nHaving a good buyer's agent also means having someone who is knowledgeable about the local real estate market and who has the skills and competence to negotiate with the seller's agent on your behalf.\nIn addition, a helpful buyer's agent should be able to offer a list of reputable service providers who you may need during the home buying process, from inspectors and appraisers to surveyors, contractors, real estate attorneys and others. Ideally, an agent will offer you at least two to three recommendations for any type of service provider, Lessinger said.\nAnd experienced buyer's agents should have a solid working knowledge of local real estate laws and rules governing renovations, landscaping, utilities and new construction along with the fees, permits and paperwork required.\nFor example, your agent should be able to tell you what right of way an electric utility company has on a property if a tree is near a power line. Or how much it will cost you to hook up a home to city water.\nLegally and ethically, buyer's agents have six key obligations to you.\nLoyalty: They must be loyal to you and your interests. Not theirs. Not the seller's. Nor anyone else's in the home-buying process.\nLoyalty: They must be loyal to you and your interests. Not theirs. Not the seller's. Nor anyone else's in the home-buying process. Confidentiality: They have to treat the information you share with them as confidential, including your budget and motivation to buy a home.\nConfidentiality: They have to treat the information you share with them as confidential, including your budget and motivation to buy a home. Disclosure: They have to disclose any pertinent information you need to make your decision about a home. That can include red flags they notice. While agents are not obligated to officially inspect a property on behalf of a buyer nor do they have to be home repair experts, Lessinger said, working with a seasoned buyer's agent who can spot potential problems (e.g., mold or water damage) and who knows what it might take to fix them can help you better assess whether a home is right for you and how much you're willing to spend.\nDisclosure: They have to disclose any pertinent information you need to make your decision about a home.

Obedience: While they can make recommendations, a buyer's agent must follow your instructions, assuming you're not asking them to do anything illegal.\nObedience: While they can make recommendations, a buyer's agent must follow your instructions, assuming you're not asking them to do anything illegal. Accountability: A buyer's agent has to keep good records and proof of any monies you give them (e.g., a cashier's check for earnest money or money to pay a home inspector).\nAccountability: A buyer's agent has to keep good records and proof of any monies you give them (e.g., a cashier's check for earnest money or money to pay a home inspector). All real estate agents must abide by two federal laws: the Fair Housing Act (FHA) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA).\nThe FHA prohibits real estate agents, mortgage professionals, landlords and others from discriminating against anyone for reasons of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status and disability.\nRESPA, meanwhile, requires that consumers seeking a federally backed or federally related mortgage receive relevant and timely disclosures about the nature and costs of the real estate process.\nAnd it specifically prohibits practices like real estate professionals taking kickbacks (for example, by steering you to a specific service provider who pays the agent for sending you their way).\nBeyond those two laws, every state has its own laws and guidelines spelling out the rules as well as the licensing and education requirements that apply to real estate agents and brokers. So check the Web site of the real estate governing body in the state where you want to buy a home. Such a body may be known as the real estate commission, the board of real estate or department of real estate.\nBeyond legal requirements, if the agent is a designated Realtor (meaning they're a member of the National Association of Realtors), they are required to abide by NAR's code of ethics.\nIf they're not a NAR member, they may belong to a professional real estate association that has its own ethical guidelines. Members of the National Association of Real Estate Brokers, for instance, are bound by the group's Code of Professional Responsibility.\nWhile you want someone who is competent, you also want to work with someone you trust and who communicates well. That's why you want to interview a few buyer's agents before settling on one, said Jason Abrams, the head of industry and learning at Keller Williams Realty Inc., a franchise real estate company.\nIdeally, you want to choose someone who has a lot of experience doing real estate transactions in the area where you're looking.\nAsk them what kinds of services they provide and discuss with them what services you'd like. Find out, too, if the agent has availability that will work with your schedule, said David Kent, founder of The Real Buyer's Agent in Charleston, South Carolina.\nYou also want to know the person has a good professional reputation, Kent said. 'Do your research on the agent.'\nBesides reading their testimonials, make sure they're licensed in the state where you're shopping and whether they're in good standing.\nWhen you decide to move ahead with a specific agent, you will be asked to sign a buyer-broker agreement, which is a legally binding document that you should look over carefully before signing.\n'Anything that a buyer agrees to with an agent will be spelled out in the agreement,' Abrams said.\nThe agreement will lay out, among other things, the agent's legal and ethical obligations to you, as well as your obligations, which may include a deal to work with that agent's brokerage exclusively within a geographic area for a given amount of time. It also may include what commission you will pay the agent if the seller of a home you buy hasn't agreed to pay both the listing agent and the buyer's agent, which is traditionally how it's been done. Or it may include a flat fee or hourly rate you agree to pay for specific services, Kent said.\nThe final terms should best suit your needs. So remember, Abrams said, 'Everything is negotiable.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Jeanne Sahadi","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2110552404.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":2.80937,"_id":"808042560379617716165e2a499446cb"},{"title":"Tensions are so high at Columbia ahead of Passover that all classes will be virtual today","author":"Matt Egan","published_date":"2024-04-22 09:07:07","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/22/business/columbia-tensions-passover-virtual-classes","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Officials at Columbia University, facing surging tensions on campus that have raised safety concerns, have announced all classes will be virtual on Monday as Passover begins.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Officials at Columbia University, facing surging tensions on campus that raised safety concerns, have announced all classes will be virtual on Monday as Passover begins.\nColumbia President Minouche Shafik said in a statement the decision was made to 'deescalate the rancor and give us all a chance to consider next steps.'\nThe move underscores how tense the situation has become at the Ivy League school and the enormous challenge facing Shafik to get the situation under control.\nBillionaire Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots and a prominent Columbia graduate, called for school officials to immediately end the protests and suggested he is withholding donations to the university because he's 'no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff.'\n'The school I love so much \u2013 the one that welcomed me and provided me with so much opportunity \u2013 is no longer an institution I recognize,' Kraft, founder of the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, said in a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter. 'I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken.'\nAs Columbia students move to virtual learning, scores of protestors were camped out on the university's West Lawn Monday morning opposite the lawn where the original encampment took place.\nMore than a dozen tents were pitched and tables were stocked with supplies of clothes and food. Signs along the perimeter include ones reading, 'End the siege on Gaza now' and 'Welcome to the People's University of Palestine.'\nMeanwhile, pro-Israel protestors gathered outside the Columbia gates Monday morning, with some waving Israeli and American flags.\n'This is happening at every US university. Jews are not safe anywhere on college campuses,' Shai Davidai, a Jewish Columbia Business School assistant professor, told the group of pro-Israel protestors.\nColumbia officials said last week that Davidai is under investigation for harassment. Davidai told CNN he has never spoken against students by name, only 'pro-Hamas' students organizations and professors.\nAt Yale University, at least 16 people had been arrested \u2014 including some students \u2013 after police blocked off entrances during response to a protest at Hewitt Quadrangle & Beinecke Plaza, the school's independent college newspaper, The Yale Daily News reported Monday morning.\n'Cops have gathered at Beinecke Plaza, where pro-Palestine protesters urging Yale to divest from military weapons manufacturers set up tents overnight \u2013 the third night of their ongoing encampment,' the Yale Daily News said.\nJournalists from the Yale Daily News were also threatened with arrest if they did not move from the plaza, according to reports.\nCNN has reached out to Yale University administration, the Yale Police Department and the New Haven Police Department in Connecticut for more information.\nTensions at many universities have been high ever since the October 7 terror attack on Israel by Hamas. However, the situation at Columbia escalated in recent days after university officials testified before Congress last week about antisemitism on campus and pro-Palestinian protests on and near campus surged.\nAt Columbia, 'During the coming days, a working group of Deans, university administrators and faculty members will try to bring this crisis to a resolution. That includes continuing discussions with the student protestors and identifying actions we can take as a community to enable us to peacefully complete the term and return to respectful engagement with each other,' the president said in her Monday statement.\nAs the situation has unfolded, Shafik has faced new calls for her resignation, and a rabbi linked to the university even urged Jewish students to stay home due to concerns about their safety as Passover, a major Jewish holiday, is set to begin Monday evening.\nThe safety of Columbia's community is 'our number one priority,' a university spokesperson told CNN in a statement Sunday.\n'We are acting on concerns we are hearing from our Jewish student\ufeffs and are providing additional support and resources to ensure that our community remains safe,' the statement added.\nThe White House, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric Adams all weighed in over the weekend, denouncing calls for violence against Jews.\nAdams said he was 'horrified and disgusted with the antisemitism spewed at and around' Columbia and said the New York Police Department 'will not hesitate to arrest anyone' found to be breaking the law.\nRabbi Elie Buechler, a rabbi associated with Columbia University's Orthodox Union Jewish Learning Initiative on Campus, confirmed to CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday he sent a WhatsApp message to a group of about 300 mostly Orthodox Jewish students 'strongly' recommending they return home and remain there.\nIn his message, Buechler wrote recent events at the university 'have made it clear that Columbia University's Public Safety and the NYPD cannot guarantee Jewish students' safety.'\n'It deeply pains me to say that I would strongly recommend you return home as soon as possible and remain home until the reality in and around campus has dramatically improved,' the message reads.\nThe campus Hillel said in a Sunday post on X they 'do not believe that Jewish students should leave' the campus, but that the university and City of New York must act to protect students from harassment.\n'If I had my child at Columbia, I also would tell them to go home,' Hagar Chemali, an adjunct associate professor of International and Public Affairs at the university, told CNN Monday. 'It's not just because of the tension on campus, it's also because those protests on campus have invited extremists outside.'\nOrganizers of the campus protest \u2013 Columbia University Apartheid Divest and Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine \u2013 said in a statement, 'We have been peaceful,' and distanced themselves from non-student protestors who have gathered outside the campus, calling them 'inflammatory individuals who do not represent us.'\n'We firmly reject any form of hate or bigotry and stand vigilant against non-students attempting to disrupt the solidarity being forged among students \u2013 Palestinian, Muslim, Arab, Jewish, Black and pro-Palestinian classmates and colleagues who represent the full diversity of our country,' the activists' statement continued.\nColumbia student, Noah Lederman, told CNN he was 'terrified, angry, upset, and horrified that the university failed to take action.' Lederman said he had been accosted in early February and had asked the university for remote learning options. 'What's happening on campus is blatantly antisemitic,' he added.\n'Columbia students organizing in solidarity with Palestine \u2013 including Jewish students \u2013 have faced harassment, doxxing, and now arrest by the NYPD. These are the main threats to the safety of Jewish Columbia students,' Jonathan Ben-Menachem, a Ph.D. student, told CNN.\n'On the other hand, student protesters have led interfaith joint prayers for several days now, and Passover Seder will be held at the Gaza Solidarity Encampment tomorrow,' he went on. 'Saying that student protesters are a threat to Jewish students is a dangerous smear.'\nDemonstrations are also taking place at other campuses. Pro-Palestinian students at Emerson College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology set up protest encampments as an act of solidarity with students at Columbia University, according to The Boston Globe. Solidarity rallies have also taken place at Yale, Harvard, the University of North Carolina, and Boston University.\nThe crisis at Columbia amounts to a massive test for Shafik, who took the helm of the university less than a year ago.\nRep. Elise Stefanik, the New York Republican and frequent critic of Ivy League schools, called for Shafik to immediately step down.\n'It is crystal clear that Columbia University \u2013 previously a beacon of academic excellence founded by Alexander Hamilton \u2013 needs new leadership,' Stefanik said in a statement on Sunday.\nFollowing a disastrous hearing on campus antisemitism before Congress in December, the presidents of Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania came under enormous pressure and both resigned.\non campus antisemitism before Congress in December, the presidents of Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania came under enormous pressure and both resigned. Shafik testified to the\ufeff House Education Committee on the same subject last Wednesday, and the protests on campus have escalated in the days since, prompting Republican committee chair Rep. Virginia Foxx to warn university leaders of consequences if they do not rein in the protests.\n'Columbia's continued failure to restore order and safety promptly to campus constitutes a major breach of the University's Title VI obligations, upon which federal financial assistance is contingent, and which must immediately be rectified,' Foxx wrote in a letter.\nAs Passover begins Monday, Jewish student organizations have increased security for their upcoming events and services.\nPolice will be present at the Kraft Center, a Jewish cultural center shared by Columbia and Barnard College, throughout Passover, and students will be able to get walking escorts to and from the building starting Monday, according to an email from Brian Cohen, the center's executive director.\nChabad, another Jewish organization at the university, said they are still planning on hosting Passover celebrations but have hired additional security to protect students.\nCNN's Elizabeth Wolfe, Paradise Afshar, Caroll Alvarado, Shimon Prokupecz and John Towfighi contributed to this report.\nCNN's Elizabeth Wolfe, Paradise Afshar, Caroll Alvarado, Shimon Prokupecz and John Towfighi contributed to this report.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"business","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Chris Boyette,Matt Egan,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-04-20t193811z-1537477061-rc2ia7a42oug-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-usa-protest-copy.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":2.7976367,"_id":"d28838b95b0683b2e61e8a2aab5813f1"},{"title":"Opinion: Shaking off the Trump effect","author":"Richard Galant","published_date":"2024-04-21 12:08:39","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/21/opinions/trump-followers-asleep-at-switch-opinion-galant","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"When a defendant nods off, it doesn't stop a trial from going forward.

After two months of inaction\u2026","summary":"Editor's Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\nCNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 'We are most deeply asleep at the switch,' wrote Annie Dillard, 'when we fancy we control any switches at all. We sleep to time's hurdy-gurdy; we wake, if we ever wake, to the silence of God.'\nDillard's line \u2014 from her short meditative book titled 'Holy the Firm,' published in 1977, two years after she won the Pulitzer Prize at the age of 29 \u2014 invoked the role of the switchman, whose alertness was crucial in making sure trains got routed on the right track before the advent of automated switches.\nIf America's political leaders control any switches at all, some have been asleep at the switch for a while. When the Senate voted to send new aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan two months ago, House Speaker Mike Johnson took no action. The House leadership also refused to act on a bipartisan bill to address the surge of migrants across the southern border.\nIn both cases, Republicans in Congress were partly heeding the wishes of former President Donald Trump, who opposed more aid for Ukraine and wanted to prevent President Joe Biden from scoring any more legislative victories.\nThat was weeks before Trump went on trial in a Manhattan courtroom, where the man who labeled Biden 'Sleepy Joe' appeared to doze off several times Monday and Tuesday while the court started the process of selecting jurors.\nAnd it was also well before Iran directly attacked Israel for the first time. Israel responded, and while those strikes appeared to cause only limited damage, it showed the potential for wars to spiral out of control and made it even less politically tenable for the House leadership to be seen stalling on military aid measures.\nWhen a defendant nods off, it doesn't stop a trial from going forward. When a nation naps in the middle of international crises, the consequences can be profoundly scary.\nLast week, Johnson finally acted, making clear he supports the foreign aid package, though he broke it up into four bills and added a fifth on border security. With the help of Democrats, the House approved aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan on Saturday. 'Despite fierce opposition from MAGA Republicans within his caucus, Speaker Johnson has decided that the imperative of the US providing this assistance is more important than pleasing all the members of his caucus,' wrote Julian Zelizer .\nJulian Zelizer.\n'Without this support, international adversaries, including Russia, Iran and China, would read the failure of the US Congress to pass legislation as a sign that MAGA's America First agenda was triumphant. They might conclude that the age of internationalism, entrenched into American politics since World War II, had come to an end.'\n'The problem for Johnson is that his decision to move forward might very well cost him his job,' added Zelizer, noting Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's fierce criticism of Johnson and a House rule allowing just one member to bring about a vote to oust the speaker \u2014 which led to Kevin McCarthy's downfall six months ago.\nBiden backed bipartisan legislation on the border, but in the view of Fareed Zakaria , he has missed an opportunity to take firm executive action after House Republicans scuttled the bill and launched the doomed effort to impeach and remove Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\nFareed Zakaria, he has missed an opportunity to take firm executive action after House Republicans scuttled the bill and launched the doomed effort to impeach and remove Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. 'Biden must show he can fight. He should declare a national security emergency, send the National Guard to the border, work with Congress to suspend the asylum process and propose a new one that basically makes it impossible to get asylum if you just show up at the border,' Zakaria wrote.\n'Many will scream, and it will all be challenged in court. But it will signal that Biden is taking the problem seriously. Bill Clinton often says that the American people don't always need you to succeed, but they want to catch you trying. Joe Biden needs to be caught trying to solve the immigration crisis.'\nDonald Trump's campaign denied reports that the former president dozed off several times in court last week. But no one should be surprised at the sight of a criminal defendant seeming to nod off, noted Elliot Williams , a former prosecutor who has logged countless hours in court.\nElliot Williams, a former prosecutor who has logged countless hours in court. 'Courtrooms don't lend themselves to keeping people awake. They are notoriously quiet places where people are required to remain seated almost all of the time. The air is often stagnant and the ever-so-distracting handheld devices that are our lifelines to (and barrier from) the world around us are strictly forbidden \u2026 the gears of justice are not made for the 24-hour news cycle. What might be resolved in an 8-minute final segment of an episode of \u2018Law and Order' might be drawn out over days of painstaking testimony. It can take months, if not years (even in cases in which a defendant is not deliberately attempting to slow proceedings down) before a matter finally gets to trial.'\nStill, the selection of the jury that will pronounce a verdict on the hush money trial moved faster than expected last week. There were speed bumps though, as Patrick T. Brown noted.\nPatrick T. Brown noted. 'One potential juror who underwent questioning \u2026 was subsequently struck for cause after Trump's team found social media posts from the juror referencing Trump that say, \u2018Get him out' and \u2018Lock him up.''\n'Indeed, it seems unlikely that this case would be being prosecuted with the same vigor and creative legal theorizing if Trump were an everyday citizen. After all, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg came into office promising to focus on the ongoing investigation of Trump, and would have likely felt political heat from New York Democrats had he decided to close the investigation without bringing charges.'\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook 'In the end, as The New York Times reported in March 2023, Bragg's office took a \u2018circuitous and sometimes uncertain road' to filing criminal charges, reviving a dying investigation that originally focused on Trump's business practices with a renewed focus on hush money payments.'\nWill the trial be fair? Jeffrey Abramson , author of a book on the jury system, noted, 'Impartiality is the key to jury justice, but we can hardly expect jurors to approach the case without strong opinions about Trump. Indeed, it would be disturbing to seat jurors whose only qualification was their ignorance about major news events of the day.'\nJeffrey Abramson, author of a book on the jury system, noted, 'Impartiality is the key to jury justice, but we can hardly expect jurors to approach the case without strong opinions about Trump. Indeed, it would be disturbing to seat jurors whose only qualification was their ignorance about major news events of the day.' 'Fortunately, an open mind does not require an empty mind. We can find fair jurors who understand the difference between law and politics.'\nDon't call it a hush money trial, urged Norm Eisen .\nNorm Eisen. 'The core issue \u2026 is not the payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels in October 2016 to conceal her claimed affair with Trump (he denies the affair took place). The core issue is why Trump made them.\n'Paying hush money by itself is not a crime. The crime alleged in this case is felony document falsification, as the judge detailed. That requires intent to conceal, aid or commit another crime. Here, the prosecution alleges that the intent was to violate federal campaign finance laws and also the state statute prohibiting the \u2018unlawful influence' of an election \u2014 i.e., election interference.'\n'No one can seriously dispute,' Eisen concluded, that the reason former Trump fixer Michael Cohen and Trump himself 'allegedly hatched the scheme was to deprive voters of information that could have changed the outcome of an extremely close election.'\nFor more:\nElie Honig : Which case is the biggest threat to Trump?\nElie Honig: Which case is the biggest threat to Trump?\nElie Honig: Which case is the biggest threat to Trump?\n02:13 - Source: CNN\n02:13 - Source: CNN The unimaginable is not a theory, wrote Frida Ghitis .

'Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war for decades. The notion that one day Iran would launch a direct attack against Israel may have seemed like a distant possibility: something that was bound to happen, but only at some elusive future date. The same was true of Hamas, a terrorist group that seized control of Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thought he could appease Hamas and preserve quiet in Gaza and safety for Israelis living in the south. Others worried that one day Hamas would attack with full force. Many have worried that Iran will one day attack with full force. October 7 and April 14 are reminders that the unimaginable, the barely-imaginable, can and does happen.'\nPeter Bergen wrote that 'Saturday's drone and missile attacks against Israel were designed to show Israel and the region that the Iranian regime can't be trifled with, and the Israeli attack on its military leaders in Damascus would be avenged. However, it might not trigger a major war since 99% of the 300 drones and missiles launched by Iran were intercepted, according to the Israeli military.

'Unlike the men's uniform \u2014 a standard compression tank top and mid-thigh shorts \u2014 the women competitors repping the so-called \u2018land of the free' will be donning a compression tank top and bikini bottoms with a noticeably high cut up the thigh,' wrote Danielle Campoamor .\nDanielle Campoamor. Interest in women's sports is at an all-time high, thanks to superstars like Caitlin Clark and Simone Biles, Campoamor noted, 'and despite all the excellence of women's sports, Team USA decided to send a resounding message to their athletes, our country and the world: You are viewed as a woman expected to perform for the male gaze, not a medal, way before you are viewed as an athlete. You must be sexy before you can be powerful. You must appear feminine before you can appear athletic.'\nSix people \u2014 five of them women \u2014 were killed in a stabbing attack at a mall in Sydney.

He had to stare down political opposition from his own supporters at the time, but his tough stance has been vindicated by the lack of mass shootings ever since.'\n'But restricting public access to weapons with the capability of mass lethality cannot stop hateful ideologies mixing with other noxious ingredients including radicalization and mental health issues.'\n'This includes misogyny.'\nFor more:\nJustin J.

'The party of Winston Churchill wants to ban (cigars)?' he moaned. 'Donnez-moi un break, as they say in Quebec. It's just mad.'\nThomas wrote, 'Under the proposed bill, no one born on or after January 1, 2009, would ever be allowed to buy tobacco, effectively raising the legal smoking age every year. This would mean today's 15-year-olds will never legally be able to buy cigarettes.'\n'Despite what Johnson may have led his audience to believe, a potential smoking ban enjoys broad popular support in the UK. A February survey by YouGov for the charity Action on Smoking and Health found that 71% of adults backed the goal of making Britain a country where no one smokes (12% are opposed). Like most people, I'm certain this would save many lives and relieve a massive strain on the National Health Service (NHS). Whether that goodwill proves sufficient to overcome the many obstacles still ahead remains to be seen.'\nDavid M. Perry : The FAFSA fiasco is a huge problem for students and colleges\nDavid M.

Seven years later they're feeling the benefits.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 When Kema Ward-Hopper and her then-fiance Nicholas Hopper, both from the US, decided to get married in Costa Rica, they had no idea that they'd end up relocating there a few years later.\nBut a series of devastating events led the couple and daughter Aaralyn, now 15, to a new life in the Central American country's very own 'blue zone,' one of the regions of the world where people live longest and are the healthiest.\nWard-Hopper, a health and life coach, was diagnosed with breast cancer a few months before their wedding in 2016.\n'[I had] started treatment and everything,' Ward-Hopper tells CNN Travel. 'If you see pictures from my wedding, I didn't have hair, and I didn't really look like myself. But I was sick.'\nWhile she hadn't been feeling well before they traveled to Costa Rica for their big day, Ward-Hopper noticed a change in her energy levels during the time that they spent there.\n'I just felt the best that I had been feeling since I'd been diagnosed,' she says. 'When we got back.\n'That feeling good\u2026 I thought that I was getting better. But it really seemed like it was environmental, because after about a week, I was feeling bad again.\n'So that was the first indicator that there was something special about Costa Rica.'\nWard-Hopper went on to have a unilateral mastectomy before undergoing reconstruction surgery and the family, who were based in Houston, Texas, tried to return to normal.\nHowever, they suffered another major blow when their home was destroyed by a Category 4 hurricane in August 2017.\n'I had the surgery and then Hurricane Harvey hit Houston,' she says. 'And we ended up losing our home. So it just seemed like a lot of bad things [happening] back to back to back to back.'\nAfter struggling to find a new home, the couple realized that there wasn't anything holding them to Houston anymore, and decided that it was time to move on.\n'My husband was like, \u2018Well, let's just leave the country,' adds Ward-Hopper.\nThey initially mulled over relocating to four potential destinations \u2013 Ghana, Sweden, Mexico, and of course, Costa Rica.\n'Costa Rica ended up winning out over the other places that were on our list,' adds Ward-Hopper, explaining that they were impressed by the country's health care and education system, as well as the environmental protections in place \u2013 Costa Rica is the first tropical country to have reversed deforestation.\n'Ever since we left there from our honeymoon, we just felt like we wanted to get back there and just feel good,' she adds. There's something energetic about being in Costa Rica.'\nWard-Hopper goes on to explain that the country's proximity to the US \u2013 Costa Rica is less than four hours from Houston by plane, was a major factor in their decision.\n'It just felt so serendipitous,' she says. 'I feel like if we had chosen one of the other locations, we would have done way more research and preparation than we did for Costa Rica.'\nIn 2018, around eight months after deciding to make Costa Rica their new home, the family left Houston to start afresh in Pueblo Nuevo, a neighborhood located in the Nicoya Peninsula, one of the world's blue zones, along with Loma Linda in California, Italy's Sardinia, Japan's Okinawa and Greece's Ikaria.\n'My husband and I came first and we were here for six weeks without my daughter,' says Ward-Hopper, explaining that they'd signed a lease on a property a friend had found for them.\n'It was like a second honeymoon.'\nThe couple spent their time tending to their garden, meeting the locals and getting used to their new surroundings.\n'We were in the jungle,' she says, recalling how they had to adapt to the sounds and creatures that came with their new environment.\n'It was an adventure. My memory of that time is very fond. By the time we came back with our daughter, it was peak rainy season. So that was a whole adventure in and of itself.'\nAs they'd entered Costa Rica on a tourist visa, the couple were only permitted to remain in the country for 90 days at a time, and would regularly return to the US to renew their visas.\nThankfully, Ward-Hopper already spoke Spanish before they arrived, while her daughter had some knowledge of the language, which helped the family to transition more quickly.\n'I don't know that we would have gotten some of the deals that we've gotten had we not had the ability to communicate,' she says, adding that her husband, who runs a logistics business, has been learning Spanish during their time there.\nAs the family settled into life in Costa Rica, Ward-Hopper, who describes their first year in the country as 'one long learning experience,' was particularly struck by the country's strong sense of community.\n'I had an idea of what I thought community was, but that was completely obliterated when I got here and experienced true community,' she says.\n'The locals were helpful whether they knew you or not\u2026 It was amazing. The community really looked out for each other.'\nAccording to Ward-Hopper, Aaralyn adapted very quickly and enjoyed being able to spend so much time on the beach and going on 'lots of hikes.'\n'My husband and I both commented that she was able to kind of have a childhood like we had in the 80s and 90s,' she says.\n'Being able to go outside and play outside of the watchful eye of your parents.'\nThe family also found that they felt more energized, which Ward-Hopper attributes to access to fresh fruit, vegetables and whole foods, as well as cleaner air.\n'The health benefits of the blue zone, I think, show up later in life,' she says.\n'But we have noticed that we feel better when we're here. Our cardiac health and lung health seems to be better.'\nIn August 2019, Ward-Hopper learned that she was pregnant with her second child.\n'It was a weird turn of events,' she admits. 'I didn't expect to get pregnant.'\nWhen the global Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, shutting down much of the world, the family were granted permission to remain in Costa Rica on their tourist visas.\nWard-Hopper welcomed her son Nicolai at their home in Pueblo Nuevo in April 2020.\nAside from not being able to have extended family with her due to border restrictions, she says that giving birth in Costa Rica turned out to be a wonderful experience.\n'The birth of my son was kind of like a meditation,' she adds. 'Everything was so intentional\u2026 I wish I could have had the experience with my daughter.'\nSadly, Ward-Hopper's sister passed away suddenly a few months later.\nDue to the complications around border restrictions at the time and the fact that Nicolai was born in Costa Rica and would have been unable to leave at that stage, Ward-Hopper made the difficult decision not to return to the US to be with her family.\n'That was also a really hard point in our journey,' she says, before recounting the way the local community rallied around them to make sure that they 'felt loved and supported.'\n'That's the kind of community that we live in,' she adds.\nThe family of four, who have since moved to a larger house in Nicoya, are now settled in Costa Rica and their lives couldn't be more different than they were in Houston.\nFor Ward-Hopper, one of the best things about the Costa Rican lifestyle is the way in which children are embraced in pretty much every aspect of everyday life.\n'I feel like in the States, you feel pressure taking your young child out to dinner or something,' she says.\n'Here, if your kid wants to play and walk around the table, then they tell you to leave them alone and let them. So it's just different.\n'They love children. And I don't necessarily know that I felt the same when my daughter was little.\n'It's a very family oriented nation. Families definitely [come] first.'\nWard-Hopper, who has been 'cancer free' for several years, has adapted to a slower paced lifestyle and learned to not 'be so uptight.'\n'In the US, everything is super fast,' Ward-Hopper says, noting that she's had to learn to stop apologizing every time she's a few minutes late.\n'You know the saying, \u2018If you're on time, you're late.' But here, that is not the case.'\nThe average life expectancy in Nicoya is said to be around 85 years and the region has a number of centenarians.\n'They're [the centenarians] delightful to talk with,' Ward-Hopper says, noting that she's always touched to see the way in which the local families take care of each other, with the old taking care of the young, and the young taking care of the old.\n'The elderly are a part of caring for the youngest generation \u2013 their grandchildren, or their great grandchildren, because they're in such good shape,' she says.\n'And it's that way because they're hardworking people, and they walk a lot of the places and they eat really well.\n'So I think all of those things contribute to their long life. They also live with the land and not in spite of the land.\n'So they don't try to remove all of the nature so that they can exist. They just kind of exist with the nature. At least where we live.'\nWhile Ward-Hopper says that there are endless benefits to living in Costa Rica, she stresses that it's not necessarily more affordable than the US.\n'Costa Rica is the most expensive country in Latin America,' she says. 'But I also think that depends on how you're trying to live.'\nWard-Hopper points out that the cost of living in areas of the country where there is a 'high ratio of expats to locals' is probably around the same as the US.\n'Where we live, it would be way more expensive, [to have the same] quality of life living back in Houston,' she says.\n'So for us it is more affordable, it's getting more expensive as more people move to Costa Rica.\n'But there are still places you can go and live cheaper. But it's far away from the most popular spots.'\nEven after several years of living in the country, Ward-Hopper says she's still as amazed by its incredible nature as she was in the beginning.\n'I'm so grateful, because I was worried that all this will become just the norm,' says Ward-Hopper. 'But it hasn't yet\u2026 We're still seeing new creatures this many years in. So that's fun.'\nWard-Hopper and her husband and daughter all became permanent residents of Costa Rica after the birth of Nicolai, who is a Costa Rican citizen.\nAlthough they have no desire to return to the US, Ward-Hopper misses her 'friends, family, and Amazon,' and yearns for a traditional US winter every once in a while.\n'When Christmas rolls around, sometimes I just want to put on fuzzy socks and a big hoodie and curl up somewhere cozy with a mug of hot chocolate while it's cold outside,' she says. 'But that does not happen [here]. It's a hot Christmas.'\nAnd while they're happy to stay where they are for the time being, the family don't necessarily plan to remain in Costa Rica indefinitely.\n'I think Costa Rica will be [our] home base, but we do have plans to travel and experience other parts of the world,' Ward-Hopper adds, explaining that they're considering spending time in Colombia and Brazil.\n'I guess we're more nomadic than stationary, but Costa Rica feels like home.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"travel","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Tamara Hardingham-Gill,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/unknown-4-20240417151921426.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnntravel","_score":2.5650902,"_id":"033b1e7581f8c305f9dc6cce52d42b6b"},{"title":"In India's 2024 election, BJP's main opposition appears increasingly weak in face of Modi juggernaut","author":"Helen Regan","published_date":"2024-04-21 02:19:31","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/20/india/india-election-opposition-alliance-intl-hnk","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Under the searing New Delhi sun, more than a dozen of India's top opposition leaders joined hands in a rare show of unity imploring voters to 'save democracy.'","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN\n\u2014\nUnder the searing New Delhi sun, more than a dozen of India's top opposition leaders joined hands in a rare show of unity imploring voters to 'save democracy.'\nStanding before thousands of supporters at the city's historic and politically important Ramlila Maidan, the March 31 rally marked the opposition's strongest attempt yet to sway voters against electing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third straight term.\nThe consequence of continued Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rule, they say, would be the erosion of the very foundation upon which modern India was built: democracy.\n'This election is for saving democracy and we must fight united,' main opposition party Indian National Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge told the crowds, who were waving the party flag of orange, white and green. 'There is no level playing field in this election.'\nIt echoed a similar rally more than 40 years earlier on the same spot, when opposition leaders fired up huge crowds to help change the course of the 1977 election \u2013 ending the 10-year rule of India's powerful third prime minister and political scion Indira Gandhi.\nGandhi had imposed a state of emergency, jailed key opposition leaders and curtailed civil freedoms. To some, India's future was perched on a needle point between autocracy and democracy. She lost the election and, in the eyes of many, India's democracy was saved.\nTo many supporters in the crowd three weeks ago, India is now at a similar crossroads with this high-stakes election deciding which path the country follows.\n'Our democracy is being murdered, India is becoming a dictatorship,' Hazari Lal Rajput, a resident from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, told CNN at the Ramlila Maidan.\nSupporters of India's opposition party, Indian National Congress, during an election rally in Puducherry on April 15, 2024\nSupporters of India's opposition party, Indian National Congress, during an election rally in Puducherry on April 15, 2024\nR.

Such levels of popularity for a two-term incumbent prime minister defy all modern conventions, both in India and throughout much of the democratic world.\nBut India's opposition leaders accuse Modi's right-wing government of becoming an electoral autocracy by attempting to rig the vote, weaponizing state agencies to stifle, attack and arrest opposition politicians, and undermining democratic principles ahead of elections, which began on April 19 and run until June 1, with results counted on June 4.\nThey also warn Modi's brand of Hindu nationalism is uncorking dangerous religious divides in a country with a long and tragic history of sectarian bloodletting.\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking during a rally in Sydney, Australia, on May 23, 2023.\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking during a rally in Sydney, Australia, on May 23, 2023.\nMatthew Abbott/The New York Times/Redux Narendra Modi was born in 1950, three years after India's independence, to mother Hiraben and father Damodardas, a teaseller, in the western state of Gujarat.

It has been beset by ideological differences, has seen a host of defections to the BJP and, even with the election in full swing, has yet to even name a prime ministerial candidate.\n'What kind of a democracy can you have if you don't have a vibrant opposition, a robust opposition that can question the government?' asks Arati Jerath, an independent political commentator and journalist.\n'That's why it's not really a question of whether Modi wins or not, it's a question of keeping the opposition alive to fight another day so that democracy in India survives.'\n\u2018Scorched earth'\nAmong those leading the charge for the opposition alliance is Rahul Gandhi, longtime face of the Congress and the latest member of his family to bid for power.\nHe is the son of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. His grandmother Indira was India's first female leader, and his great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the country's founding prime minister.\n'If the BJP wins these fixed elections and changes the constitution, the country will be on fire. Remember this,' Rahul Gandhi told the crowd in Delhi last month.\nThe BJP and its allies are gunning for a supermajority of more than two-thirds of the seats in India's parliament, the Lok Sabha. A rising fear among critics is that this would give the BJP the power to change India's constitution, which is rooted in the democratic principles of justice, liberty, equality and \u2013 crucially \u2013 secularism.\nThe BJP has repeatedly denied it has plans to change the constitution.\nCongress party leader Rahul Gandhi speaks during a press conference in New Delhi on March 25, 2023.\nCongress party leader Rahul Gandhi speaks during a press conference in New Delhi on March 25, 2023.\nMoney Sharma/AFP/Getty Images\n'When I say that I have big plans, no one should be scared. I don't take decisions to scare or run over anyone, I take decisions for the wholesome development of the nation,' Modi said in an interview with Indian news agency ANI earlier this week.\nBut the party has already begun publicly pulling India's government away from its secular foundation and leading BJP figures have openly advocated for the country to be declared a Hindu nation.\n'There shouldn't be politics on the basis of religion in any country, they should talk about real issues. Until people's financial situation improves, there won't be any social reform,' said voter Mohammad Irfan at the opposition rally in Delhi.\nOpposition parties have found themselves facing a slew of legal and financial challenges in the run-up to this year's election.\nGandhi's Congress \u2013 the largest party in the INDIA alliance \u2014 has accused the BJP of 'tax terrorism' and crippling its ability to campaign after its accounts were frozen by the tax department, leaving it unable to use some $20 million in funds. It has also been landed with a $218 million tax bill.\nThen came the arrest of Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi chief minister and head of the popular Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).\nKejriwal's detention on graft allegations came after the announcement of the general election last month, sparking protests in the capital. Analysts say it's the first time in post-independence history that an Indian chief minister has governed from behind bars.\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal speaks during a protest against alleged attacks on federalism by the federal government, in New Delhi, India, on February 8, 2024.\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal speaks during a protest against alleged attacks on federalism by the federal government, in New Delhi, India, on February 8, 2024.\nAltaf Qadri/AP\nKejriwal has denied the allegations, claiming they are politically motivated. He is just one of several prominent members of the opposition, including three other senior AAP leaders, that have also been arrested or investigated by state agencies in moves decried as political by their parties.\n'I think there are very serious concerns about how free and fair the elections are going to be in India this time around,' said Atishi, Delhi minister of education for the AAP, who goes by one name.\nReports have emerged of opposition party members being coerced into joining the BJP with the threat of arrest, while they were under investigation by state agencies. Other reports suggest politicians have had their probes dropped after switching sides.\nAtishi said she was also approached to switch to the BJP. 'Either you join the ruling party, and then the cases are closed or put into cold storage or if you don't, like the Aam Aadmi Party leaders, then the cases go ahead and you're arrested and put into jail,' she said, without specifically naming who approached her.\nCNN cannot independently confirm the incidents and has reached out to the BJP for comment.\nIn his interview with ANI, Modi denied any sliding of democracy under his rule and emphasized the independence of the Election Commission and state agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate, saying political leaders make up just 3% of cases.\n'Shouldn't we let the ED work independently when it is supposed to do so?' he said. 'I am convinced that corruption has destroyed the country. We should fight against corruption with our full strength.'\nAnalyst Jerath said a BJP-led campaign to weaken the opposition was part of Modi's 'scorched earth policy.'\n'Just wipe out whatever comes in your way so that this juggernaut can move on without any kind of challenge, without any obstruction,' she said.\nGandhi \u2018not a contender'\nModi is enduringly popular, analysts say, appealing to both the poor and the affluent, especially among much of the roughly 80% of India's population who are Hindu.\nDuring his 10 years in power, he has launched a raft of welfare policies including free food handouts, housing, cheap gas cylinders for women and infrastructure projects.\nIndia is also the world's fastest-growing major economy and Modi's presence on the world stage \u2014 including hosting the G20 \u2014 has cemented the country as a modern global power, along with a history-making moon landing.\nAuthor Christophe Jaffrelot told CNN Modi makes people feel 'proud again of being Indian.'\n'There is a sense in India, a constant sense, of vulnerability, a lack of self-esteem. So to be recognized as a great power in spite of everything, (that) is attributed to him,' he said.\nThat does not mean there aren't key issues the opposition could rally around, analysts say, including the BJP's failure to increase education opportunities or improve health infrastructure \u2013 especially following the coronavirus pandemic, which hit India especially hard.\nYouth unemployment also remains a huge problem, close to 50% among 20-to-24-year-olds.\nBut the INDIA alliance has failed to capitalize on these weak spots, Jerath said.\n'They haven't been able to weave together a cohesive kind of campaign, come up with a catchy slogan that will fire the imagination of the voting public,' she said.\nCongress leader Gandhi is one of the few opposition figures considered to have the kind of star power and name recognition to stand against Modi.\nBut though he may have the name, Gandhi lacks leadership skills, some analysts say.\nRasheed Kidwai, journalist and author of '24 Akbar Road,' a history of the Congress party, said it's a winner-takes-all election and there is 'no silver medal in politics.'\n'The problem with INDIA alliance is there is nobody who has that kind of hunger, who has that kind of personal(ity), who has that kind of inner sense of belonging or ownership to go in this election. Rahul is doing it but is not a contender,' he said.\nGandhi recently completed a 6,713-kilometer (4,200-mile) walk across the country, starting in the violence-hit northeastern state of Manipur, to raise issues of poverty, unemployment, diversity and democracy with voters.\nDespite these efforts, the BJP has dominated the campaign narrative.\nA key gauge of opposition strength will be in those parts of India where the BJP has historically failed to make inroads.\nSupporters of the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) participate in an election campaign rally on Hill Cart Road in Siliguri, India, on April 16, 2024.\nSupporters of the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) participate in an election campaign rally on Hill Cart Road in Siliguri, India, on April 16, 2024.\nDiptendu Dutta/NurPhoto/Getty Images\nRegional opposition heavyweights, such as the West Bengal chief minister and All India Trinamool Congress head Mamata Banerjee and the south's Tamil Nadu chief minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin, will be vying to block a BJP takeover in their respective states.\nBut the only other major national party is the Congress, which has been the main opposition since 2014.\nCongress governed the country for much of the 77 years since independence, and while it was once a powerful political force with its legacy rooted in the formation of modern India, it now finds itself in the doldrums, dogged by infighting and accusations of corruption within the party.\n'In the Congress, the best and brightest are not fighting the election,' Kidwai said.\nAnalysts say that during a decade in opposition, Congress has failed to rebuild its organization and political machinery to effectively take on the BJP.\nThe Congress organization has 'decayed and almost died over the years, particularly in north India, and particularly in Uttar Pradesh, which is the largest, most populous state,' Jerath said.\n'There was a time after independence, and for many years after independence, that they used to say that you would find a Congress flag in every single village in India,' she said. 'That's no longer true.'\nStill, there is optimism from some.\nThe AAP's Atishi said that despite repeated attacks against her party, it has been able to defeat the BJP in Delhi again and again.\n'Democracy becoming an autocracy \u2026 That is what we are fighting against,' she said. 'I think that the people of India have always voted very sensibly, and we hope that they do so this time.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Helen Regan,Rhea Mogul","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2147820411.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":2.4364204,"_id":"d9d77c90c6fbf24426f2f6910912f042"},{"title":"Herders on front line of India's Himalayan border dispute with China fear losing their way of life","author":"Simone Mccarthy","published_date":"2024-04-17 02:05:51","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/16/china/ladakh-india-china-border-intl-hnk","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"High in the Himalayas, the people of a remote northern Indian territory fear their way of life is under threat from the changing climate, looming development \u2013 and border tensions with China.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 High in the Himalayas, the people of a remote northern Indian territory fear their way of life is under threat from the changing climate, looming development \u2013 and border tensions with China.\nAt stake, they believe, is the future of Ladakh, one of the world's highest elevation regions, where indigenous tribes maintain nomadic traditions on sprawling plains hemmed in by mountains punctuated by Buddhist monasteries.\nFor years, Lopzang Dadul herded his yaks, sheep and goats across the vast, vertiginous landscape near India's contested border with China, following the seasons to find grazing land.\nBut now, Dadul says, shepherds are being barred by the Indian military from lands that for generations sustained Ladakh's nomadic way of life \u2013 a situation he and others say has worsened following a deadly 2020 border clash between Chinese and Indian soldiers.\n'In India, the army is not letting us go to places which they call no-man's land \u2026 civilians are not allowed to go there anymore,' says Dadul, 33, a father of two from the village of Phobrang.\n'If we do not get enough land we will have to sell our livestock \u2026 and look for another option.'\nLadakh's herders inhabit what is now a highly strategically sensitive area, where India's contested 2,100-mile (3,379-kilometer) boundary with China has for decades been a source of friction between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.\n'A lot of these grazing lands are in contested areas between India and China, and (after the 2020 clash) these grazing lands have now been denied to the locals, because they have been brought as part of buffer zones between India and China,' according to Sushant Singh, a senior fellow at the Indian think tank Centre for Policy Research.\nBoth India and China maintain a significant military presence along their de facto border, known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which has never been clearly defined and has remained a source of friction since a 1962 Sino-Indian border war.\nFour years ago, border tensions broke out into the open when a clash in Ladakh-Aksai Chin brought the first known fatalities in conflict between the two countries in more than four decades \u2013 with at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers killed.\nThe violence was followed by a process of disengagement, the creation of buffer zones and ongoing border talks \u2013 but the situation remains tense and neither India nor China have publicly specified where the zones are, making for a murky reality on the ground.\nFor that reason, the location of some of those zones may 'not be clear to the local people,' said Manoj Joshi, a distinguished fellow at the New Delhi think tank Observer Research Foundation.\nThe movement of herders is seen as sensitive because both countries have in the past used their presence in an area to assert military control over it, said Singh.\n'First graziers go, then you pitch up tents, and then your soldiers reach and then you say \u2018this is our area,'' he said, noting why India is blocking them from entering these zones.\nKonchok Stanzin, 37, a councilor in Ladakh's Chushul constituency, which encompasses four border villages, says such restrictions have impacted herders' access to land.\n'Rezeng La, Mukhpari, Black Top, Helmet Top and Gurung Hill. All these areas are winter grazing areas of Chushul village. Now people find it very difficult to go there. These areas are now no-man's land,' said Stanzin, who has been raising awareness about these issues since 2020.\nBut those interviewed by CNN also point to what they say is the impact of Chinese encroachment and changes to the control of contested lands over time, including from the 2020 clash.\nChinese encroachment and changes to the control of contested lands over time, including from the 2020 clash.

They have been crossing the line and coming in,' he said. 'China is capturing the land, the Indian government is saying nothing is lost, the (Indian) Army is not letting us go there.'\nCNN was unable to independently confirm the status of the restricted land described in this report, nor claims of Chinese encroachment or loss of Indian territorial control after the 2020 clash.\nIn a statement, India's Ministry of Defense told CNN: 'No Indian territory has been lost during the standoff. Negotiations are currently underway for disengagement at the remaining friction points.'\nOn the buffer zones, the ministry said: 'all disengagements achieved till date have been based on the principle of Mutual and Equal Security. Currently, a mutually agreed moratorium exists on military activities from both sides in areas where disengagement has been affected, to maintain peace and tranquility.'\nThe 'number of Indian graziers and livestock in traditional grazing areas has seen a sharp rise' after the events of 2020, the ministry's statement added. 'There has thus been no adverse impact on the livelihood of locals in the area.'\nChina's Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\nExplained: Why do India and China spar at the border? (2022)\n02:40 - Source: CNN\n02:40 - Source: CNN Mounting concern over threats to the way of life in Ladakh \u2013 from lost grazing lands to climate change and industrialization \u2013 have driven thousands from across the region to its joint capital city of Leh in recent weeks to demand greater rights ahead of India's general election, which begins Friday.\nThere, some 3,500 meters (11,550 feet) above sea level, residents are calling for Indian statehood for Ladakh to ensure political representation, as well as inclusion in the national constitution's Sixth Schedule, which grants special rights to tribal areas. Organizers say at least 10,000 people turned out during a single day in Leh last month to support the start of an ongoing, weekslong hunger strike.\nLadakh lost special controls over its land in 2019, following a controversial move by the Indian central government that stripped the former state of Jammu and Kashmir of its statehood and broke off Ladakh, which had been a part of it, into a separate territory.\nThe change placed the region under the direct control of India's central government, which critics say has pared back national environmental protections and backed ecologically harmful infrastructure development pushes in other sensitive parts of the country in recent years.\nChina doesn't recognize what its Foreign Ministry has called the 'so-called union territory of Ladakh,' saying the 'western section of the China-India border has always belonged to China.' In addition to China, the territory of Ladakh also shares a disputed border with Pakistan, another neighbor with which New Delhi has fraught relations.\nNow many in Ladakh are concerned about the potential damage of future New Delhi-backed industrial projects, or that an influx of people moving in could shift the largely tribal demography.\n'Only local people will think about the next few generations, (others will) \u2026 make mistakes at best and sell off the place at worst,' said Sonam Wangchuk, an activist and educator widely known across India, who is leading the hunger strike to draw attention to environmental threats facing Ladakh.\nSpeaking to CNN during the 19th day of a 21-day fast last month, Wangchuk said in a steady but weakened voice that without protections and representation, 'we will have no control on how to secure these mountains.'\nHe pointed to plans for a solar plant and the potential for more environmentally damaging industry to follow.\nThe activism has faced pressure from local authorities.\nEarlier this month, Wangchuk and other civil society leaders called off a planned peaceful march toward the border they said was meant to reveal grazing lands lost to Chinese encroachment, after local authorities banned unauthorized gatherings and temporarily slowed internet speeds, citing an 'apprehension of breach of peace.'\nCNN has reached out to Leh's district magistrate and local police for comment.\nSome, like the Ladakh president of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), say protections on land, jobs and culture in Ladakh could be granted through other means, which local leaders have rejected. He also suggested the border dispute is a factor in why other demands won't be met.\n'We are with the border with China and Pakistan. How can a sensitive (place) like Ladakh just be turned into a state immediately?' the local party leader, Phunchok Stanzin, told CNN.\nThe nomadic traditions of shepherd communities living off the land and selling goats' wool to be spun into luxurious Pashmina had already been diminishing in Ladakh in recent decades.\nA tourism boom and the impacts of climate change \u2013 as receding glaciers and other impacts drive flash floods, drought and reduced snowfall \u2013 are among factors shifting how some families make their livings.\nNamgail Phonchok, 51, whose village lies south of the piercing blue waters of Pangong Lake that stretches from India into China, fears his children won't be able to continue their way of life \u2013 including due to access restrictions on grazing lands.\n'When they won't let us graze, then we will sell our animals. We do not know what other job to get, and our own work will also go, then what will we do?' he said, adding that 'if big industries come here then the environment will get ruined completely.'\nBetween longer-term changes and new restrictions on grazing lands, 'our nomadic way of life is going away,' Phonchok said.\nDadul, in Phobrang, has seen those changes too.\nHe says 60 of the 113 households in his village used to be nomadic; now only 10 are maintaining the tradition due to those factors and lost grazing lands.\n'Nomadic way of life is a very rare thing in India. In one home you have yaks, sheep, goats, horses and other livestock \u2026 yaks are meant for transportation and milk, cheese and butter, and the goats give Pashmina. This is the actual eco-friendly and sustainable way of life,' he said.\n'When the army steps back from the real border, this effect spills over to the village \u2026 and the movement of the nomadic tribes is restricted,' he added.\nNew Delhi has denied that its border tensions with China are impacting the lives of the shepherds there.\nAnd Prime Minister Narendra Modi \u2013 India's Hindu nationalist leader, who is widely expected to win a rare third term in the upcoming election \u2013 has tread cautiously around the border issue, claiming in the wake of the June 2020 border clash that 'no one has intruded' into Indian territory.\nModi's comments appeared to contradict his own foreign minister, who said the violence began after 'the Chinese side sought to erect a structure in Galwan valley on our side of the LAC.' Beijing at the time said, 'none of the responsibility lies with China,' blaming Indian troops for 'starting provocations' and crossing the de facto border.\nNew Delhi says two sites remain contested along the Ladakh border after disengagement at other contested zones following the 2020 clash. Observers believe Chinese forces are blocking Indian patrols in those contested areas where they previously had access.\nAt the points where there has been disengagement, the establishment of buffer zones means 'both sides have pulled back by mutual agreement and neither side patrols there,' as opposed to earlier, when troops could patrol up to their claim, according to Joshi in New Delhi.\nNew Delhi's official response \u2013 and the lack of transparency over buffer zones \u2013 has fueled domestic debate about India's position on the border.\nA report from a Ladakh police superintendent released in 2023 further stoked concerns \u2013 detailing how Indian forces lost their presence in 26 of 65 patrol points over an unspecified period. Reduced patrolling led to an ultimate loss of control over such areas, where China grabs land 'inch-by-inch,' the report said.\nThe report also accused China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) of having 'taken advantage' of the buffer areas established in the de-escalation talks by objecting to Indian forces' movement in the buffer zone and asking for further pushback.\nIt noted: 'Much restrictions on the movement of civilians and grazers near the forward areas on the Indian side, indicating their \u2018play safe' strategy that they do not want to annoy the PLA by giving them the chance to raise objections on the areas being claimed as disputed.'\nA copy was posted online by Indian magazine The Caravan alongside a report from Singh, from the Centre for Policy Research.\nSingh, who is also a lecturer at Yale University, suggested the lack of clarity on the border situation may stem from Modi's concerns over Chinese military superiority \u2013 and tarnishing his government's image.\nIf Modi's strongly nationalist government were to acknowledge loss of territorial control, 'it would be very difficult for him to then not take some aggressive action to regain that lost territory,' he said.\n'Then the risk of escalation would be very high and, in that escalation, I think Mr. Modi's government fears that they could be humiliated \u2013 that they could lose to China.'\nBut some from Ladakh argue that the sensitivity of the region, both environmentally and strategically, is the very reason to allow the local people more control over the land \u2013 including access around the border.\n'The shepherd is going to the mountain and protecting it every day,' said Dadul, the shepherd from Phobrang.\n'If the real protectors are brought to the borders and allowed to stay there, then what is left will be protected.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Simone McCarthy,Aishwarya S

believe, is the future of Ladakh, one of the world's highest elevation regions, where indigenous tribes maintain nomadic traditions on sprawling plains hemmed in by mountains punctuated by Buddhist monasteries.\nFor years, Lopzang Dadul herded his yaks, sheep and goats across the vast, vertiginous landscape near India's contested border with China, following the seasons to find grazing land.\nBut now, Dadul says, shepherds are being barred by the Indian military from lands that for generations sustained Ladakh's nomadic way of life \u2013 a situation he and others say has worsened following a deadly 2020 border clash between Chinese and Indian soldiers.\n'In India, the army is not letting us go to places which they call no-man's land \u2026 civilians are not allowed to go there anymore,' says Dadul, 33, a father of two from the village of Phobrang.\n'If we do not get enough land we will have to sell our livestock \u2026 and look for another option.'\nLadakh's herders inhabit what is now a highly strategically sensitive area, where India's contested 2,100-mile (3,379-kilometer) boundary with China has for decades been a source of friction between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.\n'A lot of these grazing lands are in contested areas between India and China, and (after the 2020 clash) these grazing lands have now been denied to the locals, because they have been brought as part of buffer zones between India and China,' according to Sushant Singh, a senior fellow at the Indian think tank Centre for Policy Research.\nBoth India and China maintain a significant military presence along their de facto border, known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which has never been clearly defined and has remained a source of friction since a 1962 Sino-Indian border war.\nFour years ago, border tensions broke out into the open when a clash in Ladakh-Aksai Chin brought the first known fatalities in conflict between the two countries in more than four decades \u2013 with at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers killed.\nThe violence was followed by a process of disengagement, the creation of buffer zones and ongoing border talks \u2013 but the situation remains tense and neither India nor China have publicly specified where the zones are, making for a murky reality on the ground.\nFor that reason, the location of some of those zones may 'not be clear to the local people,' said Manoj Joshi, a distinguished fellow at the New Delhi think tank Observer Research Foundation.\nThe movement of herders is seen as sensitive because both countries have in the past used their presence in an area to assert military control over it, said Singh.\n'First graziers go, then you pitch up tents, and then your soldiers reach and then you say \u2018this is our area,'' he said, noting why India is blocking them from entering these zones.\nKonchok Stanzin, 37, a councilor in Ladakh's Chushul constituency, which encompasses four border villages, says such restrictions have impacted herders' access to land.\n'Rezeng La, Mukhpari, Black Top, Helmet Top and Gurung Hill. All these areas are winter grazing areas of Chushul village. Now people find it very difficult to go there. These areas are now no-man's land,' said Stanzin, who has been raising awareness about these issues since 2020.\nBut those interviewed by CNN also point to what they say is the impact of Chinese encroachment and changes to the control of contested lands over time, including from the 2020 clash.\nChinese encroachment and changes to the control of contested lands over time, including from the 2020 clash. 'We know the reality, we know the ground situation. If the (Indian) government says we have not lost an inch of land, then whatever we have lost is already lost,' said Stanzin.\nDadul in Phobrang said the 'Chinese are coming toward us constantly. They have been crossing the line and coming in,' he said. 'China is capturing the land, the Indian government is saying nothing is lost, the (Indian) Army is not letting us go there.'\nCNN was unable to independently confirm the status of the restricted land described in this report, nor claims of Chinese encroachment or loss of Indian territorial control after the 2020 clash.\nIn a statement, India's Ministry of Defense told CNN: 'No Indian territory has been lost during the standoff. Negotiations are currently underway for disengagement at the remaining friction points.'\nOn the buffer zones, the ministry said: 'all disengagements achieved till date have been based on the principle of Mutual and Equal Security. Currently, a mutually agreed moratorium exists on military activities from both sides in areas where disengagement has been affected, to maintain peace and tranquility.'\nThe 'number of Indian graziers and livestock in traditional grazing areas has seen a sharp rise' after the events of 2020, the ministry's statement added. 'There has thus been no adverse impact on the livelihood of locals in the area.'\nChina's Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\nMounting concern over threats to the way of life in Ladakh \u2013 from lost grazing lands to climate change and industrialization \u2013 have driven thousands from across the region to its joint capital city of Leh in recent weeks to demand greater rights ahead of India's general election, which begins Friday.\nThere, some 3,500 meters (11,550 feet) above sea level, residents are calling for Indian statehood for Ladakh to ensure political representation, as well as inclusion in the national constitution's Sixth Schedule, which grants special rights to tribal areas. Organizers say at least 10,000 people turned out during a single day in Leh last month to support the start of an ongoing, weekslong hunger strike.\nLadakh lost special controls over its land in 2019, following a controversial move by the Indian central government that stripped the former state of Jammu and Kashmir of its statehood and broke off Ladakh, which had been a part of it, into a separate territory.\nThe change placed the region under the direct control of India's central government, which critics say has pared back national environmental protections and backed ecologically harmful infrastructure development pushes in other sensitive parts of the country in recent years.\nChina doesn't recognize what its Foreign Ministry has called the 'so-called union territory of Ladakh,' saying the 'western section of the China-India border has always belonged to China.' In addition to China, the territory of Ladakh also shares a disputed border with Pakistan, another neighbor with which Delhi has fraught relations.\nNow many in Ladakh are concerned about the potential damage of future New Delhi-backed industrial projects, or that an influx of people moving in could shift the largely tribal demography.\n'Only local people will think about the next few generations, (others will) \u2026 make mistakes at best and sell off the place at worst,' said Sonam Wangchuk, an activist and educator widely known across India, who is leading the hunger strike to draw attention to environmental threats facing Ladakh.\nSpeaking to CNN during the 19th day of a 21-day fast last month, Wangchuk said in a steady but weakened voice that without protections and representation, 'we will have no control on how to secure these mountains.'\nHe pointed to plans for a solar plant and the potential for more environmentally damaging industry to follow.\nThe activism has faced pressure from local authorities.\nEarlier this month, Wangchuk and other civil society leaders called off a planned peaceful march toward the border they said was meant to reveal grazing lands lost to Chinese encroachment, after local authorities banned unauthorized gatherings and temporarily slowed internet speeds, citing an 'apprehension of breach of peace.'\nCNN has reached out to Leh's district magistrate and local police for comment.\nSome, like the Ladakh president of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), say protections on land, jobs and culture in Ladakh could be granted through other means, which local leaders have rejected. He also suggested the border dispute is a factor in why other demands won't be met.\n'We are with the border with China and Pakistan. How can a sensitive (place) like Ladakh just be turned into a state immediately?' the local party leader, Phunchok Stanzin, told CNN.\nThe nomadic traditions of shepherd communities living off the land and selling goats' wool to be spun into luxurious Pashmina had already been diminishing in Ladakh in recent decades.\nA tourism boom and the impacts of climate change \u2013 as receding glaciers and other impacts drive flash floods, drought and reduced snowfall \u2013 are among factors shifting how some families make their livings.\nNamgail Phonchok, 51, whose village lies south of the piercing blue waters of Pangong Lake that stretches from India into China, fears his children won't be able to continue their way of life \u2013 including due to access restrictions on grazing lands.\n'When they won't let us graze, then we will sell our animals. We do not know what other job to get, and our own work will also go, then what will we do?' he said, adding that 'if big industries come here then the environment will get ruined completely.'\nBetween longer-term changes and new restrictions on grazing lands, 'our nomadic way of life is going away,' Phonchok said.\nDadul, in Phobrang, has seen those changes too.\nHe says 60 of the 113 households in his village used to be nomadic; now only 10 are maintaining the tradition due to those factors and lost grazing lands.\n'Nomadic way of life is a very rare thing in India. In one home you have yaks, sheep, goats, horses and other livestock \u2026 yaks are meant for transportation and milk, cheese and butter, and the goats give Pashmina. This is the actual eco-friendly and sustainable way of life,' he said.\n'When the army steps back from the real border, this effect spills over to the village \u2026 and the movement of the nomadic tribes is restricted,' he added.\nNew Delhi has denied that its border tensions with China are impacting the lives of the shepherds there.\nAnd Prime Minister Narendra Modi \u2013 India's Hindu nationalist leader, who is widely expected to win a rare third term in the upcoming election \u2013 has tread cautiously around the border issue, claiming in the wake of the June 2020 border clash that 'no one has intruded' into Indian territory.\nModi's comments appeared to contradict his own foreign minister, who said the violence began after 'the Chinese side sought to erect a structure in Galwan valley on our side of the LAC.' Beijing at the time said, 'none of the responsibility lies with China,' blaming Indian troops for 'starting provocations' and crossing the de facto border.\nNew Delhi says two sites remain contested along the Ladakh border after disengagement at other contested zones following the 2020 clash. Observers believe Chinese forces are blocking Indian patrols in those contested areas where they previously had access.\nAt the points where there has been disengagement, the establishment of buffer zones means 'both sides have pulled back by mutual agreement and neither side patrols there,' as opposed to earlier, when troops could patrol up to their claim, according to Joshi in New Delhi.\nNew Delhi's official response \u2013 and the lack of transparency over buffer zones \u2013 has fueled domestic debate about India's position on the border.\nA report from a Ladakh police superintendent released in 2023 further stoked concerns \u2013 detailing how Indian forces lost their presence in 26 of 65 patrol points over an unspecified period. Reduced patrolling led to an ultimate loss of control over such areas, where China grabs land 'inch-by-inch,' the report said.\nThe report also accused China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) of having 'taken advantage' of the buffer areas established in the de-escalation talks by objecting to Indian forces' movement in the buffer zone and asking for further pushback.\nIt noted: 'Much restrictions on the movement of civilians and grazers near the forward areas on the Indian side, indicating their \u2018play safe' strategy that they do not want to annoy the PLA by giving them the chance to raise objections on the areas being claimed as disputed.'\nA copy was posted online by Indian magazine The Caravan alongside a report from Singh, from the Centre for Policy Research.\nSingh, who is also a lecturer at Yale University, suggested the lack of clarity on the border situation may stem from Modi's concerns over Chinese military superiority \u2013 and tarnishing his government's image.\nIf Modi's strongly nationalist government were to acknowledge loss of territorial control, 'it would be very difficult for him to then not take some aggressive action to regain that lost territory,' he said.\n'Then the risk of escalation would be very high and, in that escalation, I think Mr. Modi's government fears that they could be humiliated \u2013 that they could lose to China.'\nBut some from Ladakh argue that the sensitivity of the region, both environmentally and strategically, is the very reason to allow the local people more control over the land \u2013 including access around the border.\n'The shepherd is going to the mountain and protecting it every day,' said Dadul, the shepherd from Phobrang.\n'If the real protectors are brought to the borders and allowed to stay there, then what is left will be protected.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Aishwarya S Iyer,Simone McCarthy","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/img20240323100250.jpeg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":2.385653,"_id":"6d079bbab57637a97fb542fbe73149a4"},{"title":"Why Biden and Democrats are talking so much about freedom","author":"Ronald Brownstein","published_date":"2024-04-17 04:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/abortion-democrats-freedom-messaging/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration:\u2026","summary":"When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration: 'This fight is about freedom, and the freedom that is fundamental to the promise of America.'\nIn a new abortion-focused ad that the Biden campaign aired in Arizona last week, President Joe Biden somberly asks: 'If Donald Trump gets back in power, what freedom will you lose next?'\nFor Biden, Harris and other Democrats to lean so heavily on the word 'freedom' in this campaign is a historic reversal of roles. At least since the New Deal 90 years ago, Republicans have been the party most likely to frame their agenda as advancing 'freedom' and 'liberty' while Democrats have more often emphasized ideas such as 'equality' and 'justice.'\nRepublicans haven't abandoned their rhetorical efforts to claim the terrain of freedom. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for instance, used the word almost as a mantra the past few years to denounce the restrictions many states imposed to fight the spread of Covid-19 and to attack what he calls the left's effort to impose 'woke ideology.' And Trump disparages Biden's agenda to promote the deployment of electric vehicles as an attempt to deny Americans' freedom to continue purchasing gas-powered cars and trucks.\nBut the GOP push at every level of government to roll back the 'rights revolution' of the past six decades \u2013 symbolized by the proliferation of red-state laws limiting access to abortion and potentially other reproductive health care such as IVF \u2013 has provided Democrats a historic opportunity to reverse the direction of this long-running debate, many analysts agree.\n'Historically, Republicans have rooted their philosophical world view in liberty: for them it's about freedom to own guns, to practice religion as they see fit' or reducing government taxes, spending and regulation, said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute, which studies the intersection of culture and politics. 'What's new is Democrats are using the term in ways to reimagine what freedom really means.'\nTransforming the debate over freedom may be especially crucial for Biden because polls consistently show Trump with a double-digit lead when voters are asked who they trust more to handle the economy. That means that to win the election Biden will need to convince a substantial number of voters who believe Trump is better for their bottom line to vote against him anyway. The interrelated issues revolving around rights, values and democracy likely offer the president his best chance to do so. 'If any issue' is going to flip voters who express more confidence in Trump on the economy, 'it is going to be social issues like abortion,' said Deckman.\nBiden signaled the central role freedom would play in his campaign messaging from the outset, in the video he released last year announcing his plan to seek reelection. As an ominous piano key trills behind images of the January 6, 2021, insurrection, abortion rights protesters and the White House, Biden opens the video with a stark declaration: 'Freedom. Personal freedom is fundamental to who we are as Americans. There's nothing more important. Nothing more sacred.' Later he says: 'The question we're facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer. I know what I want the answer to be, and I think you do too.'\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security.\nRoe v.

But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security. Harris, who has been the administration's point person in delivering the freedom message, has likewise cast an expansive net. When Harris delivered a Martin Luther King Day speech to the NAACP this year that summarized the administration's case for another term, she cited all the issues Biden did in the video and others, such as the restrictions several red states have imposed on the teaching of the nation's racial history and the right 'to live free from the horror of gun violence.'\nWay to Win, a liberal group that funds organizations and campaigns focusing on voters of color, has been pushing the party for several years to emphasize the freedom argument. Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, the group's vice president and chief strategy officer, says linking all these other issues to abortion is key to portraying Trump and his allies as a threat to freedom.\n'If [abortion] was the only thing, it would feel different than if you are able to tick off all these other things that they are doing and that they will do,' she said. 'We can even say it with other kinds of repro [rights]: We can say it with IVF, or now they are going to come for your contraception. Abortion is an entry point: because it is so visceral for people, it is a way to connect to a larger story about rights and freedoms.'\nLauren Hitt, a senior spokesperson for the Biden campaign, argued freedom will be a powerful message for the president because it resonates with a broad range of voters. 'It \u2026 speaks to the values of traditional Republican voters, [Nikki] Haley primary voters, and suburban voters \u2013 as well as to our base who believe deeply that the government shouldn't be making personal decisions for people,' she said. 'It's a uniquely powerful idea grounded in traditional democratic values that will be critical in winning the swing voters we need to win in November.'\nThe Trump campaign pushed back on Biden's ad asking which freedom Trump would take away next. 'Under Joe Biden, Americans are less free, less safe, and less prosperous,' Karoline Leavitt, the campaign's national spokesperson, said in a statement.\nDaniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that broad changes in societal attitudes have encouraged both parties to emphasize their commitments to personal freedom. 'Each side recognizes this is something people care about,' Cox said. 'It's effective language at a time when we are increasingly individualistic. We are not as inclined to be communitarian and oriented toward the concerns of others. So I think it's not a surprise that we're seeing both political parties try to employ this language to their advantage.'\nEven with all the increased Democratic emphasis on protecting rights, Cox said, the issue remains 'contested ground' that can favor either party depending on how it is framed. While Republicans have been 'on their heels' defending abortion restrictions such as last week's Arizona ruling, he said, the party has benefited in other races from positioning itself as defending 'parent's rights,' as Republican Glenn Youngkin did while winning the Virginia governorship in 2021. (It's notable that when abortion rights and parental rights collided in the 2023 Virginia state legislative elections, Democrats stressing the former won control of both chambers over Republicans emphasizing the latter.)\nPolling suggests the public remains split over which party it trusts to defend basic rights and freedoms. To begin with, Democrats and Republicans hold very different priorities over which rights are most important to protect, PRRI found in unpublished national polling shared exclusively with CNN. In that survey, conducted late last year, Republicans were most likely to say their freedom to own guns, to practice their religion and to speak their mind was growing more restricted; Democrats were most likely to say that they were losing the freedom to control their own body. 'The parties are talking past each other,' Deckman said. 'Freedom is a word that is quintessentially American, but it depends on what freedoms you are referring to in the first place.'\nThe public returned a similar split verdict last fall in an NBC poll that asked voters which party they trusted more to handle different issues. In the poll, Democrats held a commanding 18 percentage point advantage on dealing with abortion. But when asked which party they trusted more on 'protecting our constitutional rights,' voters preferred Republicans by a margin of 43% to 35%. Even White women, who strongly preferred Democrats on abortion, split evenly over which party they trusted on the broader question of preserving core constitutional rights.\nThat GOP advantage may reflect the traditional political dynamic that conservative voters have been more likely than liberals to believe their rights are under siege and to view government actions as a threat to their liberty. In 2022 polling by Penn State University's McCourtney Institute for Democracy, Republicans were twice as likely as Democrats to say that they had lost rights and freedoms over the past decade. Republicans were also considerably more likely, though not by as lopsided a margin, to predict that they would lose more rights than they gain over the next decade.\nThe real-world consequence of that imbalance was on display in the 2016 presidential campaign, when Democratic-leaning voters largely shrugged about Hillary Clinton's warnings that a Trump victory would allow him to move the Supreme Court to the right in a way that would threaten basic rights, like abortion.\nChris Wilson, a GOP pollster who worked for the super PAC supporting DeSantis in the 2024 campaign, said the Penn State polling suggests that Biden still will face difficulty mobilizing key elements of the Democratic coalition with a message about rights and freedoms. He noted that such groups as Generation Z, Blacks and Latinos were much less likely than college-educated Whites or Republicans to express fears in the poll that they would lose rights in the decade ahead.\n'To whatever extent the Democrats are trying to make a rights argument, it's not as worrying to the youth and to minorities as it is to Whites, people with college degrees, and Boomers,' Wilson said. 'Biden's \u2018rights' argument might be a big hit with his peers, but might be the wrong note to strike if he wants to hold onto the parts of the Democratic coalition that are starting to look shaky.'\nBut the Penn State polling was conducted before the Dobbs decision ended the nationwide right to abortion. And many analysts believe that seismic shift has increased the relevance of questions revolving around rights and freedoms to key groups that Democrats rely on \u2013 with younger women especially focused on these threats. While Republicans traditionally responded more to these arguments, Deckman said, 'These times certainly have made freedom a more accessible, even an existential, issue for people on the left.'\nFernandez Ancona agrees to an extent with both Wilson and Deckman. The 2022 elections, she said, demonstrated how strongly many people react to the risk of losing rights they believed had been settled. 'When these things you take for granted are taken away in this very stark way, it's incredibly motivating,' she said. But she also believes that Democrats need to tie their case about defending personal freedom into a broader message that portrays the 2024 election less as a personal choice between Trump and Biden than as a fundamental crossroads over America's future priorities that will shape not only personal liberties but also economic opportunity.\n'We have to get people to shift their thinking about how this is a choice between two different futures,' she said. 'It can get people out of this one-to-one candidate-to- candidate [comparison] and asking, \u2018what I like, what I don't like' about Trump or Biden.'\nFor libertarians, the escalating struggle between Biden and Republicans over the idea of freedom is a source of both bemusement and frustration. Libertarians take a purist position that advocates for minimal government intervention in both personal behavior and the economy; they usually find Republicans deficient on the first count, and Democrats on the second.\nDavid Boaz, a distinguished senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, sees those flaws in both Biden and Trump. The Biden administration, Boaz said, is 'very big on reproductive freedom, and very big on a lot of aspects of LGBTQ freedom, but beyond those things, where's the freedom in the Biden-Harris plan?' And while Trump talks about promoting economic freedom by cutting taxes and regulation, Boaz continued, Republicans have also undermined such freedom by promoting high tariffs and using government policy to punish companies they disfavor, as DeSantis did with Disney in Florida.\nBut while Boaz believes both Biden and Trump have imperfect records when it comes to promoting freedom, he thinks one issue breaks the tie between them: Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election. \ufeff'I have friends who say Biden is the biggest spender ever and he's regulating and he's woke and how can anyone consider voting for him over Trump?' Boaz said.\n'And I'll say that one reason is that Biden has not tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power. That's a very fundamental issue. You can add up all these [other] issues and weigh them. But the big freedom issue that Biden has over Trump,' Boaaz added, 'is that Trump tried to steal an election.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ronald Brownstein,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bc56ff7a-5e96-468d-93c1-418068e7e891.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":2.382204,"_id":"29d5ef176fd69a8b984c85be46f5d200"},{"title":"Analysis: Why Biden and Democrats are talking so much about freedom","author":"Ronald Brownstein","published_date":"2024-04-17 04:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/abortion-democrats-freedom-messaging","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration:\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration: 'This fight is about freedom, and the freedom that is fundamental to the promise of America.'\nIn a new abortion-focused ad that the Biden campaign aired in Arizona last week, President Joe Biden somberly asks: 'If Donald Trump gets back in power, what freedom will you lose next?'\nFor Biden, Harris and other Democrats to lean so heavily on the word 'freedom' in this campaign is a historic reversal of roles.

He noted that such groups as Generation Z, Blacks and Latinos were much less likely than college-educated Whites or Republicans to express fears in the poll that they would lose rights in the decade ahead.\n'To whatever extent the Democrats are trying to make a rights argument, it's not as worrying to the youth and to minorities as it is to Whites, people with college degrees, and Boomers,' Wilson said. 'Biden's \u2018rights' argument might be a big hit with his peers, but might be the wrong note to strike if he wants to hold onto the parts of the Democratic coalition that are starting to look shaky.'\nBut the Penn State polling was conducted before the Dobbs decision ended the nationwide right to abortion. And many analysts believe that seismic shift has increased the relevance of questions revolving around rights and freedoms to key groups that Democrats rely on \u2013 with younger women especially focused on these threats. While Republicans traditionally responded more to these arguments, Deckman said, 'These times certainly have made freedom a more accessible, even an existential, issue for people on the left.'\nFernandez Ancona agrees to an extent with both Wilson and Deckman. The 2022 elections, she said, demonstrated how strongly many people react to the risk of losing rights they believed had been settled. 'When these things you take for granted are taken away in this very stark way, it's incredibly motivating,' she said. But she also believes that Democrats need to tie their case about defending personal freedom into a broader message that portrays the 2024 election less as a personal choice between Trump and Biden than as a fundamental crossroads over America's future priorities that will shape not only personal liberties but also economic opportunity.\n'We have to get people to shift their thinking about how this is a choice between two different futures,' she said. 'It can get people out of this one-to-one candidate-to- candidate [comparison] and asking, \u2018what I like, what I don't like' about Trump or Biden.'\nFor libertarians, the escalating struggle between Biden and Republicans over the idea of freedom is a source of both bemusement and frustration. Libertarians take a purist position that advocates for minimal government intervention in both personal behavior and the economy; they usually find Republicans deficient on the first count, and Democrats on the second.\nDavid Boaz, a distinguished senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, sees those flaws in both Biden and Trump. The Biden administration, Boaz said, is 'very big on reproductive freedom, and very big on a lot of aspects of LGBTQ freedom, but beyond those things, where's the freedom in the Biden-Harris plan?' And while Trump talks about promoting economic freedom by cutting taxes and regulation, Boaz continued, Republicans have also undermined such freedom by promoting high tariffs and using government policy to punish companies they disfavor, as DeSantis did with Disney in Florida.\nBut while Boaz believes both Biden and Trump have imperfect records when it comes to promoting freedom, he thinks one issue breaks the tie between them: Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election. \ufeff'I have friends who say Biden is the biggest spender ever and he's regulating and he's woke and how can anyone consider voting for him over Trump?' Boaz said.\n'And I'll say that one reason is that Biden has not tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power. That's a very fundamental issue. You can add up all these [other] issues and weigh them. But the big freedom issue that Biden has over Trump,' Boaaz added, 'is that Trump tried to steal an election.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Ronald Brownstein","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bc56ff7a-5e96-468d-93c1-418068e7e891.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":2.3753507,"_id":"81dbae72a82253d6374c4fc6129317ab"},{"title":"Narendra Modi: India's popular but controversial leader seeking a transformative third term","author":"Rhea Mogul","published_date":"2024-04-15 23:39:06","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/15/india/modi-profile-india-election-intl-hnk-dst","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reelection slogan makes a simple promise: 'good days are coming.' But opponents argue he has done little to soothe India's deep divisions.","summary":"Varanasi and New Delhi CNN \u2014\nVaranasi and New Delhi CNN \u2014 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi once famously made a simple election promise: 'good days are coming'.\nTo his adoring supporters, it's a vision of a future now finally within reach should Modi and his right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secure an emphatic and rare third consecutive term at this month's nationwide election.\nAt his rallies, tens of thousands gather in near frenzied religious devotion in support of a man whose policies they say have transformed the lives of ordinary Indians \u2013 and helped enshrine the nascent promise of social mobility in a country still riven by caste divisions.\nModi projects himself as an outsider from humble origins. Born as the son of a tea seller in a small town in Gujarat, he does not fit neatly within the often privately educated, resolutely metropolitan, English-speaking template set by many previous Indian leaders.\nThe 74-year-old is unmarried, has no children, and seemingly shuns expensive material possessions in favor of a simple, ascetic lifestyle.\nAnd though little is shared about Modi the man \u2013 his private life is assiduously guarded by a formidable public relations team \u2013 his persona resonates with many.\nHis political rise in some ways mirrors India's own path from a newly independent nation freed from the shackles of colonialism to a confident, secure country inching ever closer to superpower status \u2013 albeit one wracked by deep and abiding fault lines.\nModi, his opponents argue, has done little to soothe those divisions.\nReligious persecution and Islamophobia have increased sharply on his watch, with many accusing the prime minister of tacitly endorsing sectarianism as a means of further bolstering his Hindu-nationalist credentials, while diverting from policy failures \u2013 such as youth unemployment, which now stands at close to 50% among 20- to 24-year-olds.\nAmong India's minorities, particularly the country's 230 million Muslims, the prospect of another five-years for a prime minister who calls himself the 'chowkidar' \u2013 or watchman \u2013 remains deeply concerning.\nMany don't believe Modi is watching out for them \u2013 instead, they say they are marginalized as he fulfills his party's dream of transforming secular, pluralistic India into a majoritarian Hindu state.\n'As he goes toward seeking a third term, Prime Minister Modi has positioned himself as a head priest alongside the head of the political system \u2026 the protector of the nation (and), as the creator of a Hindu-first nation,' said Saba Naqvi, author of 'The Saffron Storm: From Vajpayee to Modi.'\nThis seemingly potent, populist mix of economic empowerment and Hindu nationalism has proved to be a successful electoral formula for Modi, confounding longstanding social and regional voting lines.\nAccording to 2023 Pew research, about eight-in-ten Indian adults have a favorable view of Modi, including 55% who have a very favorable view. Such levels of popularity for a two-term incumbent prime minister defy all modern conventions, both in India and throughout much of the democratic world.\nvery favorable view. Such levels of popularity for a two-term incumbent prime minister defy all modern conventions, both in India and throughout much of the democratic world. 'He's done something which has not happened before in Indian politics among all our prime ministers,' said Naqvi. 'He has willfully created a cult of his own personality.'\nAs the sun sets across the Ganges, Hindu devotees bathe in the holy river's waters and priests offer daily prayer by its banks. It's here, in the city of Varanasi \u2013 Modi's own constituency \u2013 that this so-called cult of personality is on full display.\nBillboards with the prime minister's face appear on the corners of roads, and saffron flags with his party's lotus symbol are hoisted on buildings across the dusty, meandering gulleys of the ancient city.\nOn the streets, his party's volunteers go door-to-door advocating for the leader.\nWhen Modi first ran for prime minister a decade ago, he did so on a promise of infrastructure, development and anti-corruption, choosing the city of gods as his constituency \u2013 its religious symbolism the perfect backdrop for his BJP's Hindu nationalist ambitions.\nIn one of Varanasi's oldest spice markets, shopkeepers say their lives have been transformed since.\n'Many people think he is God,' said father of two, Akash Jaiswal, pointing to Modi's welfare schemes and business incentives. 'We've never had a prime minister like Modi ever. He's done a great sacrifice for India, for us \u2026 We want him to be prime minister forever.'\nJaiswal even praised some of Modi's most controversial leadership moments. 'India had the least casualties during Covid,' he said, when in fact the country had the third highest number of pandemic-related deaths, after the United States and Brazil, according to the World Health Organization. Modi was highly criticized for his handling of the pandemic and accused of being underprepared, as hospitals reached their limit and morgues overflowed with bodies.\nThe city's BJP President, Dileep Patel, who has helped Modi with all three of his election campaigns, however, isn't surprised by his enduring levels of popularity. To him, Modi represents India's future.\n'Today India is strong, capable, and self-reliant under the prime minister's leadership,' he said.\nModi's official party biography tells the story of a poor boy, the third of six children, whose father was a 'chaiwallah' or tea seller, who'd serve customers at the local train station to support his young family\nPromoted by the BJP, analysts say this tale of humble beginnings makes him relatable to hundreds of millions across the country. And it stands in stark contrast to the generations of India's elite, urbane politicians that have historically risen to the top job.\n'He comes from a poor background and that helps him understands the people of India,' said Varanasi BJP president Patel.\nIndia's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was a member of the Indian National Congress, a political party that was pivotal in ending nearly 200 years of British colonial rule. His daughter, Indira Gandhi, also became prime minister, as did her son, Rajiv. All three studied overseas at Cambridge or Oxford.\nThe face of today's Congress Party, and Modi's primary opponent, is Rahul Gandhi, son of Rajiv, and an alumni of both Cambridge and Harvard.\nModi, by contrast, had a modest upbringing in the small town of Vadnagar, far from the political cut and thrust of the capital New Delhi, according to Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, author of 'Narendra Modi: The Man, The Times.'\nMukhopadhyay notes Modi was an average student at school and his marriage was arranged to a woman at 17.\nThough Mukhopadhyay claims the tale of Modi's poverty is 'grossly exaggerated,' his charisma \u2013 and confidence \u2013 was evident from an early age.\n'He liked acting in school plays,' said Mukhopadhyay. 'He always wanted to have the lead role. If the lead role was not given to him, he would not act in the play at all.'\nModi was still a child when he was exposed to the idea of Hindu nationalism through classes at the local branch of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing paramilitary organization that advocates for the establishment of Hindu hegemony within India.\nFounded in 1925 by Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, a campaigner who had split from Nehru's Congress party over what he believed to be 'undue pampering of the Muslims,' its central mission is to 'nourish the Hindu culture,' according to the group's website.\nAt 17, Modi abandoned his family and his wife, left his village and traversed India with the group in search of a spiritual awakening, according to his biography. He devoted himself to the RSS, never remarried and learned to 'leave all the pleasures in life,' according to an interview he gave in 2019.\nBy 1972, he had become a 'pracharak' for the RSS, according to his biography, someone appointed to spread their cause through meetings and public lectures.\nThe turning point for the young activist came in 1975, when then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi invoked what she called necessary 'shock treatment' to stamp out internal unrest. She imposed a state of emergency, tightening government control, rounding up critics, censoring her opposition and silencing the press.\nDetached from the demands of marriage, Modi then 25, saw an opportunity, according to his biography. He joined a movement to restore democracy to India, his profile states, marking the start of his journey to political high office.\nAnd in the absence of a family life, many of his supporters have claimed him as part of their own, adding to his everyman appeal. 'Modi is our family,' said the shopkeeper Jaiswal in Varanasi. 'We are all his family.'\nModi joined the BJP in 1987, when the fringe political party started gaining traction fueled by the rise of Hindu nationalism in India.\nConsidered to be the political arm of the RSS, the BJP gained prominence that decade when it advocated for the destruction of the Babri Masjid, a 16th-century mosque believed by Hindus to have been built on the site of the birthplace of the religion's revered Lord Ram.\nAnd it was thrust into the mainstream in 1992, when \u2013 spurred on by members of the BJP \u2013 Hindu hardliners attacked the mosque, ripping it apart with their hands, and setting off a wave of sectarian violence that reverberated through the nation.\nOne of the BJP's founders Lal Krishna Advani \u2013 widely believed to be the brains behind the mosque's destruction \u2013 saw a leader in Modi, giving him immense responsibilities within the party.\nNo politician 'brings the experience that Modi does,' Naqvi, the author, said last month from her home in New Delhi, referring to his various political roles.\nModi thrived under Advani's guidance, working his way through the ranks of the BJP. In 2001, he was appointed chief minister of the wealthy state of Gujarat.\nUnder Modi's governance, the state introduced a wave of infrastructure, industry, and innovation to its arid landscape \u2013 making the 'Gujarat model' synonymous with development and government efficiency.\nHis tenure was not without controversy.\nViolence erupted in Gujarat in 2002 when Hindus blamed Muslims for setting fire to a train in an incident that killed dozens of Hindu pilgrims and sought revenge by attacking Muslim-owned homes and stores.\nMore than 1,000 people \u2013 mostly Muslims \u2013 were killed, according to government figures. Critics accused Modi of being complicit in the violence, alleging that his administration failed to prevent or adequately respond to the unrest.\nModi faced international repercussions in its aftermath, with the United States banning him from entering the country for many years over concerns about human rights violations.\nHe vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and the Supreme Court cleared him of complicity. Months after the violence, he was re-elected with a roaring majority \u2013 the 'first evidence' of his cult following, said Naqvi, the author.\nBut the polarization of communities deeply divided the nation, leaving scars that persist to this day.\nPolitical scientist Christophe Jaffrelot suggested events in Gujarat made Hindu nationalists more confident. 'But Modi himself is so insecure, he cannot face any questions,' he said.\nModi infamously walked out of an interview in 2007, when journalist Karan Thapar pressed him on his role in the Gujarat riots. He rarely gives interviews, and has not held a solo press conference since becoming Prime Minister.\n'He cannot face debate,' Jaffrelot said.\nModi's 'Gujarat model' had become a blueprint for India and in 2014, the BJP won by a landslide, crushing the Congress \u2013 the party's worst defeat in more than 100 years of its existence.\nSince entering into office, Modi's administration has upgraded the country's aging transport network, building highways connecting small villages with major cities. His administration has built new power plants and maritime projects, and, according to recent remarks from Modi himself, subsidized the construction of some 40 million concrete homes for improvised families.\nThe administration also bolstered the country's military capabilities. And it's invested money in sports, science and high-end technology \u2013 letting India thrive on the world stage.\nBut for some observers, a troubling pattern has also emerged.\n'He was able to popularize Hindu nationalistic politics and their ideology,' said Mukhopadhyay, the writer and unofficial Modi biographer.\nModi appointed Hindu nationalists to top positions in government, giving them the power to make sweeping changes to legislation, instilling a sense of fear among the 230 million Muslims living in the country.\nIn 2019, he roared through polls yet again \u2013 this time on a more clearly defined ticket of Hindu supremacy.\nHe abrogated the special autonomy of Kashmir \u2013 India's only Muslim-majority state \u2013 bringing it under the direct control of New Delhi. His government implemented a controversial citizenship law considered by many to be discriminatory against Muslims.\nHe built the Ram Temple in Ayodhya on the site of the destroyed mosque, reviving painful memories of 1992's bloodshed for many Muslims, but brought a sense of pride for millions of Hindu devotees.\nAnd to his more vocal critics, Modi's economic policies are also open to question. Despite India now boasting an economy that is projected to grow 7.3% this fiscal year \u2013 the highest rate among major global economies \u2013 accusations persist that Modi has failed to create enough jobs, or adequately bridge the gap between the country's billionaire class and its most improvised.\n'He has made the poor, poorer. He has increased inequalities,' said Jaffrelot, in reference to the country's wealth gap, which according to a recent study is more unequal than it was during British rule.\nOn the diplomatic front, he's grown closer to the US, been wooed by Australia and courted by the United Kingdom.\nAt the same time, Modi has kept India's historically close relationship with Russia \u2014 snapping up huge amounts of Moscow's oil despite the Ukraine invasion \u2014 and he maintains relations with both Israel and other Middle Eastern countries at a time of increased polarization.\nAnd an overwhelming majority of Indians appear to put their weight behind his leadership. A recent Morning Context poll ranked Modi as the world's most popular global leader, with an approval rating of 76% at home.\n'He's the number one figure right now. He's the only candidate for prime minister,' Naqvi said.\nAt a Modi rally in the northern city of Ghaziabad earlier this month, thousands of supporters thronged the large grounds as he walked on stage. Some dressed as the Indian god Ram, others head to toe in saffron, the official color of his BJP, their triumphant cries reverberating through the air.\nIn the city of Meerut in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, a Modi supporter says she is voting for him because he is 'unlike any other politician in the world.'\n'I have put Modi's poster in my son's room,' Raniva, who is 36 and goes by one name, said. 'The way (he) is doing so much for the country, I hope my son also does good work for the country.'\nOn the streets of the capital New Delhi, opinion is more divided. 'Nowadays there is so much fighting between Hindus and Muslims. We all know why,' said one rickshaw driver sitting outside the city's famed Jama Mosque.\nWith Modi widely expected to comfortably win the upcoming election, some analysts say they have genuine fears about the future of the country's democracy.\n'I definitely see a decline in the quality of democracy in the country,' said Mukhopadhyay. 'I see greater insecurity and marginalization of Muslims in India. That's not a very rosy picture. But it's the likely path India is going to take.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Rhea Mogul,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20240409-cult-of-modi-gfx-final.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":2.229555,"_id":"c9a571d91330a80d8e74d540011d680c"}],"user_input":{"q":"education","search_in":["title_summary_en"],"lang":["en"],"not_lang":null,"countries":null,"not_countries":null,"from":"2024-04-15 00:00:00","to":null,"ranked_only":"True","from_rank":null,"to_rank":null,"sort_by":"relevancy","page":1,"size":100,"sources":["cnn.com"],"not_sources":[],"topic":null,"published_date_precision":null}}
