John E. McLauchlen Jr. of Detroit were identified in January and will be buried this summer at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas.\nMcLauchlen, 25, was the pilot of a B-24J Liberator bomber during a Dec. 1, 1943, bombing mission from India targeting a railroad yard in Myanmar, then known as Burma. After reaching the target, McLauchlen's plane was reportedly hit by anti-aircraft fire, causing its left wing to catch fire.\nThe crippled plane was last seen with three enemy aircraft following it into the clouds and its crew members were later declared missing in action, the DPAA said.\nIn 1947, the remains of what were believed to be eight individuals involved in a potential B-24 Liberator crash were recovered in present-day Myanmar. They could not be identified and were interred as unknowns in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu.\nOne set of those remains was disinterred in October 2020 and sent for analysis by DPAA scientists.\nThose remains were identified as McLauchlen's through anthropological analysis, circumstantial and material evidence and DNA analysis, the DPAA said.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/22/7f27f206-ce09-487e-9db0-c222fad983c4/thumbnail/1200x630/dbfc7ff39cf2ef82db8f878f8e2a59de/john-e-mclauchlen-jr.png?v=57e8fa9efcf044a821348136ff26ed69","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSDetroit","_score":7.968017,"_id":"3a595cefc74beef89e00944275dcb848"},{"title":"NPR suspends Uri Berliner, editor who accused the network of liberal bias","author":"Aimee Picchi","published_date":"2024-04-17 12:18:38","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/npr-uri-berliner-editor-suspended-essay","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Uri Berliner, who has worked at NPR for 25 years, was suspended after he claimed the network pushed progressive viewpoints.","summary":"Misinformation spreads online as some in Congress fight what they see as censorship\nNational Public Radio has suspended Uri Berliner, a senior editor who earlier this month claimed in an essay that the network had \"lost America's trust\" by pushing progressive views in its coverage while suppressing dissenting opinions.\nBerliner's suspension was reported by NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik, who said that the senior editor was suspended for five days without pay starting on Friday. A formal rebuke from NPR said Berliner had violated its policy of securing prior approval to write for other news outlets, and warned that he would be fired if he breached those guidelines in future, Folkenflik reported.\nNPR declined to comment to CBS News. \"NPR does not comment on individual personnel matters, including discipline,\" a spokesperson said.\nBerliner's essay in the Free Press caused a firestorm of debate, with some conservatives, including former President Donald Trump, calling on the government to \"defund\" the organization. Some of Berliner's NPR colleagues also took issue with the essay, with \"Morning Edition\" host Steve Inskeep writing on his Substack that the article was \"filled with errors and omissions.\"\n\"The errors do make NPR look bad, because it's embarrassing that an NPR journalist would make so many,\" Inskeep wrote.\nIn the essay, Berliner wrote that NPR has always had a liberal bent, but that for most of his 25 year tenure it had retained an open-minded, curious culture. \"In recent years, however, that has changed,\" he wrote. \"Today, those who listen to NPR or read its coverage online find something different: the distilled worldview of a very small segment of the U.S. population.\"\nBerliner added, \"[W]hat's notable is the extent to which people at every level of NPR have comfortably coalesced around the progressive worldview. The \"absence of viewpoint diversity\" is \"is the most damaging development at NPR,\" he wrote.\nAfter the essay's publication, NPR's top editor, Edith Chapin, said she strongly disagrees with Berliner's conclusions and is proud to stand behind NPR's work.\nCOVID coverage, DEI initiatives\nBerliner criticized coverage of major events at NPR, singling out its reporting on COVID and Hunter Biden as problematic. With the first topic, he wrote that the network didn't cover a theory that COVID-19 had been created in a Chinese lab, a theory he claimed NPR staffers \"dismissed as racist or a right-wing conspiracy.\"\nHe also took NPR for task for what he said was failing to report developments related to Hunter Biden's laptop. \"With the election only weeks away, NPR turned a blind eye,\" Berliner wrote.\nBerliner also criticized NPR for its internal management, citing what he claims is a growing focus on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI.\n\"Race and identity became paramount in nearly every aspect of the workplace,\" Berliner wrote. \"A growing DEI staff offered regular meetings imploring us to 'start talking about race'.\"\nInskeep said Berliner's essay left out the context that many other news organizations didn't report on Hunter Biden's laptop over questions about its authenticity. He also disputed Berliner's characterization that NPR editors and reporters don't debate story ideas.\n\"The story is written in a way that is probably satisfying to the people who already believe it, and unpersuasive to anyone else \u2014 a mirror image of his critique of NPR,\" Inskeep wrote.\n\u2014With reporting by the Associated Press.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Where She Covers Business,Consumer Reports.,Alain Sherter,Has Written,Aimee Picchi","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/05/01/c9f34cd8-88d1-44c8-81c1-43737e5a6ac8/thumbnail/1200x630/6c6e87fa12dbb31fa0d4a98d8afc3be0/npr-sign-1920.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@@aimeepicchi","_score":6.8026357,"_id":"acc66b674dbcc55c62ac8f28a7a5b6d0"},{"title":"MIT, Emerson College students start pro-Palestinian camps inspired by Columbia University protests","author":"Jordyn Jagolinzer","published_date":"2024-04-22 10:55:02","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/mit-emerson-college-students-pro-palestinian-camps-columbia-university-protests-israel-gaza-war","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Inspired by protests at Columbia University, pro-Palestinians camps have been set up at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Emerson College.","summary":"Pro-Palestinian camps set up by students at MIT and Emerson College\nPro-Palestinian camps set up by students at MIT and Emerson College\nPro-Palestinian camps set up by students at MIT and Emerson College\nBOSTON - Inspired by protests at Columbia University, pro-Palestinians camps have been set up at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Emerson College.\nDozens of students put up tents at the campuses in Cambridge and Boston Sunday night to protest the Israel-Hamas war.\nA pro-Palestinian camp set up at MIT on Monday, April 22, 2024.\nCBS Boston\nColumbia University protests\nMore than 100 people have been arrested at Columbia since protests started there last Wednesday.

The event at the Palm Beach, Florida, estate that she shares with the former president is scheduled to take place behind closed doors.

Her attendance at the fundraiser \u2014 for a group she has previously supported \u2014 could be a sign that she will ramp up her schedule with several months left before the November election.\nBoth Trumps went together to cast their ballots in the Florida primary last month.

During his presidency, he nominated judges for the U.S. Supreme Court, including Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, who were criticized by liberal advocates for LGBTQ+ people.\nTrump also faced national criticism in 2017 when he announced transgender people were barred from military service, when about 15,000 transgender people were enlisted at the time. In 2019, he barred U.S. embassies from displaying the rainbow or pride flag during Pride Month.\nThroughout his campaign, Trump has repeatedly mocked transgender people using language of gender identity that LGBTQ+ critics call harmful. He has acted out a young athlete struggling to lift heavy barbells compared with other competitors \"who transitioned.\"\nIn campaign speeches he has touted his promise to cut federal funding on schools pushing what he calls \"transgender insanity.\"\nSome additional promises Trump has made in his rallies include prohibiting federal money going to hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to minors, or ending any program that promotes sex or gender transition. He has also promised that he'd push Congress to ban chemical or surgical interventions on minors.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/07/28469bef-4ff1-482d-98f7-f06dc84a1287/thumbnail/1200x630/650c7134dd7eced043b5539fab8ea6e5/ap-20342573995693.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSMiami","_score":5.251404,"_id":"2af8d4be67f60e5299f10f49d8ac6dca"},{"title":"Supreme Court agrees to hear dispute over Biden administration's \"ghost guns\" rule","author":"Melissa Quinn","published_date":"2024-04-22 13:54:15","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ghost-guns-supreme-court-biden-administration","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"The Supreme Court will consider a court fight over a rule from the Biden administration that imposed requirements on the manufacturers and sellers of ghost guns.","summary":"Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to review a lower court decision that invalidated a rule from the Biden administration that aimed to address the proliferation of crimes involving \"ghost guns.\"\nThe regulation at issue was implemented by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in April 2022 and imposed a series of requirements on manufacturers and sellers of so-called ghost guns, which are unserialized firearms that can be assembled from kits sold online.\nATF's rule changed the definition of \"firearm\" under the Gun Control Act to include certain weapon parts kits, and clarified that it includes partially completed parts such as the frame or receiver. As a result of the regulation, covered manufacturers and sellers have to obtain licenses, mark their products with serial numbers, run background checks and keep purchase records, which are all required for firearms made and sold in the U.S.\nThe rule applies to all ghost guns, including those made with 3D printers or sold as assembly kits.\nA group of gun owners, advocacy groups and ghost gun distributors filed a lawsuit against ATF in August 2022, arguing that the two portions of its rule, regarding the term \"frame or receiver\" and definition of \"firearm,\" exceeded its authority. A federal district court in Texas sided with the challengers, finding that the Gun Control Act doesn't \"cover weapon parts, or aggregations of weapon parts,\" regardless of whether they can be assembled into \"something that may fire a projectile.\"\nThe district court invalidated the entire regulation, including those that were not at issue in the lawsuit.\nThe Biden administration appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit halted the lower court's order as to the unchallenged portions of the rule. The Supreme Court then paused the full decision in a 5-4 ruling, allowing ATF to enforce the restrictions while legal proceedings continued. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the three liberal justices in the majority.\nThe 5th Circuit later ruled that the Gun Control Act's definition of \"firearm\" doesn't encompass weapon parts kits, and invalidated the provision of the rule involving the term \"frame or receiver.\"\nThe Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to review the appeals court's decision in February, arguing that it contradicts the plain text of the Gun Control Act.\n\"Under the Fifth Circuit's interpretation, anyone could buy a kit online and assemble a fully functional gun in minutes \u2014 no background check, records, or serial number required,\" it told the Supreme Court. \"The result would be a flood of untraceable ghost guns into our nation's communities, endangering the public and thwarting law-enforcement efforts to solve violent crimes.\"\nThe Biden administration told the court that weapon parts kits can be converted into a fully functional firearm in just 21 minutes, and ghost guns allow felons, minors and others barred from buying firearms to circumvent the law.\nIf left in place, the 5th Circuit's ruling would give the manufacturers and distributors of weapons parts the \"green light to resume unfettered distribution\" without background checks, records, or serial numbers, posing an \"acute threat\" to public safety, the Biden administration said.\nIt noted that since 2017, there has been a 1,000% increase in the number of ghost guns recovered by law enforcement each year.\nThe challengers to ATF's rule also urged the Supreme Court to decide its validity \"once and for all.\" They told the high court in a filing that the provisions of the rule are \"fundamentally incompatible\" with the Gun Control Act's definition of firearm.\n\"This expanded definition upsets the delicate balance struck by Congress between the commercial production and sale of firearms and the non-commercial making of firearms by law-abiding citizens,\" the group said.\nThey accused the Biden administration of seeking to destroy the industry that caters to law-abiding citizens making their own guns and said that if the definition of \"firearm\" is now considered unsatisfactory, it's an issue for Congress to address.\n\"ATF is not free to expand the scope of the GCA without Congress's blessing,\" the challengers argued.\nThe case will be argued in the Supreme Court's next term, which begins in October.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Melissa Quinn,Daily Signal,Federal Courts.","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/03/12/9158231c-ed3f-442b-a1ef-5eed634f7458/thumbnail/1200x630g8/8a574848e718d408b41acc3bb2c5fb23/ap24072559614498.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@@MelissaQuinn97","_score":5.0837526,"_id":"3afc83a7362effd8624933bdd82d3864"},{"title":"Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says U.S. aid is crucial for global security","author":"Brad Edwards","published_date":"2024-04-18 04:05:32","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/ukrainian-prime-minister-denys-shmyhal-cbs-2-chicago","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"During his quick stop in Chicago, Shmyhal also made time for one interview \u2013 with CBS 2.","summary":"CHICAGO (CBS) -- Two years into the war between Ukraine and Russia, funding Ukraine's fight has become a fight of its own in a divided Congress.\nCHICAGO (CBS) -- Two years into the war between Ukraine and Russia, funding Ukraine's fight has become a fight of its own in a divided Congress.\nThis week, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal visited Chicago \u2013 home to a large Ukrainian population and many refugees.

Three years into his presidency, what do those who care about the issue most think about what he's done? How much do they know?\nFew Americans say they've heard a lot about what the administration has done on climate change. That extends to those in the president's own party and to those who rate the issue of climate change as very important. Half of them have heard little or nothing at all about what the administration has done.\nAnd perhaps as a result, those who prioritize climate change are feeling somewhat unsatisfied \u2014 more of them feel the president has done too little, rather than the right amount on trying to reduce it.\nBut they do like the Biden administration's policies when they hear about them.\nClimate change: An issue important to Biden's base\nClimate change is not the most important issue for Americans overall; it trails economic issues and matters like crime and immigration. But most Democrats, liberals, those who voted for Mr. Biden in 2020 and many younger people place a lot of importance on the issue. These groups will be crucial to Mr. Biden in November.\nJust 10% of Americans who say climate change is a very important issue have heard or read a lot about what the Biden administration has done so far to deal with it. And when evaluating the Biden administration, many think it has done too little to address it.\nWhen presented with some of the Biden administration's climate change policies, a majority of those who place a lot of importance on climate change \u2014 from enhanced regulations, to reducing toxic chemicals in drinking water, to tax rebates for buying an electric vehicle \u2014 favored the policies.\nEven people who feel the administration has done too little on climate change support these policies. So this may be more about Mr. Biden needing to get his message out there than having to convince this \"climate constituency\" \u2014 those who call the climate issue very important \u2014 of the substance of his policies.\nWhat is the \"climate constituency\" looking for?\nNine in 10 of those who call the climate issue very important support the country taking steps to stop or slow the rate of climate change, and if they had to choose, they overwhelmingly would prioritize protecting the earth's climate over energy production.\nAnd most agree with the administration and Democratic leaders that efforts to reduce climate change would help the economy, not hurt it, putting them at odds with those who place little or no importance on the issue.\n2024 presidential candidates and climate change\nWhile this \"climate constituency\" would like to see Mr. Biden do more, they do prefer his approach to climate change and energy policy to former President Donald Trump's. It's the public at large that is not convinced, and that adds up to Mr. Biden running about even with Trump among people who are asked whose approach to the issue they agree with more. More than a quarter pick neither.\nAmericans who think the issue of climate change is very important and those who want an energy policy that moves away from fossil fuels in favor of renewable energy sources prefer Mr. Biden's approach on both climate and energy, while those who place little importance on climate change and who want to encourage greater production of fossil fuels favor Trump's approach.\nThis cuts heavily to partisanship as well, though independents \u2014 who think efforts to fight climate change will hurt rather than help their finances \u2014 lean more towards Trump's approach than Mr. Biden's.\nLooking ahead, there's skepticism that either candidate can do much about climate change if elected in November.\nOn balance, more think Mr. Biden will slow the rate of climate change and more think Trump will increase it, while half don't think it will make any difference, regardless of who wins in 2024.\nAmericans with a more fatalistic view on climate change \u2014 who think humanity can't do anything about climate change or who think it doesn't exist in the first place \u2014 are the most likely to say the election will make no difference.\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,230 U.S. adult residents interviewed between April 16-19, 2024.

Brad Little, a Republican, signed a bill into law last year that prohibits gender-affirming medical treatments for transgender minors.","summary":"Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to allow Idaho officials enforce a ban on gender-affirming medical care for nearly all transgender minors statewide, granting a request from state officials to narrow the scope of a lower court's order that blocked the law from taking effect.\nThe court's conservative majority granted the state's request for a stay over the objections of the three liberals, Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. The stay does not apply to the two transgender teenage plaintiffs in the case and the care they are seeking, but blocks the more expansive portions of the lower court's decision.\n\"The district court's order promised to run for the life of this lawsuit, thus preventing Idaho from executing any aspect of its law for years. Meanwhile, the plaintiffs face no harm from the partial stay the State requests,\" Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in an opinion that was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.\nThe Idaho case\nThe legal battle involves Idaho's Vulnerable Child Protection Act, or H.B. 71, which was signed into law by GOP Gov. Brad Little last year. The measure bars health care providers in the state from providing certain medications or surgeries \"for the purpose of attempting to alter the appearance of or affirm the child's perception of the child's sex if that perception is inconsistent with the child's biological sex.\" Among the restricted treatments are puberty blocking-drugs, hormone therapy and surgeries. Violators of the law may face up to 10 years in prison and fines.\nParents to two transgender girls sued the state over the law, arguing it violates the Constitution. The two, identified in court filings by the pseudonyms Pam Poe and Jane Doe, were diagnosed with gender dysphoria and have taken puberty blockers and estrogen therapy. In addition to challenging the constitutionality of the law, the families asked a federal district court to block enforcement of the law while their case proceeds.\nThe district court granted their request in December 2023, finding in part that the law is likely unconstitutional. The lower court also ruled that prohibiting gender-affirming care would have \"serious consequences\" for Pam Poe and Jane Doe, including \"severe psychological distress.\"\n\"Transgender children should receive equal treatment under the law,\" U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill wrote in his decision. \"Parents should have the right to make the most fundamental decisions about how to care for their children.\"\nThe injunction reached statewide, in part because Winmill found that because Pam Poe and Jane Doe used pseudonyms, it would be difficult to provide them relief without compromising their anonymity. The judge also said that if the injunction applied only to the plaintiffs, there would likely be follow-on lawsuits, which would \"create needless and repetitive litigation.\"\nState officials asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit to pause the district court's order or narrow its scope to cover just Pam Poe and Jane Doe, but the request was denied. Idaho then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court while the 9th Circuit considers the appeal, asking the justices to limit the injunction to apply only to Pam Poe and Jane Doe. The high court agreed in its order on Monday.\nIn their request to the justices, Idaho officials, represented by the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, criticized the scope of the district court's injunction as \"exorbitant\" and said it reached too far by blocking enforcement of the law \"in all circumstances against all parties.\"\nRelief specific to the teenagers involved in the case was \"easy to conceive,\" they said, as an injunction could prohibit enforcement against those who provided Pam Poe and Jane Doe with the treatments they've sought.\n\"Plaintiffs only seek estrogen hormone therapies, yet the district court issued a universal injunction against the law in its entirety, stopping enforcement even in situations where Plaintiffs' experts agree medical intervention is not appropriate,\" Idaho officials wrote. \"Those applications involve the most extreme surgical treatments and the most vulnerable minors, who will lose the protections of Idaho's law and will instead be governed by an injunction obtained by others who do not and cannot speak for them.\"\nThey went on to claim that the \"overbroad\" injunction would allow doctors to experiment on minors with \"dangerous\" surgeries, such as mastectomies for patients with gender dysphoria.\nBut the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the family, warned the Supreme Court that allowing the state to enforce the law would cause severe harm to Pam Poe and Jane Doe.\nGranting the request from Idaho officials would jeopardize \"their ability to continue receiving the medical care that they, their parents, and their doctors all agree is medically necessary for their health and well-being\" and require them to \"give up their anonymity as transgender plaintiffs in this case to try to access that care,\" ACLU lawyers wrote in a filing.\nThey also noted that because the law imposes criminal penalties on doctors and pharmacists who provide gender-affirming care to minors, harm to Pam Poe and Jane Doe cannot be remedied without an injunction shielding health care providers from prosecution so they can continue treating them.\nAdditionally, because Pam Poe and Jane Doe are receiving ongoing medicare care, Idaho's ban would disrupt that treatment, and a narrowed injunction would jeopardize their access to care.\n\"The preliminary injunction maintains the status quo \u2014 that the decision about whether to pursue gender-affirming medical care for adolescents with gender dysphoria is made by their parents, in consultation with the children's doctor,\" the ACLU lawyers wrote. \"With the advice of their doctors, parents weigh the risks and benefits of treatment just as they do for other medical decisions.\"\nMore than 20 states have imposed bans on gender-affirming medical care for minors, though laws in some states have been blocked by courts, according to the Human Rights Campaign.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Melissa Quinn,Daily Signal,Federal Courts.","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/03/05/acdbb20c-bfba-4351-a49d-be5cbf2f1a12/thumbnail/1200x630g2/75de69c575b56d1d46b00ed1240bb6ae/gettyimages-2049056964.jpg?v=6450b1292090ace5f47bbb23ced2a4e3","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSPolitics","_score":4.375625,"_id":"f1e8f4d1a08c1c0db9baeb659bfb34d8"},{"title":"Listen Live: In major homelessness case, Supreme Court weighs constitutionality of anti-camping ordinances today","author":"Melissa Quinn","published_date":"2024-04-22 12:00:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/supreme-court-constitutionality-anti-camping-ordinances-grants-pass-oregon","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"The Supreme Court is weighing whether efforts to address homelessness in Grants Pass, Oregon, violated the Constitution's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.","summary":"Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is hearing arguments Monday in a dispute over whether laws that ban public camping violate the Constitution's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\nThe case is the most significant involving homelessness to come before the nation's highest court in decades, and its outcome could impact how cities and states respond to high rates of homelessness that have given rise to encampments on public property.\nThe dispute involves the constitutionality of laws that punish homeless people with civil citations for camping on public property. Arguments come as the nation confronts a spike in homelessness driven in part by high housing costs, and a ruling is likely to reach beyond the borders of the Oregon city at the center of the dispute.\nThere were an estimated 256,000 unsheltered people in the U.S. on a given night in 2023, according to a December report from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Homelessness rose 12% from 2022 to 2023, its highest level since tracking began in 2007, the report found, as housing prices soared and pandemic-era assistance programs expired.\nAt the center of the case is Grants Pass, a city of roughly 40,000 in southern Oregon with ordinances that bar camping or sleeping on public property or in city parks. The city's rules define \"campsite\" as \"any place where bedding, sleeping bag, or other material used for bedding purposes, or any stove or fire is placed.\"\nViolators face fines of at least $295, but repeat offenders may be banned from a city park for 30 days. If a person violates that order by camping in a park, they are committing criminal trespass, punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $1,250 fine.\nThe city said in court papers that it enforced the ordinances \"with moderation,\" issuing more than 500 citations from 2013 to 2018. A policy from the Grants Pass Department of Public Safety states \"homelessness is not a crime,\" and the department does \"not use homelessness solely as a basis for detention or law enforcement action.\"\nBut the three liberal justices, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, were quick to pepper a lawyer arguing on behalf of the city about how the ordinances did not criminalize homelessness.\n\"For a person who has no place to go, sleeping in public is kind of like breathing in public,\" Justice Elena Kagan said.\nShe acknowledged that the issue of homelessness is a \"super hard policy problem\" for all municipalities, but said the rules in Grants Pass sweep broadly.\n\"Your statute says that a person cannot take himself and himself only and take a blanket and sleep some place without it being a crime,\" Kagan said. \"It just seems like you're criminalizing a status.\"\nJackson said it seems \"both cruel and unusual to punish people for acts that constitute basic human needs.\"\n\"We're talking about sleeping,\" she said. \"That is universal, that is a basic function.\"\nThe challenge to the Grants Pass ordinances\nIn 2018, three homeless people in Grants Pass sued the city on behalf of its homeless population, alleging its public sleeping and camping ordinances unconstitutionally punished them by violating the Eighth Amendment's protections against cruel and unusual punishment.\nA federal district court in Oregon ruled for the challengers and barred Grants Pass from enforcing the public-camping ordinances during daytime hours without 24-hour notice, and at night entirely against the roughly 600 homeless people in the city. A divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld the district court's ruling as to the public-camping rules.\n\"The City of Grants Pass cannot, consistent with the Eighth Amendment, enforce its anti-camping ordinances against homeless persons for the mere act of sleeping outside with rudimentary protection from the elements, or for sleeping in their car at night, when there is no other place in the city for them to go,\" Judge Roslyn Silver, who was on the 9th Circuit panel, wrote for the majority.\nThe full 9th Circuit declined to rehear the case over the dissent of 13 active judges and four senior judges.\nGrants Pass officials appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court, arguing that \"modest\" fines and short jail terms for camping on public property are not cruel and unusual punishments under the Eighth Amendment.\nThey said that allowing it to stand prevents governments from \"proactively addressing the serious social problems associated with the homelessness crisis,\" and threatens many other criminal prohibitions.\n\"The homelessness crisis is a significant challenge for communities large and small throughout the nation. But '[n]ot every challenge we face is constitutional in character,'\" lawyers for the city wrote in a filing. \"And the solution is not to stretch the Eighth Amendment beyond its limits and place the federal courts in charge of this pressing social problem.\"\nBut Ed Johnson, director of litigation at the Oregon Law Center, who brought the suit on behalf of the homeless people in Grants Pass, said the word \"camping\" in the city's ordinances is misleading.\n\"The city has simply described the condition of living outside while trying not to die of hypothermia, and called it camping,\" he said in a call with reporters, noting that Grants Pass has no homeless shelters and a \"severe\" shortage of affordable housing.\nHe said the Eighth Amendment does not allow governments to fine, arrest and incarcerate those with no place else to go.\n\"Our case has always been about this narrow and fundamental issue that's currently before the Supreme Court,\" Johnson said. \"Can a city make it illegal on every inch of city land, every minute of the day, for people to live outside when they have nowhere else to go? We believe the answer is no.\"\nIn court filings, Johnson and his co-counsel accused the city of punishing homeless people for sleeping or resting \"anywhere on public property at any time with so much as a blanket to survive the cold\" and said the laws make it \"physically impossible for a homeless person who does not have access to shelter\" to stay in Grants Pass without facing fines and jail time.\nEfforts to address a homelessness crisis\nThe dispute has attracted input from a range of advocacy and law enforcement organizations, cities, states, members of Congress and the Biden administration.\nThe Justice Department said in a filing that the 9th Circuit was right to find that the Eighth Amendment prohibits a local government from effectively criminalizing homelessness by prohibiting individuals who lack access to shelter from residing in that area. But it said applying that principle to a particular person requires a look at their circumstances, and the lower court was wrong to issue the broad injunctive relief that it did.\nThose broad injunctions issued by U.S. district courts \"may limit cities' ability to respond appropriately and humanely to encampments and other legitimate public health and safety concerns,\" Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who represents the government before the Supreme Court, said.\nShe urged the Supreme Court to wipe away the 9th Circuit's decision and send the case back for further proceedings.\nSeveral major cities have asked the justices to allow them to address public health and safety concerns that arise from homeless encampments.\nThe city of Phoenix and the League of Arizona Cities and Towns said municipalities must have the authority to \"arrest, cite, or forcibly remove individuals camping on public property when their actions jeopardize public safety.\" In San Francisco, which is facing a homelessness crisis, city leaders told the Supreme Court that the 9th Circuit's decision has prevented it from enforcing six state and local laws that place limits on where and when homeless people can sleep and erect tents on public property.\n\"The city has been unable to implement the considered policy decisions of its Mayor and local legislature; unable to enforce the will of San Francisco voters; unable to allow conscientious City employees to do their jobs; and unable to protect its public spaces,\" lawyers for the city said in their brief, filed in support of neither party.\nThe lower court decisions have \"harmed both San Francisco's housed and unhoused populations by causing obstructed and inaccessible sidewalks, unsafe encampments, and fewer unhoused people to accept services,\" they continued.\nA decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Daily Signal,Melissa Quinn,Federal Courts.","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/22/13fc889b-fbdd-4542-a4fd-7f2ab08324ca/thumbnail/1200x630g8/7550f90f9e6a829322afb1944b2f8f2b/gettyimages-2147863353.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSNewsColorado","_score":3.8729086,"_id":"0238b38251daeccff604a28a94a01847"},{"title":"In major homelessness case, Supreme Court grapples with constitutionality of anti-camping ordinances","author":"Melissa Quinn","published_date":"2024-04-22 12:00:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/supreme-court-constitutionality-anti-camping-ordinances-grants-pass-oregon","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"The Supreme Court considered whether efforts to address homelessness in Grants Pass, Oregon, violated the Constitution's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.","summary":"U.S. Supreme Court to hear case on constitutionality of anti-camping ordinances targeting homeless p\nU.S. Supreme Court to hear case on constitutionality of anti-camping ordinances targeting homeless p\nU.S. Supreme Court to hear case on constitutionality of anti-camping ordinances targeting homeless p\n04:15\nWashington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday wrestled with the constitutionality of local laws that ban public camping in a dispute over whether an Oregon city's rules aimed at addressing homelessness violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\nThe case is the most significant involving homelessness to come before the nation's highest court in decades, and its outcome could impact how cities and states respond to high rates of homelessness that have given rise to encampments on public property.\nThe dispute involves the constitutionality of laws that punish homeless people with civil citations for camping on public property when they have nowhere else to go.

If a person violates that order by camping in a park, they are committing criminal trespass, punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $1,250 fine.\nDuring more than two hours of arguments, the justices appeared divided over whether Grants Pass went too far with its rules, and they struggled with where to draw the line for what a city can do to address homelessness before it becomes a constitutional violation.\n\"How do we draw these difficult lines\" of whether the Eighth Amendment would prohibit a municipality from punishing other acts like public urination if there are no facilities available or trespassing, asked Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\nSome of the justices also seemed concerned with the notion that federal judges would be considering city policies designed to address homelessness, instead of local officials.\n\"Judges across the country are now going to superintend this under the Eighth Amendment,\" said Justice Neil Gorsuch.\nIt was a concern echoed by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Elena Kagan.\n\"Many people have mentioned this is a serious policy problem, and it's a policy problem because the solution of course is to build shelter, to provide shelter for those who are otherwise harmless,\" Roberts said. \"But municipalities have competing priorities. What if there are lead pipes in the water? Do you build the homeless shelter or do you take care of the lead pipes? What if there isn't enough fire protection? Which one do you prioritize? Why would you think that these nine people are the best people to judge and weigh those policy judgments?\"\nKagan asked Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler, who argued on behalf of the Biden administration, \"Where is the line where the city can say our legitimate municipal interests can come in and say as to that, as to that, you can't do that?\"\n\"How does the court make these judgments?\" she said. \"These are tough judgments and usually they're the kind of judgments that we think of as municipal officials make them.\"\nStill, Kagan and the two other liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, sharply probed a lawyer arguing on behalf of Grants Pass about how the ordinances did not criminalize homelessness.\n\"For a person who has no place to go, sleeping in public is kind of like breathing in public,\" Kagan said.\nShe acknowledged that the issue of homelessness is a \"super hard policy problem\" for all municipalities, but said the rules in Grants Pass sweep too broadly.\n\"Your statute says that a person cannot take himself and himself only and take a blanket and sleep some place without it being a crime,\" Kagan said. \"It just seems like you're criminalizing a status.\"\nSotomayor asked where homeless people would go \"if every city every village, every town lacks compassion and passes a law identical to this? Where are they supposed to sleep?\"\nJackson said it seems \"both cruel and unusual to punish people for acts that constitute basic human needs.\"\n\"We're talking about sleeping,\" she said. \"That is universal, that is a basic function.\"\nThe challenge to the Grants Pass ordinances\nThe case before the Supreme Court dates back to 2018, when three homeless people in Grants Pass sued the city on behalf of its homeless population, alleging its public sleeping and camping ordinances unconstitutionally punished them by violating the Eighth Amendment's protections against cruel and unusual punishment.\nThe city said in court papers that it enforced the ordinances \"with moderation,\" issuing more than 500 citations from 2013 to 2018. A policy from the Grants Pass Department of Public Safety states \"homelessness is not a crime,\" and the department does \"not use homelessness solely as a basis for detention or law enforcement action.\"\nA federal district court in Oregon ruled for the challengers and barred Grants Pass from enforcing the public-camping ordinances during daytime hours without 24-hour notice, and at night entirely against the roughly 600 homeless people in the city. A divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld the district court's ruling as to the public-camping rules.\n\"The City of Grants Pass cannot, consistent with the Eighth Amendment, enforce its anti-camping ordinances against homeless persons for the mere act of sleeping outside with rudimentary protection from the elements, or for sleeping in their car at night, when there is no other place in the city for them to go,\" Judge Roslyn Silver, who was on the 9th Circuit panel, wrote for the majority.\nThe full 9th Circuit declined to rehear the case over the dissent of 13 active judges and four senior judges.\nWith Fruitdale Elementary School in the background, a Grants Pass police officer walks to check on a homeless person after relatives asked for a welfare check at Fruitdale Park on Saturday, March 23, 2024, in Grants Pass, Ore.\nJenny Kane / AP\nGrants Pass officials appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court, arguing in a filing that \"modest\" fines and short jail terms for camping on public property are not cruel and unusual punishments under the Eighth Amendment.\nTheane Evangelis, the lawyer representing the city, told the justices during arguments that the 9th Circuit's decision tied the city's hands by \"constitutionalizing the policy debate\" over how to address growing encampments, which she said present harms to the public.\nIf the challengers prevail, Evangelis said Grants Pass \"will be forced to surrender its public spaces.\"\n\"When the 9th Circuit constitutionalized this area, it left cities with really no choice: either keep building enough shelter that may or may not be adequate or suitable to someone's preferences or be force to give up all of your public spaces. That is what's happened,\" she said.\nBut Kelsi Corkran, who argued on behalf of the challengers, said the ordinances \"by design make it physically impossible for homeless people to live in Grants Pass without facing endless fines and jail time.\"\nShe said the city's rules punish people based on their status, which is considered cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment.\n\"All the ordinances do is turn the city's homelessness problem into someone else's problem by forcing its homeless residents into other jurisdictions,\" Corkran said, adding that the 9th Circuit's order still leaves the city with tools to address homelessness, such as imposing time, place and manner restrictions on when and where homeless people sleep.\nIn court filings, lawyers representing the homeless population in Grants Pass accused the city of punishing them for sleeping or resting \"anywhere on public property at any time with so much as a blanket to survive the cold\" and said the laws make it \"physically impossible for a homeless person who does not have access to shelter\" to stay in Grants Pass without facing fines and jail time.\nThe Supreme Court's arguments\nDuring the oral arguments, Kavanaugh and some of the conservative justices suggested that homeless people facing citations could raise a \"necessity defense\" under state law as a justification for violations.\nStill, Kavanaugh raised concerns that in Grants Pass, there are more homeless people than there are available shelter beds and questioned whether there should be a different constitutional rule in that circumstance.\n\"The law here, how does it help if there's not enough beds for the number of homeless people in the jurisdiction,\" he asked.\nKavanaugh also told Evangelis that imposing criminal penalties on a homeless person for sleeping in a public space does not necessarily ensure their circumstances will be improved.\n\"When you get out of jail, what's going to happen then? You still don't have a bed available so how does this help?\" he asked. \"If you run through that cycle and end up in jail for 30 days, then you get out, you're not going to be better off than you were before in finding a bed ... if there aren't beds available in the jurisdiction.\"\nBarrett, meanwhile, asked Kneedler how the federal government addresses homeless encampments, such as a 70-person encampment in a Washington, D.C., park that was cleared last year.\nKneedler, representing the Biden administration, said that instance was the \"gold standard\" of how to address homeless encampments and said there was extensive cooperation between the National Park Service and District of Columbia. Still, he expressed concerns about what could follow if Grants Pass is allowed to enforce its ordinances.\n\"If Grants Pass can do this, so could every other city, so could a state do it statewide and eventually a homeless person would have no place to be,\" Kneedler said.\nEfforts to address a homelessness crisis\nIn addition to the Biden administration, the dispute attracted input from a range of advocacy and law enforcement organizations, cities, states and members of Congress.\nThe Justice Department said in a filing that the 9th Circuit was right to find that the Eighth Amendment prohibits a local government from effectively criminalizing homelessness by prohibiting individuals who lack access to shelter from residing in that area. But it said applying that principle to a particular person requires a look at their circumstances, and the lower court was wrong to issue the broad injunctive relief that it did.\nThose broad injunctions issued by U.S. district courts \"may limit cities' ability to respond appropriately and humanely to encampments and other legitimate public health and safety concerns,\" the Biden administration said.\nSeveral major cities have asked the justices to allow them to address public health and safety concerns that arise from homeless encampments.\nThe city of Phoenix and the League of Arizona Cities and Towns said municipalities must have the authority to \"arrest, cite, or forcibly remove individuals camping on public property when their actions jeopardize public safety.\" In San Francisco, which is facing a homelessness crisis, city leaders told the Supreme Court that the 9th Circuit's decision has prevented it from enforcing six state and local laws that place limits on where and when homeless people can sleep and erect tents on public property.\n\"The city has been unable to implement the considered policy decisions of its Mayor and local legislature; unable to enforce the will of San Francisco voters; unable to allow conscientious City employees to do their jobs; and unable to protect its public spaces,\" lawyers for the city said in their brief, filed in support of neither party.\nThe lower court decisions have \"harmed both San Francisco's housed and unhoused populations by causing obstructed and inaccessible sidewalks, unsafe encampments, and fewer unhoused people to accept services,\" they continued.\nA decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Melissa Quinn,Daily Signal,Federal Courts.","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/22/13fc889b-fbdd-4542-a4fd-7f2ab08324ca/thumbnail/1200x630g8/7550f90f9e6a829322afb1944b2f8f2b/gettyimages-2147863353.jpg?v=57e8fa9efcf044a821348136ff26ed69","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@@MelissaQuinn97","_score":3.141622,"_id":"4470951166bb6af02ddcbdb4210ca8e1"},{"title":"Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on U.S. microchip production, blocking of sales to China, Russia","author":"Lesley Stahl","published_date":"2024-04-21 23:00:18","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/commerce-secretary-gina-raimondo-on-us-microchip-production-blocking-of-sales-to-china-russia-60-minutes-transcript","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo is focused on U.S. advanced microchip production \u2014 and keeping the chips out of China and Russia.","summary":"What does the secretary of commerce do? Until now, mainly promote U.S. businesses abroad. It had not been a high-profile job til Gina Raimondo turned the second-tier agency into a center of job creation, manufacturing, and national security.\nOnce the governor of Rhode Island, Raimondo, at 52, seems to have come out of nowhere to become a rising star of the Democratic party, and of the Biden administration.\nAs commerce secretary, she's running new projects that could touch the lives of every American, and she's helping lead the expanding Cold War with China and confront Russia's aggression in Ukraine. The battlefield for both those conflicts is technology.\nGina Raimondo: If you think about national security today in 2024, it's not just tanks and missiles; it's technology. It's semiconductors. It's AI. It's drones. And the Commerce Department is at the red-hot center of technology.\nAnd at the red-hot center: a global \"chip war\" that ramped up, says Gina Raimondo, when Russia invaded Ukraine.\nGina Raimondo: The Commerce Department stopped all semiconductor chips from being sold to Russia. Every drone, every missile, every tank has semiconductors in them. And, you know Lesley, you know we are being effective because shortly after we started that work we heard stories of the Russians taking semiconductors out of refrigerators, out of dishwashers--\nGina Raimondo\n60 Minutes\nLesley Stahl: What?\nGina Raimondo: \u2013out, out of breast pumps, getting the chips--\nLesley Stahl: Oh, come\u2013\nGina Raimondo: --to put them into their military equipment.\nLesley Stahl: However, the Russians are now working their way around this--\nGina Raimondo: They are.\nLesley Stahl: --and successfully. And they're doing better in the war, probably, because of this.\nGina Raimondo: You are right in what you say.\nBut, she says--\nGina Raimondo: It's absolutely the case that our export controls have hurt their ability to conduct the war, made it harder. And we are enforcing this every minute of every day, doing everything we can.\n60 Minutes\nThese are some of the enforcers:\nThea Kendler (assistant secretary of commerce for Export Administration):Push to talk about our controls on Russia--\n--Raimondo's team at Commerce that monitors and polices the ban on any company in the world from selling products with American chips in them to Russia. but not just Russia.\nPresident Biden (during State of the Union): I've made sure that the most advanced American technologies can't be used in China.\nThe Chinese warn that these export controls could trigger an escalating trade war.\nLesley Stahl: Trade with China accounts for 750,000 U.S. jobs.\nGina Raimondo: Mmhmm.\nLesley Stahl: And if trade ends, we lose those jobs.\nGina Raimondo: We want to trade with China on the vast majority of goods and services. But on those technologies that affect our national security, no.\nLesley Stahl: Those advanced chips are in consumer goods. Banks use them\u2014\nGina Raimondo: Mmhmm.\nLesley Stahl: --hospitals. This is going toward products that are made for civilian use.\nGina Raimondo: Yep. Well, they also go into nuclear weapons, surveillance systems. And we know they want these chips and our sophisticated technology to advance their military.\nHer toughness has made her a target in China, where fake ads have her promoting the new Chinese-made smartphone.\nLast year, the government in Beijing hacked her email. When she was in China, on a trip ironically to improve relations, the tech company Huawei introduced that new smartphone with an advanced, Chinese-made chip.\nLesley Stahl: It was kind of in your face\u2014\nGina Raimondo: Mmhmm.\nLesley Stahl: --as if to say, \"Look at the chip that we have.\" And it was a pretty good, high-level chip, right?\nGina Raimondo: Well, I have their attention, clearly. And--\nLesley Stahl: And they've gotten yours.\nSecretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo\n60 Minutes\nGina Raimondo: Hmm. Well, what it tells me is the export controls are working because that chip is not nearly as good--\nLesley Stahl: It's not?\nGina Raimondo: --it's years behind what we have in the United States. We have the most sophisticated semiconductors in the world. China doesn't. We've out-innovated China.\nLesley Stahl: Well, \"we,\" you mean Taiwan?\nGina Raimondo: Fair.\nWhile American tech companies design the world's most advanced chips, none are actually made in the U.S. Ninety percent of them come from Taiwan, and they are key to the future of U.S. military weaponry.\nLesley Stahl: And China, from time to time, threatens, you know, the wolf, to invade Taiwan.\nGina Raimondo: Mmhmm.\nLesley Stahl: And some people say the whole reason is to get their hands on those chips.\nGina Raimondo: That's a problem, it's a risk, it makes us vulnerable.\nThe problem of our outsourcing production goes way beyond high tech with millions of American workers having lost their jobs that went overseas, something Raimondo knows first-hand growing up as the youngest child in an Italian-American family in Rhode Island.\nGina Raimondo: This is the old Bulova watch factory where my dad worked for almost 30 years.\nHer dad lost his job when Bulova abandoned the factory in 1983 and moved its operations to China.\nGina Raimondo: It's hard for you to imagine it now as you look around here. But this was, you know, a bustling place. You know, they had 1,000 people working here, food trucks on the sidewalk, an electroplating shop there, a tool and dye shop there. And now, this is what you have.\nLesley Stahl: And how old were you?\nGina Raimondo: I was in, like, sixth grade. But I saw the toll it took on my dad and my family.\nthe toll it took on my dad and my family.\nAnd that influenced her career choices from when she studied economics and played rugby at Harvard\u2013\nGina Raimondo: So, this is my office.\n--to when she left a high-paying job as a venture capitalist to run for public office in Rhode Island.\nGina Raimondo: This was the day that I was sworn in as State Treasurer, and those are my parents. That's my dad.\nLesley Stahl: That's your dad--\nGina Raimondo: Super proud of me.\nLesley Stahl: --the man who worked at Bulova.\nGina Raimondo: The man who worked at Bulova. The man who taught me about manufacturing, tau-- taught me that a job is about your pride, ability to take care of your family, not just a paycheck.\nMarried with two children, Raimondo--a Rhodes scholar and Yale Law School graduate--was elected the state's first female governor in 2014 as a moderate, pro-business Democrat.\nLesley Stahl: Liberals in your party, this is a quote, look upon you as a sellout to big business.\nGina Raimondo: I think that's ridiculous. I hold businesses accountable as much as anyone. When I tell them they can't sell their semiconductors to China, they don't love that. But I do that.\nIn late 2020, President-elect Joe Biden called her about leading the Commerce Department, which til then managed--without much fanfare or headlines--a mishmash of agencies and assignments, ranging from monitoring the weather to measuring the level of contaminants in household dust.\nLesley Stahl: So, one day, President-elect Biden calls you and said, \"What about being Commerce Secretary?\" And you heard that and thought?\nGina Raimondo: (laugh) Init-- truthfully, initially, I thought, \"What does the Commerce Secretary do?\"\nLesley Stahl: Yeah. (laugh)\nGina Raimondo: And then the president-elect said to me, \"Come. I want you to work with me to help rebuild American manufacturing.\" And I called my brother, my big brother, and he said, \"Gina, dad would be so proud. You gotta do it. You gotta do it.\" And that was it.\nOnce at Commerce, she began to lean on Congress-\nGina Raimondo (during congressional testimony): This is just good business--\n--to fund her new programs with $100 billion, including $50 billion for the bipartisan \"CHIPS Act\" that she is now dispensing to reduce America's reliance on Taiwan.\nGina Raimondo (during Intel \"CHIPS Act\" award announcement): It's a huge day for the entire country.\nLast month in Arizona, she announced her first award for making leading-edge chips in the U.S. to Intel.\nGina Raimondo (during Intel \"CHIPS Act\" award announcement): We are announcing our intention to invest $8.5 billion in Intel, America's champion semiconductor company. (applause)\nIntel intends to construct and modernize facilities in Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, and Ohio.\nShe's made two other big awards totaling $13 billion to Taiwan-based TSMC, and the South Korean company Samsung, to make the world's most advanced chips in Arizona and Texas.\nRaimondo is also spreading her largesse elsewhere in the country with another huge initiative, the \"Internet For All\" program.\nLesley Stahl, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Corning CEO Wendell Weeks\n60 Minutes\nWe went with her to a Corning factory in North Carolina, the world's largest manufacturer of fiber optic cable.\nWendell Weeks: You're looking at fiber on these spools, all different colors. What's inside of there is actually one of the most precise products ever manufactured by man.\nWendell Weeks, chairman and CEO of Corning, is expanding production to make some of the 10 million miles of new cable that's needed to connect the 24 million Americans, living mostly in rural America, who don't have access to high-speed internet. And under prodding by Raimondo, he's investing Corning's own capital to do it.\nWendell Weeks: We've invested another half-billion dollars and doubled our footprint for the U.S.\nLesley Stahl: When you're spending all this money to connect, you know, small numbers of people who live miles away, the expense almost doesn't make sense.\nGina Raimondo: It does make sense. The internet is no longer a luxury. You need it to see the doctor, to go to school, to do your business, to pay your bills, to sign up for, you know, Social Security. Everyone has electricity in this country. Everyone ought to have the internet.\nTogether, she says, the Internet For All and the CHIPS Act initiatives will create about a half-million jobs by 2030. But Wall Street is skeptical. Intel, for example, just reported $7 billion in operating losses.\nLesley Stahl: When you go to pick these different companies to give the money to--\nGina Raimondo: Mmhmm.\nLesley Stahl: --it's, it's social, industrial policy, something, you know, we gave up because it was shown that private industry does a better job picking. You're smiling.\nGina Raimondo: Well, do they? Because in the case of semiconductors the market didn't get it right.\nLesley Stahl: How did we lose this?\nGina Raimondo: We allowed manufacturing in this country to wither on the vine in search of cheaper labor in Asia, cheaper capital in Asia, and here we are. We just pursued profit over national security.\nLesley Stahl: There are strings attached to these grants. They have to provide daycare. You want them to have a diverse workforce--\nGina Raimondo: Mmhmm.\nLesley Stahl: --be union workers?\nGina Raimondo: That is not social policy, Lesley. That's--\nLesley Stahl: Sounds like it.\nGina Raimondo: --it's math. This is pure math.\nLesley Stahl: What do you--\nGina Raimondo: You won't have enough workers to do the job unless you figure out how to get women working in the facilities. What I am--\nLesley Stahl: But-- but on that point, if they need women--\nGina Raimondo: Mmhmm.\nLesley Stahl: --and women need daycare, that's a decision for the company to make. Why mandate it if it's what they need?\nGina Raimondo: It's not mandated. To be clear, these are not mandates.\nLesley Stahl: But it's written in there.\nGina Raimondo: It is written. But you know what's funny, I never hear complaints about this from the companies. The only complaints I have are from politicians.\nIn her three years in Washington, Raimondo has elevated the Commerce Department and its secretary into a high-profile player.\nGina Raimondo: China wakes up every day figuring out how to get around our regulations. We got to wake up every day that much more relentless and aggressive. So, I bring it every day.\nLesley Stahl: So here comes the inevitable, obvious question that you know is coming your way. You are on a list of future presidential candidates. Does that sound good to you? Is it appetizing?\nGina Raimondo: What sounds good to me is being the best commerce secretary there's ever been.\nOne qualification for high office is being able to duck a question like that.\nProduced by Richard Bonin.
