            "excerpt": "A reporter working for a local news outlet in Georgia spoke with multiple Black voters, noting that Donald Trump may benefit from decreased enthusiasm for Biden.",
            "summary": "A Georgia news reporter observed that while voting for former President Trump may be out of the question for some Black voters, the Republican nominee may nonetheless benefit from them losing enthusiasm for President Biden and his ailing economy.\nCasey Quinlan, the economy reporter for States Newsroom, wrote a piece for the Georgia Recorder, \"Black voters key to electing Biden in 2020. Money woes make some question their support in 2024.\" She shared multiple examples of Black voters reflecting a larger trend of dissatisfaction with Biden's economic track record.\nCiting Cleveland resident Jennifer Garner, Quinlan said, \"Black voters overwhelmingly supported President Joe Biden in 2020 and were key to his win, but as many like Garner struggle to make ends meet now, there is some evidence that Black voter enthusiasm for Biden may be slipping. And Trump is hoping to capitalize on that.\"\n\"I have to work two jobs overtime just to even try to cover my rent, which means I have no time to be able to enjoy life, period,\" Garner said. \"The only way things are going to get better is if people start talking and just let them know the economy sucks. We need better jobs and more money.\"\n\"She voted for Biden in 2020, but says now that she's researching other candidates — although she has ruled out former President Donald Trump,\" Quinlan wrote.\nHowever, Garner later added that she wasn't \"leaning towards anybody just yet.\"\nThe reporter also spoke to Audrianna Lewis, who, like Garner, ruled out voting for Trump, but nonetheless laments that in this current economy, \"People are not able to pay for doctor visits and prescriptions.\"\nIn addition, the report summarized the strife of a Philadelphian named Sarah Wallace as she contends with \"$200,000 in student debt and said she struggles to get Ozempic to treat her diabetes\" and in response, \"wants to see political leaders do more on student debt relief and make healthcare more affordable and accessible.\" Quinlan added further that Wallace, \"doesn't believe the economy has improved under Biden and that she doesn't see inflation easing enough to make a difference for her at the grocery store.\"\n\"I think Biden sold all of us on his dream to get into the office… And that was that,\" Wallace said, later adding, \"Buying food, you're never buying the most healthy [food] because they're more expensive. So you kind of have to improvise what you can do, you know?\" she said.\nThe Biden campaign has been wary of Trump capitalizing on decreased Black voter enthusiasm, Quinlan noted, writing that \"To counter Trump, the Biden campaign is spending millions on radio ads in swing states at Black-owned and Latino-owned radio stations to point out the administration's accomplishments, including investments in historically Black colleges and universities through grant funding and the American Rescue Plan Act, the cancellation of student loan debt for 3.9 million borrowers, and reducing Black child poverty in 2021, which it has connected to the then expansion of the child tax credit.\"\nThe reporter also appeared to be referring to a recent statement from Cornell Belcher, a pollster who worked for Barack Obama.\n\"I think the greatest threat to Biden's ability to rebuild his 2020 coalition, that looked like the 2012 coalition, isn't Donald Trump with Black voters, it's frustration and cynicism that'll lead to an off-ramp of third-party candidates,\" Belcher said.",

            "excerpt": "The bad economic news Americans saw last week is not something the Biden White House can easily spin their way out of. Still, with the help of the liberal media, they're trying.",
            "summary": "Last week brought bad news for the American people and President Joe Biden. Inflation persists and jobs are decaying.\nOn inflation, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported prices rose 3.5 percent between March 2023 and March 2024. This bad number is far higher than the U.S. Federal Reserve's goal of 2 percent inflation – and it follows three years of price increases.\nInflation continues to build even after the Federal Reserve pushed interest rates to their highest point in 23 years.\nMuch to the Fed's dismay, its restrictive private sector policies are being more than offset by the Biden administration's massive deficits. While the Fed is trying to take liquidity out of the system and force a slowdown to lower inflation, the Biden administration keeps pumping borrowed money into the economy.\nThe contradiction between the Fed and the Biden White House increases the scale of government and shrinks the private sector. Furthermore, since the federal government is the world's largest debtor, high interest rates translate into an even bigger federal deficit.\nSo, the long run consequences of Bidenomics on inflation is staggering. Measured from the time President Joe Biden took office, the prices Americans are paying have skyrocketed. In just three-and-a-half years, the price of eggs is up 49.3 percent, gasoline is up 47.5 percent, peanut butter is up 40 percent, butter and margarine are up 32 percent, electricity is up 28.3 percent, airfares are up 32.7 percent, used cars are up 20.9 percent – and the list continues.\nThe American people feel these price increases, and they are unhappy. Most Americans rate the economy as poor, while only 38 percent consider the economy is in good shape. (Under President Donald Trump, 65 percent rated the economy as good.)\nAs the Wall Street Journal editorialized:\n\"[I]f voters are downbeat about the economy, persistent inflation is a good reason. Price increases across the Biden Presidency are unlike anything Americans have seen in recent decades. They have been a particular shock for low-income and younger workers who haven't accumulated a wealth cushion in the stock market or housing values.\n\"Mr. Biden is the main architect of his inflation problem—and ours.\"\nMark Halperin with his usual insight asserted: \"The story of who will win this election might just be that voters demand a change from the mind-boggling high cost of almost everything. The prices are just too damn high.\"\nAs if inflation was not a big enough problem there is a an even bigger problem growing with the employment news.\nAs Matt Weidinger outlined in AEI Ideas:\n\"[I]n the past 12 months, employment among US natives is down by 651,000. Those declines were focused on men, a group President Biden already has increasing difficulties winning over.\n\"In contrast, employment among foreign-born individuals grew by 1,266,000 in the past year, driven by the rapidly growing population of foreign-born individuals ages 16 and over in the US, which rose by almost 2.6 million during the past year.\n\"The gap between US native and foreign-born employment is even starker since last summer. Since its peak in July 2023, employment of US natives has fallen by over 2.0 million, while employment of the foreign-born has risen by almost 1.4 million. \"\nFrom President Biden's standpoint, Weidinger highlights a deadly detail:\n\"Friday's jobs report reveals that unemployment among Black or African American individuals rose in March for the third consecutive month, to over 1.4 million, the highest level since January 2022. That group's unemployment rate has risen from 5.1 percent to 6.4 percent in the past year.\"\nThe jobs numbers contain even more problems for President Biden because part-time jobs are increasing much faster than full-time jobs. More and more Americans are finding themselves working two or three jobs – often with little or no benefits – just to make ends meet in an economy of constantly rising prices.\nSo, Bidenomics means rising prices, fewer jobs, more part-time employment, and a desperate sense that things are just not working.\nStill, the propaganda media is trying hard to paint a pretty picture. CNN, for example, called the latest monthly jobs report a \"blowout.\"\nBut everyday Americans know when they go to the grocery store, pay monthly bills, or fill up their cars that life has gotten harder under Biden.\nThe trademark of Bidenomics may be the steady shrinking of products. Take a Trump-era candy bar or box of cereal and place it next to the same product today. In most cases, the price increased, and the unit size has shrunk.\nSimply put: Bidenomics means you get less for more.\nIf this economic failure persists for another seven months – and it almost certainly will – then Bidenomics may be Biden's downfall.",

            "summary": "Radical left activists are back at it with a tactic that feels like déjà vu. These weren't your peaceful protesters rallying on Monday in solidarity with Palestinians; these are disruptors who view chaos as a stepping stone to their anti-capitalist utopia. They're just pretending to care about what happens in Gaza. It's crucial that city leaders step up now. If they don't, we're not just looking at a repeat of past disruptions—we're staring down a potentially more vicious wave of activism that threatens our economy.\nFrom the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco to the Brooklyn Bridge in New York, activists snarled traffic, creating a hellish commute for people just trying to get home or to work. Passengers likely missed flights out of Sea-Tac airport in Seattle and Chicago O'Hare International Airport thanks to activists blocking the roads in.\nThe methods are right out of an anarchist's handbook. \"Sleeping dragon\" tactics, where protesters handcuff themselves together inside PVC pipes, make it a logistical nightmare for police to intervene. Some even go as far as chaining themselves to barrels filled with concrete or using their vehicles to clog the roads.\nWhy are we seeing this surge in direct action? Well, they've seen it work.\nThe anti-police violence during the peak of the Black Lives Matter movement got them the headlines and chaos they desired. And without significant consequences, why stop? Take Seattle's I-5 freeway takeover on January 6—months later, those identified haven't even faced charges.\nMonday's activists will get off with a slap on the wrist like a fine, and at worst, some restorative justice program that barely registers as punishment.\nThese activists aren't just random activists looking to be a part of something bigger than themselves; they're die-hards who see themselves as martyrs in a war not against \"oppression\" in Gaza, but against capitalism itself. Despite the banners of \"Free Palestine\" and slogans against genocide, their real battle is with the economic system they despise.\nI know these people. I could write the script for how the next several weeks to months will unfold.\nIn my new book, \"What's Killing America: Inside the Radical Left's Tragic Destruction of Our Cities,\" I detail my experiences infiltrating Antifa direct action. I know how they think, organize, operate, and act. Monday's activism was an extension of what we saw after the death of George Floyd. Only they might not waste as much time, learning from some of their mistakes in 2020 and 2021.\nInitially, BLM protests were largely peaceful, but then came Antifa, escalating to riots and taking over parts of Seattle and Portland. They burned buildings in Minneapolis, and helped create a looters paradises in New York and Chicago. Today, some of the same figures behind those riots are blocking roads, ostensibly under the banner of Palestinian support but really aiming to inflict economic pain as a form of protest against capitalism.\nThe newly-formed A15 Economic Blockade group makes no secret of their goals. Their website explicitly targets the \"global economy\" that they claim is \"complicit in genocide.\" They're not just aiming to disrupt; they want to inflict pain by \"blocking the arteries of capitalism and jamming the wheels of production.\" Their actions aren't about aiding Palestinians or any other oppressed group; they aim to hammer at the foundations of a system they believe is fundamentally corrupt: capitalism.\n\"There is a sense in the streets in this recent and unprecedented movement for Palestine that escalation has become necessary: there is a need to shift from symbolic actions to those that cause pain to the economy,\" the website says.\nThough elements of the activists are very obviously antisemitic, much anger is generated by Israel's embrace of capitalism.\nIsrael's capitalist economy is robust thanks, in large part, to significant technical advancements and a strong entrepreneurial spirit. The country epitomizes the very economic system activists oppose because they believe it exacerbates disparities between the wealthy and the poor, both within its borders and in its dealings with Palestinians. It doesn't matter that they're siding with Hamas in this war; their hatred of capitalism is so intense they can convince themselves there's nothing wrong with a terrorist group that subjugates women and throws gays from rooftops.\nCoordinated protests like those witnessed on Monday can galvanize people to join the cause. Similar to how gangs recruit vulnerable youth from broken homes, these activists target disenchanted young Americans—whether they're underemployed as baristas or disillusioned with corporate life. These individuals can become radicalized, swayed to contribute to the chaos unfolding on our streets. And we know what happens when we let it get out of hand.\nWhen law enforcement finally acted against Antifa, driven in part by a public that was getting tired of the violence, the violence came to an end. But the activists hadn't dismantled the biggest \"system of oppression\" as they had hoped. They've been biding their time until there was another massive movement that they could exploit or infiltrate. Who knew it would be Hamas terrorists that would reignite their activism?\nSo, what's next? Unless city leaders take a firmer stance against these disruptions, expect things to escalate. We're not just dealing with a protest; it's an all-out assault on the structure of society by those who believe they have nothing to lose.\nIf left unchecked, this movement could morph into something even more dangerous than what we witnessed with Antifa and BLM. The time for half-measures is over. It's time to confront these tactics head-on and restore order, for everyone's sake.",

On the issue of immigration, 29% of Latino respondents gave Trump a positive rating, over 22% who preferred Biden.\nThe NBC poll was conducted from April 12 to 16, 2024 with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",

            "summary": "A new Biden campaign ad focused on the economy and infrastructure included a subtle claim about the president's mental fitness, calling him \"sharp as a knife.\"\nThe Thursday ad, titled \"Sharp,\" centered on Pennsylvania steelworker Jojo Burgess, who spent most of the 30-second video praising Biden over his handling of the economy and infrastructure, but briefly appeared to reference the president's mental acuity by using the same descriptor repeated by the administration and Democrats to defend his cognitive ability earlier this year.\n\"I've been a proud steelworker for 23 years, and I know hard work when I see it. I love to tell the story about meeting President Biden because when you meet him, this guy is as sharp as a knife,\" Burgess said in the video.\n\"They have nothing else to attack because they can't attack the things that he is doing that are so good for this country. I see people going back to work, jobs coming to the area, infrastructure being fixed up. Joe Biden gets things done. That's just who he is,\" he added.\nIn a post on X about the ad, Biden-Harris HQ — the account belonging to the Biden campaign — said, \"President Biden gets things done. MAGA Republicans have nothing else to attack — because they know President Biden is delivering.\"\nThe use of the word \"sharp\" was frequently used by Biden's defenders to describe the president as he faced an onslaught of Republican attacks following the release of Special Counsel Robert Hur's report in February, which claimed he was a \"sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory.\"\nRepublican lawmakers and former President Donald Trump claimed the report — which came about as part of the investigation into Biden's mishandling of classified documents — was evidence the president was not fit to serve another term.\nIn the White House press briefing following the report's release, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stressed that Biden was \"sharp\" and \"on top of things,\" while Democrat lawmakers and liberal media figures insisted Biden was one of the \"sharpest\" people they've dealt with.\nFox News Digital has reached out to the Biden campaign for comment.",

For Latinos, this election is all about inflation! And that makes sense! Inflation is bad right now,\" he said before claiming that Trump had no solutions to solve the crisis.\nAnother recent poll from Axios/Ipsos shows Latinos overwhelmingly support Trump over Biden on key issues like the economy.\nThe poll found only 20% of Latinos think Biden is \"good for the U.S. economy,\" while 42% of respondents said the same about Trump. Latinos also favor Trump on immigration, crime and public safety.\nBiden received 50% support among Latino voters in a recent NY Times/Siena College survey, which is historically low for a Democrat, according to a report from The Hill.

            "summary": "Coral reefs around the world are experiencing global bleaching for the fourth time, top reef scientists declared Monday, a result of warming ocean waters amid human-caused climate change.\nCoral reef bleaching across at least 53 countries, territories or local economies has been confirmed from February 2023 to now, scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and International Coral Reef Initiative said. It happens when stressed coral expel the algae that are their food source and give them their color. If the bleaching is severe and long-lasting, the coral can die.\nCoral reefs are important ecosystems that sustain underwater life, protect biodiversity and slow erosion. They also support local economies through tourism.\nBleaching has been happening in various regions for some time. In the world's largest coral reef ecosystem, Australia's Great Barrier Reef, bleaching affected 90% of the coral assessed in 2022. The Florida Coral Reef, the third-largest, experienced significant bleaching last year.\nBut in order for bleaching to be declared on a global scale, significant bleaching had to be documented within each of the major ocean basins, including the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\nMonday's news marks the second worldwide bleaching event in the last 10 years. The last one ended in May 2017. Brought on by a powerful El Nino climate pattern that heated the world's oceans, it lasted three years and was determined to be worse than the prior two bleaching events in 2010 and 1998.\nThis year's bleaching follows the declaration that 2023 was the hottest year on record.\n\"As the world's oceans continue to warm, coral bleaching is becoming more frequent and severe,\" Derek Manzello, NOAA Coral Reef Watch coordinator, said in a statement.\nSelina Stead, a marine biologist and chief executive of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, called climate change \"the biggest threat to coral reefs worldwide.\" She said scientists are working to learn more about how coral responds to heat and to identify naturally heat-tolerant corals, but said it is \"critical the world works to reduce carbon emissions.\"\nOne reef that fared better than others last year was the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, which was afforded some protection by its location in deeper water in the Gulf of Mexico about 100 miles off the Texas coast. Sanctuary officials didn't immediately respond to messages Monday seeking the latest on the health of the sanctuary's corals.",

            "excerpt": "Tax Day is behind us, but it already looms large for next year. The FairTax would give us eight things to help us take the power from the IRS and change April 15 forever.",
            "summary": "April 15 has just passed. Most of us are taking a breather. It doesn't have to be this way. The FairTax Act which has been before Congress for 25 years would fund the government with no extra effort from any of us than just paying a sales tax whenever we buy new goods or services. No one would ever have to know what we pay or when we pay.\nWhat else would happen?\n1. The economy would explode. Trillions of dollars offshore would be repatriated, because there would be no tax event in doing so. A study shows that capital spending in the first year after passing the FairTax would increase 70%. That increases productivity, and it is estimated that the GDP would grow in the first year by 10%. That begins to save Social Security and Medicare. Additionally, the ceiling on contributions to those programs disappears and illegal immigrants and the underground economy pay into the system.\n2. Manufacturing would return to the U.S. Former Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer often quoted an informal study of a large number of international businesses that are headquartered overseas.\nWhen asked what they would do in their long-term planning if we eliminated all taxes on capital and labor and taxed only personal consumption, 80% said they would build their next plant in the U.S. Twenty percent said they would relocate their headquarters to the U.S. And it is totally border-neutral, which would improve our exports as well as make us more competitive with imports whose taxes have been rebated.\n3. Every family that is legally resident in the U.S. would receive a monthly cash advance — a prebate — that would totally cover the tax costs of spending up to the poverty line for that family. Poverty level spending is defined each year by the government to be that spending necessary to buy essentials. The prebate for a family of four would cover the tax costs on spending of $40,880. That would totally untax the poor and in addition, prices would fall dramatically. A Harvard study determined that the embedded cost of the IRS at retail is on average 22% of the price.\n(Example: It takes hundreds of companies to bring a loaf of bread to your table. Oil companies, refineries, ore companies, steel companies, tractor and truck manufacturers, distributors, farmers, grain companies, bakeries, plastic companies and retail stores are all involved. Each of them has labor costs, operating costs, rent and tax costs. The only mechanism available for any business to pay a bill is the price. And the only taxpayer in the world is the consumer who consumes the product and all the embedded costs.) Let's quit lying to the public. Stop pretending that businesses pay taxes and tax the consumer honestly and openly.\n4. We would, for the first time ever, tax wealth instead of wages. (For those worried that the rich won't pay their fair share, I note that all wealth is ultimately consumed. If not by the earner, then by the heirs. Even money contributed to charities is ultimately consumed and would be taxed.) And if billionaire Elon Musk wants to move to a farm and grow his groceries and never pay taxes, we won't care. We would borrow his money and create jobs with it.\n5. Businesses would make business decisions based on what is best for their shareholders, employees and customers, not what is best for their tax burden.\n6. We would tax the underground economy which, 15 years ago, was estimated at $3 trillion a year. Illegal immigrants would also pay their fair share.\n7. We would save Americans nearly $1 trillion spent each year on IRS paperwork.\n8. Churches would be able to conduct themselves as they see fit without IRS agents listening to their sermons. In 1954, Lyndon Johnson passed an amendment to the tax code that prevented 501(c)(3) organizations from endorsing political candidates. It was aimed mainly at churches and during the abuses of the IRS during the Obama administration, government agents did in fact attend some churches to monitor sermons.\nEvery family that is legally resident in the U.S. would receive a monthly cash advance — a prebate — that would totally cover the tax costs of spending up to the poverty line for that family. Poverty level spending is defined each year by the government to be that spending necessary to buy essentials. The prebate for a family of four would cover the tax costs on spending of $40,880.\nThis is not a crazy idea. It has been carefully studied and it works. It is exactly the system in place in Monaco, for example. And billionaires, who have armies of tax experts to game the current code, also spend a lot of money and would pay more than their fair share.\nWe would be told that the FairTax would discourage charitable giving, but the Fricks, the Mellons, and the Carnegies gave away their fortunes before there even was an income tax to deduct from. The wealthy would continue to do so.\nLet us get serious about helping the American people. The FairTax would increase everyone's purchasing power by lowering prices when the embedded costs are driven out of price, increasing everyone's take-home pay when all taxes on income are repealed, give everyone peace of mind when the IRS is eliminated, and finally, give to the American people the greatest gift we have to give. Anonymity! No agency of government should know more about us than we are willing to tell our children.",

He then introduced two parents, Jordan and Leticia, who said that despite both of them working multiple jobs to support their family, life under the current government has made the American dream unachievable.\n\"The American dream is the American nightmare,\" Jordan said in an introductory segment, juxtaposing how he thought that a college degree would lead to a stable and prosperous life.\n\"My wife wants to have another baby, but we just can't afford it,\" he continued. \"Only half my family has health insurance right now. My income is not keeping up with inflation. We're paying $100 for the same $40 worth of groceries, and the rent went up as well. Gas prices have gone up.\"\nLater in the show, Dr. Phil asked, \"How do you feel when you see money being spent by the government on other things? They're spending money on migrants that are coming in, they're spending money on foreign causes, they're spending money on a lot of things, but it keeps costing more and more and more just to live here. All of that is because of the economy and the fact that they're just, as I said when we started, they're just printing more money.\"\nLeticia said it felt like a slap in the face to taxpayers like herself. Jordan was similarly frustrated by money being spent on migrants.\n\"I'm all for legal migration, but … we're being last, you know? We're being crushed,\" he said. \"The middle class are the ones who are hurting. We're in the bracket where we make too much to get help [but] still feel the pressure of gas prices.\"\nIn a later segment, Leticia offered a similar comment.\n\"The state of our country right now is disgusting. We're definitely angry at the government,\" she said. \"We pay taxes for illegal immigrants, for the homeless and for people that aren't even working, and we're people that are working and are barely surviving.\"\nJordan said, \"I'm angry at our leadership. The American people deserve better. We're taking care of everybody. What about us? We need help. I'm angry at the system that has failed us over and over and over again. We're being crushed.\"\nDr. Phil later expressed frustration over people who get paid not to work.\n\"Now, is it just me or is the system turned on its head?\" he asked.\n\"And these guys are not working one job, they're not working two jobs, they're not working three — they're working four jobs,\" Dr. Phil said, referring to his guests. \"They're making $1,000 more than these people who aren't working at all.\"\n\"You know why? Because you're paying for these people to stay home,\" he continued. \"What the hell?\"",

            "summary": "FIRST ON FOX: New Jersey Republican Rep. Chris Smith has introduced legislation that would ensure minerals key to green energy in the U.S. are not extracted using child labor in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nSmith's legislation — called the Stop China's Exploitation of Congolese Children and Adult Forced Labor through Cobalt Mining Act — would specifically block cobalt extracted or processed with the use of child or forced labor from entering the U.S. market. Cobalt is a vital component of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, but is largely sourced from the DRC where human rights investigations have found child labor is rampant.\nAnd Chinese companies often own cobalt mines in the DRC that export raw materials to China to be processed. The vast majority of worldwide cobalt is processed in Chinese facilities, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\"The Communist Chinese government — which has gained almost full dominance of every single step of the cobalt supply chain — profits from child and forced labor used to extract cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo and power our so-called ‘green economy,'\" said Smith, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Global Human Rights Subcommittee.\nSmith's legislation was crafted alongside House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., whose committee has jurisdiction over the bill. The committee will mark the legislation up on Wednesday, setting it up for a potential floor vote in the near future.\nThe bill was also written, in part, in response to a November congressional hearing chaired by Rep. Chris Smith that put a spotlight on forced labor in the DRC.\n\"America has long fought to end child and adult forced labor, yet the cobalt vital to the batteries in our technology is unethically mined with the use of forced labor under Chinese control,\" Rep. Jason Smith said. \"This legislation is a critical step to blocking material tainted by these inhumane labor practices from entering this country. I am thankful to Rep. Chris Smith for introducing this legislation to stop these dangerous practices.\"\nOverall, in 2023, the DRC produced 74% of the world's cobalt and is home to more than half of known global reserves of the mineral, according to U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data. The U.S., on the other hand, mined less than 1% of the world's cobalt supply and contains less than 1% of its reserves.\nWhile it remains unclear exactly how many of the mines are artisanal and employ child laborers, a USGS National Minerals Information Center study published in June determined that up to 11% of cobalt produced in the nation is tied to child labor.\nThe Department of Labor's Bureau of International Labor Affairs previously found that more than 40,000 children, including children as young as 6 years old, work in cobalt mines in the DRC.\nThe Stop China's Exploitation of Congolese Children and Adult Forced Labor through Cobalt Mining Act comes as the Biden administration continues to push for a rapid economy-wide transition to electric vehicles. In recent weeks, the administration has finalized rules pushing for more than 50% of car sales to be electric by 2030 and a large share of trucks to be zero-emissions in that same timeline.\n\"Three years ago, I set an ambitious target: that half of all new cars and trucks sold in 2030 would be zero-emission,\" President Biden said last month. \"I brought together American automakers. I brought together American autoworkers. Together, we've made historic progress. Hundreds of new expanded factories across the country. Hundreds of billions in private investment and thousands of good-paying union jobs. And we'll meet my goal for 2030 and race forward in the years ahead.\"",

            "summary": "TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — A Belarusian hacker activist group claims to have infiltrated computers at the country's largest fertilizer plant to pressure the government to release political prisoners.\nThe state-run Grodno Azot plant has made no comment on the claim by the Belarusian Cyber-Partisans group to have done damage including destroying backup systems and encrypted internal mail, document flow and hundreds of PCs. However, the company's website has been unavailable since Wednesday, the day the group claimed the attack.\nGroup coordinator Yuliana Shametavets told The Associated Press from New York on Friday that because the plant works with dangerous substances including ammonia the attack was designed to affect only documentation.\nThe group posted photos on social media that it it claimed showed screens of compromised plant computers.\nGrodno Azot, with about 7,500 employees, is a key producer in the country, whose economy relies heavily on chemical industries.\nA harsh crackdown on the opposition in Belarus began after protests swept the country in August 2020 in the wake of presidential elections whose disputed results gave authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko a sixth term in office.\nHuman rights activists say some 35,000 people were arrested in the course of the crackdown and that there are nearly 1,400 political prisoners behind bars today. They include many of the country's most prominent opposition figures and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski, founder of the Viasna human rights group.\nThe 2020 protests were the largest and most sustained show of dissent in Belarus since Lukashenko came to power in 1994. Workers struck in protest at several major plants, including Grodno Azot.\nCyber-Partisans said its claimed hack was punishment for \"bullying, pressuring & conducting political repression against the company's employees.\"",

            "excerpt": "Times are changing rapidly in the new Portland. The tolerance of drugs is long gone and business is back. The region is working hard to welcome investment and serve as a tech hub.",
            "summary": "After three years of legalized hard drugs and rampant overdose deaths in Portland, Oregon, lawmakers this month rightly said enough is enough. There is a better option: strong progressive economic policies and ending untethered drug use promises to help repair the Portland image, attract new businesses and retain others downtown. This new more pragmatic progressivism we see shows a major shift in our state.\nGovernor Tina Kotek and the Democratic-majority legislature decisively steered away from ultra-progressive drug policies this year. The state's evolution reflects an increasing recognition among bipartisan policymakers of the need for practical solutions to address challenging social issues while becoming a more business-friendly state. And I have seen this work before.\nI hail from Detroit and contributed to the city's post-bankruptcy restructuring, which is currently drawing in investors, innovators and young adventurers. Coming to Portland, I was struck by the similarities between my new city today with that of my youth in Detroit's Cass Corridor.\nLike Detroit's blend of academic and economic opportunities juxtaposed with the stark realities of urban decay and crime, Portland's downtown today grapples with a similar set of opportunities and challenges.\nThis was exacerbated by voter-approved Measure 110 which ushered in the most lenient drug laws in the nation in attempt to encourage drug treatment and cut down addictions. Despite the well-meaning intentions of Portland voters, the unintended outcomes have been severe.\nLike Detroit, beneath visible urban challenges, Portland pulsates with vitality. Greater Portland boasts an extraordinary industrial base, fosters the education of trailblazers, and remains a strategic West Coast location for any sector.\nThe repeal of Measure 110, effective September 1, signals a commitment to growth, creating a safer and more conducive business climate. Unfortunately, Measure 110's failures reminded Portlanders of the importance of basic order to maintain a city's quality of life.\nAnd when polls this year showed 56% of voters favored repealing the measure, bipartisan legislators went for it, allowing local governments and law enforcement agencies the option to arrest or pursue substance abuse treatment for hard drug users. Kotek's leadership here mirrors Portland's metamorphosis, as she emerges as a centrist West Coast leader.\nHer work to allocate $240 million in tax incentives to 15 semiconductor companies also underscores Portland's dedication to embracing change and propelling progress in ways it simply had not done before to attract business. In June 2023, the state had approximately $11 million in cash incentives available for companies expanding their footprint in the state.\nOregon's political shift on tax incentives has solidified greater Portland's position as the nation's leading location in the semiconductor sector, shaping America's new economy in this critical industry that employs 40,000 people in the region.\nMoreover, this strategic move aligns seamlessly with the overarching federal effort for manufacturing investment, most notably from the CHIPS Act. Last December, the governor led a Portland central city task force of public and private sector leaders. We created solutions to the city's more pressing challenges and a long-term strategic vision for economic prosperity for the region.\nThis month, Multnomah County and Portland leaders unveiled an ambitious goal to cut the region's unsheltered homeless population in half by 2026, by adding hundreds of new shelter beds, building more affordable housing, and expand access to mental health and substance abuse treatment.\nRecently, Portland city council introduced an innovative Downtown Business Incentives Credit Program, expanded enterprise zones, and is exploring new Tax Increment Financing districts, signifying a turning point in the economic posture of the city nestled between the majestic Cascade Mountains and the tranquil vineyards of the Willamette Valley.\nCombined, these new incentives and the reversal of legalized open-air hard drug use show a region committed to turning the page on three years of economic uncertainty. With these changes, business leaders can now confidently consider expanding in the Portland area, knowing that favorable policies are in place to support their success.\nDriving down drug use and crime creates economic wins. In Detroit, policies like these ended much of the dilapidation I witnessed in my youth. That city now experiences high-priced condos, retail, and the newly erected Little Caesars Arena (home to two of the city's pro sports teams, the Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Pistons).\nOregon's political shift on tax incentives has solidified greater Portland's position as the nation's leading location in the semiconductor sector, shaping America's new economy in this critical industry that employs 40,000 people in the region.\nSimilarly, Portland's allure transcends its urban confines. Today, as Portland confronts its challenges head-on, it stands on the cusp of emerging stronger, more vibrant, and more resilient than ever before.\nAs someone who talks to corporations seeking fresh industrial land, high-value talent, and a high quality of life, the repeal of Measure 110 will help further reposition Portland once again as the Pacific Northwest's prime choice for business. My new hometown of Portland is charting a course toward once again being the West Coast's best value for business.",

At least two dozen \"Defend Our Juries\" protesters have been interviewed by police, though so far no one other than Warner has been charged.\nWarner welcomed the ruling, noting it came on Earth Day, and said she was relieved.\n\"When you see a letter that says government department versus Trudi Warner, and when you have an indictment which is 133 pages, it's intimidating,\" she said.",

            "excerpt": "Fox News poll shows registered voters show Trump ahead of Biden by three points in Michigan, a shift from Biden's strong lead ahead of the 2020 election",
            "summary": "Four years ago this month — in the early lockdown stages of the coronavirus pandemic — Joe Biden led Donald Trump by 8 points among Michigan voters in a head-to-head presidential matchup. Today, they prefer Trump by 3 points.\nA new Fox News survey of Michigan registered voters finds President Biden receives 46% support to former President Trump's 49%. That's within the margin of sampling error. In February, it was 45% Biden — 47% Trump. In April 2020, Biden was at 49% to Trump's 41%.\nTrump's advantage is mainly due to a 19-point lead among men. He is also the favorite among White men without a college degree (by 33 points), rural voters (+23), voters under age 35 (+16), and White voters (+13). Plus, he is helped by a 4-point edge among independents as well as garnering a bit more support among Republicans (94%) than Biden gets among Democrats (92%).\nBiden's best groups include Black voters (+56), urban voters (+27), suburban women (+21), and voters ages 65 and over (+14).\nSince February, Trump is up 5 points among men, and while Biden has made similar gains among Black voters (+7), his 75% support among Blacks is about 20 points below where it was when he won Michigan in 2020.\nVoters living in union households go for Biden by 12 points, while the much larger non-union segment backs Trump by 7.\nTrump retains more of his 2020 voters, with 95% still supporting him compared to 90% of Biden's 2020 voters backing him.\nIn a potential 5-way race, Trump is ahead of Biden by 42%-40%, with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. receiving 9%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 2% each. It was announced Thursday that Kennedy will appear on the ballot in Michigan in November.\nBiden won Michigan by less than three percentage points in 2020. Ninety-six percent of Democrats voted for him, but fewer of them today, 83%, approve of the job he is doing.\nThe president's overall job rating stands at 43% approve and 56% disapprove. Some 11% of those disapproving of Biden's job performance still prefer him over Trump in the matchup.\nMichiganders have mixed views of Biden's approach to the Israel and Hamas war in Gaza, with 24% saying he is too supportive of the Israelis, 21% too supportive of the Palestinians, and 40% about right. Democrats (33%) and independents (22%) are more likely than Republicans (15%) to think Biden is too supportive of the Israelis -- and that shows up in the presidential vote preference. More than one-third of those saying Biden is too close to Israel back Trump (35%), the highest of the four battleground states where Fox News conducted surveys this week (Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin).\nJust over half of Michigan voters are either getting ahead financially or holding steady and those voters choose Biden, while just under half are falling behind and they go big for Trump.\nMore voters trust Trump by wide margins on some of the major issues of the campaign — immigration (+15 points), the economy (+11 points), and foreign policy (+8), while Biden is more narrowly preferred on election integrity (+6), health care (+6), and abortion (+5). The two are trusted about evenly on energy policy (Trump +2).\nBy a 9-point margin, more think Trump (49%) has the mental fitness to serve effectively as president than Biden (40%). Some 22% of Democrats think Biden lacks the metal soundness to serve. That's more than twice the number of Republicans who say the same about Trump (10%).\nMajorities of voters under age 35 disapprove of Biden (63%), think he lacks the mental fitness to serve (68%), trust Trump to handle the economy (61%), and favor Trump in the head-to-head ballot (+16 points).\nOverall, more voters view Biden negatively than positively by 16 points (41% favorable, 57% unfavorable). Trump's personal rating is also in negative territory but by a narrower 8 points (45-53%). Kennedy is underwater by 3 (39-42%), with one in five unable to rate him (19%).\nForty-six percent of voters say they would back the Republican candidate for Congress in their district, while 43% prefer the Democrat. Almost all of those backing the Democratic candidate go for Biden (92%) and most of those favoring the Republican candidate back Trump (93%).\nConducted April 11-16, 2024 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,126 Michigan registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (186) and cellphones (653) or completed the survey online after receiving a text message (287). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sample error of ±3 percentage points. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics of respondents are representative of the registered voter population.",

Now, it's been a muddled mess and an embarrassment to the United States.\n…\nNow, these aren't the words of a superpower because a superpower is proud and resolute. America under Biden is ashamed and shaky.\n…\nToday, the same people who got us into this mess are now somehow stunned that Americans are opposed to more foreign intervention, more money for Ukraine. And those same people think that America is weaker and our enemies are stronger because the American people are the problem, and their representatives in the House lack the will to stand up to our enemies. And these same people think that if we just agreed to borrow more money, if we agreed to take on more commitments to other countries, if we agreed to trust Biden and his team even more, then things would be better. Well, they are completely wrong.\nThe American people are still loyal, they're still patriotic. They're still committed to building a richer and safer world for everyone. Most still support Israel. They still mistrust Vladimir Putin. They still want America to be number one. The problem isn't the American people. The problem is what our leaders have done to the American people and America. Measured on the basis of purchasing power parity, China's economy is now larger than ours.\nThe United States is over $34 trillion in debt and counting. The United States' intel community lacks credibility. And young people? They're not interested in joining the military anymore. Government geniuses gave in to globalization and gutted our jobs.

            "summary": "The Keystone State looks headed for another tight race as President Biden and former President Trump are in a dead heat in the latest Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters, a state Trump won by less than a point in 2016 and Biden reclaimed by just over a point in 2020.\nThe survey of registered voters, released Thursday, finds the former and current presidents tied at 48% each, a slight improvement for Biden who was down by 2 percentage points in March.\nBiden saw modest gains among nonwhite voters (+5), suburban voters (+5) and voters under age 35 (+9), while Trump's coalition, such as conservatives, White evangelicals, White men without a degree, and rural voters, held relatively steady. What's more, Trump kept the advantage he had among independents: He was ahead among them by 7 points in March and maintains an 8-point edge now.\nBiden won union households by 5 points in 2020. Today, he holds the small subgroup by 2 points (49% Biden, 47% Trump). Non-union households split 48% each.\nIn a potential five-way race that includes third-party candidates, Trump comes out on top by 2 points: Trump 44%, Biden 42%, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. 8%, Jill Stein 2%, and Cornel West 1%. In this scenario, 8% of two-way Trump supporters break for Kennedy (none for Stein or West), while 10% of Biden supporters go for Kennedy (6%), Stein (3%), and West (1%).\nBiden is in the Keystone State this week, focusing on the economy and advocating for higher taxes on the wealthy as he visits several cities, including his hometown of Scranton.\nOver 4 in 10 voters feel they are falling behind financially (44%). Almost as many (41%) say they are holding steady, while just 14% say they are getting ahead. Trump leads among those who feel they are falling behind by 53 points, while Biden is ahead by 42 points among those saying getting ahead/holding steady.\nThe March Fox News Poll identified the economy as the top issue for Pennsylvanians, when voters surveyed felt Trump would better handle the issue. Trump's advantage on the issue (+12 points) held steady in the April poll.\nTrump also has a 16-point lead on another top issue: immigration and border security, while voters favor him on foreign policy by 4 points.\nBiden is seen as better at handling abortion (+10), election integrity (+6), and health care (+6).\nThe two major candidates are nearly tied on energy policy (Biden +1), despite concerns among some Democrats that Biden's opposition to fracking might be unpopular, especially after the administration paused new exports of U.S. natural gas earlier this year. A House Oversight Committee hearing on Thursday saw Republicans question the impact the pause would have on the U.S., especially internationally.\nVoters split over the Biden administration's handling of the conflict in the Middle East: 24% think he's too supportive of the Israelis vs. 23% say he's too supportive of the Palestinians. The largest number, 40%, says Biden's approach is about right.\nDemocrats are more likely to think the White House is too supportive of the Israelis, while Republicans are more likely to think it is too supportive of the Palestinians.\nBiden's job approval rating is nearly identical to his personal favorability rating: 45% approve of the job he's doing and 44% have a favorable opinion of him, while 55% disapprove of his job performance and have an unfavorable view of him.\nTrump is perceived slightly better than Biden on his favorable rating, but still underwater by 5 points (47% favorable vs. 52% unfavorable), while Kennedy is underwater by 6 points (40% favorable, 46% unfavorable, 15% can't rate).\nThe candidates' mental soundness has been a topic of debate and Pennsylvania voters are more likely to think Trump has the mental fitness to serve effectively as president (49%) than say the same of Biden (43%). At least half think they both don't have the mental soundness to perform the duties of president (50% Trump does not, 55% Biden does not).\nThe Pennsylvania congressional race is tight as well: 47% say they would vote for the Democratic candidate in their district while 46% support the GOP candidate. That's a reversal from March when Republicans were up by 3 points.\n\"The liabilities Biden has nationally are present in Pennsylvania, but they're muted,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"His standing with core Democratic constituencies is a little stronger, and he does a little better on issues like abortion, health care, and election integrity. It's the difference between being down a few points versus being tied.\"\nConducted April 11-16 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,141 Pennsylvania registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file.

            "excerpt": "Former President Donald Trump held a rally in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania on Saturday and local business owners spoke out to Fox News Digital about the economy and his visit.",
            "summary": "NORTH WHITEHALL TOWNSHIP, Pa. – Al Anderson owns the Leather Corner Post.\nThe bar and grill on the edge of Schnecksville has its roots as a former carriage stop in the 1850s. The landmark, so dubbed from a time before street names when the crossroads at which it sits was marked only by a piece of rawhide nailed to a stake, has seen a lot of change in 170 years.\nAnd for Anderson, the changes have been particularly profound over the past decade as he struggles to keep up with rising costs to keep his business going.\n\"Our costs are through the roof just to stay in business. From A-to-Z we didn't have this four years ago,\" Anderson said. \"Of course, Bidenomics is nothing but printing money and creating inflation.\"\n\"So it's just false. It's bound to break, I just don't know when they're going to break it.\"\nAnderson's sentiments were echoed by other local business owners who expressed excitement before former President Trump's visit to the community and presidential campaign rally at Schnecksville firehall's fairground last Saturday. They seemed to long for the past years of the Trump administration and appear to be rooting for his victory in November.\n\"The economy over the last four years, especially from a customer's standpoint – we have to raise prices all the time. They were just complaining yesterday, too, that diesel fuel is up; everything's up… We have to just keep raising beer prices and food prices, it's just never ending,\" Lauren Anderson, Al's daughter and manager of Leather Corner Post, told Fox News Digital.\n\"I think it's exciting,\" Al Anderson said of Trump's visit. \"Donald Trump coming right next door to us is pretty awesome,\" Lauren added.\n\"I think in the Trump years, we all had more money in our pockets, so we could buy things at a lower cost… you could do more things with less money,\" Al added. \"[Biden-era] economics don't make sense. Go to the grocery store; it's unreal.\"\nCloser to the center of town, Schnecksville native Ed Frack recently opened SuperSets Gym in what was once his childhood IGA grocery store. Frack opened his first gym in Hanover Township, near ABE International Airport, just before Trump left office.\n\"I caught the tail end of it when I opened my first SuperSets,\" he said of Trump's first term. \"I would categorize it as [a time of] growth… Things were just a little easier for businessowners.\"\n\"The younger generation is noticeably spending more money than my generation ever did.\"\n\"At the same time, while they're spending more money, operation costs have doubled, tripled, and increased drastically over the last three years,\" added Frack, who previously battled to keep his first location open during then-Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf's pandemic lockdowns.\nFrack said he was shocked to hear Trump would be visiting the local firehouse over the weekend. \"I thought it was pretty awesome and cool for [him] to come by,\" he said.\nAs for the economic outlook for SuperSets, Frack said it will be difficult, but that he has made \"unorthodox changes\" to his business model to adapt to current conditions.\nHe described the last four years as a \"roller coaster,\" though added he believes the greater Lehigh Valley area retains a \"strong\" economic undercurrent. Inflation and cost-of-living increases, he said, have negatively affected the region, but not to the extent of other parts of the country. Frack added Schnecksville and the greater Allentown area remain a good place overall to start a business.\nLocal resident Zane Gray's father used to own a flooring business in the area, he told Fox News Digital.\nGray said the coronavirus pandemic coupled with the Biden administration's economic policies sent supply prices \"through the roof,\" which led to the business' demise.\n\"Sheets of plywood were $94 per sheet and what homeowner could afford that?\" Gray said. \"That really burnt some holes in our pockets and [we] ended up having to close-up shop, it's a shame.\"\nGray said he had been looking forward to Trump coming to town.\n\"I'm just excited. I'm so happy that he's coming to our little slice of heaven, and he gets to see the true people around here that support him, not these people on Facebook and Instagram,\" he quipped.\n\"It's nice to see some actual support and him coming out to see us. To see that he actually cares about us Pennsylvania locals. As long as he sticks true to his word and I know he will… prices should go down; jobs should be open up. I'll actually be able to afford things again, so I'm looking forward to him being in office.\"\nAbout 25 minutes below Schnecksville, Doug Letterman has operated Letterman's Diner in Kutztown since 1998. Letterman hails originally from Mount Carmel, the heart of the Anthracite coal region where blue-collar workers delivered Trump 2016 wins in counties that had long been reliably Democratic.\nLetterman's customer base down toward the other end of Route 61 is not dissimilar from there, and they overwhelmingly have good things to say about the former president, he said.\nLetterman, like Frack, recalls weathering the Pennsylvania lockdowns, which saw him receive a stack of citations amid pushback from Harrisburg for trying to keep his 23-seat, streetcar-style diner, known for its heaping omelettes and Pennsylvania Dutch flair, open, he said.\nWhile former President Bill Clinton visited his borough during his re-election campaign, Letterman said it was good to see Trump come pretty close this time around. He looks back fondly on Trump's time in the Oval Office.\n\"Biden is not doing a great job. When Trump was in, Trump was doing such a great job,\" Letterman said. \"The economy was doing great. Food costs were down… the economy was so much better than it is now.\"\nHe predicted, however, that Trump will only become more popular in the key areas of the Keystone State such as his own:\n\"[His popularity] is increasing, you can tell by my customer base that it's increasing,\" Letterman said.\nPennsylvania State Sen. Jarrett Coleman, a Schnecksville-area Republican who previously served on the Parkland School Board, told Fox News Digital he hears from constituents often about the lack of optimism they have during the Biden years compared to the previous four.\n\"President Biden was recently in Lehigh County touting Bidenomics -- the funny thing about Bidenomics is if it was working the president wouldn't have to travel around the country convincing people it's working,\" Coleman said.\nThe Lehigh Valley and Schnecksville area as a whole has undergone a long-term economic shift itself, as the \"iron and coke; chromium steel\" that Billy Joel sang about in 1981's \"Allentown\" no longer emanates from the site of Bethlehem Steel.\nA casino now sits amid the rusting steelstacks, and communities like Schnecksville – which had nary a traffic light in the 1980s – see an influx of warehouses and new residential subdivisions that depict a transition within the once-agrarian region.\nColeman told Fox News Digital that the diverse, economically evolving environment, however, presents politicians with a representation of many parts of the electorate at once:\n\"It's clear by both presidential candidates coming to Lehigh County that they understand the importance of the Lehigh Valley and the importance its voters make,\" added Coleman. \"And how the Lehigh Valley is like a representative spread of the Commonwealth as a whole.\"\nColeman also suggested Trump has an \"affinity\" for Pennsylvania for many reasons, including, as he noted, sons Donald Jr. and Eric attended private school in nearby Pottstown.\n\"I believe Pennsylvania has a special place in his heart,\" he said.\nFox News Digital reached out for a comment on Trump's visit from local U.S. Rep. Susan Wild, D-Pa., but did not receive a response.",

It's also our biblical admonition. This is something that's an article of faith for us. It also happens to be great foreign policy.\"\nHe spent much of his 15-minute address also laying into President Biden and other top Democrats who have been critical of Israel in its response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. In particular, he singled out Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for calling for new elections in Israel.\n\"They're trying to dictate strategy, then they're trying to demand a change of leadership while Israel is in a battle for its very existence,\" Johnson said. \"It's breathtaking.\"\nHe also criticized Biden's foreign policy with respect to Iran, including reports the administration extended a sanctions waiver last month to pump more cash into its shaky economy. The waivers were first granted in November 2018.\n\"It's unconscionable. I can't make sense of it. And I've talked to the White House about this. I do not understand the policy. You can't make sense of it,\" Johnson said.\nThe speaker also said he confronted Schumer by phone after he called for new Israeli elections last month.\n\"I called the senator and I said, ‘What are you doing?\" Johnson said. \"What if I came out and made a statement and called for a regime change in Ukraine…your hair would be on fire.\"\nIt came just after Johnson unveiled a new plan to fund Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan in a closed-door meeting with the House GOP conference.\nUnder his proposal the House would hold separate votes on each funding priority sometime at the end of this week, likely Friday, he told reporters after the meeting.",

They only stand to exist in their own echo chambers. That's the only reason they are talking. And their obsession with Donald Trump is actually preventing them from understanding that it's not Donald Trump that's truly on trial here, it is our very democracy. Because yes, it is Donald Trump today that you will see sitting in a courtroom for this completely meritless clown show of a show trial. But the implications of this are far deeper for this country, because if in America we are able to just manipulate the law when convenient, if we allow violent criminals to go free and prosecute the innocent, if they are willing to thwart the will of the American people and try to remove our choice for president of the United States, then the fabric of this country is irreparably damaged. I want to tell everybody something out there. It is not working. The people of America spoke up yesterday in support of Donald Trump, to the tune of a million and a half dollars raised for his campaign. The average donation was $28. So even here in the abysmal Biden economy, people are coming out and they are financially supporting this president.\nFormer President Donald Trump began the second day of the hush money trial in New York City railing against the case and its \"conflicted\" judge, whom the 45th president called a \"Trump-hating judge.\"\n\"We have a Trump-hating judge. We have a judge who shouldn't be on this case. He's totally conflicted. But this is a trial that should never happen. It should have been thrown out a long time ago,\" Trump said Tuesday before heading into the courtroom, referring to Judge Juan Merchan.\n\"It's a trial that is being looked upon and looked at all over the world. … They're looking at, analyzing it. Every legal pundit, every legal scholar said this trial is a disgrace,\" he added.\nTrump arrived at court in Lower Manhattan for day two of a trial that is anticipated to last at least six weeks as he battles 34 charges of falsifying business records. Jury selection will continue Tuesday, a task that is anticipated to last at least a week.",

Also, they have no coherent strategy or platform except that they are ‘anti-Modi,'\" 25-year-old Anandh Nair from Thiruvananthapuram in the state of Kerala recently told Fox News Digital.\nModi first became prime minister in 2014. He was then re-elected for a second term in 2019.\nNair, a student, said that \"During Modi's two terms, we actually saw the standard of living rise, especially for the middle class. Another thing was, previous leaders had been ‘wishy-washy' about supporting our Hindu identity, almost as if they were ashamed of it. But for the BJP, there was no doubt that they showed pride. For most Indians, religion is an important part of everyday life.\"\nWhile Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has not yet succeeded in making inroads in some parts of the country, the main opposition Indian National Congress Party has dwindled in terms of the number of states it now holds, despite its previous dominance in Indian politics. Regardless, Modi has campaigned in the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala recently in what many viewed as a daring step, given that the party has not fared well there.\nGurdas Rao, a tour guide from Mumbai, told Fox News Digital that, \"Modi is popular among both the rich and poor. All of us have seen the quality-of-life skyrocket, so why won't we vote for him again?\".\nIndia's economic success in the face of the economic crisis following the COVID-19 pandemic was most notable when regional neighbors, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, faced major challenges as they ran out of foreign reserves. In contrast, India stayed relatively unscathed. This culminated when India came to Sri Lanka's rescue, providing much needed fuel resources during its economic crisis in 2022. Both the IMF and the World Bank also estimated that India was the fastest growing economy in 2023.\nA significant event was when the 73-year-old Modi attended the groundbreaking opening of the Ram Mandhir, a new temple in Ayodhya and described this as fulfilling \"dreams that many generations have cherished for years\". This was at the holy site believed by Hindus to be the birthplace of the legendary King Rama. MILLIONS IN INDIA CELEBRATE AS TEMPLE BUILT ON RUINS OF HISTORIC MOSQUE\nIt opened, despite much controversy surrounding the temple being built on top of a razed mosque, leaving the nation divided along religious lines. Many among the Hindu majority showed positive responses, while religious minorities seemed less satisfied.\nPrince Samuels, a Christian from Goa, told Fox News Digital that \"India is a very diverse country: we have churches, mosques and temples; all on the same street. The BJP is catering to the Hindu majority and not incorporating our religious and culture diversity into their vision of a ‘united India'. They blatantly favor one community over the others.\"\nSiddhartha Dubey, a professor of journalism based in Evanston, Illinois, said \"I think the Indian diaspora, which is largely Hindu, is keen to see India growing economically and strengthening ties with their adopted countries. Both of these are currently happening. However, generally speaking, they do not seem too bothered in the whittling down of democracy and institutions within India, and it seems that many are happy to support Mr. Modi.\"\nHe cautioned that a third Modi term will see the \"doubling down against the rights of minorities and civil society\". However, in terms of foreign relations, he said that \"U.S.-India relations are agnostic of whoever gets elected as U.S. president this year.\"\nDubey added, \"India's economy will grow and if you see the projections from big American companies, India is a key place for investment.\"\nFormer University of Delhi, Indian history professor Preeti Singh told Fox News Digital that, \"Modi's support in India transcends the differences in income levels, social categories and caste divisions. His background as a chai walla (tea vendor) has been likened to a common man much like a majority of Indians, and his rise to the top position in India personifies the aspirations of the working classes and all other Indians.\"\n\"His promise and delivery of clean politics, corruption-free government and improved infrastructure have increased his popularity cutting across all classes and categories of society.\"\nStrong foreign relations have been a cornerstone of Modi's tenure as prime minister. He has undertaken many foreign visits across the globe. Modi has also notably maintained ties with major world powers that rival one another. Singh explained, \"Modi is clearly sticking to ‘neutrality'. He wants to make it clear that India is trying to break the shackles by conveying that major players such as the U.S. and Russia have their independent value in terms of Indian foreign policy.\"\nLikewise, Modi has also maintained relationships with Israel and Iran. In contrast, India's biggest political rivals historically continue to be Pakistan and China.\nSingh also noted how India's role during the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict was \"rooted in strategic neutrality, while also condemning civilian killings that had taken place.\"\nRumela Sen, political science lecturer at Columbia University, expressed concern as to the BJP government's \"rewriting Indian history\" to fit a Hindu nationalist narrative as \"a battle for the soul of India\". She cited \"textbook revisionism on caste\" and the \"‘sanitization' of independence hero Gandhi's killer\"(Nathuram Godse) as examples.\nShe said that the BJP's actions \"undermine several institutions and rights that were hallmarks of Indian democracy.\"\n\"We almost do not notice the centralization of power in the hands of the executive, midnight arrests and legal harassment of opposition and critics and erosion of free press.\"\nWhen asked about concerns of eroding democracy and a crackdown on the opposition in India, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told journalists on Monday that, \"India is the world's largest democracy, it is an important strategic partner of the United States, and I expect that to remain true.\"\nDespite criticism, Narendra Modi has so far proven that his support-base is solidly rooted in both the domestic and foreign fronts. Also, coupled with a weak opposition and poll results, all indicators suggest that Modi will most probably be re-elected for a third term.\nResults of the 44-day-long process will be known on June 4.",

            "summary": "Critics of President Biden slammed him on social media for making a puzzling statement encouraging voters to \"choose freedom over democracy\" by re-electing him to the presidency.\nConservatives expressed confusion over Biden's message, and others insisted it was yet another gaffe showing his cognitive decline.\nBiden made the claim while accepting the formal presidential endorsement of the Kennedy family in Pennsylvania on Thursday. During the political rally, half a dozen Kennedy family members appeared alongside President Biden to publicly back him over Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who is running as an independent candidate for president in 2024.\nKennedy Jr.'s own sister Kerry Kennedy spoke at the event, stating, \"President Biden has been a champion for all the rights and freedoms that my father and uncles stood for.\"\nAfter being introduced by the Kennedys, Biden addressed the crowd. Towards the end of his speech, he asked \"Are you ready to choose unity over division? Dignity over demolition? Truth over lies? Are you ready to choose freedom over democracy? Because that's America.\"\nThe last stanza turned heads with its seemingly contradictory message.\nAuthor and Canary CEO Dan K. Eberhart commented, \"He's fine. Everything's fine. Biden is definitely not in severe mental decline. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.\"\nCommentator Ian Miles Cheong appeared confused by Biden's statement, posting, \"What did he mean by this?\"\nConservative journalist Nick Sortor also asked, \"What the hell is this guy saying?\"\nJournalist Marlo Nawfal posted, \"Dems really need to upgrade his [operating system] or something...\"\nConservative political influencer \"Bad Hombre\" remarked, \"Biden says he wants you to ‘choose freedom OVER democracy.' Joe's DOJ, state prosecutors, and Secretaries of State have been working tirelessly to get rid of democracy. Just another Freudian slip.\"\nThe account for outlet \"The Conservative Brief\" posted about the gaffe, stating, \"When people were concerned about Ronald Reagan having cognitive decline near the end of his second term, it was nothing like this. When Dan Quayle couldn't spell 'potato' correctly, people lost their minds. But it was nothing like this. When George W. Bush was in the Oval Office, and people said Dick Cheney was running the country because he couldn't, it was nothing like this.\n\"Look in the mirror and ask yourself, truthfully, if this is the man you want in charge of our security, our economy, and our country for another four years?\" the post added.\nConservative podcast host Rob Coates urged voters, \"Dear lord, get this man out of office!\"",

The office did not respond to Fox News Digital's multiple requests for comment on Tuesday.\n\"We've arrived in Shenzen, where I've had the opportunity to start meeting with business leaders & city officials to build stronger connections with San Francisco,\" Breed said in a post on X Monday evening, hours after protesters had blocked the Golden Gate Bridge. \"Thank you to Shenzen Mayor Qin Weizhong for welcoming us as we start our trip to strengthen ties between our cities.\"\nBreed is expected to be in China for the rest of the week, according to China-run media outlet CGTN.\nBreed said Monday she gathered with leaders from China's tourism industry \"to highlight San Francisco's vibrant arts and restaurant scene, new attractions like Tunnel Top Park and the Sky Wheel, and iconic sites.\"\n\"This is how we build bridges,\" she said. \"This work matters. In 2023, visitor spending from China reached over $630 million, taking back the top spot for the first time since pre-pandemic. This is how we lift our entire economy, create jobs, support small businesses, and deliver revenue that provides services across SF.\"\nPrior to the trip, Breed told NBC a few of her goals were to bring pandas back to the San Francisco Zoo, create stronger relationships with Chinese officials to boost tourism and put San Francisco businesses on the radar.\n\"Our goal is to enter into major agreements and make San Francisco significant to China and to let them know that we are open to the business relationship that could be developed as a result,\" Breed told the station.\nMeanwhile, the California Highway Patrol's (CHP's) Golden Gate Division said Tuesday 38 people have been arrested following Monday's incidents, in which demonstrators held up a banner with the message \"Stop the world for Gaza\" and attached themselves to 55-gallon drums filled with concrete.\nOfficials say the protesters are now facing numerous charges including unlawful assembly, resisting and delaying officers and false imprisonment.\n\"Attempting to block or shut down a freeway or state highway to protest is unlawful, dangerous, and prevents motorists from safely reaching their destinations,\" the CHP said in a statement.\nIn the Golden Gate Bridge protest that blocked the southbound lane, \"Officers had to contend with numerous vehicles utilizing chains concealed with pipes, connecting the drivers and passengers outside the vehicle,\" the CHP says.\nA total of 26 people were arrested in that protest.",

            "summary": "Former President Trump on Thursday demanded that Europe do more to help Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia, saying the U.S. has played too big a role.\nIn a post on his Truth Social account, the Republican frontrunner questioned why the U.S. – despite having an ocean between it and Ukraine – was giving more money than Europe.\n\"Why can't Europe equalize or match the money put in by the United States of America in order to help a country in desperate need?\" Trump asked.\nHe clarified that Ukraine's \"survival and strength\" was important to the U.S. but that it should be of greater concern to Europe.\n\"GET MOVING EUROPE!\" Trump said. \"In addition, I am the only one who speaks for ‘ME' and, while it is a total mess caused by Crooked Joe Biden and the Incompetent Democrats, if I were President, this War would have never started!\"\nRussia invaded Ukraine in late February 2022. In the immediate months following, Ukraine saw widespread support from Western allies. But that support has waned as the war drags on with no clear victory in sight.\nPer the Institute for the World Economy, Europe has a slight edge over the United States in terms of financial and humanitarian aid, but the U.S. has provided significantly more military aid.\nIt found that Europe would have to double its current level and pace of arms assistance to keep pace with the U.S.\nHouse Republicans are divided over a $95 billion foreign aid bill that the Senate passed in February. That legislation provides funding for Ukraine, Israel and other allies, as well as humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza and Ukraine. It also provides replenishment cash for the U.S. military to replace weapons sent to Ukraine.\nPresident Biden has urged Congress to pass the aid, saying that besides critical support to Israel and Ukraine, it would offer \"desperately needed humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza.\" He said he would sign the funding package right away, sending a message that \"we won't let Iran or Russia succeed.\"\nPentagon leaders reiterated that urgency during a hearing with House appropriators on Wednesday, calling the situation in Ukraine dire.\n\"Whether it's munitions, whether it's vehicles, whether it's platforms, Ukraine is being outmatched by the Russians,\" Gen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. \"I'll just tell you that Ukraine right now is facing some dire battlefield conditions.\"\nMeanwhile, top NATO and European Union officials on Thursday urged foreign ministers from leading industrialized nations to take quick, concrete steps to provide more air defense systems and artillery to Ukraine, warning that continued delays could tilt the war in Moscow's favor.",

            "summary": "The oft-repeated claim by Republican politicians, \"Every state is a border state,\" appears to be resonating with voters across the country and notably in states that are thousands of miles away from the U.S. southern border.\n\"Every state became a border state when President Biden took office and immediately reversed commonsense policies that protected our borders,\" Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, told Fox News Digital in a statement.\nImmigration surpassed all other issues in a poll by Gallup in February, as more Americans agreed it was \"the most important problem facing this country today.\" The number of respondents to say so jumped eight points from January, to 28%. The previous issue cited as most important by Americans was \"government,\" followed by immigration, inflation and the economy in general. While immigration concerns managed to climb, government, inflation and economic worries remained relatively steady.\nThe issue ranked as the most important for the first time since 2019, prior to President Biden taking office and during former President Trump's administration. This was the year Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border following congressional refusal to grant him requested funds for border wall construction.\n\"The federal government's inaction at our nation's borders has led to a crisis with direct impacts upon all fifty states,\" New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu told Fox News Digital in a statement.\nIn the state, which is more than 2,000 miles from the U.S. southern border, 83% of residents said they consider illegal immigration a serious issue for the country. Among those residents, 58% said it is \"very serious,\" according to a March University of New Hampshire Survey Center (UNHSC) poll.\nAndrew Smith, director of the UNHSC, noted that the percentage of those who agree that illegal immigration is a \"very serious\" issue nationally has remained steady for more than a decade.\nJulie Kirchner, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), told Fox News Digital in a statement, \"Americans are not only seeing total chaos at the borders, where foreign nationals are literally tearing down barriers and assaulting border agents, they are witnessing first-hand how the crisis impacts every aspect of society.\"\nAt the same time, the March polling revealed that support for the construction of a border wall has surged since 2017, when opposition among New Hampshire residents was at more than half. Now, 52% in the state are in favor of the border wall, while 39% are against it.\n\"Every state, including New Hampshire, has experienced firsthand the economic and emotional toll associated with the federal government's failed response,\" said Sununu.\nReynolds claimed, \"It's clear to Iowans, and the American people, that the only way this chaos and crisis at the border can be fixed is at the ballot box,\" crediting Biden with the widespread effects of illegal immigration.\nDemocratic strategist Eric Koch pushed back on the idea the surging concern over immigration is Biden's fault, however. He noted that Republicans and Democrats in the Senate had been negotiating a border package \"that President Biden said he would have signed.\" The deal was ultimately sunk after former President Trump came out against it and Republican lawmakers followed suit.\n\"Trump and Republicans don't actually want to solve problems and walking away from the bipartisan border deal only confirms that,\" Koch added.\nA White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement, \"The Administration spent months negotiating in good faith to deliver the toughest and fairest bipartisan border security bill in decades because we need Congress to make significant policy reforms and to provide additional funding to secure our border and fix our broken immigration system.\"\nThe statement accused Republicans of placing \"partisan politics ahead of our national security\" in rejecting the border deal.\n\"Even without significant action from Congress, DHS is maximizing its enforcement operations,\" the spokesperson said.\nIn South Carolina's recent Republican presidential primary, 37% of voters pointed to immigration as the issue that was of the most significance to them ahead of casting their vote, according to a Reuters exit poll.\nThe economy came in second at 33% in the state, which is similarly more than 1,000 miles from the southern border.\n\"Every state is a border state because the Biden administration policies are to allow hundreds of thousands of aliens to illegally enter the United States and then be transported by federally funded NGO's to wherever they choose,\" said James Massa, CEO of NumbersUSA.\n\"A reason those non-border state voters are so focused on this is because of the right-wing media obsession with the issue,\" claimed Democratic strategist Kaivan Shroff, who chalked some of the concern up to a tactic to rally the Republican base.\n\"The irony here is Biden and Democrats have put forth a bipartisan border deal that would address many of the cited concerns Republicans have been focused on, and the deal was killed because of Trump,\" he added, echoing both the White House and fellow strategist Koch.\nAs Massa pointed out, non-governmental organizations are involved in the transportation of illegal immigrants to various locations within the U.S., and many of these NGOs also receive federal reimbursement and advance payments from the Department of Homeland Security for providing shelter or other eligible services to migrants released by DHS.\n\"The border crisis is funded with taxpayer dollars, regardless of state,\" he claimed.\nHe further said that illegal immigrants are choosing to travel further into the U.S. once being paroled by DHS, opting to settle in states \"that have sanctuary policies and/or benefit programs.\"\nIllegal immigrants have also been transported by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's administration to locations that have touted \"sanctuary\" policies for illegal immigrants, which some have pointed to as a trigger for concerns about the border across the country.\n\"Since launching the border transportation mission in April 2022, Texas has transported over 112,000 migrants to self-declared sanctuary cities to provide much-needed relief to our overrun and overwhelmed border communities as the Biden administration leaves thousands of migrants in Texas border towns,\" said Renae Eze, Abbott spokesperson.\nRepublican strategist Doug Heye noted that \"complaints from Democratic politicians that they can't handle this crisis on their own\" lend some credence to the claim that every state is now effectively a border state.\nLeaders of cities such as Chicago and New York, among others, have been overwhelmed by the illegal immigrants pouring in, prompting them to request assistance from Biden and the White House and plead with Abbott to halt his busing program.\n\"The sheer hypocrisy of these Democrat mayors knows no bounds, going to extreme lengths to avoid fulfilling their self-declared sanctuary city promises, yet they remain silent as President Biden transports migrants all around the country and oftentimes in the cover of night,\" added Eze.\nIowa GOP strategist David Kochel suggested the \"squealing of [Democratic] mayors … is definitely related to the busing.\"",

            "summary": "The Israeli consul general called for the Iranian regime to be \"toppled\" following the regime's drone attack targeting the Jewish state over the weekend, demanding its allies isolate the country as it wreaks havoc on the Middle East.\nIsrael Bachar addressed the Israeli response to the attack during \"Fox & Friends,\" demanding the Iranian leadership be eradicated as it weighs a possible counteroffensive. He also argued leadership must be punished through sanctions and the designation of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terror organization.\n\"It's a stain on Western democracies. It's an anti-human, tyrannical regime who destabilized the region from its first day,\" Bachar said on Monday. \"It goes against American interests, against Western interests, and against Israel. So we need to come together over the war to make sure that we are isolating Iran by reinstating crippling sanction[s]… [and] strengthening the Israeli-American and moderate Arabs alliance.\"\n\"And third, it's about time that we are going to name the Revolutionary Guard of Iran as a terrorist organization. That's what we need to do,\" he continued. \"All of us together right now, and it's time. It's time to stop the hypocrisy on the world stage... Which is dealing with Iran, on a democratic level or in... any conversation with them. I think this regime must be toppled and sooner is better.\"\nIran launched more than 300 drones and missiles directly at Israel on Saturday, and although only a handful of them crossed into Israel, the Jewish state is now contemplating a response. Israeli media claims there are key disagreements about the timing and scope of a possible counterattack between high-level officials, Trey Yingst reported.\nBiden reportedly told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the U.S. would not partake in or necessarily even support a counterattack on Iran during a call after the attack.\n\"We, the Israeli[s] believe that if we need to attack, we need to do it by ourself,\" Bachar said in response. \"And we never ask any other country to do it for us, but what we do need is the diplomatic, international clout, and definitely America has the power to give us this kind of a clout.\"\n\"The world needs to understand and decide whether it wants to go with the Chamberlain approach or the with the Churchillian decision [on] what to do against Iran. So Israel is going to do what we need to do in the end of the day, and we're going to decide the time and the scope.\"\nMeanwhile, Fox News Digital reported last month that Biden defied opponents of Iran's regime and waived sanctions on Iran's cash-starved economy. Biden faced criticism after releasing as much as $10 billion into the coffers of the Islamic Republic. In January, an Iranian regime-sponsored proxy terrorist attack killed three U.S. soldiers in Jordan.\nThe Biden administration insisted that Iran's regime can't use the funds for its growing military offensive arsenal. Critics argue that the $10 billion is fungible money and the financial allocation allows Iran to revise its budget to expand its military apparatus.",

            "excerpt": "Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba cited Israel's success in thwarting an Iranian missile and drone attack, crediting support from allies like the U.S. and Britain.",
            "summary": "The success of Israel and its allies in largely thwarting a massive Iranian missile and drone attack shows what Ukraine could achieve against Russian aerial barrages if it had more support from its partners, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Monday.\nA recent Russian aerial campaign targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure and other targets has wrought extensive damage, and Ukrainian officials have pleaded with the country's Western allies to provide more air defense systems as the war stretches into its third year.\nIsrael's defense system, with assistance from the U.S. and Britain — countries that are also supporting Ukraine's war effort — is credited with preventing serious damage or casualties in Sunday's attack by Iran using more than 300 drones and missiles.\nKuleba, speaking to reporters in Kyiv, urged Ukraine's allies to \"give us what we need and we will do the rest of the job.\"\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made the same point late Sunday, referring to the Iranian attack. \"The whole world sees what real defense is. It sees that it is feasible,\" he wrote on Telegram.\nRussia last week fired nearly 130 exploding drones, more than 80 Russian missiles and nearly 700 guided aerial bombs at Ukraine, Zelenskyy said Sunday on the social platform X. He has pleaded with allies to send more Patriot systems.\nHowever, the Institute for the Study of War noted there are key differences between the challenges faced by Israel and by Ukraine.\n\"Russian forces launch drones and missiles from throughout occupied Ukraine and in close proximity to Ukraine from within Russia, affording Ukrainian air defenders a fraction of the time that Israel and its allies leveraged to successfully blunt the mass Iranian missile and drone strike,\" the Washington think tank said in an assessment late Sunday.\nThe scale and improved accuracy of recent Russian attacks have unnerved Ukraine's defenders. They say Kremlin forces now have better intelligence and fresh tactics in their campaign to destroy Ukraine's power grid and crush its economy. Moscow has also apparently learned how to exploit gaps in air defenses across the huge country.\nThat development has added to Ukraine's problems, as the Kremlin's forces seize the battlefield advantage. At the same time, Ukraine is struggling with shortages of ammunition and troops. Ukraine's military chief on Saturday warned that the battlefield situation in the industrial east has recently significantly worsened.\nA crucial hurdle to receiving more air defense supplies is the hold-up in Washington of House approval for a U.S. aid package that includes roughly $60 billion for Ukraine. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Sunday he will try to move the package forward this week.\n\"The exhaustion of U.S.-provided air defenses resulting from delays in the resumption of U.S. military assistance to Ukraine combined with improvements in Russian strike tactics have led to increasing effectiveness of the Russian strike campaign in Ukraine,\" the Institute for the Study of War said.",

            "summary": "Former NBC \"Today\" show host Katie Couric continued to receive backlash Tuesday after a diatribe against the purported ignorance of supporters of former President Trump that one critic compared to Hillary Clinton's infamous 2016 \"deplorables\" remarks.\nCouric told liberal comic Bill Maher on his \"Club Random\" podcast that \"socioeconomic disparities\" and \"class resentment\" along with \"anti-intellectualism and -elitism\" is driving the populist, anti-establishment bent of Trump's supporters.\nCouric suggested the United States' economic transition from industrial to technological has caused jealousy as well as a \"corroding, bitter, almost bile feeling.\"\nOn \"Outnumbered,\" co-host Harris Faulkner compared Couric's comments to those of Clinton, who told a New York City crowd while running against Trump in 2016 that half of such supporters of the Republican nominee can be categorized in a \"basket of deplorables.\"\nClinton's remark received criticism and has been credited as one of the turning points in the campaign that led to Trump's upset victory.\n\"Not only are they out-of-touch, and look, Katie Couric used to be a great journalist … I'm not really sure what lane she's in now, but it sounded like what she wanted to say was ‘basket of deplorables,'\" Faulkner said.\nFox News contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier said the sight of Maher and Couric sitting in armchairs discussing such a topic was \"rather cringeworthy\" and that in a way, even with her own doctorate degree and place on the socioeconomic spectrum described by Couric, she, too, was offended by the ex-\"Today\" anchor.\n\"I don't even know what she's talking about at this point, and so I can't imagine what other people were feeling as well. And at the end of the day, yes, those who have higher socioeconomic stature, you know, they're not feeling the effects of the White House right now and the economics that are going on, the crime in their streets, in their neighborhoods and the cost of things at the grocery store,\" she said.\n\"She's talking down on all these people who are actually suffering, and she just seems so out-of-touch with the American people, which kind of is what's been going on with the White House, the entire administration.\"\nSaphier quipped that Couric might want to seek White House employment.\n\"Outnumbered's\" \"One Lucky Guy\" on Tuesday, talk show host Ben Ferguson, echoed much of his co-panelists' sentiments, saying it reminded him of media figures assessing the need for \"deprogramming\" of Trump voters.\n\"It was like a coordinated effort by the left to say, ‘Hey, we need to deprogram all these crazies.' I love this type of rhetoric from them because it goes back to the simple issue, ‘It's the economy, stupid,'\" Ferguson said, quoting former Bill Clinton strategist James Carville's winning message from the 1992 presidential sweeps.\n\"If people are suffering and this is your response to that, that anyone that disagrees with you is somehow ignorant or stupid or dumb, then I think people are going to show up and vote to say, 'No, I'm actually concerned about providing for my family.'\"\nFerguson also noted the average American worker doesn't have \"Katie Couric money,\" which according to recent reports is upwards of $110 million.",

            "excerpt": "Prominent Kennedy family member Kerry Kennedy's interview on CNN was derailed by an anti-Biden protester unleashing blood-curdling screams.",
            "summary": "An interview with a prominent Kennedy family member was derailed by an anti-Biden protester on Thursday with blood-curdling screams.\nSpeaking with liberal outlet CNN ahead of her family offering its endorsement of President Biden in Philadelphia, Kerry Kennedy — the sister of independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — was overshadowed by a male protester yelling unintelligibly immediately behind her.\nThe protester appeared only briefly in CNN's shot of the interview, but video posted on X by a reporter from another outlet captured the man standing behind Kennedy screaming that he has rights and was allowed to be at the event before being physically removed. It was not immediately clear what the man was protesting about.\nFollowing the outburst, the Kennedy family, led by Kerry Kennedy, officially endorsed Biden's re-election bid. The endorsement came as a snub to RFK Jr., who they say is acting as a \"spoiler\" to Biden's re-election chances and could lead to a victory for former President Donald Trump in November.\nRFK Jr. reacted to the endorsement in a post on X, praising his family, but also noting that other family members were supportive of and working for his campaign.\n\"I hear some of my family will be endorsing President Biden today. I am pleased they are politically active — it's a family tradition. We are divided in our opinions but united in our love for each other,\" he wrote. \"I hold this as a possibility for America, too. Can we disagree without hating our opponents? Can we restore civility and respect to public discourse? I think we can.\"\n\"My campaign, which many of my family members are working on and supportive of, is about healing America — healing our economy, our chronic disease crisis, our middle class, our environment, and our standing in the world as a peaceful nation. But this will only happen if we heal our national conversation, and move from rage and fear into love and respect,\" he added.\nLast month, the Democratic National Committee launched an effort to silence the threat to Biden's re-election from third-party candidates, namely Kennedy, in the form of a team that is expected to actively combat them with legal challenges and opposition research.\nSince its inception, members of the team have posted near-constant criticism of RFK Jr. on social media and have frequently referred to him as a \"spoiler\" candidate. They have also claimed that Kennedy is in cahoots with Trump in order to help him win.\nEarlier this month, the DNC accused RFK Jr.'s campaign of acknowledging its role as a \"spoiler\" after a woman associated with the campaign was captured on video discussing campaign strategy and how Trump could win the state of New York with the independent candidate on the ballot in November.\nAccording to video reviewed by Fox News Digital, a self-identified Kennedy campaign staffer told a room of Republicans in New York that the only way Trump could win the traditionally Democrat state in November was with Kennedy on the ballot.\n\"If it's Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\" the staffer said.",

            "summary": "President Biden officially launched the so-called American Climate Corps, a program that is slated to \"mobilize\" tens of thousands of Americans for conservation and eco-friendly projects nationwide.\nThe president's actions on the work program come on Earth Day and are part of broader actions the White House unveiled Monday to commemorate Earth Day. In addition to the American Climate Corps announcement, the White House touted recent regulations blocking off 13 million acres of federal land from future oil drilling and revealed $7 billion in grants for mainly state-level solar projects.\n\"Here's the bottom line: President Biden laid out the most ambitious land and water conservation agenda in American history,\" White House Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory told reporters during a call about the administration's Earth Day actions. \"And he is delivering, already cementing a legacy as one of the nation's strongest conservation presidents.\"\n\"The groundbreaking corps represents, yet again, a way to make accessible the economic opportunity and upside that comes with tackling the climate crisis,\" added White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi. \"So, for young people of all backgrounds, no matter their qualification, no matter their zip code, there will now be pathways and positions that they can fill that help them gain the skills to succeed in the clean energy economy.\"\nOverall, the American Climate Corps will consist of 20,000 Americans who will work in a variety of roles combating climate change. The positions generally don't require previous experience and will be geared towards conservation, green energy and environmental justice work.\nOn Monday, the White House launched a new website for interested workers to apply for such roles. The site is expected to soon list 2,000 positions – such as field coordinator, forestry technician, hydrologic technician, and land conservation crew member – located across 36 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico.\nThe White House said the overarching goal of the corps is to make it easy for any American to \"find work tackling the climate crisis while gaining the skills necessary for the clean energy and climate resilience workforce of the future.\" It added the first class of the American Climate Corps will be deployed in June 2024.\n\"From day one, the President has seen the urgency of taking action on climate not just because of the situation it creates in our communities, represented in wildfires and floods and hurricanes, but also a profound sense of urgency to get American workers back in the game competing for the jobs of the future,\" a senior administration official told reporters.\nBiden first took executive action to begin forming the government work program in September after facing pressure from progressives and environmental groups who had called for such an action. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., the two architects of the Green New Deal, had led such calls among Democratic lawmakers.\nAccording to a senior administration official, ahead of the announcement Monday, the White House held listening sessions with Markey and Ocasio-Cortez to hear from Americans interested in the program.\nBut the program has faced heavy criticism from Republicans who have argued congressional action is needed to move forward with it.\nIn an October letter, Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., and Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, expressed concern that it is unclear where funding for the program would be coming from.\n\"Unlike the Civilian Conservation Corps, which was implemented by President Roosevelt in response to an authorization in a law passed by Congress, the announcement of the program does not reference any legal authority giving rise to the program,\" they wrote.\nTogether, Comer and Sessions are spearheading an oversight investigation of the program.",

            "excerpt": "The World Bank reports half of the world's poorest countries are getting poorer as the income gap between them and the world's richest countries grows for the first time this century.",
            "summary": "Half of the world's 75 poorest countries are experiencing a widening income gap with the wealthiest economies for the first time this century in a historical reversal of development, the World Bank said in a report on Monday.\nThe differential between per capita income growth in the poorest countries and the richest has widened over the past five years, according to the report.\n\"For the first time, we see there is no convergence. They're getting poorer,\" Ayhan Kose, deputy chief economist for the World Bank and one of the report's authors, told Reuters.\n\"We see a very serious structural regression, a reversal in the world ... that's why we are ringing the alarm bells here,\" he said.\nThe report said the 75 countries eligible for grants and zero-interest loans from the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA) risk a lost decade of development without ambitious policy shifts and significant international aid.\nKose said growth in many IDA countries had already begun to taper off before the COVID-19 pandemic, but it would be just 3.4% in 2020-2024, the weakest half-decade of growth since the early 1990s. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, climate change, increases in violence and conflict also weighed heavily on their prospects.\nMore than half of all IDA countries are in Sub-Saharan Africa; 14 are in East Asia and eight are in Latin America and the Caribbean. Thirty-one have per capita incomes of less than $1,315 a year. They include the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan and Haiti.\nOne in three IDA countries is poorer now than on the eve of the pandemic. IDA countries account for 92% of the world's people who lack access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food. Half of the countries are in debt distress, meaning they are unable to service debt or are at high risk of not being able to.\nAnd despite their young populations - a demographic boon at a time when populations were aging nearly everywhere else, rich natural resources and abundant solar-energy potential, private and government creditors had been backing away from them.\nU.S. Treasury Undersecretary Jay Shambaugh raised concerns about the worsening situation last week, warning China and other emerging official creditors against free-riding by curtailing loans to low-income countries just as the IMF or multilateral development banks were pouring funds in.\nAlmost 40 countries saw external public debt outflows in 2022, and the flows likely worsened in 2023, he said.\nKose said ambitious policies were needed to accelerate investment, including domestic efforts to strengthen fiscal, monetary and financial policies, and structural reforms to improve education and increase domestic revenues.\nSignificant financial support from the global community was also essential to make progress and lower the risk of protracted stagnation, Kose said, noting that the World Bank hoped to drum up a robust replenishment of IDA funds by December.\nStronger international coordination on climate change, debt restructurings and measures supporting cross-border trade would also be crucial, it said.\nIndermit Gill, World Bank chief economist, noted that China, India and South Korea - now major economic powerhouses - had once been among the world's poorest countries, but were able to tackle extreme poverty and raise living standards.\n\"The world cannot afford to turn its back on IDA countries,\" he said.",

            "summary": "A U.S. official reportedly laughed off a Politico columnist's question about what exactly President Biden's strategy for Iran is following its missile and drone attack on Israel.\n\"You know, a lot of people inside the administration ask that same question. Sometimes they ask it on the first day. Sometimes they ask it six months later,\" the official reportedly told Politico's foreign affairs correspondent Nahal Toosi after her question was met with laughter.\nToosi included the exchange in a column published Tuesday and asserted that Biden doesn't have a strategy for handling Iran. The Middle Eastern nation on Saturday launched hundreds of missiles and drones against Israel, which was largely protected by its air defense system, along with help from allies including the U.S.\nShe also said Biden's aides have tried to keep the Iran issue off the president's desk.\n\"The strategy is to keep it on low boil on all fronts — nuclear, regional, whatever. That's been the approach for some time now,\" another U.S. official told Toosi.\n\"He believes Iran is a problem, but doesn't appear to have a coherent plan for how to solve it,\" the columnist wrote.\nToosi wrote that the Biden administration was managing the issues around Iran, but \"not trying to solve it.\" She noted Biden has mostly kept former President Trump's sanctions on Iran, but that the sanctions had not \"hurt Iran enough\" to change its behavior.\nThe attack on Israel has put a spotlight on Iran's nuclear capabilities, as it is dangerously close to securing a nuclear bomb. It is also responsible for unrest in the region, as Tehran backs multiple terrorist groups, including Iraq's Kata'ib Hezbollah, Yemen's Houthi rebels, Lebanon's Hezbollah and the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas.\nToosi acknowledged that it was an \"undeniably hard problem,\" and said Biden had been pursuing a \"regional integration\" plan in the Middle East, which seeks to connect Israel with other Arab states, as well as India, economically and diplomatically.\nToosi suggested this was not likely to succeed.\n\"The U.S. hopes to see Saudi Arabia and Israel establish diplomatic relations, Washington and Riyadh enter a security pact, and Israel agree to a pathway for a Palestinian state,\" she wrote. \"These pieces all depend on the others, and the people pushing them might as well buy a lottery ticket.\"\n\"The Middle East is too fractured and complicated for the United States to hope that a regional integration strategy might some day, maybe, lead to a fundamental change in Iran,\" Toosi concluded.\nNational Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson pointed Fox News Digitial to the statement provided to Politico.\n\"We focus on actually degrading Iran's capabilities, while strengthening those of our partners and allies. Iran's economy is in the tank, with the Rial at an all time low,\" she said. \"Its vaunted missile program did more damage in Iran through failure than in Israel.\"\n\"Containing and degrading Iran while strengthening the capacity and integration of American partners takes hard work and persistence,\" Watson continued. \"Saturday was a test, and it worked.\"\nOn Tuesday, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan announced the U.S. would impose new sanctions on Iran, \"including its missile and drone program as well as new sanctions against entities supporting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Iran's Defense Ministry.\"\nSullivan added that the actions the U.S. is taking will \"continue a steady drumbeat of pressure to contain and degrade Iran's military capacity and effectiveness and confront the full range of its problematic behaviors.\"",

            "summary": "Greece aims to create two large marine parks as part of an $830 million program to protect biodiversity and marine ecosystems, with the plans to be formally announced at an international oceans conference starting in Athens Tuesday.\nBut the plan has irked Greece's neighbor and regional rival, Turkey, while environmental organizations say the initiative doesn't go far enough, noting that the country also allows environmentally harmful practices such as energy exploration in sensitive marine environments.\n\"We are increasing the size of our marine protected areas by 80%, banning harmful fishing practices and using new technologies to monitor and enforce the commitments we make here,\" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said ahead of the conference.\nThe two-day international meeting being held in Athens aims \"to catalyze global action against two overlapping crises, the climate crisis and the crisis of our ocean,\" Mitsotakis said. \"Countries have come with specific proposals to take decisive action.\"\nWith thousands of islands and islets and one of the longest coastlines in the Mediterranean, Greece has said it will create one new marine park in the Ionian Sea and one in the Aegean Sea, bringing the total area of marine protected areas to over 30% of its waters.\nBut environmental organizations have called for stronger commitments to environmental protection.\nUnder a slogan of \"The sea is not for sale,\" Greenpeace urged leaders attending the Our Ocean Conference in Athens to take concrete measures to protect the world's marine environment.\nThe conference \"must not be simply an opportunity for governments to congratulate themselves for what they have said until now,\" said Nikos Charalambidis, head of Greenpeace in Greece. \"On the contrary, this must be where serious steps and action plans are presented to prevent the looting of our seas.\"\nGreenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund and other organizations have leveled particular criticism at Greece for allowing deep-sea seismic exploration for energy and mineral resources in the Hellenic Trench, which includes the deepest waters in the Mediterranean at more than 5,200 meters (17,300 feet).\nThe trench, which stretches from southwestern Greece to Crete, is a vital habitat for the Mediterranean's few hundred sperm whales and for other marine mammals already threatened by fishing, ship collisions and plastic pollution.\nAsked whether the Greek government planned to extend protection to the entirety of the Hellenic Trench, Theodoros Skylakakis, Greece's minister for both the environment and energy, stressed that adapting to a green economy requires significant funds over the coming decades.\n\"We need to be a lot more efficient in everything we do. And not trigger our reaction by ideology but rather trigger it by science, by efficiency and by investment,\" Skylakakis said. \"And for that, we will need money. If anybody thinks we can meet this challenge of paying for the adaptation … and at the same time don't have economic growth, they don't live in this world.\"\nGreece's plan for the two marine parks has also irked its neighbor and regional rival Turkey. When the plan was initially aired last week, Turkey's foreign ministry accused Athens of exploiting environmental issues to push its geopolitical agenda. The two countries, both NATO members, have been at odds for decades over a series of issues, including territorial claims in the Aegean, and have reached the brink of war three times in the last 50 years.\nRelations have improved somewhat over the past year following a period of heightened tensions that saw the two countries' warships facing off in the eastern Mediterranean. But Ankara responded with annoyance to the plan for a marine park in the Agean.\n\"It is known that Greece has long been trying to benefit from almost every platform in the context of Aegean problems,\" the Turkish Foreign Ministry said. \"Despite the recent softening in our relations, it appears that Greece is exploiting environmental issues this time.\"\nGreece's foreign ministry retorted that Ankara was \"politicizing a clearly environmental issue.\"",

            "summary": "Controversial videos of Katherine Maher discussing her views on \"the truth\" and the First Amendment have resurfaced as the new NPR CEO continues to face online backlash and scrutiny.\nAt the Atlantic Council's 360/Open Summit in June 2021, Maher, then the CEO of Wikimedia which oversees Wikipedia, discussed efforts to push back against disinformation and the \"challenge\" of the First Amendment. She took over at NPR last month.\n\"The number one challenge here that we see is, of course, the First Amendment in the United States. [It] is a fairly robust protection of rights and that is a protection of rights both for platforms, which I actually think is very important that platforms have those rights to be able to regulate what kind of content they want on their sites,\" Maher said.\nShe added, \"But it also means that it is a little bit tricky to really address some of the real challenges of where does bad information come from, and sort of the influence peddlers who have made a real market economy around it.\"\nShe remarked how Wikipedia took an \"active approach to disinformation and misinformation\" in response to the coronavirus pandemic and the 2020 election, though she noted that Wikipedia publishers are \"primarily men\" with \"significant gaps\" of knowledge in content about women and marginalized groups.\nAnother resurfaced video from an August 2021 TED Talk featured Maher discussing how Wikipedia teaches \"balancing truth and beliefs.\" She said trust in the website had increased during a time when public trust in institutions had collapsed. She argued Wikipedia's model worked well, especially in debates over politics or religion.\n\"In our normal lives, these contentious conversations tend to erupt over a disagreement about what the truth actually is. But the people who write these [Wikipedia] articles, they're not focused on the truth. They're focused on something else, which is the best of what we can know right now,\" Maher said.\n\"That perhaps, for our most tricky disagreements, seeking the truth and seeking to convince others of the truth might not be the right place to start. In fact, our reverence for the truth might be a distraction that's getting in the way of finding common ground and getting things done,\" she continued.\nMaher insisted that her view doesn't mean the truth \"doesn't exist\" or \"isn't important\" but emphasized the existence of \"many different truths.\"\n\"And so, in the spirit of that, I'm certain that the truth exists for you and probably for the person sitting next to you. But this may not be the same truth. This is because the truth of the matter is very often, for many people, what happens when we merge facts about the world with our beliefs about the world. So we all have different truths,\" she said.\nNPR defended Maher against \"online actors with explicit agendas\" on Wednesday as her old social media posts continue to go viral for exposing her personal left-wing ideology.\nIn a 2020 post, Maher is seen donning a Biden for President hat and saying it was the \"best part\" of her \"get out the vote\" efforts. In another post, she wrote that while \"looting is counterproductive,\" it is \"hard to be mad about protests not prioritizing the private property of a system of oppression founded on treating people's ancestors as private property.\"\nMaher's political views came out after longtime NPR editor Uri Berliner published a bombshell report blowing the whistle on liberal bias at the organization. After he received a 5-day suspension, Berliner announced his resignation on Wednesday.\n\"I am resigning from NPR, a great American institution where I have worked for 25 years. I don't support calls to defund NPR. I respect the integrity of my colleagues and wish for NPR to thrive and do important journalism. But I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new CEO whose divisive views confirm the very problems at NPR I cited in my Free Press essay,\" Berliner wrote in a statement, referring to Maher.",

            "summary": "FIRST ON FOX: Dueling candidates in the heated Montana Senate race have reported both raising millions in the first fundraising quarter of the 2024 Big Sky State battle - one that could determine party control of the chamber this fall.\nFormer Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, a Republican running to unseat Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., in November, touted his campaign's \"incredible momentum\" after bringing in over $3 million for his Senate campaign in the first fundraising quarter of 2024.\nThe funds, shared first with Fox News Digital, include $2.6 million that came from fundraising, with an additional $500k loaned to the campaign from Sheehy himself.\n\"We are humbled by the incredible momentum and support we're seeing across the state. We have been under a relentless assault with millions being spent on attack ads against us. Chuck Schumer, Jon Tester, and their liberal allies are now smearing a combat veteran because they know the hard truth: They are losing this race,\" Sheehy told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\"Montanans are rallying around a political outsider who will deliver common sense solutions like rebuilding a strong economy with low-inflation, creating more high-paying jobs, securing our border and ending reckless spending,\" the former Navy SEAL said. \"Come November, with the help of my fellow Montanans, we will finally retire Jon Tester and Joe Biden.\"\nTester reported raising $8 million in the first quarter of 2024, setting a new record for first quarter fundraising in a Montana Senate race. The Senator, who is seeking a third term, received donations from individuals in all 56 counties in Montana.\n\"This record-breaking grassroots support shows that Montanans are fired up to send the seven-fingered dirt farmer back to the U.S. Senate,\" Shelbi Dantic, Montanans for Tester campaign manager, said in a press release shared with Fox News Digital. \"Every day, Montanans learn more about Tim Sheehy: that he's a multimillionaire transplant from out-of-state, that he wants to transfer our public lands and shutter our rural hospitals, and that he has repeatedly lied to them about his story and who he is. Montanans know they can't trust Sheehy, and we're so grateful for the enormous enthusiasm we're seeing from our neighbors who are excited to vote for Jon Tester in November.\"\nDemocrats have put an emphasis on the Montana Senate race as they attempt to hold onto their Senate majority in 2024, with a group launched by Sen. Chuck Schumer's Senate Majority PAC recently spending millions in ads across the Big Sky State targeting Sheehy.\nAdditionally, an article was recently published by the Washington Post that heavily quoted Democrat-tied experts and casted doubt on whether the Navy SEAL actually received a bullet wound in Afghanistan.\nSheehy recently revealed that a bullet in his arm, which in 2015 he said was a result of an accidental self-inflicted gun shot, was actually received while serving in Afghanistan in 2012. The Senate candidate told the Washington Post that he never reported it to his superiors due to fear of an investigation, prompting the outlet to interview several individuals and question the validity of his story.\nThe Washington Post used Air Force attorney Rachel VanLandingham, who called Sheehy a \"deeply flawed hero whose fitness for office is highly questionable\" in an April 6 post on X, as a reference to question the Republican candidate's story.\nThe outlet also reported that trauma surgeon Joseph V. Sakran, a vocal anti-Trump activist and former Democrat staffer who donated over $21,000 to Democrats, said \"it is not possible to tell what type of weapon it came from nor the age of the wound.\"\nSheehy described the report as a \"smear piece,\" but his team said they \"aren't shocked\" as he ramps up his Senate campaign.\n\"We aren't shocked the Washington Post chose to cite known Democrats for their smear piece against decorated combat veteran Tim Sheehy,\" a Sheehy for Montana spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement.",

            "summary": "NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — The United Nations' refugee agency said Friday that Cypriot efforts at sea to stop numerous Syrian refugee-laden boats departing Lebanon from reaching the European Union-member island nation mustn't contravene international human rights laws or put passengers at risk.\nCypriot authorities have reportedly dispatched police patrol vessels just outside Lebanese territorial waters to thwart boat loads of Syrian refugees from reaching the island about 110 miles (180 kilometers) away.\nThe Cypriot government says a crumbling Lebanese economy coupled with the uncertainty brought on by the Israeli-Hamas war and the recent tit-for-tat strikes between Israel and Lebanon has resulted in a huge number of rickety boats overloaded with migrants – almost all Syrians – reaching the island.\nEarlier this week, Cypriot patrol craft reportedly intercepted five boats carrying hundreds of Syrian refugees and migrants. The boats turned back and the passengers disembarked safely.\nUNCHR spokesperson in Cyprus Emilia Strovolidou told The Associated Press that according to testimonies of passengers' relatives, Cypriot authorities \"forcibly pushed back\" the boats using \"violence\" and \"techniques to destabilize the boat.\"\nStrovolidou said the U.N. agency was \"not in a position to confirm\" those testimonies.\nA Cypriot senior official strenuously denied that any coercion was used in any way to get the boats to return to Lebanon, insisting that the Cypriot government doesn't engage in any pushbacks and acts \"fully in accordance with international law.\"\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he cannot disclose details of ongoing operations, dismissed as \"lies\" allegations that Cypriot authorities resorted to using any type of force.\nStrovolidou said Cyprus is also bound by international law not to return individuals to any country which could in turn deport them to their homeland where they could be at risk of harm or persecution.\nThe Lebanon office of UNHCR said in a statement that it was aware of more than 220 people who had disembarked from the returned boats in northern Lebanon on Wednesday. Of those, 110 were refugees registered with UNHCR and all of them were released, it said.\nSaadeddine Shatila, executive director of the Cedar Center for Legal Studies, a Lebanon-based human rights organization that tracks migration issues, said his group had information that the Lebanese army had detained and possibly deported Syrians from at least one of the returning boats who weren't registered with UNCHR.\nThe Lebanese army has in the past occasionally deported all Syrians aboard seized migrant boats, including registered refugees, a practice that drew an outcry from human rights organizations.\nLebanese political officials have been calling for years for the international community to either resettle the refugees in other countries or assist in returning them to Syria, and security forces have stepped up deportations of Syrians over the past year. Some of the deportees have reportedly faced detention and torture upon their return.\nThe Cypriot official said the Cyprus government in coordination with the European Commission is preparing an additional financial support package for Lebanon to help the country stop migrant boat departures. He said that support is conditional on Lebanon's effectiveness in stopping migrant boat departures.\nCypriot President Nikos Christodoulides and European Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen are due in Beirut May 2 to discuss the aid package.\nThe official said people smugglers are exploiting people's fears over the ongoing conflicts in the region and are brazenly advertising in Lebanese coffee shops available seats on boats to Cyprus for $3,000 a head – a bargain compared to the $7,000 required for a trip to Italy.\nCyprus will convene a meeting of other EU countries next month to elicit additional support for its initiative for the bloc to formally redesignate some areas of Syria as safe zones. The Czech Republic and Denmark are behind the idea.\nAccording to the Cypriot official, doing so wouldn't mean that Syrians hailing from those safe zones are deported back to their country, but they would lose any allowances, benefits and the right to work, creating a disincentive to others to come to Cyprus.\nHe said Denmark is already implementing such a policy on its own and it's a measure that the Cypriot government could consider if arrivals continue to increase.",

            "excerpt": "Zhang Youxia, one of the top military leaders in China, took a harsh line on territorial disputes at an international navel gathering Monday in northeastern China.",
            "summary": "One of China's top military leaders took a harsh line on regional territorial disputes, telling an international naval gathering in northeastern China on Monday that the country would strike back with force if its interests came under threat.\nThe 19th biennial meeting of the Western Pacific Naval Symposium opened in Qingdao, where China's northern naval force is based, providing a vivid backdrop to China's massive military expansion over the past two decades that has seen it build or refurbish three aircraft carriers.\nThe two-day talks have drawn representatives from partners and competitors including Australia, Cambodia, Chile, France, India and the U.S. and comes amid heightened tensions over China's assertive actions in the Taiwan Strait and the East and South China seas, and as China's navy has grown into the world's largest by number of hulls.\nZhang Youxia, the vice chairman of the ruling Communist Party's Central Military Commission, which controls the armed forces, spoke of \"common development\" and said \"decoupling, friction and confrontation will only divide the world into isolated islands guarding against each other with suspicion.\"\nThen he turned to China's territorial claims, which have not been recognized under international law and in some cases have been denied. Beijing has ignored rulings not in its favor, particularly in the South China Sea, where it is in dispute with five other parties over islands, waterways and undersea resources.\nJapan continues to defend its control over the uninhabited Senkaku island chain, called Diaoyu by China, in the East China Sea, against incursions by the Chinese coast guard.\nTaiwan last week reinforced its foothold in the disputed South China Sea by establishing satellite communications between the main island and its garrison on Taiping Island, also known as Itu Aba, the largest land feature in the highly contested Spratly Island chain. China has created seven artificial islands in the area by piling sand and cement on coral reefs and equipping them with airstrips and other military infrastructure.\nZhang said China's territorial sovereignty \"brooks no infringement and its core interests cannot be challenged. We do not provoke trouble, but we will never flinch in face of provocation. The Chinese military will resolutely defend the reunification and interest of the motherland.\"\nZhang has spoken in the past of Beijing's determination to take control of the self-governing island republic of Taiwan, which it claims as its own territory, using force if necessary. With its crucial high-tech economy, Taiwan has been building up its defenses on its own and with help from the U.S., where Congress this weekend approved $8 billion in military aid for Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific.\nTaiwan is also building its own submarines and trainer aircraft and waiting on the delivery of upgraded versions of F-16 fighters, battle tanks and other hardware from the U.S.\nZhang appeared to press China's unilateralist approach to foreign relations and military conflicts as espoused by Xi Jinping, the top military commander, Communist Party leader and head-of-state for life, who has eliminated all dissenting views.\nChina \"remains committed to resolving maritime disputes with directly concerned countries through friendly consultations, but we will not allow our good faith to be abused,\" Zhang said. \"Particularly over the self-governing island republic of Taiwan that Beijing threatens to use force to bring under its control. We will take justified actions to defend our rights in accordance with the law.\"\nZhang's comments follow a major shakeup of the Chinese military in recent months that has seen the still-unexplained disappearance of former Defense Minister Li Shangfu and several top officers in the missile corps.\nAlso due to speak at the gathering was the recently appointed head of the Russian navy, Adm. Alexander Moiseyev, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Monday, according to the official Interfax news agency.\nIt said Moiseyev met with Adm. Hu Zhongming, commander of China's People's Liberation Army Navy, in Qingdao on Sunday, and they agreed to further cooperation on search and rescue.\n\"The sides emphasized the importance of further developing cooperation between the two countries' fleets for supporting security and stability on the world's oceans,\" Interfax said.\nChina has refused to criticize Russia's full-on invasion of Ukraine and has held multiple rounds of drills with the Russian navy and other armed forces branches, part of an alignment of their military and political postures to form a joint front against the prevailing U.S.-led Western liberal order.\nUkraine has developed deadly sea drones that have struck Russian navy ships in the Black Sea. Those successful strikes have embarrassed the Kremlin.",

            "excerpt": "FIRST ON FOX: A group of 15 state financial officers penned a letter to bank of America, warning it against discriminating against conservatives and religious Americans.",
            "summary": "FIRST ON FOX: A group of 15 financial officers representing 13 states issued a warning to Bank of America over its alleged practices of \"politicized de-banking\" targeting conservatives.\nIn a letter to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, the officials said the bank's practices threaten its own financial health and reputation with customers, while simultaneously harming the U.S. economy and Americans' civil liberties. They pointed to examples of Bank of America shuttering the accounts belonging to Christian groups and leaders, and joining a net-zero climate alliance, in addition to its poor viewpoint diversity rating.\n\"Americans should never have to worry that their personal financial decisions will be weaponized against them,\" Kentucky State Auditor Allison Ball said in a statement. \"This practice has become all too common, and banks must urgently course correct to uphold their fiduciary duty and safeguard the constitutional freedoms of Americans.\"\nShe blasted executives at financial institutions for taking advantage \"of the divided political climate to engage in politicized de-banking.\"\nIn one example highlighted by Ball and the other 14 officials, in April 2023, Bank of America shut down the bank account belonging to Indigenous Advance Ministries, a Christian charitable organization that assists at-risk children, prisoners and sex trafficking victims in Uganda. The bank further closed the accounts of a Memphis, Tenn., church that donated to that group.\nBank of America explained the action was taken because of the group's \"business type\" and that its activities exceeded the \"bank's risk tolerance.\" After repeated requests for clarification from Indigenous Advance Ministries, Bank of America claimed the accounts were closed because a business affiliated with the group engaged in debt collection, The Christian Post newspaper reported.\nAccording to the letter, in a similar action last year, Bank of America closed the account of Timothy Two Project International, which trains pastors in more than 65 countries. The bank reportedly informed Timothy Two Project International that it was \"operating a business type we have chosen not to service.\"\nAnd three years prior, Bank of America reportedly froze the accounts of Christian author and preacher Lance Wallnau for allegedly laundering money. It then unfroze his account after asking him \"invasive\" questions about his activities, the state officers wrote.\nThe letter stated that Bank of America's actions strongly suggest that \"systemic drivers of religious and political bias may be at work within the company as a whole. The bank, though, pushed back on those accusations.\n\"Given the large number of non-profits we serve that are affiliated with religious organizations, it's absurd to think religious beliefs are a factor in any account closing decision,\" Bank of America spokesperson Bill Halldin told Fox News Digital. \"Very simply, they are not.\"\nThe state financial officers also said Bank of America's membership in the so-called Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a global group that coordinates actions taken by banks to push a green energy transition, may facilitate de-banking. They noted that commitments made by Bank of America through its membership could greatly harm farmers in their states since it will lead to higher prices.\nAnd the letter pointed to Bank of America's low ranking on the Viewpoint Diversity Score Business Index, a benchmark measuring corporate respect for free speech and freedom of religion. The index found that Bank of America partners with left-wing groups like the Human Rights Campaign and the Center for American Progress when it comes to its gift-matching program, but leaves out faith-based groups, instead citing its support for \"homeless shelters, soup kitchens or other social service needs.\"\n\"This pattern of internal political and religious bias at Bank of America poses risks for public funds invested in the company as well as for the millions of individuals, businesses, and nonprofits who rely on its services,\" the letter to Moynihan stated. \"Bank of America's de-banking policies and practices improperly subordinate financial well-being to other factors and place the company's business interests at risk.\"\nThe letter concluded by asking Bank of America to take a number of good faith steps to address the concerns, including eliminating viewpoint discrimination and exiting the Net-Zero Banking Alliance.\n\"Financial institutions like Bank of America should not be allowed to restrict Americans' access to capital based solely on their political or religious views. SFOF will continue to work with our members to fight for financial sanity, free of political agendas,\" said State Financial Officers Foundation CEO Derek Kreifels.",

            "excerpt": "Exiled Crown Prince of Iran Reza Pahlavi blames the Biden administration for emboldening Iran after its attack against Israel and calls for an end to Ali Khamenei's rule.",
            "summary": "The exiled crown prince of Iran accused the Biden administration Sunday of \"appeasing\" the Iranian supreme leader after Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel and urged global leaders to support the Iranian people, calling for an end to the Islamic Republic regime.\n\"From Tehran to Tel Aviv, from Hamidan to Haifa, Iranians and Israelis know that this is not the Iranian people's war, this is Ali Khamenei, the dictator of this brutal regime's war,\" Reza Pahlavi said during an appearance on \"Sunday Night in America.\"\n\"As we speak, today there were demonstrations in Paris, London, Berlin. Iranians together with the Israelis and Jews hand-in-hand…supporting each other and demonstrating to the whole world that we as a nation and Israel as a nation have our destiny intertwined. We cannot hope for any chance for peace and stability in the region until this regime is finally gone,\" Pahlavi said.\n\"I think it's important for the world to realize that the only obstacle to peace and stability and a better future lies on putting an end to the regime. It's time for the world to finally decide to endorse and back the Iranian people to topple this regime and put an end to all this madness,\" he added.\nHis comment comes a day after Iran launched a barrage of over 300 missiles and drones at Israel Saturday in an apparent response to Israel's reported role in an airstrike that killed a senior Iranian official in the country's embassy in the Syrian capital of Damascus last week.\nIsraeli Defense Forces and allied militaries had been preparing for the possibility of an Iranian retaliatory strike since the attack, with Israel stating that roughly 99% of the Iranian weapons fired at the country had been intercepted by its sophisticated defense systems and military allies in the region.\nPahlavi said the Biden administration's return to the Iran nuclear deal and readiness to pump billions of dollars into Iran's cash-starved economy has emboldened its leadership and sent a message of \"appeasement.\" The Biden administration's reported opposition to a retaliatory strike by Israel against Iran only further drives home that message, he said.\n\"When you release money to a regime and give it more means to finance its proxies and use brutality at home, basically appeasement, has proven it only emboldens the regime,\" he said.\n\"We said that a long time ago. As you indicated last year when I visited Israel, part of our discussions with Israeli leaders – and for that matter, other leaders around the world – have been precisely this. If you let the regime be emboldened by the fact that they can count on appeasement or paying ransom for the release of hostages or not imposing sanctions which gave the regime almost one extra hundred billion dollars [and] the fact that the current administration is trying to release even more money to the regime, $10 billion of Iranian electric revenue from the Iraqis. What do you think will happen next?\" he said.\nPahlavi was referring to President Biden's renewal of a sanctions waver last month that allows Iraq to continue to purchase electricity from Iran, effectively allowing the terrorist regime access to $10 billion in funds.\nWhite House national security communications adviser John Kirby told Fox News' Shannon Bream in an interview Sunday that \"the additional funds that have been made available to Iran\" through the sanctions program can only be used for humanitarian goods. \"It doesn't go to the regime,\" he insisted.\n\"I think there's a direct correlation between appeasement in doing this kind of thing and the regime becoming emboldened, the solution is to use every opportunity to put more pressure on the regime,\" Pahlavi said.\nWorld powers, including the U.S. and the United Kingdom, reached a nuclear deal with Iran in 2015, formerly known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, after years of international tensions that Iran was working to build a nuclear bomb. The agreement limited some of Iran's nuclear activities, while allowing international authorities to carry out inspections. Sanctions on Tehran were lifted in exchange.\nFormer President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the agreement in 2018 after slamming it as \"defective at its core.\"\nPahlavi said the U.S. and its European allies should begin to support the Iranian people by classifying the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist group.\n\"But also parallel to that,\" he told Gowdy, \"it's time to use maximum support to the Iranian people in their struggle against this regime. It is the Iranian people's ask to have change. It does not have to be a U.S. senator saying who needs to change. If the Iranian people say loud and clear that we're done with this regime, help us liberate ourselves, that is the message of the Iranian people… and I hope the U.S. government and other governments will heed this call and finally help us save our world from disaster and more conflict and have an opportunity post this regime to have regional peace and brotherly cooperation.\n\"Not just Iran and Israel,\" he added, \"but the Arab world that's also been a target of this regime.\"",

            "excerpt": "Amid a devastating Iranian missile and drone attack on Israel, there are growing calls for Biden to pull the plug on his alleged appeasement policy and confront Tehran.",
            "summary": "JERUSALEM — American and Israeli experts issued scathing indictments of President Biden's alleged timid Iran policy after Tehran launched a massive aerial warfare attack on the Jewish state over the weekend.\nThe Islamic Republic, for the first time, executed direct missile and drone strikes into Israeli territory. The dramatic events in the heart of the Middle East have triggered calls for the Biden administration to reverse its reportedly dovish outreach to the ayatollahs who run the theocratic state. Biden is now urging Israel to recoil from a counterstrike.\n\"This was a massive, unprecedented and unacceptable strategic attack on Israel,\" Richard Goldberg, who was a member of former President Trump's National Security Council, told Fox News Digital. \"It would be a huge mistake to pull Israel back from a military retaliation, but it's downright insanity to keep $10 billion accessible to Tehran in the aftermath. The president needs to lock down all the money he made available to Tehran these past months.\"\nLast month, Fox News Digital reported that Biden defied opponents of Iran's regime and waived sanctions on Iran's cash-starved economy. Biden faced criticism after releasing as much as $10 billion into the coffers of the Islamic Republic. In January, an Iranian regime-sponsored proxy terrorist attack killed three U.S. soldiers in Jordan.\nThe Biden administration insisted that Iran's regime can't use the funds for its growing military offensive arsenal. Critics argue that the $10 billion is fungible money and the financial allocation allows Iran to revise its budget to expand its military apparatus.\nGoldberg, who is a senior adviser for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, added, \"If the president is looking for economic and diplomatic responses to the Iranian attack, there are three obvious ones available: lock down the $10 billion, enforce U.S. oil sanctions and snap back U.N. sanctions. If Biden avoids these steps, this isn't escalation avoidance. It's continued appeasement.\"\nSpeaking on \"Fox News Sunday\" with Shannon Bream, White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby rejected criticism that the administration has not been tough enough on Tehran, noting the sanctions and other measures used against Tehran: \"It's hard to take a look at what President Biden has done and say that we've somehow gone soft on Iran.\"\nHe continued, \"It was the previous administration that decided to get us out of the Iran deal. And now Iran is so much dramatically closer to potential nuclear weapon capability than they were before … Mr. Trump was elected.\"\nQuizzed on the financial relief given to Iran and how the regime used it, he said, \"It's not even sanctions relief but the additional funds that have been made available to Iran due to [the] sanctions relief program that the Trump administration put in place can only be used for humanitarian goods. It doesn't go to the regime.\"\nFormer Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, who appeared on \"Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo,\" said he believed the Biden administration's reaction to the death of the IRGC generals in Syria following the reported Israeli attack showed how \"fractured\" the relationship with Israel had become, and that it had \"emboldened Iran.\"\nFox News Digital reported in October, shortly after Iran's proxy, Hamas, slaughtered 1,200 people, including over 30 Americans, in southern Israel that the Biden administration and its European allies allowed U.N. sanctions to be lifted on Iran's capability to purchase and supply missiles to enemies of the U.S. and Israel.\nA State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital at the time that \"the snapback mechanism is not expiring and remains in place. We do not rely solely on UNSCR 2231 to restrict Iran's dangerous development and proliferation of missile-related technologies and UAVs, but rather a comprehensive set of multilateral and unilateral tools.\"\nThe spokesperson went on to say, \"We continue to use all our tools to counter Iran's missile and UAV development and proliferation, including sanctions, unilateral and multilateral export controls, interdiction activities, diplomatic engagement, cooperation with private industry.\"\nLisa Daftari, a leading Iranian-American expert on the Islamic Republic and editor-in-chief of the Foreign Desk, told Fox News Digital that \"The Biden administration's posture in the first hours of coming into the White House was that they were going to go soft on the regime. Their policies reflected this. Their rhetoric reflected this. They sent a clear message to the mullahs that there would be no consequences for their rogue actions. What we are seeing is a manifestation of weak policies and the ayatollah's correct read on American foreign policy.\"\nThe U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital press query. A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital last week that \"Iran's political, financial and material support to terror groups, Hamas prominently among them, is well documented, and in fact trumpeted by the regime. Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. The regime prioritizes financing Hamas and proxy groups at the expense of its own people and stability in the region.\"\nYaakov Katz, a leading Israeli expert on security and defense of the Jewish state, told Fox News Digital that \"Iran has been given immunity since Oct. 7 despite the continued attacks by its proxies: Hamas, Houthis and Hezbollah.\"\nKatz added, \"What happened on Saturday night was a direct and unprecedented Iranian attack against Israel. The containment policy does not work and the world's strategy of diplomacy and sanctions is not effective. The world needs to shift gears and change the way it has tried to confront Iran.\"",

            "excerpt": "In a two-way ballot test in Georgia, former President Trump maintains a slim majority while President Biden sees a 2-point improvement since January",
            "summary": "In a two-way ballot test in the Peach State, former President Trump maintains a slim majority, while President Biden sees a 2-point improvement since January, according to the latest Fox News Poll of Georgia registered voters released Thursday.\nTrump holds steady with 51% support in the rematch (same as in January), while 45% of voters back Biden (up from 43%). That 6-point difference is just inside the poll's margin of error.\nBiden's movement can be attributed to modest gains among Black voters (76% now vs. 71% in January) and voters under age 35 (49% vs. 43%), as well as a notable shift among the small subgroup of independents. In January, Trump had the advantage by 20 points (51% to 31% Biden), while the two presumptive candidates are tied today (42% each).\nTrump's coalition has held relatively steady, with some of his best groups being White evangelical Christians (83%), White men without a degree (75%), rural voters (67%), and voters ages 65 and over (58%).\n\"Trump stalled at 49% in 2020 and GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker was at 48-49% in 2022,\" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Daron Shaw. \"If Georgia voters have soured on Democrats even a little bit, the state is a major pickup opportunity for Trump.\"\nIn a hypothetical five-way race, Trump has a 7-point lead over Biden (46% to 39%), with third-party candidates Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (7%), Cornel West (2%), and Jill Stein (1%) in single digits. This is about where the race stood in January.\n\"Georgia may be the weakest state from Biden's 2020 coalition,\" says Shaw. \"On the plus side, if he can rally African Americans and younger voters, he might be able to recreate his 2020 victory. On the minus side, he might have maxed out that vote in 2020 and it's unclear how compelling his message is to these voters in 2024. I'm in the minority on this point, but it seems North Carolina might be a more promising target this time around.\"\nOn specific issues, Georgia continues to favor Trump, as he is seen as better able to handle — mostly by double-digits — five out of seven issues.\nNotably, Trump has the advantage on the two issues that have been dominating the campaign: immigration (Trump preferred by 23 points) and the economy (+22). He is also favored on foreign policy (+15) and energy policy (+8).\nOn other issues, neither candidate has a significant advantage: Trump has the edge on abortion (+2), whereas Biden is narrowly ahead on health care (+2) and election integrity (+3).\nForty-four percent of voters feel they are falling behind financially vs. 41% who are holding steady and 15% who are getting ahead. Voters saying they are falling behind go for Trump by 54 points, while those getting ahead/holding steady go for Biden by 31 points.\nVoters view Trump more favorably than Biden and see the former president as more mentally fit for the job than the incumbent.\nBy a 2-point margin, Georgians view Trump favorably (50% favorable vs. 48% unfavorable), a reversal from July 2022 when he was viewed negatively by 11 points (43% vs. 54%). They also see Trump as having the mental soundness to serve effectively as president (54% has mental soundness vs. 44% does not).\nBiden's favorable rating is underwater by 15 points (42% favorable vs. 57% unfavorable), and more say he lacks the mental soundness to serve by 22 points (38% mentally sound vs. 60% not).\nBiden's job approval rating is also upside down: 42% approve vs. 58% disapprove, which is about where it was in January.\nA few more things…\n— Views on Kennedy are split, with 39% rating him favorably, 39% unfavorably, and 22% unable to rate him. Democrats are more likely to view him negatively (31% favorable, 46% unfavorable), while Republicans are the opposite (45% favorable, 36% unfavorable). Independents are somewhat split (38% favorable, 33% unfavorable).\n— By a 6-point margin, Georgia voters think the Biden administration is too supportive of the Palestinians (27%) rather than too supportive of the Israelis (21%) in the war in the Middle East. Still, 4 in 10 think Biden's support of each is about right (39%). Democrats are almost 7 times more likely than Republicans to think there's too much support for the Israelis, while Republicans are 4 times more likely to think there's too much support for the Palestinians.\n— In a hypothetical U.S. House race, Georgians prefer the Republican candidate by 8 points (50% to 42% for the Democrat).\nConducted April 11-16 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,128 Georgia registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (150) and cellphones (699) or completed the survey online after receiving a text message (279). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of ± 3 percentage points. When necessary, weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics are representative of the registered voter population.",

            "summary": "FIRST ON FOX — An April 11 edition of the United Nations Division for Palestinian Rights' NGO Action News, which provides updates about civil society organizations worldwide \"relevant to the Palestine issue,\" linked readers to the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights (USCPR) list of \"5 Ways to Take Action for Tax Day.\"\nIncluded within the list were instructions about how protesters who did not \"want [their] tax dollars to fund genocide\" could \"disrupt for a free Palestine.\"\nThe second item on USCPR's list was a hyperlink for protesters seeking to engage in a \"coordinated multi-city economic blockade to free Palestine,\" an effort organizers noted was \"not affiliated with USCPR.\"\nIn the destination page, blockade organizers A15 describe efforts to \"identify and blockade major choke points in the economy, focusing on points of production and circulation with the aim of causing the most economic impact,\" effectively \"blocking the arteries of capitalism and jamming the wheels of production.\"\nAnne Bayefsky, president of Human Rights Voices and director of the Touro University Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust, told Fox News Digital \"the U.N. has been caught red-handed aiding and abetting pro-Hamas anarchists in American cities and streets\" by \"distributing a newsletter, in multiple languages and to a worldwide network, that contains links to radical anti-American and anti-Israel agitators, their agendas and plans.\"\nFox News Digital reported on the April 15 blockades when anti-Israel protesters stopped traffic outside Washington's Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Chicago's O'Hare Airport, California's Golden Gate Bridge and on the I-5 in Eugene, Ore. Gatherings also took place outside the New York Stock Exchange and Philadelphia's City Hall, at San Antonio's Valero headquarters and in Los Angeles, Oakland, Tampa and Miami.\nAt an attempted traffic disruption in Detroit, police told Fox 2 Detroit protesting vehicles \"ignored multiple traffic control signals,\" which led to \"traffic obstructions\" and \"nearly caus[ed] accidents.\"\nDuring the day's events, dozens around the country were arrested.\nThe UN's NGO Action News site contains a disclaimer warning that third-party links \"are not under the control of the United Nations and the United Nations is not responsible for the content of any linked site or any link contained in a linked site.\"\nBayefsky says the U.N. disclaimer \"is totally bogus.\" She claims \"it is U.N. staff who produce summaries of activist plans,\" and that \"the inclusion of any announcement or link to a third party must receive prior approval from the U.N.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to the chair of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, Ambassador Cheikh Niang of Senegal, for comment about whether U.N. staff approve items within and author summaries for NGO Action News. He did not immediately respond.\nThe USCPR's protest guide contains other inflammatory remarks, including referencing President Biden as \"Genocide Joe,\" and alleging that \"Israel is mass murdering Palestinian families with [U.S.] tax dollars.\" To summarize USCPR's messaging, NGO Action News pulls from the more measured tones within its guide for action, explaining USCPR \"urged the public to pressure for the end of U.S. military funding to Israel's massive violence.\"\nStéphane Dujarric, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, told Fox News Digital \"the secretary-general does not have the legal authority to label an event as ‘genocide.' For the United Nations, that determination needs to be made by a competent court.\"\nIn its Jan. 26 preliminary ruling, the International Court of Justice did not rule that Israel had committed genocide but urged Israel to allow Gazans access to humanitarian aid and attempt to assist Palestinian civilians.\nWhen asked whether the secretary-general supports NGO Action News' instructions in an official U.N. publication that protesters engage in civil disobedience, Dujarric stated that NGO Action News \"is compiled in accordance with a mandate conferred by the member states of the U.N. General Assembly\" and \"does not fall under the authority or direction of the Secretary-General.\"\n\"You have all this anarchy on the streets of the U.S.,\" Bayefsky said, which \"ought to be a major wake-up call for American lawmakers and the criminal justice system since we are talking about an operation based in New York City itself. It is also a stunning reminder of the U.N.'s history of anti-Israel and anti-Jewish bias and its vicious post-Oct. 7 campaign to deny Israel its lawful right of self-defense.\"\nOn April 16, the Anti-Defamation League released its annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents, which found that antisemitic incidents rose 140% between 2022 and 2023. This included a 45% increase in assaults, a 69% increase in vandalism and a 184% increase in harassment. The ADL noted it \"observed explicitly antisemitic and anti-Zionist rhetoric at 1,352 anti-Israel rallies across the United States\" after Oct. 7.\nWhen asked if he recognized that anti-Israel protests are among the reasons for the rise in antisemitic incidents in the U.S. following Oct. 7, Dujarric said \"the Secretary-General has publicly, and repeatedly, raised his voice against what he believes is the rise of antisemitism in many of our societies, whether that be in Europe, North America and other parts of the world.\n\"In addition, the secretary-general has also stated publicly that those that call for the destruction of the state of Israel is a form of modern antisemitism.\"\nBoth Israel's foreign minister and the United Nations ambassador have called for Guterres to resign over his treatment of Israel.",

            "excerpt": "When Joe Biden was a senator, he opposed Reagan's efforts to build missile defense. Now, those systems defend Israel and Biden doesn't want our ally to strike back at Iran.",
            "summary": "Iran fired more than 320 warheads at Israel on Saturday. The explosives were carried by about 170 propeller-driven drones of the kind Iran has sold Russia for use against Ukraine, more than 30 cruise missiles, and more than 120 ballistic missiles — mostly fired from Iranian territory at least 1,100 miles away to the east with a few launched from more distant Houthi-controlled Yemen to the south.\nThe attack failed to deliver any meaningful damage, though a 10-year-old girl was injured, as 99% of the drones and missiles were intercepted by Israel, the U.S., and likely Jordan and Saudi Arabia as well.\nWhat Iran's large-scale attack on Israel — more than twice as large as any Russian attack on Ukraine — did was show the value of a layered anti-missile defense championed by former Presidents Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump — and opposed by President Joe Biden, when he served in the U.S. Senate.\nIran's triple threat attack was defeated by fighter jets, Israel's short-range Iron Dome system, David's Sling, a kinetic hit-to-kill interceptor system with a range out to 186 miles away, and Israel's Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 systems, developed with the United States beginning in the late 1980s. The U.S. Navy also fired anti-ballistic missile rockets from warships nearby.\nBut, had Biden had his way in 1987, Israel wouldn't have had the sophisticated and highly effective missile defense system.\nAt the time, I was a young special assistant for foreign affairs in the Pentagon. Shortly after the Republicans lost their U.S. Senate majority in the 1986 election, Democrats redoubled their efforts to terminate Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.\nIt was a destabilizing waste of money, they claimed. They argued on one hand that it cost too much, and it wouldn't work anyway, and on the other hand, if it did work, it would increase the likelihood of a life-ending nuclear war.\nBut with Israel's advances in defense technology, combined with its location in a dangerous neighborhood, a bipartisan argument could be made that Israel would benefit from the development of anti-missile technology while America would benefit from Israel's testing data and lessons learned. Thus was born Israel's Arrow anti-ballistic missile system.\nIt's important to note at the time that Arrow had its critics in both America and Israel. Aside from Biden and the largely anti-defense left, the Israeli Air Force was skeptical, fearing a diversion of resources from its ability to deter attacks on Israel through what was euphemistically called \"preemptive diplomacy\" — the threat of first strikes to destroy emerging dangers.\nBut Israel's Ministry of Defense believed that an effective anti-missile defense would blunt the destruction of an enemy surprise attack, allowing Israel the luxury of not having to conduct diplomatically costly preemptive strikes. That has now been borne out.\nIn the wake Iran's foiled attack on Israel, Biden told Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to \"take the win\" and not strike back. Further driving the point home — likely to appeal to the Democrats' growing problem with their antisemitic, left-wing base — Biden said he wouldn't support an Israeli counterattack.\nBut just because a would-be murderer failed doesn't mean that a criminal should escape justice.\nRepublican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio called out Biden, accusing him of leaking his call transcript with Netanyahu to appease the \"pro-terrorist\" mob. Rubio further condemned the Biden administration for playing a \"public game\" that \"encourages Iran and Hezbollah … and the Houthis\" and other anti-Israel elements that make the Middle East an even more dangerous region.\nIn the meantime, domestic pressure is mounting to force Israel to relent in its efforts to defend itself by eliminating the threat from adjacent terrorist groups. Terrorist sympathizers in Chicago shut down the road to the city's airport and increasing chants of \"Death to America\" and \"Death to Israel,\" aiming to change U.S. policy towards Israel.\nThis brings to mind the Cold War-era revelations from high level Soviet defector Col. Stanislav Lunev, a military intelligence officer, that the Soviet Union's clandestine agencies provided more resources for \"antiwar propaganda in the United States than it did for economic and military support of the Vietnamese.\"\nBut, had Biden had his way in 1987, Israel wouldn't have had the sophisticated and highly effective missile defense system.\nThe People's Republic of China has a simple doctrine with regards American interests: Whatever the U.S. supports, it opposes; whatever the U.S. opposes, it supports. With China openly opposing Israel's efforts to defend itself and in possession of an economy several times larger than the Soviet Union's at its peak, as well as having powerful propaganda tools such as TikTok, one can only guess at the extent to which China is involved in whipping up anti-Israel, pro-terror hysteria in America.\nBiden's policy of appeasing Iran and its terror proxies has failed spectacularly.\nIsrael may soon do what it must, using its strength to make up for Biden's fecklessness.",

            "excerpt": "Republicans and Democrats look at poverty from opposite directions. Republicans want to help Americans find their way out of poverty. Democrats want to keep them poor.",
            "summary": "The left claims to care about income inequality, but time and time again, its members reject solutions that allow more people to accumulate assets and savings. That's because the left wants to end income inequality by leveling everyone down so everyone will be equally miserable. The American way, however, is to help everyone move up in income and have a better life.\nOne example of a dramatic effort to empower the poor and help them enrich themselves was developed by then-Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp, under President George H. W. Bush.\nAs a congressman from Buffalo, Kemp helped develop supply-side economics and authored the Kemp-Roth three-year tax cut, which became the basis for President Ronald Reagan's tax cut plan.\nBoth as a congressman and Secretary of HUD, Kemp was one of the most innovative leaders in finding ways to bring the benefits of capital and ownership to the poor.\nHe and civil rights activist Bob Woodson developed a program to allow people in public housing to eventually own the units in which they lived in exchange for helping to maintain the buildings.\nThis bold idea outraged left-wing Democrats. Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank, one of the most liberal members of the House, objected to the program, pointing out that it would enable poor New York City residents to acquire properties worth $1 million in the New York market.\nYes, the fact that the program could help poor people accumulate wealth was his objection. The left is willing to talk about helping the poor so long as they remain poor – and are kept dependent on the government.\nAnother example of a bold reform that would give lower income Americans the opportunity to accumulate more wealth is strengthening Social Security with personal savings accounts.\nOne of the major obstacles to fixing the wealth gap in America is the fact that 4-in-10 Americans have no investments in the stock market.\nIndividual accounts to strengthen Social Security would enable every American to have a 401(k) and enjoy larger monthly payments when they retire. Unlike the current Social Security model, this would enable seniors to leave the balance of their accounts to their heirs.\nThis opportunity is particularly important to Americans of lower incomes because the lack of generational wealth transfer is a major driver of persistent inequality.\nOf course, the left objects to this enhancement of Social Security – not because it would be bad for the poor and minorities, but because it would make these groups more capitalist and less dependent on government.\nIn recent years, we've seen this pattern repeat itself in the left's assault on retail trading platforms that allow customers to access the stock market via apps on their phones.\nBecause they don't charge commissions for trades, retail investment apps lower the barrier to entry by making small dollar investing cost-effective. Instead of making money on commissions, these trading platforms often rely on small rebates from market-making firms that compete to execute the trades – a process called payment for order flow (PFOF).\nToday, commission-free online investing and trading is the norm. Since the introduction of zero-commission trades in 2013, a slew of commission-free online investing platforms has arisen in the marketplace. As a result, retail investment volume for equities grew to 25% of total investing trading volume in 2021 from 10-15% in the 2010s (BNY Mellon November 2021). This increase in retail investment has brought with it an increase in the number of minorities and women joining the investor class.\nA report by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Foundation showed that since 2015, minorities have entered the investing market at a faster pace than whites. And, these minority investors tend to be younger than the white investors.\nAnother report from Fidelity showed that 67% of women are now investing outside of retirement, up from 44% in 2018. Again, the largest increase comes from younger women. The study also showed that women tend to outperform men as investors.\nBut much like Congressman Frank, who objected to the idea that the poor might get a chance to own a $1 million home, the left objects to the idea of giving more people the opportunity to accumulate wealth through investing. President Joe Biden's U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissioner Gary Gensler, backed by liberal Democrat politicians such as Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, falsely claim that without commissions paid by traders, the trading apps serve the interests of market makers and hedge funds, not the customers. Others on the left claim that options trading is too risky to allow normal Americans easy access.\nSome trading platforms, such as Public.com, have attempted to appease the left, announcing in 2021 that they were eliminating PFOF and would instead rely solely on tips to make money. Public also prohibited its customers from trading even basic options.\nIndividual accounts to strengthen Social Security would enable every American to have a 401(k) and enjoy larger monthly payments when they retire. Unlike the current Social Security model, this would enable seniors to leave the balance of their accounts to their heirs.\nHowever, earlier this year, the company did a 180, announcing the return of PFOF as part of the introduction of options trading to their platform. Like many companies that experienced \"go woke, go broke\" effects, Public discovered it could either give its customers what they want or the left what it wants. Public appears to have chosen its bottom line.\nPoliticians should learn the same lesson. Americans are struggling in the Biden economy and want financial independence. This means providing them with more opportunities to accumulate wealth, not taking those opportunities away by banning the business models that enable more people to invest.\nThe deterioration of our cities and explosion of housing costs under Biden also mean it is time to think more creatively about our welfare and anti-poverty programs. They should support the benefits of savings, investment, and wealth accumulation.\nOur goal should be to help people leave poverty, not keep them stuck there.",

            "summary": "Longtime Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey voted to kill the impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas last week, but has a long track record of supporting impeachment proceedings when former President Trump was in the hot seat with Democrats.\nThe Senate voted against two articles of impeachment Mayorkas faced last week, including one that charged Mayorkas with \"willful and systemic refusal to comply\" regarding immigration law, and a second article that charged him with a \"breach of trust\" after saying the border was secure. The Senate voted 51-48 and 51-49 against the articles.\nThe votes were largely along party lines, with Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska serving as the only Republican who voted \"present\" when asked about dismissing the first article, and voted against dismissing the second article.\nRepublicans were pushing for a trial of Mayorkas for \"willfully\" refusing to enforce immigration laws, while millions of illegal immigrants have poured across the border into the U.S. since he was sworn in as the Biden administration's secretary of Homeland Security in 2021.\nCasey was among the Democrats who voted to kill the impeachment trial of Mayorkas, but had largely been tight-lipped ahead of the vote. Fox News Digital reported last week ahead of the Senate vote that Casey had not yet revealed his plans, while Politico reported on April 10 that Casey \"did not directly answer a question on whether or not he'd support a motion to dismiss the trial.\"\nHe did tell the outlet at the time that \"the Senate should be spending time passing the bipartisan border deal\" and that he has \"no doubt at all\" that Republicans would use the impeachment trial against him and other vulnerable Senate Democrats ahead of the election.\nSenate Democrats quashing impeachment proceedings against Mayorkas was historically significant, as he is still serving in his role in public office. It marks a first for an impeachment trial to be dismissed, tabled or effectively tossed without the accused official first exiting their role, Fox Digital previously reported.\n\"The Senate has no constitutional authority to rule that the articles approved by the House do not state impeachable offenses,\" Andrew McCarthy, a former chief assistant United States attorney in the Southern District of New York and a senior fellow at the National Review Institute, said last week.\nMcCarthy added that the House has the sole power to determine impeachable offenses, and the Senate deeming the articles of impeachment unconstitutional and killing the potential trial, \"essentially nullifies the House's important role in the impeachment process.\"\nThe Senate voting against carrying through with the trial of Mayorkas comes after Casey repeatedly publicly supported impeachment proceedings against Trump when he was president.\n\"There can be no justice without accountability for those involved in the insurrection against the federal government. As a Nation, we cannot advance our shared democratic values without consequences for those who have betrayed those values. Those who stormed the Capitol should face charges. President Trump should be impeached and removed from office because he betrayed his oath to the Constitution and incited a mob to violence,\" Casey said in 2021, following protesters breaching the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 of that year.\nIn 2020, when Democrats accused Trump of soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 election, Casey said, \"Americans deserve a fair trial\" when touting articles of impeachment against the 45th president.\n\"Soon the Senate will take a critical vote on whether we should hear from relevant witnesses like John Bolton. Americans deserve a fair trial. Anything less is a cover-up,\" he said on X at the time.\nThat same month, he also called for \"answers, under oath, in full view of the American people,\" as part of Trump's first impeachment.\nHe added in 2019 of the Trump impeachment that failing to pursue proceedings against Trump would be \"an insult to our Constitution and to our values.\"\n\"Our Constitution indicates that impeachment is for ‘treason, bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.' A failure by Congress to pursue impeachment in the face of grave offenses by the President is an insult to our Constitution and to our values.\"\nTrump was ultimately impeached twice, an historical first for a president, and acquitted on all counts by the Senate.\nCasey has served in the Senate since 2007, and is anticipated to have one of the most closely watched elections this year as he gears up for a campaign against anticipated Republican challenger Dave McCormick. Pennsylvania holds its primaries Tuesday, which will solidify the expected race between Casey and McCormick.\nThe Pennsylvania Democrat and fellow vulnerable Senate members have now come under greater focus from the Republican Party following the Mayorkas vote, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) previously telling Fox Digital that their votes against proceeding with the trial will become a focal point of election season.\n\"Joe Biden's wide open border is going to be a top issue for voters headed into November,\" NRSC spokesperson Maggie Abboud told Fox News Digital in a statement last week.\n\"You can bet we are going to highlight Senate Democrats' refusal to hold Joe Biden's DHS Secretary accountable on the campaign trail, in advertising, and in every other way possible,\" she continued.\nFox News Digital reached out to the Casey campaign for comment on the Mayorkas vote and his previous remarks on Trump's impeachment proceedings, but did not immediately receive replies.\n\"Together, Casey, Biden and Mayorkas have enabled drug cartels to flood Pennsylvania communities with deadly drugs like fentanyl,\" Elizabeth Gregory, a spokesperson for McCormick, said last week.\nImmigration has become a top concern for voters ahead of November, alongside other concerns such as inflation, the economy and crime. Nearly 7.3 million migrants entered the U.S. between President Biden taking office and February 2024, a Fox News Digital analysis previously reported. The figure is more than the population of 36 individual states.",

            "summary": "A handful of vulnerable House Democrats, including those in pivotal battleground states, celebrated partnering with a left-wing Gen Z advocacy group ahead of 2024 that supports policies such as decriminalizing prostitution and abolishing cash bail.\n\"I am thrilled to be a Voters of Tomorrow Youth Vote Champion. As elected officials, my colleagues and I have a unique opportunity to give young Americans a voice in their future,\" Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright said of the endorsement, according to an X post from the Voters of Tomorrow.\nA left-wing advocacy group that promotes voting among Gen Z voters, Voters of Tomorrow has a particular focus on \"justice\" issues such as decriminalizing prostitution, dismantling \"racist\" institutions — including those that carry out \"racial profiling in education and policing\" and ending \"racist voting laws\" — as well as calling for stricter gun control, and ending \"the abusive practices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection.\"\nVoters of Tomorrow announced last year that 36 members of Congress joined a \"Youth Vote Champion\" pledge in an effort to engage young Gen Z voters, a generation typically considered to include anyone born between 1997 and 2013.\n\"We have to engage young voters not only in the two weeks before the election, but in the two years before the election,\" Jack Lobel, 18, the national press secretary of Voters of Tomorrow, told Axios at the time.\nAs the election season heats up this year, Fox News Digital found that a handful of the House members who took the Voters of Tomorrow pledge are located in swing-districts, including Cartwright, Rep. Greg Landsman of Ohio, Rep. Mary Peltola of Alaska, and Rep. Susan Wild of Pennsylvania.\nThe four members of Congress were identified last year by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as vulnerable in the 2024 elections, assigning them as members of the Frontline Program for vulnerable incumbents. Each member celebrated joining forces with the Voters of Tomorrow in comments shared by the advocacy group on social media.\n\"I wholeheartedly agree with Voters of Tomorrow's view that empowering Gen Z in our political process is a requirement for building a better future,\" Landsman said in a message of his support of Voters of Tomorrow.\n\"I ran for Congress to be an advocate for all Alaskans — from every region, background, and generation. Encouraging young people to get involved in our political process benefits everyone — and is a responsibility I take very seriously,\" Peltola said in another message posted by Voters of Tomorrow last year.\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) told Fox News Digital that the four Democrats aligning with Voters of Tomorrow ahead of 2024 shows they are not \"moderate\" Democrats, but instead \"complete frauds that should never be re-elected.\"\n\"Self-proclaimed moderate House Democrats are once again showing the American people where their true priorities lie: abolishing cash bail, defunding the police, ending ICE & CBP, and decriminalizing sex work and drugs. It's dangerous, and exposes how Cartwright, Landsman, Peltola, or Wild are complete frauds that should never be reelected,\" the NRCC's rapid response director Macy Gardner told Fox News Digital.\nFox News Digital reached out to the campaigns for comment, but did not receive replies.\nImmigration and the economy are two of the biggest issues weighing on voters this election cycle, while crime still ranks high for voters following 2020's historically bloody year, which was followed by other ongoing crime trends, such smash-and-grab robberies and carjackings.\nProstitution has spiraled in certain areas of the country in recent months, which has been compounded by the immigration crisis and local state laws. Residents in California have particularly voiced their outrage over rampant and brazen prostitution on city streets, which many pin blame on a law that repealed a previous law that banned loitering with the intent of engaging in prostitution. New York City has also seen \"third world\" conditions, including prostitutes and pimps walking the streets of Queens in broad daylight.\nVoters of Tomorrow argues prostitution should be decriminalized, saying that \"Sex work is work.\"\n\"Criminalizing consensual sex, including the exchange of these services, is taking away from the human right to autonomy and privacy. The government should not be telling consenting adults who they can have sexual relationships with and on what terms,\" the group says on its website.\nThe group also advocates for the end of cash bail, which would abolish the requirement that suspects charged with crimes post bail in order to leave jail while they await court proceedings.\n\"If the ‘justice' system has policies or laws in place that have a monetary value tied to them, then those policies only apply to low-income people. No one should have to remain in prison for the duration of their case just because they do not have the financial means to pay their bail. Cash bail only applies to low-income people and we need equal justice,\" the group states.\nVoters of Tomorrow was founded in 2019 by a ​​17-year-old immigrant from Mexico, Santiago Mayer, after he \"noticed a lack of political engagement at his high school,\" according to the group's website. The group has since gone on to advocate that Gen Z vote, including in both the 2020 election and the 2022 midterms.\nThe Republican Party had a lackluster 2022 in the midterms, which some have attributed to lack of outreach to America's youngest voting generation.\n\"Another reason that the polling was so inaccurate and that so many critical races swung to Democrats is the growing importance of Gen Z voters, which appears to have been completely ignored by the GOP,\" Fox News contributor Liz Peek wrote in an op-ed in 2022, arguing Gen Z \"stopped the Republicans' expected red wave.\"\n\"Not only did Gen Z show up in force, they overwhelmingly picked Democrats, by a 28-point margin. That preference was close to their vote in 2020, which went 62% Democrat and only 32% GOP.\"",

            "excerpt": "Wisconsin voters split their preference between President Biden and former President Trump in a hypothetical 2-way presidential race",
            "summary": "Wisconsin voters split their preference between President Biden and former President Trump in a hypothetical 2-way presidential race — and between backing the Democratic and the Republican congressional candidates in their House district, according to a new Fox News survey of Wisconsin registered voters.\nIn the head-to-head presidential matchup, Biden and Trump tie with 48% support each.\nBiden gets significant backing from urban voters (+29 points), Whites with a college degree (+26), suburban voters (+10), and union households (+8).\nFor Trump, some of his highest support is from White evangelical Christians (+46 points), White men without a college degree (+29), and rural voters (+15).\nVoters under age 45 back Biden by a single point, while those ages 65 and over go for Biden by 10 points.\nThere's a 17-point gender gap, as men go for Trump by 8 points and women for Biden by 9.\nBiden receives a touch more support among Democrats (95%) than Trump gets among Republicans (93%), but Trump is the choice of the small subgroup of independents (by 8 points).\nWhen potential third-party candidates are included, Biden tops Trump by 2 points (43-41%), with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. getting 9%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 2% each. In January, it was Trump who was up by 3 points over Biden, with Kennedy at 7%.\nKennedy receives a bit more of his backing from those who favor Trump (9%) in the 2-way ballot than from Biden (5%).\nBiden won Wisconsin in 2020 by 20,682 votes, less than one percentage point. Trump's 2016 victory was also by less than a point (22,748 votes).\nMore voters trust Trump to do a better job handling immigration (by 13 points) and the economy (+9). Biden is preferred over Trump on abortion (+9), health care (+7), and election integrity (+7). They are rated more evenly on foreign policy (Trump +2) and energy policy (even).\nOn the Middle East, equal numbers think the Biden administration is too supportive of the Israelis (25%) and the Palestinians (24%). Yet the largest share says Biden's support of each is about right (38%) — and they favor him over Trump by 38 points.\nOverall, Wisconsinites feel somewhat positive about their personal finances, as 6 in 10 say their situation is either holding steady (45%) or improving (14%). Both of those groups largely favor Biden, while the 4 in 10 who are falling behind financially go for Trump by a wide margin.\nIn the Congressional ballot test, 46% go for the Democratic candidate in their district and 45% for the Republican. Neither Biden nor Trump is a drain on his party, as 94% of those backing the Congressional Democrat favor Biden and 93% of those supporting the Republican go for Trump.\n\"Data from the 2022 election suggests MAGA candidates ran three to four points worse than non-MAGA Republicans,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts Fox News polls with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"But we're not seeing that ‘Trump tax' so far in the 2024 numbers. Neither are we seeing Biden underperforming other Democrats. It looks like partisans are behaving like partisans.\"\nBy a 5-point margin, more voters think Trump (48%) has the mental soundness to serve effectively as president than Biden (43%). Most Republicans (89%) say Trump has it and most Democrats say Biden does (85%), but independents are 17 points more likely to say Trump is mentally fit.\nThe survey finds 44% approve of Biden's job performance and 55% disapprove — unchanged since January (44-56%). His 48% support in the 2-way race is higher than his approval because 10% of those disapproving of the job he's doing still pick him over Trump.\nNearly two-thirds think Biden was legitimately elected in 2020, and they back him over Trump by 53 points and are twice as likely to approve of the job he's doing (67% approve, 32% disapprove). Among the one-third who say Biden was not legitimately elected, 98% favor Trump in the 2-way race and 98% disapprove of Biden's job performance.\nWisconsin voters are unified when it comes to having a negative opinion of both Biden and Trump. Views of each are net negative by a 10-point margin, as they both receive the same rating: 44% favorable vs 54% unfavorable.\nKennedy's ratings are negative by 13 points, 35% favorable vs. 48% unfavorable. He's viewed much more positively by Republicans (49%) and independents (44%) than Democrats (19%).\nAmong the small segment of so-called double haters (those viewing both Biden and Trump unfavorably), the vote preference splits: Biden 38% vs. Trump 39% % in the two-way ballot test. When third-party candidates are included, they back Kennedy (34%), followed by Biden (21%), Trump (13%), West (10%), and Stein (9%).\nConducted April 11-16, 2024 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,198 Wisconsin registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (174) and cellphones (669) or completed the survey online after receiving a text message (355). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics are representative of the registered voter population.",

            "excerpt": "Election 2024 is having an impact on our foreign policy. President Biden is appeasing Iran because polls are looking bad and his base is angry at him for backing our ally Israel.",
            "summary": "Did President Joe Biden receive advance warning of Iran's strike against Israel? Reuters is reporting that \"Iraqi, Turkish and Jordanian officials each said Iran had provided early warning of the attack last week, including some details.\" They further reported that Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said on Sunday that \"Iran gave neighbouring countries and Israel's ally the United States 72 hours' notice it would launch the strikes,\" according to Reuters.\nU.S. News and World Report also reports that Iran alerted Turkey to its planned operation against Israel and adds that \"Washington had conveyed to Tehran via Ankara that any action it took had to be 'within certain limits.'\"\nThe White House denies the story, which implies that Biden might have greenlighted the drone and missile onslaught, but it fits. Biden has been playing both sides of the field, declaring his support of Israel \"rock solid and unwavering\" until, that is, it began to cost the president political support.\nYoung people, key to Biden's reelection, are angry about Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, and have turned negative on the president's support of our ally. With pro-Palestinian demonstrations erupting across the nation and polls showing young voters gravitating to former President Donald Trump, Biden's support of the Jewish state has started … wavering.\nBiden told Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu over the weekend he will not back Israel in countering Iran's attack. Certainly no one wants a broad war in the region, and it is possible that a retaliatory move by Israel could provoke another round of attacks, and then another.\nBut Biden's caution could also be interpreted as yet another sign that the president, desperate to win in November, will do almost anything to prevent higher oil prices, another political tripwire.\nOn Maria Bartiromo's Fox Business show recently, Florida Republican Congressman Michael Waltz urged the Biden White House to \"cut off Iran's cash.\" Waltz forgets one thing: doing so would require curtailing Tehran's oil exports and would send energy prices through the roof. That is unacceptable to Biden.\nHence, Biden's appeasement of Tehran. When Trump left office, Iran was broke and isolated. Their Arab enemies in the region were increasingly united under the Abraham Accords, establishing diplomatic relations with Israel and forming a powerful bloc to counter Iran's malicious terror activities.\nWhat a difference three-and-a-half years makes.\nThe Biden White House enriched Iran by failing to enforce the tough sanctions imposed by the Trump administration, and by permitting $10 billion in relief funds to flow to Tehran, purportedly to buy electricity from Iraq. Biden's crack foreign policy team claims that this money will be used exclusively for humanitarian purposes, but all funds are fungible. Money for electricity also buys drones, and military aggression.\nBiden has turned a blind eye to the country's surging oil exports. Over the past year, Iran's production jumped by 50%, to a five-year high. This, despite ongoing Trump-era sanctions which supposedly limited Tehran's exports. The International Energy Agency reports that Iran exported 1.29 million barrels per day of crude oil last year and predicts overall production will increase another 160,000 barrels per day this year. Most incremental output has gone to China.\nWhy would Biden allow Iran to export more oil and stockpile money? Because he took office promising to end fossil fuel production on federal lands in the U.S. and committing to an improbable and hopelessly expensive switch to green energy.\nIt is nearly impossible that his team did not anticipate the cost to Americans, in the form of higher energy and electricity prices, of his \"green revolution\"; actually, given the extreme ideologues driving the White House bus, it is entirely possible.\nOn numerous fronts, including canceling the Keystone Pipeline, halting drilling permits and leases and raising the costs of exploration, Biden showily stalled the upward march of U.S. oil production that occurred under Trump. As a consequence, as the economy rebounded from the COVID-19 downturn, and when Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, oil prices rose and gasoline prices surged to an all-time high. Americans blamed Biden.\nWhen gasoline prices set records of $5 per gallon in June 2022, the Biden White House sensed electoral danger, and set out to buttress U.S. oil production by seeking incremental supplies wherever they could find them, including our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. They even sought help from Saudi Arabia, a country spurned by Biden, only to be turned down flat.\nWhen oil prices surged again last year, the White House even lifted sanctions on Venezuela, another unfriendly major oil exporter, under a flimsy agreement that required the country's hated leader Nicolas Maduro to allow free elections. When oil prices receded and the White House no longer needed to court the dictator, who of course did not allow a fair vote in his country's election, they resurrected most of the sanctions.\nBut Biden's caution could also be interpreted as yet another sign that the president, desperate to win in November, will do almost anything to prevent higher oil prices, another political tripwire.\nMeanwhile, they also allowed Iran's exports to rise. The excuse? Biden's team insisted they wanted to revive the Iran nuclear deal. Obama failed to produce an agreement that would prevent Iran from creating a nuclear weapon, as did Biden. The collapse of negotiations was almost guaranteed by repeated indications that Iran lied about ongoing uranium enrichment activity and its hidden efforts to build a nuclear device.\nToday, you can be sure Biden will continue his appeasement of the Islamic state, hoping that their oil exports will continue uninterrupted as he campaigns for reelection – even as Iran continues its malevolent activities in the region which now include, for the first time, directly attacking Israel.\nAs he ran for president, Joe Biden claimed to have extraordinary diplomatic capabilities and experience. During his presidency, he has directed the most humiliating military withdrawal in our history as we hastily abandoned Afghanistan, permitted Putin's deadly invasion of Ukraine, despite having ample warning, and has now reportedly signed off on Iran attacking our long-time ally, Israel.\nBiden reportedly wanted to be a historic president. Sadly, he is just that.",

            "excerpt": "The Supreme Court is looking at how cities can handle the homeless crisis. But, it's important to know government caused it with a mix of zoning regulations and limits on new houses.",
            "summary": "On Monday, April 22, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in City of Grants Pass v. Johnson. The question before the justices is: did the Ninth Circuit correctly hold that the Eighth Amendment prevents cities from enforcing civil or criminal restrictions on the homeless sleeping or camping on public property? Underlying the specific legal question in the case is a larger social question: How did our country get to where hundreds of thousands are homeless?\nReasonable people agree that the homeless crisis presents a serious public policy problem. Growing homeless populations encroaching on public and private property and the resulting conflicts among people who use or own those spaces have forced the nation and the courts, like the Ninth Circuit here, to grapple with the problem. But the solution won't be found in the courts. Courts can't build housing. And more affordable housing will solve the homeless crisis.\nMany believe that it's entirely mental illness and drug use that drive the homeless crisis. Those problems contribute to its rise. However, nonpartisan research led by Alex Horowitz at Pew confirms that attributing the growth in homelessness primarily to drug addiction or mental illness underappreciates the role of housing shortages. As Horowitz and his fellow researchers explain:\n\"A large body of academic research has consistently found that homelessness in an area is driven by housing costs, whether expressed in terms of rents, rent-to-income ratios, price-to-income ratios, or home prices. ... [H]ousing costs explain far more of the difference in rates of homelessness than variables such as substance use disorder, mental health, weather, the strength of the social safety net, poverty, or economic conditions.\"\nThat the homeless problem has worsened over the last several decades cannot be denied. Homelessness has existed in the country at least since the mid-1800s, but before the 1970s, homelessness generally ebbed and flowed with the economy.\nHowever, by 1984, federal officials estimated the number of homeless in the country to be between 250,000 and 350,000. Fast forward 40 years: last year, the federal government estimated the number of Americans without a place to stay for the night had doubled from that 1984 estimate.\nWhile the number of homeless began increasing in the '70s, so did the country's restrictions on land use. The massive growth in homelessness has paralleled growth in the number, complexity, and expense of land use regulations. Pervasive and increasingly restrictive land use laws are the principal cause of housing shortages throughout the country at all price points.\nRestrictions on building housing, especially lower-cost housing, have often come in the guise of zoning reform. Local and state officials regulate how we use our property through land use codes that apply to nearly all populated areas throughout the country. And other invidious ways to regulate the use of land developed or accelerated in the 1970s as well.\nIn coastal zones with the most acute housing shortages, permitting schemes drove up the cost of new homes and tested the bounds of the constitution. That phenomenon continues today, with the Supreme Court unanimously deciding earlier this month in Pacific Legal Foundation's Sheetz v. County of El Dorado case that legislatively imposed permitting fees on land use must both relate to the purported reason justifying the permit and be proportional to the impact of the planned land use.\nState planners set out how local officials may restrict the private use of land, and most communities of even modest size have enacted complicated and restrictive expensive land use schemes regulating which parcels may contain housing and what type.\nMoreover, the federal government began overreaching its regulatory authority and steadily impairing the right to use property in a non-nuisance manner, including for housing, in the 1970s as well. It did this under the guise of environmental protection laws born in the '70s, like the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act.\nThus, government \"gatekeepers\" at all levels decide where and how we can live, work, and recreate. As Richard D. Kahlenberg, in his new book \"Excluded: How Snob Zoning, Nimbyism, and Class Bias Build the Walls We Don't See,\" persuasively explains: \"Government gatekeepers ... dictate which buildings can be built and how they should look, which in turn determines who can live where.\"\nOur era of pervasive and highly restrictive land use has created housing shortages, particularly at the lower end of the market, where we might expect the homeless to find housing. How do heavy-handed government land use regulations do that?\nBy turning our right to use our property into a privilege that the government may or may not bestow. The country has all but ceded the right to use one's property to government land use planners, and one consequence of this decades-long error is plain to see in this case.\nAlthough the Biden administration should be commended for finally recognizing that the cost of housing must come down by increasing its supply, its 1960s-style big government solution to the problem — throwing money at it — won't work.\nNo. Instead, to increase the affordable housing supply for all, including the homeless, land use regulations should be drastically simplified where they cannot reasonably be eliminated. Or put another way, we can address the homeless crisis by taking away from the government planners.\nRestrictions on building housing, especially lower-cost housing, have often come in the guise of zoning reform. Local and state officials regulate how we use our property through land use codes that apply to nearly all populated areas throughout the country. And other invidious ways to regulate the use of land developed or accelerated in the 1970s as well.\nIn doing so, we'll free Americans to build more housing and put their property to good use more cheaply, free of unreasonable government regulations. These land use regulatory rollbacks must happen at all levels of government, including the federal level.\nBut that's not what the Ninth Circuit decided in the Grants Pass case. That Court gave us more government involvement in our lives, not less. The Ninth Circuit's Grants Pass rule, if adopted by the Supreme Court, would create a new, previously unknown Eighth Amendment right to sleep on public property, which would put costly new demands and responsibilities on local and state governments and the public purse.\nThat mistake would put even more power into the hands of government planners. That is exactly the wrong road for the court to take.\nBad land use planning policy has driven up the price of housing to crisis levels, making it unaffordable for too many, including many of the homeless. The road to curing the social ill of homelessness runs through the ingenuity of entrepreneurs and the market in providing low-cost housing. That will happen only if government land use planners get out of the way.",
