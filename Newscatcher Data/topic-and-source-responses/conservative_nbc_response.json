            "summary": "High-profile rightwing influencers were briefed on House Speaker Mike Johnson's voter registration bill well in advance of its announcement in what appears to be a coordinated social media campaign meant to drum up support for the legislation, which is dead on arrival on the Senate.\nConservative influencers posted dozens of times before Johnson, R-La., publicly announced the bill alongside former President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, calling on Congress to pass the bill, which has not yet been filed, and offering policy details that are still not available to the public.\nThe legislation targets voting by non-citizens, which is already illegal and very rare. Johnson's appearance at Mar-a-Lago came at a time when his speakership is in a precarious position, with attacks from far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who has a significant social media following. Getting some public support and praise from Trump could give Johnson a bit of protection with the Republican base, as could drumming up support from conservative social media influencers.\nAt 3:50 p.m. ET on Friday, Ryan Fournier, the chair of Students for Trump who boasts a million followers on X, appears to have been the first to post the name of the bill and details of the legislation.\nJohnson's press conference was scheduled to begin at 4:30 p.m. ET on Friday but began just after 5 p.m. Neither the speaker nor his office would provide specifics on the legislation in advance of Friday's event when asked by NBC News, but his office confirmed Monday that background information about the bill had been sent in advance to conservative-leaning influencers.\nIn the hours leading up to Johnson and Trump's press conference, social media posters including Libs of TikTok, DC_Draino and EndWokeness promoted the legislation online. They all called the bill 'the SAVE Act,' though Johnson did not name it as such.\n\"PASS THE BILL,' wrote DC_Draino at 4:22 p.m., claiming the bill 'would require blue states to obtain proof of citizenship for voter registration.'\nOn X, EndWokeness wrote that the bill would add penalties for election officials registering noncitizens to vote.\nRep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, reposted EndWokeness's post at 4:40 p.m., saying he'd authored the bill. A spokesman for the Republican lawmaker said the bill has not yet been filed yet, but Roy posted a screencap of the first few lines of legislation ahead of Johnson's speech.\nhas not yet been filed yet, but Roy posted a screencap of the first few lines of legislation ahead of Johnson's speech. The bill is dead on arrival, with Democrats controlling the U.S. Senate. Johnson said Friday, though, that simply putting the bill to a vote would be \"interesting.\"\n\"When we put this bill on the floor, you're going to see a record vote by Republicans and Democrats,\" he said. \"They're going to have to go on record, do you believe that Americans and Americans alone should be the ones who vote in American elections? We're about to find out their answer.\"\nIt is illegal for non-citizens to vote in state and federal elections, though some municipalities allow non-citizen voting in local elections only.\nChrissy Clark, a conservative influencer who contributes to Turning Point USA, appears to have been one of the individuals who received early information about the legislation.\n'Speaker Mike Johnson just dropped information about the SAVE Act, which basically its only goal is that only U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections — what a concept,' Clark said in a video posted more than 20 minutes before Johnson would begin speaking.\nClark's post included numerous details about the bill that were not yet public.\n'The whole message that he's trying to portray is you should be required to provide proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration. That doesn't necessarily mean a state-issued ID,' she said in the produced short video, which was posted on TikTok and X.\nClark's post is tagged with the hashtag #partnership, a tag some influencers use to disclose they have been paid for a post. Clark did not respond to an emailed request for comment, and Johnson's office did not respond to a request for comment on paying influencers.\nAnother conservative-leaning Twitter and TikTok account, Ding News, posted a produced video about the \"common sense SAVE Act\" at 4:11 p.m., nearly an hour before the press conference took place. An email sent to Ding News was not returned.\nAnother conservative influencer, Isabella DeLuca, posted about the legislation at 5:07 p.m., at the same minute when the press conference began.\n\"Speaker Johnson just introduced the SAVE Act, a pivotal measure to fortify our democracy and save our elections,\" DeLuca wrote on Twitter.\nLast month, DeLuca was arrested on Jan. 6 charges, with the FBI saying she climbed into the Capitol through a broken window and helped hand a table out a window that was used to assault police officers. Her Twitter account had been set to private earlier in the day, before her post about Johnson's bill.\n\"America's democracy hinges on the integrity of our elections,\" the Jan. 6 defendant wrote.\nRyan J.

            "excerpt": "House Speaker Mike Johnson told members that they expect to vote on separate aid bills for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies on \"Saturday evening\" after an amendment process.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Facing a divided party and pressure to act, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced he will roll out four bills Wednesday to provide assistance to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan and advance other national security priorities, with the hope of holding final votes on Saturday.\nThe bills represent a major test of Johnson's ability to navigate a thicket of political and global challenges with a wafer-thin majority. And it comes as Johnson, R-La., faces a serious threat to his gavel from Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky.\nJohnson's biggest challenge is Ukraine funding, an issue that has bitterly divided the GOP. He has been squeezed by conservative security hawks who want to help Ukraine fend off Russia's aggression and by an empowered isolationist wing that is feeding off former President Donald Trump's criticism of NATO and prior Ukraine aid measures.\nMultiple Republicans say they oppose any funding for Ukraine, meaning that a significant share of Democrats will be required to carry that measure over the finish line.\nIn a message to members before releasing the legislation, Johnson said there would be \"three bills that will fund America's national security interests and allies in Israel, the Indo-Pacific, and Ukraine, including a loan structure for aid, and enhanced strategy and accountability.\"\nHe said Republican leadership will come forward with an amendment process \"alongside a fourth bill that includes the REPO Act,\" which is aimed at seizing Russian assets to benefit Ukraine; the House-passed bill to ban TikTok in the U.S. unless it divests from its China-based owner; as well as \"sanctions and other measures to confront Russia, China, and Iran.\"\n'We expect the vote on final passage on these bills to be on Saturday evening,' Johnson said in a text message obtained by NBC News.\nHe said there will also be a \"border security bill that includes the core components of H.R.2\" — a conservative, House-passed immigration bill — moving under a separate process. That measure serves as a sweetener for reticent conservatives who are unhappy that the aid bills don't include domestic immigration provisions.\nSwift conservative pushback Multiple House conservatives pushed back immediately on social media Wednesday after Johnson's message went out, complaining that the border measures weren't directly tied to Ukraine funding.\n\"The Republican Speaker of the House is seeking a rule to pass almost $100 billion in foreign aid — while unquestionably, dangerous criminals, terrorists, & fentanyl pour across our border. The border 'vote' in this package is a watered-down dangerous cover vote. I will oppose,\" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, wrote on X.\nRep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., the most recent chair of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, said: \"Anything less than tying Ukraine aid to real border security fails to live up to @SpeakerJohnson's own words just several weeks ago. Our constituents demand — and deserve — more from us.\"\nRep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, earlier called aid to Ukraine unnecessary, saying: 'I'm not giving them a nickel today, tomorrow or next week.\"\n'Putin is not going into Poland. I don't care what you say. Besides, anyway, it doesn't really matter because ... when Donald Trump wins, Putin's leavin'. Putin's leavin' Ukraine,' Nehls said ahead of the bill's release, without explaining his logic.\nHouse Democrats have repeatedly called on Johnson to bring up a Senate-passed foreign aid package instead, calling it the best — if not only — path to getting a bill on Biden's desk. They have posted a \"discharge petition\" with 195 signatories to end-run Johnson and force a vote on that bill. It needs 218 votes to come up, meaning it will need the backing of some Republicans in addition to Democrats.\nAt a Wednesday meeting with Democrats, House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., told members that they need to use their 'personal relationships' with Republicans to garner support for the discharge petition, according to two people familiar with her comments.\nTreasury Secretary Yellen dials up pressure At a bilateral meeting later Wednesday with Ukraine Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen plans to dial up the pressure on House Republicans to act.\n'The failure of House Republicans to act to support Ukraine in this pivotal moment of the war for so long has been inexcusable—and detrimental to our national security,' Yellen will say, according to a Treasury source. 'Every moment of delay by House Republicans strengthens Putin and emboldens America's adversaries around the world who are closely watching to see if we, the United States, maintains its resolve to support a democratic Ukraine as it fends off an autocratic Russia.'\nMeanwhile, Greene has not said when she might force a vote on her \"motion to vacate\" the speaker's chair, which would take a simple majority to remove Johnson from his job. Her effort gained a cosponsor in Massie on Tuesday, who predicted Johnson would be voted out.\nIt's not clear the votes are there to oust Johnson. Many conservatives, including some who voted to remove former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, have not joined the effort to oust Johnson. Some Democrats have also said they'll vote to protect Johnson from a motion to depose him.\nBut Massie said that would only hurt his standing with the GOP in the long term.\n'Then he goes further in the hole with Republicans. He becomes toxic to the conference. For every Democrat who comes to his aid he'll lose 2 to 3 more Republicans,' Massie said. 'He doesn't have much shelf life after that.'\nJohnson struck a defiant tone Tuesday when asked about the threat to his gavel, calling it 'absurd' while saying he's 'not concerned' about the motion and will continue to do his job.\nSahil Kapur Rebecca Kaplan Julie Tsirkin contributed.",

            "excerpt": "House Republican impeachment managers will walk the articles over to the Senate chamber Tuesday with what is expected to be a short-lived trial beginning on Wednesday.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — After a weeklong delay, the House of Representatives on Tuesday afternoon will send its articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to the Senate, a spokesperson for Speaker Mike Johnson confirmed.\nIt will kick off what's expected to be a very short trial in the upper chamber — one that could wrap up by week's end. However, Republicans, who are demanding a full Senate trial, are fighting to drag out the process in a bid to shine the spotlight on what they see as Mayorkas' failure to curtail migrant crossings and secure the southern border.\nAs was done for the two Donald Trump impeachments, the impeachment managers will escort a pair of articles from the House chamber, across the Rotunda and onto the Senate floor sometime after 2 p.m. ET.\nThe Senate will receive the articles, and all 100 senators will be sworn in as jurors in the trial on Wednesday afternoon. It is unclear exactly how long the trial will last, though Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has said the Senate will deal with the matter 'expeditiously.'\nIt's expected that Senate Democrats, who control the chamber, will band together and vote to dismiss or table the issue, then move on to other business, including the chamber's need to renew a critical spy tool before it expires Friday. None of the Senate's 51 Democrats have said they support the Mayorkas impeachment, and even a handful of GOP senators have said the impeachment is meritless.\n\"Impeachment should never be used to settle a policy disagreement; that would set a horrible precedent for the Congress,\" Schumer said in a floor speech Monday. \"Nevertheless, the Senate's plan has not changed since last week. We are ready to go whenever the House sends us the articles. We want to address this issue as expeditiously as possible.\"\nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican, had originally planned to send the Mayorkas articles to the Senate on April 10, but Senate conservatives, led by Mike Lee of Utah, successfully lobbied the speaker to postpone the action to prevent a speedy dismissal by Democrats at the end of the week as lawmakers were preparing to leave Washington.\nMayorkas, Biden's top border official and the first Latino to lead the Homeland Security Department, became only the second Cabinet secretary in history — and the first since 1876 — to be impeached by the House. Republicans' first attempt to impeach him collapsed spectacularly on the House floor, but they were successful on the second try, on Feb. 13, with just a single vote to spare; the tally was 214-213, with three Republicans joining all Democrats in voting no.\nIn their two articles, House Republicans charged Mayorkas with 'high crimes and misdemeanors' for failing to enforce immigration and border security laws, resulting, they said, in 'millions' of undocumented immigrants illegally crossing into the U.S. each year; and for knowingly lying under oath to Congress.\nMayorkas' Democratic allies have lambasted the GOP's impeachment as a politically motivated 'sham' launched months before the presidential election and argued that Republicans' criticism of the DHS secretary amounts to policy differences rather than impeachable offenses. Several conservatives have argued against impeaching Mayorkas as well, blasting the move as inappropriate. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., a Trump ally, called it 'the worst, dumbest exercise and use of time.'\nThe 11 House impeachment managers, the prosecutors appointed by Johnson, are a mix of senior Republicans and conservative hard-liners.\nThey are: Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green of Tennessee; the Homeland panel's vice chair, Michael Guest of Mississippi; Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul of Texas, who previously was Homeland chairman; Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York; Rep. August Pfluger of Texas; Rep. Laurel Lee of Florida; four conservative Freedom Caucus members: Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Clay Higgins of Louisiana, Ben Cline of Virginia and Harriet Hageman of Wyoming; and far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., one of Trump's top allies on the Hill who led the push to impeach Mayorkas.",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — A second House Republican said he will support the effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson from power, pointing to the GOP leader's handling of foreign aid for Ukraine and other U.S. allies.\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who is a member of Johnson's own Rules Committee, said he informed the speaker directly in a closed-door meeting of House Republicans Tuesday that he is co-sponsoring the resolution offered by far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to remove Johnson, R-La., from the top job.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. Getty Images \"He should pre-announce his resignation (as Boehner did), so we can pick a new Speaker without ever being without a GOP speaker,\" Massie wrote on X, referring to former GOP Speaker John Boehner, who resigned in the middle of his term in 2015 while facing a similar conservative rebellion from Massie and others.\nJohnson told rank-and-file House Republicans in the room that he won't resign, Massie said, a point he reiterated to reporters.\n'I am not resigning. And it is in my view an absurd notion that someone would bring a vacate motion when we are simply here trying to do our jobs,' Johnson said after the private meeting. 'It is not helpful to the country. It does not help the House Republicans advance our agenda which is in the best interest of the American people here: a secure border, sound governance — and it's not helpful to the unity that we have in the body.'\nHe added: 'I am not concerned about this. I am going to do my job.'\nWith the GOP majority hanging by a thread, Johnson can only afford exactly two GOP defections if Greene files her motion as \"privileged,\" forcing a floor vote to vacate the speaker's chair. To successfully remove him in that scenario, at least three Republicans — and all Democrats — would need to vote for the motion to vacate for Johnson to lose his job.\nSome Democrats, however, have said they would vote to save Johnson to prevent the House from spiraling out of control, similar to what happened last fall after conservatives toppled then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, ushering in three weeks of chaos and ultimately paving the way for Johnson's ascent.\nThis week's conservative rebellion comes as Johnson attempts to move stalled foreign aid for U.S. allies including Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan through the House. Far-right members, including Greene, are demanding that Johnson and his leadership team focus their attention and resources on shoring up security of the southern border with Mexico.\nMassie's support for Johnson's ouster is significant in one other regard. The Kentuckian serves on the Rules Committee, known on Capitol Hill as the \"speaker's committee,\" because its members are appointed by the speaker and typically carry out the speaker's wishes. Massie, however, was put on the influential panel by McCarthy last year, and Johnson has had to bypass the Rules Committee on a number of occasions to get critical legislation to the floor.\nScott Wong Rebecca Kaplan Kyle Stewart, Syedah Asghar, Lori Rampani, Ryan Nobles and Sahil Kapur contributed.",

            "summary": "TOPEKA, Kan. — A beloved ostrich at the Topeka Zoo & Conservation Center in Kansas has died after swallowing a staff member's keys.\nThe zoo announced in a social media post Friday that the 5-year-old ostrich named Karen had reached beyond her exhibit's fence and grabbed and swallowed the employee's keys. Staff consulted with experts around the U.S. 'to undergo surgical and non-surgical efforts to minimize the impact of the keys. Unfortunately, these efforts were unsuccessful,' the zoo said.\nKaren was euthanized Thursday and 'passed away in staff's hands,' Topeka Zoo Interim Director Fawn Moser said in an email.\n'We are devastated by the loss of Karen,' Moser said in a statement. 'She was not just an animal; she was a beloved member of our community. Our thoughts are with our dedicated animal care team, who formed deep bonds with Karen during her time with us.'\nThe adored ostrich had been at the zoo since March 2023. She was known for her love of playing in water 'and, best of all, being our ‘dancing queen!'' the zoo said.\nThe zoo said it undertook an investigation and 'is taking appropriate actions regarding the team member involved.' The zoo also said it would review and enhance safety protocols for its animals.\nThe Topeka Zoo & Conservation Center is home to more than 300 animals exhibited throughout 35 acres, according to its website.\nThe Associated Press",

            "excerpt": "The South Carolina senator is working to make himself the face of the Black conservative movement as the GOP tries to make inroads with Black voters.",
            "summary": "Last July, a town hall attendee in Salem, New Hampshire, asked Sen. Tim Scott if he 'believed he could swing the historically Democratic-supporting African American community.' Scott's response was guarded.\n'Maybe,' the then-presidential candidate replied. 'I'm a fairly conservative candidate. That does not necessarily bode well for my ability to persuade die-hard Democrats, Black or white or any other color.'\nBut now, with Scott in the middle of speculation about former President Donald Trump's pick for a 2024 running mate, the South Carolina senator is leaning into his ability to engage with the growing number of Black voters that polling data suggest are open to voting for Trump in this election.\nScott has launched a weekly series, 'America's Starting Five,' with other Black Republicans in Congress, in a bid both to make Black conservatives more visible and to reach Black voters. The series, which will discuss ' politics, race, and the 2024 election' and which Scott hopes to continue at least through the summer, is also a vehicle for him to lean into a skill set that could be an asset for Trump: his perceived ability to expand the party's tent.\n' politics, race, and the 2024 election' and which Scott hopes to continue at least through the summer, is also a vehicle for him to lean into a skill set that could be an asset for Trump: his perceived ability to expand the party's tent. 'Sen. Scott recognizes that he can draw people into the party, particularly Black men,' said a source familiar with the planning of the series. 'This is an effort to highlight that.'\nA composite analysis of NBC polling data from 2023 found that among Black voters, men under 50 years old gave by far the lowest ratings to President Joe Biden — and the highest ones to Trump, though a majority still viewed Trump negatively.\nStill, almost 40% of those voters said they'd vote for Trump over Biden in a general election, compared to no more than 15% in any of the other age and gender categories among Black voters, a split well outside the margin of error for those subgroups.\nThat's largely what's behind other recent surveys showing Trump garnering more support from Black voters than ever, cutting into Biden by double digits compared to the 2020 results, even though the president still leads among Black voters.\nA shift in tone Scott's willingness to focus on his race is a departure from the early days of his presidential campaign, when he was at times hesitant to lean too deeply into his identity, even as supporters encouraged him to highlight a factor they believed made him the most electable 2024 presidential candidate on the GOP side.\n'Here are four non-Black, Black people,' Scott said while leading a roundtable discussion alongside four other prominent Black Republicans in the first episode of his new series: Reps. Burgess Owens of Utah, Byron Donalds of Florida, John James of Michigan and Wesley Hunt of Texas.\nThe panelists were taking their turns dissecting a past misstep by Biden, and the focus of the group had turned to a 2020 interview he did with radio host Charlamagne tha God, during which Biden suggested that Black Americans who don't vote for him 'ain't really Black.'\n'The good news is in 2024, it looks like four out of 10 of us ain't Black enough for Joe Biden,' Scott continued.\nAs Scott's presidential campaign went on last year before he dropped out in November, his tune began to shift. He became more vocal not only about his appeal to the small but growing number of Black conservatives nationwide, but also how he was uniquely positioned to help the party make more inroads with voters of color, as arguably the most prominent Black Republican elected official in the country.\n'I believe that I create a red wave where we win back the Senate, we expand our majority in the House, and you do that by having the kind of candidate who — the literal truth of my life — destroys the lies of the radical left and creates a red wave,' Scott said at one of his final campaign stops in October.\nThat 'red wave,' in his view, would be fueled in part by his life story: A Black man from South Carolina, raised by a single mother in a low-income neighborhood, who went from 'cotton to Congress' in a single generation, as he often riffed during his events.\n'I have lived a similar experience to people who find themselves trapped in poverty, who are today growing up in single parent households, who are wondering whether the American dream can work for them,' Scott said.\nA valuable surrogate Trump seems aware of Scott's potential and has certainly worked to keep his former primary opponent close.\nIn addition to appearing alongside Trump at several campaign rallies in the waning days of the Republican primary, Scott was invited by Trump to attend and speak at his Mar-a-Lago fundraiser last week, which the campaign said netted $50 million across groups including Trump's main super PAC and other fundraising committees.\nA day before the South Carolina Republican primary, Scott accompanied Trump to the Black Conservative Federation's annual gala, where Trump was the recipient of the 'Champion of Black America' award. Scott was the only former Trump rival to appear at the event.\nAnd Trump has repeatedly said that Scott is better at campaigning on his behalf than he was campaigning for himself.\nThe Biden-Harris campaign appears skeptical that Scott — or whoever Trump ultimately selects as a running mate — will be successful in recruiting more Black voters to the Republican Party.\n'Regardless of who Donald Trump's running mate is, these are the facts: While he was president, Black unemployment and uninsured rates spiked, his encouragement of white nationalism divided the nation, and his botched Covid-19 response disproportionately left Black people dead,' said Jasmine Harris, the Biden campaign's Black media director. 'Black voters remain some of the most informed and engaged voters every election, and this November they will get behind Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who put Black Americans at the forefront of their administration's work.'\nNnamdi Egwuonwu",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The policy contrasts between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are sharpening as the general election campaign gets fully underway.\nBut what does the choice represent for ordinary voters and the economic and cultural issues they care about? A rematch between the Democratic incumbent and his Republican predecessor may feel uninspiring to many voters, but the policy stakes are enormous for tens of millions of Americans — and the world.\nHere are seven big issues at stake in the 2024 election.\nAbortion The contrast: Biden favors federal abortion protections; Trump opposes them. Trump supported nationwide restrictions on abortion as president but now downplays the need for a federal ban, as Republicans are divided over the issue. Biden does not support federal limits.\nThe contrast: Biden favors federal abortion protections; Trump opposes them. Trump supported nationwide restrictions on abortion as president but now downplays the need for a federal ban, as Republicans are divided over the issue. Biden does not support federal limits. Biden has championed the Women's Health Protection Act, a bill to protect abortion rights in all 50 states under federal law and prohibit medically unnecessary hurdles to accessing the procedure. He has asked voters to send him a Democratic Congress that supports legal abortion to achieve that.\nTrump has boasted that he \"broke Roe v. Wade\" by picking three of the five Supreme Court justices who overturned it, delivering on a four-decade goal of the GOP. More recently, Trump has openly fretted that the backlash may cost him and his party the election. Last week, Trump said the issue should be left to states, a shift from his support for nationwide restrictions when he was president. His new stance has drawn pushback from GOP allies, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and anti-abortion-rights advocates, who say that he is wrong and that Republicans should not be deterred from their long-standing goal of enacting some nationwide abortion limits.\nSome Republicans downplay the prospects of federal abortion restrictions' passing Congress, even if they win full control. Biden and his allies are telling voters to look at the GOP's long history of championing federal restrictions and not their recent rhetoric.\nImmigration The contrast: Trump has promised a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration and tougher executive actions; Biden is asking Congress to give him more tools to manage an overwhelmed border and create new legal pathways to immigrate to the U.S.\nThe contrast: Trump has promised a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration and tougher executive actions; Biden is asking Congress to give him more tools to manage an overwhelmed border and create new legal pathways to immigrate to the U.S. Trump has called existing border laws an existential threat to the U.S., saying migrants are 'poisoning the blood of our country' and bringing new 'languages.' His campaign website says: 'President Trump will shut down Biden's border disaster. He will again end catch-and-release, restore Remain in Mexico, and eliminate asylum fraud. In cooperative states, President Trump will deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement to assist with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals.'\nAfter having rescinded some of Trump's policies, Biden has recently shifted to support stricter immigration laws as the system remains overwhelmed. He championed a bipartisan bill to raise the bar for gaining asylum, grant more U.S. resources to process asylum claims and turn away migrants who do not qualify, and empower the president to temporarily shut down the border if migration levels hit certain triggers. (Republicans blocked the bill in the Senate amid lobbying by Trump, who wants to use the border as an election issue.) Biden has also endorsed the U.S. Citizenship Act, which would grant a pathway to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally if they pass background checks and pay their taxes.\nFundamentally, Trump has aligned with forces who want less immigration into the country, while Biden has embraced the belief that immigrants make the U.S. better.\nHealth care and prescription drugs The contrast: Biden wants to extend Affordable Care Act provisions and empower Medicare to negotiate more prescription drugs; Trump has aggressively criticized the ACA but not offered a health care plan.\nThe contrast: Biden wants to extend Affordable Care Act provisions and empower Medicare to negotiate more prescription drugs; Trump has aggressively criticized the ACA but not offered a health care plan. Biden, who was vice president when the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, sees it as a cherished achievement to protect and strengthen. The law, also known as \"Obamacare,\" which has extended coverage to 45 million people through subsidies, insurance mandates and a Medicaid expansion, continues to face conservative opposition.\nSeparately, Biden has touted a provision in his party-line Inflation Reduction Act that empowers Medicare to negotiate lower prices for 10 prescription drugs. He said he wants to boost that to 50 if he is re-elected, with the goal of $200 billion in savings.\nTrump spent his four years as president fighting unsuccessfully to repeal and unravel the law — through legislation and executive action and endorsing lawsuits to wipe it out. In November, Trump called for revisiting plans to \"terminate\" the ACA. He has recently sought to downplay that and insists he only wants to improve the law. But he has not offered a health care plan. Many of his GOP allies in Congress still favor repealing or undoing the ACA, including a budget by the Republican Study Committee, which boasts about 80% of the House GOP conference as members, including Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana.\nTaxes The contrast: Trump's 2017 tax cuts expire at the end of next year, and he has called for extending them; Biden has called for raising taxes on families earning over $400,000 to fund various priorities.\nThe contrast: Trump's 2017 tax cuts expire at the end of next year, and he has called for extending them; Biden has called for raising taxes on families earning over $400,000 to fund various priorities. A series of Trump tax cuts, which Republicans passed on a party-line basis in 2017, expire at the end of 2025. Congress and the winner of the election will decide what happens to them.\nIn a recent private speech to wealthy donors, Trump said his policies include \"extending the Trump tax cuts\" if he is elected, according to a Trump campaign official. That would preserve lower rates across the income spectrum, with the biggest benefits for top earners.\nBiden has attacked that law as a giveaway to the wealthiest Americans, vowing to make \"big corporations and the very wealthy finally pay their fair share.\" He has backed a corporate tax rate hike from 21% to 28% and said that \"nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny in federal taxes.\" Biden is also calling for a $3,600-per-child tax cut for families, an $800 average tax break for \"front-line workers\" and a 25% minimum tax on billionaires, according to a newly released campaign plank.\nThe expiration of the Trump tax cuts will restore the unlimited federal deduction for state and local taxes, which Republicans had capped at $10,000 in the 2017 law. Republicans broadly support preserving the cap, with some exceptions, while most Democrats want to lift it.\nJudges and the Supreme Court The contrast: Their track records tell a clear story. Trump has picked young conservative judges to serve on the federal bench, while Biden has picked liberals with a focus on professional and personal diversity.\nThe contrast: Their track records tell a clear story. Trump has picked young conservative judges to serve on the federal bench, while Biden has picked liberals with a focus on professional and personal diversity. One of the clearest contrasts is what kinds of judges Trump and Biden would pick for lifetime appointments on the federal courts. A simple way for voters to think about it is whether they prefer new judges with the conservative views of Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump's first Supreme Court pick, or with the liberal views of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, Biden's (so far only) high court pick.\nAs president, Trump nominated young conservative judges who will serve for generations. Biden has focused on finding judges with diverse backgrounds and résumés, including more civil rights lawyers and public defenders.\nPerhaps the biggest question is whether a Supreme Court vacancy will open up in the next four years. The presidential election winner and the party that controls the Senate would fill it.\nTrade The contrast: Trump is pushing a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports; Biden's White House opposes that, saying it would raise inflation.\nThe contrast: Trump is pushing a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports; Biden's White House opposes that, saying it would raise inflation. Trump, long a skeptic of U.S. trade deals, has proposed to impose a 10% tariff on all imported goods if he returns to the White House. He recently told Fox News that it could be 60% — or potentially 'more than that' — on imports of Chinese goods.\nBiden opposes that idea. In a memo over the weekend, the White House slammed the idea of \"across-the-board tariffs that would raise taxes and prices by $1,500 per American family,\" without naming Trump; it referred to an estimate by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, that Trump's 10% tax on imports could cost an average American household $1,500 per year.\nBiden, instead, has sought to boost domestic manufacturing with major federal investments in semiconductors and electric vehicles.\nForeign policy and NATO The contrast: Biden favors Ukraine aid, while Trump is skeptical of it; Biden supports NATO and a traditional view of American power, while Trump has criticized NATO and voiced some isolationist views.\nThe contrast: Biden favors Ukraine aid, while Trump is skeptical of it; Biden supports NATO and a traditional view of American power, while Trump has criticized NATO and voiced some isolationist views. The clearest example of the foreign policy differences between the two concerns the fate of Ukraine, which is running low on ammunition and says it needs U.S. assistance to continue holding off Russia's aggression. Biden is an ardent proponent of helping Ukraine, while Trump has poured cold water on U.S. aid to Ukraine and successfully pressured House Republicans to block it since they took the majority in January 2023.\nAnd that points to a deeper divide: Biden is an outspoken supporter of the NATO alliance as a bulwark against adversaries like Russia and China and of preserving the post-World War II order. Trump has dialed up his criticisms of NATO and aligned with a growing isolationist wing in the U.S. that wants to be less involved in global affairs. Trump recently said that as president, he 'would encourage' Russia 'to do whatever the hell they want' to member countries who are 'delinquent' in their dues.\nSahil Kapur",

            "excerpt": "84% of AAPI adults agree climate change exists, compared to 74% of the general U.S. population, new research says.",
            "summary": "Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in the United States are more likely than the overall adult population to believe in human-caused climate change, according to a new poll. It also suggests that partisanship may not have as much of an impact on this group's environmental views, compared to Americans overall.\nA recent poll from AAPI Data and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds 84% of AAPI adults agree climate change exists. In comparison, 74% of U.S. adults hold the same sentiment. And three-quarters of AAPI adults who accept climate change is real attribute it entirely or mostly to human activity. Among the general U.S. adult population surveyed in an AP-NORC poll in September, only 61% say humans are causing it.\nThe poll is part of an ongoing project exploring the views of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, whose views can usually not be highlighted in other surveys because of small sample sizes and lack of linguistic representation.\nScientists overwhelmingly agree that heat-trapping gases released from the combustion of fossil fuels are pushing up global temperatures, upending weather patterns and endangering animal species. Many scientific organizations have made public statements on the issue.\nIn terms of partisanship, the percentage of AAPI Democrats, 84%, who acknowledge climate change falls exactly in line with the share of Democrats overall in the September poll. The share of AAPI Republicans who believe there is a climate crisis is lower, but they somewhat outnumber Republicans in general, 68% versus 49%.\nAdrian Wong, 26, of Whippany, New Jersey, is registered as unaffiliated but leans Republican. A biology major in college, the Chinese American says the science behind climate change is indisputable.\n'I've probably done more or looked more into it than the average person has,' Wong said. 'It's to me clear that it's changing due to human activity, not natural shifts.'\nThere has been growing conflict within the Republican Party between those who insist climate change is a progressive-generated hoax and those — mostly younger generations — who say the issue cannot be ignored. GOP lawmakers, in general, refuse to consider measures like mandated lowering of carbon emissions. However, some consider that an untenable position long-term. American Conservation Coalition, the largest conservative environmental group in the nation, has said Republicans running for office cannot risk alienating people who care about climate change.\nWong is not surprised that AAPI conservatives like himself recognize that the climate is changing. He thinks they are more highly educated and more likely to be exposed to science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n'It wouldn't surprise me if they were more likely to have studied more and actually more likely to have studied in science and STEM-related fields rather than, say like, finance or something,' Wong said.\nWhile climate change is an afterthought to her parents, Analisa Harangozo, 35, of Alameda, California, worries a great deal about it. She has noticed a rise in 'crazy heatwaves and droughts and just like crazy weather in general' in the San Francisco Bay Area. She and her husband are teaching their sons — ages 7 and 4 — to take small steps to reduce their carbon footprint like composting, growing food and eating less meat. They're also trying to minimize their accumulation of household items.\n'I always second-guess myself, ‘Do I really need this?'' Harangozo said. 'Stuff will eventually end up in the landfill. So, we're really mindful with the products we buy, and whether or not they can be recycled or they're made from materials that are natural, like wood or what-not.'\nA registered independent with Democratic leanings, Harangozo is open to proposals from California Gov. Gavin Newsom and other state lawmakers to slash greenhouse gas emissions and invest in renewable energy.\n'I'm not knowledgeable enough to know what an attainable goal is,' she said. 'But, whatever it takes to actually make a difference, I'm all for it. I fully support.'\nKarthick Ramakrishnan, a public policy professor at the University of California, Riverside, and founder of AAPI Data, said the richness and detail of the data shows environmental groups need to consider reaching out to AAPI populations. They make up a relatively small share of the U.S. population — around 7%, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of 2021 census data — but their numbers are growing quickly.\n'Asian American and Pacific Islander voters are environmental voters,' Ramakrishnan said. 'Many of us still have an image in our minds of a particular kind of person maybe of a particular race, gender or age group. What we see here is across the board Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders care about the environment.'\nAsian American and Pacific Islanders may also have more of a stake in climate change because of connections to relatives abroad. China, considered one of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases alongside the U.S., vowed last year to reduce emissions. More Chinese companies are considering selling wind and solar power equipment in other countries. Around this time last year, Japan was preparing for another sweltering summer and risks of floods and landslides. That country has also pledged to curb emissions.\nHeavy rains swept across Pakistan last month, causing landslides and leaving over 36 people dead and dozens of others injured. In 2022, unprecedented rainfall and flooding in that country killed more than 1,700. In India, farmers are grappling with frequent cyclones and extreme heat. In southern India, the city of Bengaluru is seeing water levels running desperately low after an unusually hot February and March.\n'There's a fairly high level concern of what climate change means to low-income countries,' Ramakrishnan said. 'That sensitivity is either because people still have friends or family back in their home country or at least have some concern about what climate change does to other countries.'",

            "excerpt": "The latest gun rights dispute concerns the Biden administration's effort to regulate gun-making kits the same way as commercially available firearms.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to consider whether the Biden administration can lawfully regulate so-called ghost guns — firearms that are made from kits available online that people can assemble at home.\nThe justices took up a Biden administration appeal in defense of regulations that a lower court invalidated. The provisions in question are currently in effect while litigation continues.\nIn August of last year, the Supreme Court allowed the regulation to be enforced on a 5-4 vote, with Chief Justice John Roberts and fellow conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the three liberal justices in the majority.\nThe federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, commonly known as ATF, issued the regulations in 2022 to tackle what it claims has been an abrupt increase in the availability of ghost guns. The guns are difficult for law enforcement to trace, with the administration calling them a major threat to public safety.\nThe rule clarified that the parts used to make ghost guns fit within the definition of 'firearm' under the federal Gun Control Act, meaning the government has the power to regulate them the same way it regulates firearms manufactured and sold through the traditional process.\nThe regulations require manufacturers and sellers of the kits to obtain licenses, mark the products with serial numbers, conduct background checks and maintain records.\nTexas-based U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor last year ruled in favor of Jennifer VanDerStok and Michael Andren, who own components they want to use to build guns. Plaintiffs also include gun rights groups and makers and sellers of ghost guns.\nAfter the Supreme Court allowed the regulation to remain in effect while litigation moved forward, the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals mostly ruled for the challengers.\n\"Because Congress has neither authorized the expansion of firearm regulation nor permitted the criminalization of previously lawful conduct, the proposed rule constitutes unlawful agency action, in direct contravention of the legislature's will,\" the ruling said.\nIf that decision were allowed to go into effect, \"anyone could buy a kit online and assemble a fully functional gun in minutes — no background check, records, or serial number required,\" Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in court papers.\n\"The result would be a flood of untraceable ghost guns into our nation's communities, endangering the public and thwarting law-enforcement efforts to solve violent crimes,\" she added.\nThe challengers agreed with the Biden administration that the Supreme Court should take up the case, citing its nationwide importance.\nTheir lawyers wrote that it is not the job of the ATF to expand the meaning of \"firearm\" under the Gun Control Act.\n\"If that definition has become obsolete or unsatisfactory in any way, that is an issue for Congress to address,\" they wrote.\nThe Supreme Court's conservative majority has backed gun rights in multiple cases, including the landmark 2022 ruling that for the first time recognized that the Constitution's Second Amendment includes a right to bear arms outside the home.\nThe court is currently weighing the scope of that decision in a case concerning whether people accused of domestic violence have a right to own firearms.\nThe ghost guns case, however, is on a separate legal question related to ATF's regulatory authority, not the right to bear arms.\nThe justices are set to decide a similar case in the coming weeks, a challenge to another ATF regulation that banned \"bump stocks,\" an accessory that allows semi-automatic rifles to be fired rapidly.\nLawrence Hurley",

The vote of 60-34 sends the bill to President Joe Biden, who has championed it. The legislation extends Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, for two more years.\nThe final vote came after the Senate defeated six amendments from progressive and conservative senators who said the spying powers are too broad and demanded protections for Americans' civil liberties and privacy. The Biden administration and FISA supporters had warned that even a brief lapse could have a detrimental impact on the intelligence-gathering process.\nSenators just missed the midnight deadline to reauthorize the FISA Section 702 statute but voted to reauthorize it minutes later. Had any amendments been adopted, the bill would have been sent back to the House, potentially forcing a lengthy lapse of the law.\n'In the nick of time, bipartisanship has prevailed here in the Senate,' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said.\n'It wasn't easy, people had many different views, but we all know one thing: letting FISA expire would have been dangerous. It's an important part of our national security to stop acts of terror, drug trafficking, and violent extremism,' Schumer said on the Senate floor. 'Thank you to all my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their good work in getting this done.'\nThe House passed a two-year FISA renewal last week after defeating, by the slimmest of margins, an amendment to require a warrant to search through the communications of Americans as part of data collected while surveilling foreigners. Senators delayed a vote for days by pushing for amendments to make changes to the bill.\nThe bill's passage came on the heels of a pitched battle between the U.S. intelligence community and an unusual coalition of progressive and conservative civil liberties advocates, who argued that the powers are too expansive and impinge on the privacy of Americans.\n'It's important that people understand how sweeping this bill is,' said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Intelligence Committee and outspoken proponent of privacy protections. 'Something was inserted at the last minute, which would basically compel somebody like a cable guy to spy for the government. They would force the person to do it and there would be no appeal.'\nIn a rare break with Schumer and Biden, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the president pro tempore, opposed the bill, saying: 'I have strong concerns that this expansion of FISA Section 702 authorities would allow for increased abuse and misuse of the law — infringing on the rights of Americans here at home.'\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chair Mark Warner, D-Va., pushed back on that and other criticisms of a House amendment added to the FISA reauthorization bill, arguing that it 'is narrowly focused on a significant intelligence gap,' but some members like Wyden worry it could be abused.\n'Contrary to what some have been saying, it expressly excludes coffee shops, bars, restaurants, residences, hotels, libraries, recreational facilities and a whole litany of similar establishments,' Warner said on the Senate floor Wednesday. 'It also absolutely would not, as some critics have maintained, allow the U.S. government to compel, for example, a janitor working in an office building in Northern Virginia to spy for the intelligence community.'\nWarner said that allowing FISA to expire would have put the U.S. in 'uncharted territory' as companies who work with the government to provide intelligence might have stopped doing so without a reauthorization.\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said that '60% of the president's daily brief is composed of 702-derived materials, so this is absolutely critical.'\nFrank Thorp V Sahil Kapur Ryan Nobles Rebecca Kaplan contributed.",

Jaime Herrera Beutler represented the area for over a decade, but a year after voting to impeach then-President Donald Trump, she lost her 2022 GOP primary to Joe Kent, an Army veteran who had challenged Herrera Beutler from the right.\nKent then lost the general election to Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez in a campaign that focused on Kent's right-wing ties — even as the GOP's Senate candidate, Tiffany Smiley, carried the same district by 8 points. (Smiley lost to the Democratic incumbent, Patty Murray.)\nKent is running for the seat again this year, hoping for an opposite result, but Camas City Council Member Leslie Lewallen is hoping to take that spot on the general election ballot for herself. She is pitching herself as a Republican who is more palatable to the district's voters.\n'Joe Kent had his opportunity in 2022. He lost. He'll lose again, by an even wider margin,\" Lewallen told NBC News during a trip to Washington, D.C.\nShe added that she worries that if Kent and Gluesenkamp Perez are on the general election ballot again, 'we could lose this seat for a very long time and we could lose the majority in the House of Representatives.'\n'There's frankly just too much at stake. We should never have lost that seat,' Lewallen said.\nA tough path to beat Kent in the primary Across the country in 2022, Republicans blamed the absence of a \"red wave\" on poor candidate quality, pointing to Kent as one example.\nKent questioned the integrity of the 2020 election, called Jan. 6 defendants \"political prisoners\" and attended a \"Justice for J6\" rally organized by one of his advisers. The Associated Press also investigated his ties to far-right groups during the campaign.\nBut Republicans in the state and nationally say Kent's place on the general election ballot this year is almost a foregone conclusion, with Lewallen's campaign struggling to define a clear path to finishing ahead of him in the top-two primary.\nLewallen's campaign struggling to define a clear path to finishing ahead of him in the top-two primary. 'Joe Kent has the support of all seven county Republican Parties in [the district] and also the Washington State Republican Party,' Kent's campaign said in a statement, adding, 'Grassroots and mainstream voters in the district are unified in support of replacing the extreme Democrat incumbent with common sense conservative, Joe Kent.'\nOne national Republican strategist said that Lewallen \"seems like a good candidate with a nice bio, but the question is can she win the primary? From what we've seen of her campaign so far, it doesn't look likely.'\nIn the first three months of 2024, Kent raised just over $225,000, while Lewallen raised just over $193,000. That's a closer spread than the last quarter of 2023, but Kent is still outraising Lewallen.

Meanwhile, the Washington state Republican Party decided to officially endorse Kent last year.\n\"This is politics,\" said the party's chair, Jim Walsh, adding, \"Nothing is ever certain, certain, certain, but Kent's path looks pretty clear.\"\nAbove all, Walsh said, Republicans in the state and the district should be focused on beating Gluesenkamp Perez.\nHe pointed to what he thought should be the biggest issue in the race: \"Dissatisfaction with Marie Perez's track record\" in Congress.\n\"While Perez has a very effective PR campaign and operation and gets lots of photo ops, the fact is her voting record is really not representative of what Washington's 3rd's values are,\" Walsh added.\nFor their part, Democrats are convinced that Kent will be their opponent in November and hope to run a similar campaign to the one that defeated him in 2022.\n\"Joe Kent will be my opponent in the general election, and I invite Republicans and conservatives who can't stomach Joe Kent's angry, dangerous, divisive view of the world to support my campaign instead, like they did in 2022,' Gluesenkamp Perez said in a statement.\nMarching forward But Lewallen isn't mounting her campaign alone. She's backed by many of the strategists who worked on Smiley' campaign in 2022, as well as Smiley herself.\nWinning for Women, a national group that backs female Republicans running for office, has endorsed Lewallen, too. The group's super PAC has spent millions of dollars supporting female GOP candidates in recent elections.\n\"The choice here is simple: If Leslie is our nominee, Republicans win back this seat. Joe Kent has already shown he cannot win, and nominating him effectively guarantees two more years of Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a liberal extremist who is out of touch with the voters of this district,\" WFW Action Fund executive director Danielle Barrow said in a statement.\nBarrow added that the group raised over $40,000 for Lewallen in a single event in the first quarter of this year and it already has additional fundraisers planned for the second quarter.\nSo far this year, a few GOP House candidates who lost swing seats in 2022 have failed in repeat runs. In Ohio, J.R. Majewski, who was seeking a rematch against Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, dropped out ahead of this year's primary amid a cascade of unflattering news stories and other revelations.\nAnd in North Carolina, far-right candidate Sandy Smith lost the GOP primary this year to retired Army Col. Laurie Buckhout, who was backed by an outside group tied to House Republican leadership. Smith, the GOP nominee in 2022, lost to Democratic Rep. Don Davis.\nBut every race is different.\n\"Joe Kent has the support of all seven county Republican Parties in [the district] and also the Washington State Republican Party,\" Kent's campaign said in a statement, adding, \"Grassroots and mainstream voters in the district are unified in support of replacing the extreme Democrat incumbent with common sense conservative, Joe Kent.\"\nLewallen said she found Kent's 2022 campaign \"very frustrating\" because he \"did not talk about anything important to southwest Washington. \"\n\"did not talk about anything important to southwest Washington.\" \"The entire campaign focused on this Washington instead of our Washington,\" she said. \"I want to move forward.

For an optimal experience visit our site on another browser.\nApocalyptic warnings of an \"evil\" assault are fueling a struggle for control of the public library in Metropolis, Illinois. For a half century, the small city of Metropolis, Ill., has marketed itself as the \"Home of Superman.\" Now a fiery clash over its public library is testing its reputation for welcoming outsiders. Bryan Birks for NBC News April 18, 2024, 7:18 PM UTC METROPOLIS, Ill. — The pastor began his sermon with a warning. Satan was winning territory across America, and now he was coming for their small town on the banks of the Ohio River in southern Illinois. 'Evil is moving and motivated,' Brian Anderson told his congregation at Eastland Life Church on the evening of Jan. 13. 'And the church is asleep.' But there was still time to fight back, Anderson said. He called on the God-fearing people of Metropolis to meet the enemy where Satan was planning his assault: at their town's library. A public meeting was scheduled there that Tuesday, and Christians needed to make their voices heard. Otherwise, Anderson said, the library would soon resemble a scene 'straight out of Sodom and Gomorrah.' Warning that evil was coming for Metropolis, Brian Anderson, a pastor, told his congregation on Jan. 13 that \"the church needs to wake up.\" Eastland Life Church via YouTube The pastor's call to action three months ago helped ignite a bitter fight that some locals have described as 'a battle for the soul' of Metropolis. The dispute has pitted the city's mayor, a member of Eastland Life Church, against his own library board of trustees. It led to the abrupt dismissal of the library director, who accused the board of punishing her for her faith. And last month, it drew scrutiny from the state's Democratic secretary of state, who said the events in Metropolis 'should frighten and insult all Americans who believe in the freedom of speech and in our democracy.' Similar conflicts have rocked towns and suburbs across the country, as some conservatives — convinced that Democrats want to sexualize and indoctrinate children — have sought to purge libraries of books featuring LGBTQ characters and storylines. Republican state legislatures have taken up a wave of bills making it easier to remove books and threatening librarians with criminal charges if they allow minors to access titles that include depictions of sex. To counter this movement, Illinois Democrats last year adopted the first state law in the nation aimed at preventing book bans— which ended up feeding the unrest in Metropolis. Under the law, public libraries can receive state grant funding only if they adhere to the Library Bill of Rights, a set of policies long promoted by the American Library Association to prevent censorship. Constructed of bronze rather than steel, a 15-foot Superman statue draws thousands of tourists to Metropolis every year. Bryan Birks for NBC News Many longtime residents were stunned when these national fissures erupted in Metropolis, a quirky, conservative city of about 6,000 people that has a reputation for welcoming outsiders. Because of its shared name with the fictional city from DC Comics, Metropolis has for the past half century marketed itself as 'Superman's hometown.' Tens of thousands of tourists stop off Interstate 24 each year to pose beneath a 15-foot Superman statue at the center of town, to attend the summertime Superman Celebration, or to browse one of the world's largest collections of Superman paraphernalia at the Super Museum. 'Where heroes and history meet on the shores of the majestic Ohio River,' the visitor's bureau beckons, 'Metropolis offers the best small-town America has to offer.' But lately, the pages of the Metropolis Planet — yes, even the masthead of the local newspaper pays homage to Clark Kent — have been filled with strife. Unlike in comic books and the Bible, the fight in Metropolis doesn't break along simple ideological lines. Virtually everyone on either side of the conflict identifies as a Christian, and most folks here vote Republican. The real divide is between residents who believe the public library should adhere to their personal religious convictions, and those who argue that it should instead reflect a wide range of ideas and identities. Meetings of the Metropolis library board used to draw a resident or two, tops. In the months since Anderson's call to action, the board's meetings have been standing room only. Bryan Birks for NBC News During his sermon in January and in the months since, Anderson has cast his congregation and their God as righteous defenders of Metropolis — and the Library Bill of Rights and its supporters as forces of evil. If Christians didn't take a stand, Anderson warned, there would soon be an entire children's section at the library 'dedicated to sexual immorality and perversion.' And before long, he said, the town would be hosting 'story hour with some guy that thinks he's a girl.' Anderson, who is also a member of the Metropolis City Council, then asked his followers to confirm that they were ready to join him in the fight for decency. 'Amen?' the pastor said. The congregation called back in unison: 'Amen.' Three days later , Rhonda James pulled up to the Metropolis Public Library and was surprised to find nearly every parking spot filled. In her 12 years volunteering on the library's board of trustees — including seven years as its president — James couldn't recall more than a few residents attending one of the monthly meetings. But when she walked inside on the evening of Jan. 16, about 50 people were waiting in the basement meeting room. 'Oh, hi,' James said nervously as she made her way to the front. 'I wasn't expecting you all.' Rhonda James, Metropolis library board president, said she and her fellow members tried to address community concerns about the library's director without stirring controversy. Bryan Birks for NBC News James, who'd grown up attending a Baptist church and has hosted a Bible study at her home the past 20 years, didn't know why the crowd had gathered. She suspected it had something to do with the tension that had been quietly building between the nine-member board of trustees — which is appointed by the mayor and charged with overseeing the library's operations — and the library's director, Rosemary Baxter. Baxter, who did not respond to interview requests, had taken the job in 2021 and quickly earned praise in the community for developing fun and engaging children's programs. But in recent months, the board had been fielding complaints from residents who said Baxter, a devout Christian, was injecting her religious beliefs into the library's operations. Baxter had acknowledged praying aloud with children at the library's after-school program, which she told the board she did with the permission of parents. She'd put up a nativity display on the library lawn for Christmas and invited a man dressed as Santa to read the Bible to children. Board members had been pressing Baxter for months to produce a list of book removals and purchases after learning that the library had sold or donated about 15,000 books in recent years, shrinking the overall collection by about a third. The children's section of the library now had eight versions of the Bible, but only a single picture book about Halloween. Explaining the discrepancy at a public meeting, Baxter said she only removed titles that hadn't been checked out in several years, then cited her belief in Scripture. 'God said he did not give us a spirit of fear,' Baxter said, alluding to the scary themes sometimes found in Halloween books. 'Why would I want to instill that on anyone?' 'We are here to serve and to honor God,' Rosemary Baxter said of her work for the Metropolis Public Library. WPSD But the people now crammed inside the library weren't there to talk about Baxter or her book selections. Instead, they said they'd come to oppose the board's plan to adopt the Library Bill of Rights, which they believed would bring drag queen story hour to Metropolis, as Anderson had warned. 'We are concerned our values may be undermined,' said Jim Duncan, a pastor speaking on behalf of an alliance of local faith leaders. James glanced around at her fellow trustees, most of whom, she said, looked as confused as she was. 'Drag queens in libraries,' James told the crowd, 'has never come before this board.' The Library Bill of Rights, which includes a pledge to provide reading materials representing 'all points of view,' does not deal with library programming. Plus, James explained, the board had already adopted the Library Bill of Rights more than a decade ago, long before the new law that made it a requirement for state grant funding. The vote that night was merely to adopt an updated version of the policy that included an additional clause about protecting patrons' privacy. The explanation seemed to appease at least a few residents — but not everyone. Seated alongside the board, Baxter, the library director, argued against the Library Bill of Rights. The Metropolis Public Library didn't need state funding, she said. In fact, she'd never applied for any state grants during her tenure. 'There are grants we can get,' Baxter said, 'where we don't have to barter with Satan in order to get the funding.' On the shore of the Ohio river in southern Illinois, Metropolis is far closer — both geographically and culturally — to the cities of Nashville, Tenn., and St. Louis., Mo., than it is to Chicago. Bryan Birks for NBC News Ford Loverin, one of the trustees who'd clashed with Baxter in recent months — and the only openly gay library board member — was stunned. The library, he responded, should be 'accepting and tolerant' of everyone's views. Loverin, a practicing Lutheran and retired child therapist, had moved from California to Metropolis with his husband five years earlier after falling in love with the town's eccentric charm. He especially enjoyed spending time at the small library, housed in a red-brick building constructed in 1915 with seed money from the steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie. These days, the library's budget runs around $350,000, funded by city taxes and revenue from a local riverfront casino. In past years, Loverin said, the Metropolis library has relied on state grants to close shortfalls or fund capital improvements. 'I don't think,' he said, 'we need to be in a position where we throw public funds away.' \"I almost laughed,\" Ford Loverin said of the claim that the library board wanted to host a drag queen story hour. \"I thought, 'Oh, my God, in Metropolis? Really? Are you kidding me?'\" Bryan Birks for NBC News In the end, James and Loverin joined four other members in voting 6-2 to adopt the updated Library Bill of Rights. As she headed to her car afterward, James held tight to her library binder. Inside, she carried a resignation letter that she'd planned to present to the board that night. The owner of a local day spa, James had been feeling run down after spending much of her free time that year caring for her elderly mother, who'd entered the final stages of multiple sclerosis. She had decided she no longer had the time or energy to continue serving on the board. But after seeing the backlash brewing, James decided to keep the resignation letter tucked away. Later, when she told her father about her decision to stay and fight, James said he laughed. 'You're like Jonah,' he said, referring to the Old Testament Bible story. 'You tried to jump ship, and you got swallowed by a whale.' Anderson, the Eastland pastor and Metropolis city councilman, wasn't appeased by the board's assurances on drag performances. He wrote a scathing op-ed in the Metropolis Planet and preached about the library controversy nearly every weekend, warning that 'Satan has made a move in our community' and that 'darkness is coming after us.' The Metropolis Planet has covered every twist and turn of the fight over the town's library. Bryan Birks for NBC News On Feb. 18, Anderson taught from the Book of Nehemiah, telling the story of the Jewish prophet who worked to rebuild the walls around Jerusalem in the 5th Century B.C. Metropolis, Anderson said, was also in need of protection. Not physical barriers, he said, but spiritual. 'Do you think we need safety from the powers of darkness?' Anderson asked his congregation. 'I don't know if you realize it, but our enemy hates us.' Anderson then motioned to some children sitting in the front row. 'These children that you see here,' Anderson said, 'the enemy hates them. And the enemy wants to kill them.' Anderson's apocalyptic warnings were motivating more than just his followers. The county Democrats, a small but vocal group in Metropolis, joined with some moderate conservatives and began staging protests, voicing support for the library board and demanding that it diversify the library's collection. Responding to a call from county Democrats, residents show their support for the library board and the Library Bill of Rights. Charity Blanton / WPSD As clips of Anderson's sermons spread, some conservative Christian leaders distanced themselves. Duncan, the Baptist minister who'd come to the board in January to voice concerns about drag queen story hour, said he'd changed his position after learning more. 'I wanted nothing more to do with this situation,' Duncan wrote in an email to NBC News. 'I believe the church has no place attempting to privatize a public library. We should not push our own convictions on others.' Anderson declined to be interviewed. Glenn Coram, pastor of Immanuel Baptist Church in Metropolis, said he also opposed efforts to portray the library as a site of spiritual warfare. \"All they're doing is saying, 'If somebody wants a book in the library, we'll give it to him,'\" Glenn Coram, a pastor, said of the Metropolis library board. \"How hard is that?\" Bryan Birks for NBC News Coram, like most Baptist ministers, believes that homosexuality is a sin. But he doesn't think a public library should refuse to carry children's picture books depicting same-sex couples. 'I'm not one of these people who looks at Harry Potter and thinks that it's going to make your kids into witches,' Coram said. And he doesn't believe Christians should try to impose their views on others, which he called a violation of church-state separation. 'They're seeing their mission,' Coram said, 'as establishing the kingdom of God in Metropolis through the government.' Glenn Coram said that he preaches the gospel of Jesus Christ at Immanuel Baptist, but that he does not believe his personal convictions should determine what other people can read at the library. Bryan Birks for NBC News On Feb. 21 , Baxter, the embattled library director, appeared alongside Anderson and another local pastor on the 'Greg Dunker Show,' a local conservative talk radio program. Baxter defended her decision to donate or sell thousands of books, which she said she did to make room for additional children's programming. Those removals, she said, were not 'an attempt to pull any specific thing.' She acknowledged, however, that some parents had complained about children's picture books with depictions of LGBTQ characters and that she shared their concerns. 'They get to the end, and there's a surprise ending with same-sex marriages, same-sex parenting,' Baxter said. 'And they're like, ‘I don't want this.'' Baxter also elaborated on her refusal to apply for state grants. She had chosen instead, she said, to rely on God to provide. 'We don't need to live by the regulations and the rules of this state,' Baxter said. 'We are here to serve and to honor God.' By then, some members of the library board had had enough. Richard Kruger, a longtime lawyer and concerned citizen, had advised them that Baxter's blending of religion and government service was inviting a civil rights lawsuit. In 52 years practicing law in Metropolis, Richard Kruger said he's never seen the community more divided. Bryan Birks for NBC News A week later, the board went into a closed session and presented Baxter with an ultimatum: If she wanted to keep her job, she needed to sign a performance improvement plan. It stipulated that she would abide by the Library Bill of Rights, seek state grant funding and discontinue praying aloud with children and other religious activities at the library. Baxter refused to sign and began to criticize the board. Voices were raised, according to three members. After a few minutes, James, the board president, slammed her fist on the table. 'This is not up for debate, Rosemary,' she said. 'Either sign it, or don't.' Baxter stood up and left. Minutes later, the board came out of closed session. By a vote of 5-3, they terminated Baxter's employment. Baxter's departure left the library in turmoil. Four employees resigned soon after, and the board got to work picking up the pieces. They brought on a former library employee to serve as interim director and embarked on top-to-bottom reviews of the library's catalog and finances. 'Our focus,' James said, 'is making sure our library is strong and healthy and there to serve everyone.' Then, on March 19, the story of Baxter's firing was picked up by Blaze Media, a national conservative outlet. In a column titled, 'A librarian's faithful service is silenced by a secularist takeover,' conservative talk radio host Steve Deace interviewed Baxter and Anderson and reported that both had come under fire for their Christian beliefs. Deace presented the local saga as a warning that evil forces were now coming for small-town America and blamed the problems in Metropolis, in part, on 'a California transplant who is living with another man,' referring to Loverin, the library board member. Three days later, Metropolis Mayor Don Canada — who in 2021 had appointed Anderson, his pastor, to an open seat on the City Council — took a stand of his own. In letters addressed to James and two other board members, Canada announced that he'd 'lost faith in the Board in its current state.' As a result, he was removing James and two others who'd voted to terminate Baxter. Metropolis Mayor Don Canada said the library board is in need of a \"fresh start.\" City of Metropolis Canada declined to be interviewed, writing in an email, 'I have no comment on the Library or the Library board.' In an interview with Deace, Canada said he removed the members because 'we need a fresh start.' The mayor's decision shocked some residents and drew a rebuke from Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias, a Democrat who also serves as the state librarian. 'Retaliating against local library trustees, who are dedicated to serving their community and assisting children in learning, is unacceptable,' Giannoulias wrote. The mayor's action was not only controversial; it also appeared to be improper. At a City Council meeting three days later, a local lawyer who previously served as a Metropolis city attorney explained that, under Illinois law, the mayor cannot unilaterally remove political appointees. He is required to level charges against board members he wants removed and seek approval from the City Council. Heeding that advice, the council voted to table the dismissals. Later, one of the board members targeted for removal resigned, creating a vacancy for the mayor to fill. In an email this week to NBC News, Canada said he planned to put off a decision on whether to replace the other two board members until this summer. While the members wait to learn their fate, the fighting has some questioning their future in Metropolis. Loverin said he feels tense when strangers approach him in public, afraid that one of the people who has accused him of pushing an anti-Christian agenda might confront him. 'I love the people here, but I don't want to be in a place where I feel intimidated,' he said. 'But then it's like, ‘Well, I'm kind of letting them win.' And I don't want to do that.' Some residents see the library fight as a test of what type city Metropolis is going to be moving forward — and who's welcome. Bryan Birks for NBC News Leaving has also crossed James' mind. She lies awake some nights, worried about what her critics might do to harm her or her family if they truly came to view her as a tool of Satan out to 'kill' children. She thinks about the phrase etched in stone at the foot of the Superman statue in the center of town — Truth, Justice, The American Way — and wonders if some of her neighbors have lost sight of what those words really mean. But through the darkness, she's also seen good from the people of Metropolis. She's watched Democrats and Republicans, Christians and nonbelievers, march together in defense of what they describe as free speech and democracy. Those moments have helped restore her faith, James said. 'There's hope for this little town.' Mike Hixenbaugh\nApocalyptic warnings of an \"evil\" assault are fueling a struggle for control of the public library in Metropolis, Illinois. For a half century, the small city of Metropolis, Ill., has marketed itself as the \"Home of Superman.\" Now a fiery clash over its public library is testing its reputation for welcoming outsiders. Bryan Birks for NBC News April 18, 2024, 7:18 PM UTC METROPOLIS, Ill. — The pastor began his sermon with a warning.\nSatan was winning territory across America, and now he was coming for their small town on the banks of the Ohio River in southern Illinois.\n'Evil is moving and motivated,' Brian Anderson told his congregation at Eastland Life Church on the evening of Jan. 13. 'And the church is asleep.'\nBut there was still time to fight back, Anderson said. He called on the God-fearing people of Metropolis to meet the enemy where Satan was planning his assault: at their town's library.\nA public meeting was scheduled there that Tuesday, and Christians needed to make their voices heard. Otherwise, Anderson said, the library would soon resemble a scene 'straight out of Sodom and Gomorrah.'\nWarning that evil was coming for Metropolis, Brian Anderson, a pastor, told his congregation on Jan. 13 that \"the church needs to wake up.\" Eastland Life Church via YouTube The pastor's call to action three months ago helped ignite a bitter fight that some locals have described as 'a battle for the soul' of Metropolis.\nThe dispute has pitted the city's mayor, a member of Eastland Life Church, against his own library board of trustees. It led to the abrupt dismissal of the library director, who accused the board of punishing her for her faith. And last month, it drew scrutiny from the state's Democratic secretary of state, who said the events in Metropolis 'should frighten and insult all Americans who believe in the freedom of speech and in our democracy.'\nSimilar conflicts have rocked towns and suburbs across the country, as some conservatives — convinced that Democrats want to sexualize and indoctrinate children — have sought to purge libraries of books featuring LGBTQ characters and storylines. Republican state legislatures have taken up a wave of bills making it easier to remove books and threatening librarians with criminal charges if they allow minors to access titles that include depictions of sex.\nTo counter this movement, Illinois Democrats last year adopted the first state law in the nation aimed at preventing book bans— which ended up feeding the unrest in Metropolis. Under the law, public libraries can receive state grant funding only if they adhere to the Library Bill of Rights, a set of policies long promoted by the American Library Association to prevent censorship.\nConstructed of bronze rather than steel, a 15-foot Superman statue draws thousands of tourists to Metropolis every year. Bryan Birks for NBC News Many longtime residents were stunned when these national fissures erupted in Metropolis, a quirky, conservative city of about 6,000 people that has a reputation for welcoming outsiders.\nBecause of its shared name with the fictional city from DC Comics, Metropolis has for the past half century marketed itself as 'Superman's hometown.' Tens of thousands of tourists stop off Interstate 24 each year to pose beneath a 15-foot Superman statue at the center of town, to attend the summertime Superman Celebration, or to browse one of the world's largest collections of Superman paraphernalia at the Super Museum.\n'Where heroes and history meet on the shores of the majestic Ohio River,' the visitor's bureau beckons, 'Metropolis offers the best small-town America has to offer.'\nBut lately, the pages of the Metropolis Planet — yes, even the masthead of the local newspaper pays homage to Clark Kent — have been filled with strife.\nUnlike in comic books and the Bible, the fight in Metropolis doesn't break along simple ideological lines. Virtually everyone on either side of the conflict identifies as a Christian, and most folks here vote Republican. The real divide is between residents who believe the public library should adhere to their personal religious convictions, and those who argue that it should instead reflect a wide range of ideas and identities.\nMeetings of the Metropolis library board used to draw a resident or two, tops. In the months since Anderson's call to action, the board's meetings have been standing room only. Bryan Birks for NBC News During his sermon in January and in the months since, Anderson has cast his congregation and their God as righteous defenders of Metropolis — and the Library Bill of Rights and its supporters as forces of evil.\nIf Christians didn't take a stand, Anderson warned, there would soon be an entire children's section at the library 'dedicated to sexual immorality and perversion.' And before long, he said, the town would be hosting 'story hour with some guy that thinks he's a girl.'\nAnderson, who is also a member of the Metropolis City Council, then asked his followers to confirm that they were ready to join him in the fight for decency.\n'Amen?' the pastor said.\nThe congregation called back in unison: 'Amen.'\nThree days later , Rhonda James pulled up to the Metropolis Public Library and was surprised to find nearly every parking spot filled.\nThree days later, Rhonda James pulled up to the Metropolis Public Library and was surprised to find nearly every parking spot filled. In her 12 years volunteering on the library's board of trustees — including seven years as its president — James couldn't recall more than a few residents attending one of the monthly meetings.\nBut when she walked inside on the evening of Jan. 16, about 50 people were waiting in the basement meeting room.\n'Oh, hi,' James said nervously as she made her way to the front. 'I wasn't expecting you all.'\nRhonda James, Metropolis library board president, said she and her fellow members tried to address community concerns about the library's director without stirring controversy. Bryan Birks for NBC News James, who'd grown up attending a Baptist church and has hosted a Bible study at her home the past 20 years, didn't know why the crowd had gathered. She suspected it had something to do with the tension that had been quietly building between the nine-member board of trustees — which is appointed by the mayor and charged with overseeing the library's operations — and the library's director, Rosemary Baxter.\nBaxter, who did not respond to interview requests, had taken the job in 2021 and quickly earned praise in the community for developing fun and engaging children's programs. But in recent months, the board had been fielding complaints from residents who said Baxter, a devout Christian, was injecting her religious beliefs into the library's operations.\nBaxter had acknowledged praying aloud with children at the library's after-school program, which she told the board she did with the permission of parents. She'd put up a nativity display on the library lawn for Christmas and invited a man dressed as Santa to read the Bible to children.\nBoard members had been pressing Baxter for months to produce a list of book removals and purchases after learning that the library had sold or donated about 15,000 books in recent years, shrinking the overall collection by about a third. The children's section of the library now had eight versions of the Bible, but only a single picture book about Halloween. Explaining the discrepancy at a public meeting, Baxter said she only removed titles that hadn't been checked out in several years, then cited her belief in Scripture.\n'God said he did not give us a spirit of fear,' Baxter said, alluding to the scary themes sometimes found in Halloween books. 'Why would I want to instill that on anyone?'\n'We are here to serve and to honor God,' Rosemary Baxter said of her work for the Metropolis Public Library. WPSD But the people now crammed inside the library weren't there to talk about Baxter or her book selections. Instead, they said they'd come to oppose the board's plan to adopt the Library Bill of Rights, which they believed would bring drag queen story hour to Metropolis, as Anderson had warned.\n'We are concerned our values may be undermined,' said Jim Duncan, a pastor speaking on behalf of an alliance of local faith leaders.\nJames glanced around at her fellow trustees, most of whom, she said, looked as confused as she was.\n'Drag queens in libraries,' James told the crowd, 'has never come before this board.'\nThe Library Bill of Rights, which includes a pledge to provide reading materials representing 'all points of view,' does not deal with library programming. Plus, James explained, the board had already adopted the Library Bill of Rights more than a decade ago, long before the new law that made it a requirement for state grant funding. The vote that night was merely to adopt an updated version of the policy that included an additional clause about protecting patrons' privacy.\nThe explanation seemed to appease at least a few residents — but not everyone.\nSeated alongside the board, Baxter, the library director, argued against the Library Bill of Rights. The Metropolis Public Library didn't need state funding, she said. In fact, she'd never applied for any state grants during her tenure.\n'There are grants we can get,' Baxter said, 'where we don't have to barter with Satan in order to get the funding.'\nOn the shore of the Ohio river in southern Illinois, Metropolis is far closer — both geographically and culturally — to the cities of Nashville, Tenn., and St. Louis., Mo., than it is to Chicago. Bryan Birks for NBC News Ford Loverin, one of the trustees who'd clashed with Baxter in recent months — and the only openly gay library board member — was stunned. The library, he responded, should be 'accepting and tolerant' of everyone's views.\nLoverin, a practicing Lutheran and retired child therapist, had moved from California to Metropolis with his husband five years earlier after falling in love with the town's eccentric charm.\nHe especially enjoyed spending time at the small library, housed in a red-brick building constructed in 1915 with seed money from the steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie. These days, the library's budget runs around $350,000, funded by city taxes and revenue from a local riverfront casino. In past years, Loverin said, the Metropolis library has relied on state grants to close shortfalls or fund capital improvements.\n'I don't think,' he said, 'we need to be in a position where we throw public funds away.'\n\"I almost laughed,\" Ford Loverin said of the claim that the library board wanted to host a drag queen story hour. \"I thought, 'Oh, my God, in Metropolis? Really? Are you kidding me?'\" Bryan Birks for NBC News In the end, James and Loverin joined four other members in voting 6-2 to adopt the updated Library Bill of Rights.\nAs she headed to her car afterward, James held tight to her library binder. Inside, she carried a resignation letter that she'd planned to present to the board that night.\nThe owner of a local day spa, James had been feeling run down after spending much of her free time that year caring for her elderly mother, who'd entered the final stages of multiple sclerosis.

            "summary": "An editor for National Public Radio resigned Wednesday just days after he inflamed the ongoing culture war about mainstream media with an essay about what he considers the news outlet's liberal leanings.\nUri Berliner, who was a senior business editor, wrote an essay for the right-leaning online publication The Free Press in which he said he believes NPR is losing the public's trust.\nNPR, a nonprofit radio network, has an 'absence of viewpoint diversity,' he wrote in the essay, which was published April 9. It 'has always had a liberal bent,' but now an 'open-minded spirit no longer exists within NPR,' he wrote.\nThe essay triggered a wave of scrutiny of NPR from conservatives, some of whom responded to it with calls to defund the news organization, which receives federal funding through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. NPR says on its website that federal funding is 'essential' to NPR but that 'less than 1% of NPR's annual operating budget comes in the form of grants from CPB and federal agencies and departments.'\nUri Berliner in 2017. JP Yim / WireImage file In a resignation statement on X, Berliner briefly elaborated on the reason for his departure, which came days after NPR reported that it had suspended him for five days without pay following the op-ed's release.\nNPR's chief business editor, Pallavi Gogoi, had told Berliner about its requirement to secure approval before he appeared in outside media, according to NPR's report.\n'I don't support calls to defund NPR,' Berliner wrote. 'I respect the integrity of my colleagues and wish for NPR to thrive and do important journalism. But I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new CEO whose divisive views confirm the very problems at NPR I cite in my Free Press essay.'\nBerliner did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. A representative for NPR said it 'does not comment on individual personnel matters.'\nBerliner's essay gained traction on X, with many conservatives homing in on his thoughts about NPR's political makeup. He wrote: 'In D.C., where NPR is headquartered and many of us live, I found 87 registered Democrats working in editorial positions and zero Republicans. None.'\nHe also criticized NPR's coverage, or lack thereof, of certain stories, such as the Mueller report, Hunter Biden's laptop, the origins of Covid-19 and systemic racism following the murder of George Floyd.\nHigh-profile supporters of Berliner's essay, including former President Donald Trump and X owner Elon Musk, shared criticism of NPR and its CEO, Katherine Maher.\n'NO MORE FUNDING FOR NPR, A TOTAL SCAM! EDITOR SAID THEY HAVE NO REPUBLICANS, AND IS ONLY USED TO ‘DAMAGE TRUMP.' THEY ARE A LIBERAL DISINFORMATION MACHINE. NOT ONE DOLLAR!!!'

'We believe that inclusion — among our staff, with our sourcing, and in our overall coverage — is critical to telling the nuanced stories of this country and our world.'\nMaher also said Monday in a statement to NPR: 'In America everyone is entitled to free speech as a private citizen. What matters is NPR's work and my commitment as its CEO: public service, editorial independence, and the mission to serve all of the American public. NPR is independent, beholden to no party, and without commercial interests.'",

            "summary": "RALEIGH, N.C. — The future of diversity, equity and inclusion staff jobs in North Carolina's public university system could be at stake after a five-person committee swiftly voted to repeal a key policy Wednesday.\nThe Committee on University Governance, within the University of North Carolina Board of Governors that oversees 17 schools, voted in less than four minutes to reverse and replace a policy related to DEI. The full board of 24 members is to vote on the matter again next month, and if approved, the repeal would take effect immediately.\nIf the policy is fully repealed, the UNC system could join other major universities in dismantling their diversity offices. Among the most notable, the University of Florida in Gainesville announced in a memo last month that it was scrapping its office and shifting its funding for faculty recruitment instead.\nUniversity of North Carolina Chapel Hill in 2023. Eros Hoagland / Getty Images file In Texas, universities saw major cuts in their diversity and inclusion staff in 2024 in compliance with a state ban signed into law last year. The state higher education board in Kansas was also to address a ban on diversity initiatives in hiring staff and accepting students Wednesday.\nAt least 20 states have seen Republican bill proposals seeking to limit diversity and inclusion programs in several public institutions such as universities.\nDiversity, equity and inclusion is defined by the American Psychological Association as a framework to guide 'fair treatment and full participation of all people,' especially those belonging to minority groups. It has become a recurring point of contention for conservatives who argue DEI programs are discriminatory.\nThe proposed policy change, first reported by The News & Observer of Raleigh, would impact a diversity, equity and inclusion regulation adopted in 2019. It defines the roles of various DEI positions — such as a system office diversity and inclusion liaison and diversity officers across the university system — and the establishment of a diversity and inclusion council made up of members representing each university, according to the policy.\nUnder the policy, the officers' responsibilities include assisting the chancellor with diversity policy and programming, in addition to facilitating training for students and staff.\nBut Andrew Tripp, senior vice president for the UNC System Office's legal affairs team, said the change would reaffirm 'the university's commitment to non-discrimination and institutional neutrality.'\nThe policy that could replace the existing regulation does not include the outlined responsibilities of DEI officers and liaisons, suggesting they may be eliminated. Other inclusion efforts such as tracking the university's diversity metrics and giving reports to university boards will continue, the replacement policy said.\nUNC-Chapel Hill — the system's flagship campus and whose website says has an office for diversity and inclusion with a 12-person staff — will review the policy change and work with the university system if implemented, spokesperson Kevin Best said in an emailed statement.\n'As the Board of Governors noted, equality of opportunity in education and employment is a long-standing commitment of the University of North Carolina as a core value in service to our vibrant and growing state,' Best said. 'As part of that mission, UNC-Chapel Hill will continue to welcome people from all walks of life with a variety of experiences and perspectives who come here to learn, work and live.'\nImmediately after the vote to repeal the diversity policy with no questions or discussion, the governance committee went into closed session, according to the agenda. Closed sessions are not subject to public record, according to state statutes.\nEfforts to dissolve university diversity efforts are a 'disservice' to students and create 'controversy and volatility,' former UNC System President Tom Ross said in a joint statement with Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper after the vote. Instead, Ross, who served as president from 2011 to 2016, said universities should celebrate diversity.\n'Republican legislative and university leaders who attack diversity at our public universities are failing in their duty to protect students while threatening our ability to recruit top scientists, researchers and innovators who power our economy,' Cooper said.\nHowever, conservative-leaning advocacy group Carolina Partnership for Reform said in a statement the new policy would 'go a long way toward rooting out DEI bureaucracies.'\nThe full UNC Board of Governors is scheduled to meet May 22-23 in Raleigh. Members of the board are elected to four-year terms by the state Senate and House of Representatives, which Republicans have controlled since 2011.\nRepublican House Speaker Tim Moore said fellow Republicans have expressed interest in taking up anti-DEI legislation in the session opening next Wednesday. He recently told reporters the legislature may allow the university boards to review their diversity policies first before introducing any bills.\n'It's still at the conversation stage,' Moore said.\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .",

            "excerpt": "An outside group is launching new ads against three House Republicans who are facing primary challengers and voted to remove former Speaker Kevin McCarthy.",
            "summary": "Three House Republicans who voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy are facing a new onslaught on the airwaves, as an outside group with ties to a McCarthy ally launches new ads targeting them on border security funding.\nAmerican Prosperity Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy group, has placed nearly $700,000 in ad spending targeting Reps. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, Bob Good of Virginia and Eli Crane of Arizona, per the ad tracking firm AdImpact. The group also spent more than $90,000 targeting Ohio Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, a top general election target for the GOP.\nThe group, which was founded 2022, announced on Wednesday an effort targeting members of Congress 'who have voted against funding for enhanced border security in the past,' per a press release.\nThe group launched two ads targeting Good and Mace, with each spot saying Good and Mace 'voted against funding our border security, opposed billions for ICE, opposed millions for new technology, opposed thousands of new border agents.' The ads point to their votes against a sweeping government spending package, which 112 House Republicans opposed.\nRepublican strategist Brian O. Walsh, a close McCarthy ally, is a senior adviser to American Prosperity Alliance. Walsh told NBC News he doesn't speak for McCarthy.\nAs a nonprofit, the group does not have to disclose its donors, and it's not clear if McCarthy is involved in this specific effort. Allies were reluctant to directly call this a 'revenge tour' against the former colleagues that banded together to oust him.\nInstead, one source familiar with these groups' strategy allowed that McCarthy had been active in supporting challengers to some GOP incumbents, but that it was less of an active 'recruitment' process and more that McCarthy was supporting candidates who had already organically chosen to run.\nWhile McCarthy's exact role is not clear, he did signal back in October that he could take on some of the lawmakers who cost him the speakership.\n'A lot of them I helped get elected, so I probably should have picked somebody else,' McCarthy told reporters, speaking about the eight Republicans who voted to oust him. Asked if he would support primary challengers against those members, McCarthy said at the time, 'I'm a free agent now, aren't I?'\nMace, Good and Crane are all facing credible primary challengers. Crane is facing former Yavapai County Supervisor Jack Smith in Arizona, and Good is facing state Sen. John McGuire in Virginia. Good has also faced some criticism from allies of former President Donald Trump for endorsing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the 2024 presidential primary.\nGood's spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment, but the chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus is expected to face more opposition ahead of his June primary. Last month. Republican Main Street Partnership, a group backing centrist House Republicans, announced its super PAC would engage in the race to defeat Good, per the New York Times. The group has not yet started spending in the race.\nMace is facing attorney Catherine Templeton, who served in two positions in former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley's Cabinet. And this week, Templeton got a boost from another outside group.\nA super PAC tied to Winning for Women — a group that supports GOP women candidates and is made up of former Haley allies — launched a new TV ad Tuesday touting Templeton. The group, along with Haley, had previously backed Mace in her tough 2022 primary. But Mace ultimately endorsed Trump in the 2024 GOP presidential primary, earning the ire of Haley and her allies. Templeton also backed Trump in the race after initially supporting Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C.\n'We are proud to support principled leaders like Catherine Templeton who are interested in governing in a conservative and responsible manner,' Winning For Women Action Fund executive director Danielle Barrow said in a statement.\nBarrow went on to describe Templeton as 'the only consistent conservative in this race who Lowcountry voters can depend on and trust to secure our border, stop inflation, and truly do the people's work in Washington.'\nAnd this is likely just the beginning of the efforts to take on McCarthy's detractors.\n'More groups will get involved,' said the source familiar with these group's strategy. 'This isn't the end.'",

Lawyers for the parties did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nSmartmatic, a voting machine company used only by Los Angeles county in the 2020 election, filed a spate of lawsuits in 2021 alleging it was defamed by conservative media networks, personalities and allies of former President Donald Trump.\nHerring Networks also faces a lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems, a popular voting machine company that made headlines for securing a massive $787.5 million settlement last year from Fox News in a defamation claim. Dominion's case against Fox News dragged reams of evidence and testimony into the public sphere, revealing that Trump's media allies did not believe the remarkably dubious evidence behind the the president's stolen election claims.\nAt least eight other defamation cases from the voting machine companies are working their way through the judicial system this year, too.\nSmartmatic's lawsuit against Newsmax is scheduled to go to trial in September, while its trial on the voting machine company's case against MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, which could have begun as early as this month, was recently rescheduled to early next year. The company's suit against Fox News in New York remains in discovery as that network also pursues a counterclaim against Smartmatic.\nDominion's case against Newsmax has been delayed by discovery fights and is not expected to see a trial until sometime next year. The voting machine company's suits against prominent election deniers Lindell, former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell and former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne continue to work their way through the discovery process in a federal court in Washington, D.C., alongside its OANN lawsuit.\nJane C.

            "excerpt": "Abortion is at the center of President Joe Biden's re-election campaign — an improbability for a politician who long expressed his personal discomfort with the practice.",
            "summary": "The issue has been particularly fraught for Biden, an 81-year-old steeped in Catholic teachings and reliant on religious faith to cope with unthinkable tragedy: the deaths of two children and his first wife, Neilia.\n'One of the things that carried him through his numerous difficulties is his Catholic approach of giving yourself to the Lord,' said Ted Kaufman, a longtime Biden confidant and his former Senate chief of staff.\nOn a human level, Biden has never fully overcome his misgivings about abortion. That's evident even in the language he occasionally uses. Two years ago, talking to reporters before he boarded Air Force One, Biden referred to the procedure as aborting 'a child' rather than a fetus, a clue about the point at which he believed life began.\nStill, his stance is that he won't impose his personal views on Americans who believe differently. In 1974, the year he said in an interview that Roe. v. Wade went 'too far,' he also voiced opposition to a constitutional amendment to ban abortion, albeit with some ambivalence, a hometown news report at the time shows.\nA column in the Morning News of Wilmington in January 1974 said Biden told a group of anti-abortion activists: \"I am not sure my stand against such a constitutional amendment is right, nor am I sure the anti-abortionist stand is right, but right now I think I am more right than you are.\"\nLauren Hitt, a campaign spokesperson, said in a prepared statement: 'Joe Biden has opposed abortion bans since the 1970s. As a senator, he voted repeatedly to protect Roe, and as President, he has used his full executive authority to fight back on extreme MAGA attacks on reproductive freedom.'\nBiden described the tensions between faith and policy last year at a Maryland fundraising event.\n'I happen to be a practicing Catholic,' he said. 'I'm not big on abortion. But guess what? Roe v. Wade got it right.'\nA look at his record shows that his path has had its share of starts and stops. As a senator in 1982, he voted in a committee meeting in favor of a constitutional amendment that would have given states the power to restrict abortion if they chose, effectively overturning Roe v. Wade.\nAt the time, Biden said his aim was to push the vote to the Senate floor, where it would finally be resolved. The measure never got that far, and when it came up again the next year, he voted against it.\nIn 2019, as the Democratic front-runner for the presidential nomination, he reversed his long-held position in favor of the so-called Hyde Amendment banning federal funding for abortions.\nThat about-face came at head-spinning speed. One day, his campaign said he supported the Hyde Amendment; the next day, amid blowback from fellow Democrats, he dropped that position. He justified the switch by saying he could no longer support the policy because Republicans were restricting access to abortion in poor neighborhoods.\n'Joe Biden is an Irish Catholic kid from Scranton,' said John Carr, founder of the Initiative on Catholic Life and Social Thought at Georgetown University. 'He seems to stay with Catholic orthodoxy until he thinks the political or other costs are too high.'\nBiden recognized early on that his nuanced position — wary of abortion at his core, accepting of abortion rights in the public square — was bound to cause him grief. He told fellow Sen. Abe Ribicoff of Connecticut in 1973 that his stance would most likely please no one, according to his 2007 memoir, 'Promises to Keep.'\nThat proved prescient.\nIn Biden's first year as president, conservative Catholic bishops argued that he shouldn't receive communion given his backing of abortion rights. He met privately with Pope Francis at the Vatican in October of that year, and afterward he said the pope had assured him that communion shouldn't be withheld.\nKathleen Sebelius, who was health and human services secretary in President Barack Obama's administration, said in an interview that she sympathized with Biden's predicament.\n'I'm born and raised Catholic and went to Catholic schools for 17 years of my life,' said Sebelius, a former governor of Kansas. 'I understand this issue. I've been called out by the archbishop. I was ordered not to take communion.\n'I've been on the personal side of this and the political side of this, and I understand the struggle that those of us who are raised in a faith community and then live in a political world deal with,' she added. 'It's not easy. I think Nancy Pelosi [the former House speaker, who is also Catholic] understands that. I think Joe Biden understands it. It's not a simple choice.'\nWhatever Biden's journey, most advocates say they now have full confidence that he is a reliable champion of abortion rights. When Biden left the Senate in 2009, he had a 100% rating from what was then called NARAL Pro-Choice America, a group promoting abortion access.\n'Biden is not the same man as he used to be when it comes to abortion rights,' said Ilyse Hogue, former president of the organization. 'I don't think he's been hiding his agenda just to win a second term and then secretly plans to turn around and become this anti-choice guy. I'm not worried about it at all.'\nSome still don't believe Biden goes far enough to promote reproductive rights.\nRenee Bracey Sherman, founder and a co-executive director of We Testify, an abortion rights advocacy group, said Biden should use his megaphone to remove the stigma tied to abortion instead of airing his personal doubts. She pointed to recent surveys indicating that 6 in 10 Catholics support abortion rights.\n'He's the president of the United States; he's not the pope of the United States,' Bracey Sherman said. 'I'm sorry, he's allowed to have his personal feelings. But at the end of the day, he is the president, and he is supposed to defend the Constitution and people in this country who need abortions.'\nBracey Sherman said her organization reached out to the Biden administration multiple times offering to bring Catholics who have had abortions into the White House to share their stories — but has yet to hear back.\n'He makes it seem as though he's the one who's following the Catholic teachings,' she said. 'But what about the rest of the Catholics in America who do support access to abortion and have abortions?'\nElections are a choice. Even Biden detractors say they're fully aware that the only realistic alternative at this point is Trump, whom they view as an extremist on the issue.\nAbortion looks to be one of Trump's glaring vulnerabilities. He has boasted about his role in overturning Roe v. Wade through his appointment of three conservative Supreme Court justices during his single term.\n'There is a fundamental question and a fundamental difference between the president and Donald Trump and their belief on whether the Constitution affords women a right to choose. Donald Trump does not; Joe Biden does,' said Kate Berner, a former Biden White House official.\nTrump recently said abortion decisions should be left to the states after he was criticized that he has been murky about what he believes. Even so, he sought to dissociate himself from a recent state court ruling in Arizona upholding a 19th century law imposing a near-total abortion ban.\nDisavowing Arizona's strict anti-abortion measure isn't so easy for Trump. The reason it can take effect springs directly from the votes of conservative Supreme Court justices whom Trump worked to install.\n'The fact is that he announced he was going to stack the court with justices who could be counted on to overrule Roe v. Wade,' said Laurence Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor emeritus. 'He succeeded in that. They did it. That led to the revival of laws like Arizona's, even if Trump says: ‘Oops, I'm sorry that's the consequence. It doesn't make me look good politically.''\nBiden was at the White House last Sunday, dealing with the fallout from Iran's attack on Israel. When he's in Washington on the weekends, he'll often attend services at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Georgetown, the church frequented by the nation's first Catholic president, John F. Kennedy. A Black Lives Matter banner hangs from a fence outside.\nBiden wasn't in the pews that day; he was attending a virtual meeting with U.S. allies about the Iranian attack.\nThe Rev. Patrick Earl led the Mass and greeted congregants at the doorway afterward. He said in an interview that Biden is a 'good presence' during services, recalling how he once left his seat to congratulate a boy's family celebrating his First Communion.\nEarl said he understood Biden's position, even if it conflicts with church teaching.\n'As the political leader of a very varied country, you can't just say, ‘You've got to believe as I believe,'\" he said. \"You just can't.\"\nPeter Nicholas Natasha Korecki",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday weighs whether those involved in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol can be charged with obstructing an official proceeding, a case that could have bearing on the election interference prosecution of former President Donald Trump.\nThe justices are hearing an appeal brought by defendant Joseph Fischer, a former police officer who is seeking to dismiss a charge accusing him of obstructing an official proceeding, namely the certification by Congress of Joe Biden's election victory, which was disrupted by a mob of Trump supporters.\nThe court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in the past been skeptical of prosecutors when they assert broad applications of criminal provisions.\nTrump himself faces charges of violating the same law, as well as conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. They are among four charges he faces in his election interference case in Washington, separate from the hush money prosecution currently moving ahead in New York.\nTuesday's hearing comes just a week before the Supreme Court hears Trump's bid to toss out his election interference charges based on a claim of presidential immunity.\nFischer and Trump both say that the obstruction law does not apply to their alleged conduct, meaning that the charges should be dropped.\nOn Jan. 6, prosecutors say, Fischer joined the crowd breaching the Capitol from the east side. 'Charge!' he yelled again and again, before pushing forward toward a police line while yelling, 'Motherf-----s!' the government says.\nHe and other rioters then fell to the ground. After other rioters lifted him up, video disclosed as evidence in other Jan. 6 trials shows that he tried to appeal to officers protecting the Capitol, telling them that he was an officer too.\nFischer faces seven criminal charges, only one of which is the focus of the Supreme Court case. He also faces charges of assaulting a police officer and entering a restricted building, among others.\nThe law in question criminalizes efforts to obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding. Conviction can result in a prison sentence of up to 20 years.\nThe provision was enacted in 2002 as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was passed after the Enron accounting scandal.\nFischer's lawyers say the law should be limited to circumstances involving tampering with physical evidence, which is what they argue the law aims to address.\nA ruling in favor of Fischer could benefit Trump, although that is not guaranteed. Prosecutors in Trump's case have said that even if Fischer wins, Trump's conduct would still be covered by a narrower interpretation of the statute.",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — A divided Supreme Court on Monday allowed Idaho to mostly enforce a law that bans gender-affirming health care for transgender teens.\nGranting an emergency request filed by Idaho officials, the court said the law enacted last year could go into effect statewide but cannot be applied against the two plaintiffs who challenged it.\nThe court's three liberal justices objected to the decision, saying the law should have remained blocked in full.\nU.S. District Court Judge Lynn Winmill ruled in December that the state could not enforce the law while litigation continues. The state has appealed to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals but it has yet to rule.\nThe law, like measures enacted by other states, prevents the use of what Winmill called 'generally accepted medical treatment' for transgender minors, including puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries.\nOfficials subsequently turned to the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, saying the injunction was too broad and that the law should only be blocked for the two plaintiffs in the lawsuit.\nConservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, in an opinion explaining his vote to allow the law to be enforced, said the lower court had gone 'much further' than needed in putting the entire law on hold. The Supreme Court's intervention should be viewed as a \"welcome development,\" he said.\nIn a dissenting opinion, liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the case 'presents numerous reasons for exercising restraint' but instead, the court had decided to step in and was guilty of \"micromanaging\" the lower courts.\nLawyers for the plaintiffs, two transgender teenagers, said it was necessary that the judge blocked the entire law because if it went into effect it might imperil all gender-affirming healthcare in the state.\nThe plaintiffs, named in court papers only as Pam Poe and Jane Doe, say the law, called the Vulnerable Child Protection Act, among other things violates the Constitution's 14th Amendment by discriminating on the basis of sex.\nPoe is a 16-year-old transgender girl who has been prescribed puberty blockers. Doe is a 17-year-old transgender girl who was also prescribed puberty blockers and has begun hormone therapy.\nBoth say medical treatment has improved their mental health.\nMore than 20 states have enacted similar bans, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ rights think tank.\nThe Supreme Court will likely weigh in on the broader legal question in future as challenges to the laws make their way through the court system.\nIn the coming weeks, appeals concerning similar laws in Tennessee and Kentucky will be up for consideration by the justices.\nLawrence Hurley",

            "excerpt": "The trial is unlikely to last long, with Democrats and some Republicans saying the DHS secretary hasn't committed an impeachable offense.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Senators will open the impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday afternoon, but it's expected to look nothing like the full-blown Senate trials Donald Trump faced in 2020 and 2021.\nSenate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, are expected to quickly move to dismiss or table the two impeachment articles, which would require only a simple majority vote. Meanwhile, Republicans want to drag out the process and make it as politically painful as possible for the other party.\nThere is no scenario in which Mayorkas will be convicted. None of the Senate's 51 Democrats have said they support impeachment, and even some moderate Republicans have expressed openness to tabling the articles after some debate, arguing that Mayorkas' conduct does not rise to the level of impeachment.\nSenate President Pro Tem Patty Murray, D-Wash., will preside over the trial. At 1 p.m. ET, she and the 99 other senators will be sworn in as jurors. Both sides were working Tuesday to come to an agreement on a process that could include time for limited debate and votes on Republican-led motions, a Senate source said. But unlike in the Trump trials, which both took longer than two weeks, Democrats could finish the Mayorkas trial as early as Wednesday evening.\n'What I hope happens is that there will be an opportunity at least for some discussion once we are sworn in, and how long that is and what that entails is yet to be determined, but I would rather not go straight from swearing everybody in to, boom, we're going to move to table,' said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who is skeptical of the impeachment push.\n'At a bare minimum you have to have some process here,' she said, 'and if you just move to table ... you're not only putting the Republicans in a challenging spot, but you're setting the precedent that this is what we're going to do with every future impeachment. Do we really want to do that?'\nTuesday, the 11 House GOP impeachment managers, or prosecutors, walked across the Capitol to the Senate chamber and hand-delivered the two articles, accusing Mayorkas of failing to enforce immigration laws and secure the border, as well as lying to Congress under oath, including by saying the U.S. border with Mexico is 'secure.'\nAfter they read the articles on the Senate floor, the managers joined conservative senators at a news conference where they demanded a full trial and said a motion to quickly dispense with the articles would be unprecedented.\nBut Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who has led the GOP push for a full trial, said it would be 'acceptable' if the Senate referred the articles to a special impeachment committee.\n'Look, I know a number of us would prefer to have a full trial on the floor, but both are acceptable,' Lee told reporters, adding that a select committee 'conducts a trial and then, after it completes its work, the matter falls back to us' in the full Senate.\n'Either one would be acceptable,\" he said.\nScott Wong Frank Thorp V",

            "summary": "Donald Trump emerged from a Manhattan courtroom Monday ready for a fight.\nAfter day one of a trial that has Trump facing 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to a porn star, the former president stood in front of reporters ready to unleash a grievance-laced tirade that, at times, did not totally reflect reality but guaranteed he would continue to dominate the headlines even from court.\nHis immediate focus was Judge Juan Merchan's decision to not yet rule on whether Trump can attend his son Barron's May 17 high school graduation. Merchan did not say Trump could not go, but rather he was not yet ready to rule on the matter. Specifics aside, however, it gave Trump just enough to paint the picture for his supporters of a biased judge blocking a loving father from seeing his son's graduation.\n'My son is graduating high school, and it looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation,' Trump told the assembled group of reporters.\nIt's emblematic of how Trump has tried to control the narrative — an instinct that has defined his political career — even while stuck in a camera-less Manhattan courtroom. The judge has ordered Trump to attend court hearings in person, so it's a predicament he will find himself in at least four days a week for the foreseeable future as President Joe Biden continues to run a more traditional presidential campaign.\nThe false claim a judge was not allowing him to attend his son's graduation spread like wildfire in the conservative ecosystem, a conflagration helped by some of his top supporters with huge followings. Kari Lake called Merchan 'heartless & cruel.' Piers Morgan used a New York Post column to call the-decision-that-was-not 'disgusting.' Donald Trump Jr. called it 'pure evil.'\nFor millions of Trump supporters, the half-truth became the truth and a cause celebre for those eagerly looking to maintain the belief that the entire legal fight is an attempt by Democrats to get Trump locked up.\nThose sorts of distortions and fights about nearly every aspect of the trial dominated the first week, which focused on jury selection.\nIt was often reality versus Trump's version of it.\nThere were reports Trump may have fallen asleep in court, where cameras are not allowed in these types of cases. He responded forcefully on Truth Social that 'I was PRAYING not sleeping!!!'\nTrump had a misunderstanding about the jury selection process. It led him to post on Truth Social that the process is another example of 'ELECTION INTERFERENCE!'\nAnd Trump has broadly used a torrent of Truth Social posts and media interviews to paint a picture of both Merchan and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg as biased and out to get him, a sentiment that has been taken as gospel and amplified by conservative media.\nIn fundraising text messages, Trump has also told supporters that he left the courtroom, which at no point during the week happened except during scheduled court recesses or when court was over for the day.\n'I JUST STORMED OUT OF COURT!' read a fundraising text message from Trump's campaign. 'They think I'm finished, but I'LL NEVER SURRENDER!'\nTrump also tried to raise political cash off the claim that he has been blocked from attending Barron's graduation.\n'THEY ARE FORCING ME TO SKIP MY SON'S GRADUATION,' Trump's campaign texted. 'I'LL BE IN COURT.'\n'Heartless thugs,' it continued.\nThe trial-focused fundraising efforts have been breaking through the noise.\nOn the first day of trial, Trump's campaign raised $1.6 million in small-dollar donations, a campaign official told NBC News. Trump raised that much online on only three days in the first three months of 2024, according to a recent campaign finance filing from WinRed, the Trump campaign's online donation platform. Each of those three days came toward the end of March.\n\"Crooked Joe Biden and the Democrat's entire strategy to defeat President Trump is to confine him to a courtroom and unconstitutionally silence him throughout this sham Biden trial,\" said Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. \"Polling shows the American people see right through the Stalinist tactics employed by Crooked Joe and his allies.\"\n\"President Trump and his team will continue fighting for truth in the courtroom, while working to earn votes on the campaign trail,\" she added.\nMuch of the nation's attention is focused on the historic nature of an ex-president on trial, a saturation that has helped Trump continue his unmatched ability to get and retain attention regardless of the specific situation — which, in this case, is being stuck in court facing unflattering revelations about his personal life and accusations about trying to hide the information to get elected.\n'I don't think any of it matters. He totally rewrote the rules,' said a longtime Republican operative granted anonymity to speak freely about Trump's week-one performance. 'There are between 75-80 million people who will vote for him because he is a scrappy fighter. Working class folks see him as a billionaire bubba.'\nThe entire episode sets up a split screen of a former president mired in legal fights and stuck in court and an incumbent president checking all the boxes of what would be considered a traditional presidential campaign. Biden has a significant fundraising advantage and continues to hold in person campaign rallies, most recently a swing through Pennsylvania, including events in his hometown of Scranton, where he attacked Trump on a range of issues — but noticeably did not mention his legal woes. Biden's campaign has previously said it would avoid directly taking shots at Trump's legal problems to try and avoid the perception of a weaponized Justice Department.\nBeyond fundraising text messages, Trump's political operation has continued to work in the background. On Wednesday — the trial's off day — Trump had dinner with Polish President Andrzej Duda at Trump Tower in New York, and on Saturday, he is set to hold a rally in North Carolina, a key swing state.\nTrump has also installed top allies to lead the Republican National Committee, which has generally been focused on the more basic types of political blocking-and-tackling as the presidential nominee is likely to be stuck in courtrooms for most of the 2024 election cycle. Including the current trial, Trump faces four separate criminal indictments and a handful of civil lawsuits, some of which will continue to play out through November.\n\"We are getting a lot of data being shared with us to help us register and engage voters,\" an RNC member said.\nTrump has also used post-trial campaign stops to attract attention, including a Tuesday visit to a New York bodega. Trump at times tried to use the stop to focus on the rising cost of consumer goods and crime, which have been two policy themes of his presidential campaign, but the focus inevitably turned to his trial.\nTrump was asked what he thought about the seven jurors who had been selected as of Wednesday — the full 12-member jury was chosen Thursday — and he was blunt that the outcome would drive his assessment.\n'I'll let you know in about two months,' Trump said of the trial's likely timeline.\nMatt Dixon",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday weighs the constitutionality of municipal ordinances that punish homeless people for camping on public property when they have nowhere else to go.\nThe court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, will review an appeals court ruling that said several ordinances enacted by the small city of Grants Pass, Oregon, are prohibited under the Constitution's Eighth Amendment, which bars cruel and unusual punishment.\nThe ordinances bar sleeping or camping on publicly owned property, including sidewalks, streets, bridges and city parks. Punishment, which is the key issue in the case, can include fines of up to several hundred dollars and exclusion orders barring people from public property.\nExacerbated by lack of housing and the high cost of rent, homelessness and how to deal with it have become flashpoints in many communities across the country.\nAdvocates for the homeless argue that the ordinances in effect punish people for existing when they have no other place to go and that the measures do nothing to address the underlying issue of housing shortages.\nThey note that cities already have the power to regulate encampments, something that is not at issue before the Supreme Court.\n\"Can a city make it illegal on every inch of city land every minute of the day for people to live outside when they have nowhere else to go? We think the answer is no,\" said Ed Johnson, a lawyer at the Oregon Law Center who represents the plaintiffs.\nThe ruling issued by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2022 applies to all nine states within its jurisdiction, including California. Several of those states have large populations of homeless people.\nAmong those asking the Supreme Court to overturn the appeals court are local officials in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix and other cities.\nThe Biden administration has mostly backed the challengers, filing a brief in support of neither side saying laws that bar sleeping on public property are unlawful \"if they are applied in a manner that prevents an individual without available shelter from residing in the jurisdiction.\"\nThe appeals court ruled 2-1 that Grants Pass, which is about 250 miles south of Portland, cannot 'enforce its anti-camping ordinances against homeless persons for the mere act of sleeping outside with rudimentary protection from the elements, or for sleeping in their car at night, when there is no other place in the city for them to go.'\nThe decision applies only in situations in which homeless people 'are engaging in conduct necessary to protect themselves from the elements when there is no shelter space available,' the court added.\nThe case arose after a group of homeless people challenged the application of the ordinances. They say there is no shelter space, so they have little option but to sleep outside.\nDavid Wilson sits outside his tent at Riverside Park in Grants Pass, Ore., on March 21. Jenny Kane / AP file City officials maintain that the ordinances pass legal muster and are aimed at curbing the proliferation of homeless encampments.\nOfficials argue that their policies are aimed at encouraging homeless people to seek housing, although the city itself does not have its own shelter. It directs people to one run by a religious organization that has limited space and imposes various conditions.\n\"Fines and short jail terms for camping on public property are not cruel and unusual punishments,\" the city's lawyers wrote in court papers.\nLawrence Hurley",

            "excerpt": "The trial comes months before a regional election in which Björn Höcke is running to become his state's governor.",
            "summary": "One of the most prominent figures in the far-right Alternative for Germany party arrived in court Thursday for his trial on charges of using a Nazi slogan, months before a regional election in which he is running to become his state's governor.\nBjörn Höcke, 52, is the leader of the regional branch of Alternative for Germany, or AfD, in the eastern state of Thuringia and a powerful figure on the party's hard right.\nWhile never formally a national leader of AfD, the former history teacher has been consistently influential as the 11-year-old party has steadily headed further right and ousted several comparatively moderate leaders.\nAt the trial at the state court in Halle, he is charged with using symbols of unconstitutional organizations. He is accused of ending a speech in nearby Merseburg in May 2021 with the words 'Everything for Germany!'\nProsecutors contend he was aware of the origin of the phrase as a slogan of the Nazis' SA stormtroopers.\nUsing symbols of unconstitutional organizations can carry a fine or a prison sentence of up to three years. Four court sessions have been scheduled through May 14.\nDemonstrators gathered outside the court building before the trial opened, with banners including 'Björn Höcke is a Nazi' and 'Stop AfD!' About 570 protesters turned out, according to police.\nThe court last week added a second count of using the same phrase to the Halle trial, but decided shortly before proceedings started to try that separately because Höcke's defense lawyers recently changed, German news agency dpa reported. In that case, prosecutors allege that he repeated the offense at a party event in Gera last December, 'in certain knowledge of the punishability' of the slogan.\nThey say that Höcke said 'Everything for ...' and encouraged the audience to shout 'Germany!'\nHöcke has led AfD's regional branch in Thuringia since 2013, the year the party was founded, and its group in the state legislature in Erfurt since it first won seats there in 2014.\nHe once called the Holocaust memorial in Berlin a 'monument of shame' and called for Germany to perform a '180-degree turn' in how it remembers its past. A party tribunal in 2018 rejected a bid to have him expelled.\nHöcke's regional branch of AfD is now one of three that the domestic intelligence agency has under official surveillance as a 'proven right-wing extremist' group.\nWolfgang Schroeder, a political science professor at the Berlin Social Science Center, said Höcke has become an increasingly important figure in AfD and the front man of a 'radicalization project' in the party. He said that people vote for the party 'in part out of protest, in part out of conviction.'\nAfD is particularly strong in the formerly communist east and is in first place in polls in Thuringia ahead of a state election on Sept. 1, with recent surveys showing support of 29-to-31%.\nIt's unlikely that any other party will agree to work with Höcke and put him in the governor's office, but AfD's strength has made forming governing coalitions in the state enormously complicated.\nHöcke insisted in a debate with a conservative rival last week that he wasn't aware 'Everything for Germany!' was a Nazi slogan and claimed that many others have used it. 'Everyone out there knows it's an everyday saying,' he said on Welt television.\nHe also faces a second trial, for which dates haven't yet been set, on charges of incitement related to a 2022 post on Telegram about a crime in the western city of Ludwigshafen.\nThe Associated Press",

            "excerpt": "The quartet of bills will be voted on individually; if they pass, they'll be sent to the Senate in one package. The move has bitterly divided the GOP and fueled threats to the speaker's job.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The House is poised to vote Saturday on a quartet of bills that would authorize new U.S. aid to Israel and Ukraine, alongside security assistance for the Indo-Pacific and a bill that would force TikTok's parent company to sell it or be banned in the U.S.\nThe chamber is scheduled to vote in the afternoon on the four bills in succession, one day after a rare and extraordinary bipartisan coalition teed up the votes, with more Democrats (165) than Republicans (151) voting for the 'rule' to proceed to the measures.\nThe bills are expected to pass and then go to the Senate for approval as soon as in the next few days. Taken together, they include the $95 billion aid package championed by President Joe Biden, with some changes from the version passed by the Senate two months ago.\nHolding the vote represents an act of defiance by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., against an outspoken faction of conservative rebels who oppose Ukraine funding and pushed him not to bring it to a vote. Three of them — Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. — have threatened to oust him as speaker. The passage of the bill may bring Greene one step closer to forcing a vote to remove him.\nAfter months of wavering, Johnson sided with Biden, Democrats and the Republicans who believe that helping Ukraine fend off Russian aggression is essential to U.S. national security interests, citing briefings he has received and warning: 'Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed.'\n'I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,' Johnson told reporters, noting that his son will enter the Naval Academy this year. 'This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is so many American families. This is not a game, this is not a joke.'\nAhead of the vote, former President Donald Trump issued a confusing statement that sympathized with both the pro- and anti-Ukraine aid factions of the GOP without taking a clear position.\nApart from the three aid bills, the fourth measure includes a policy to force the China-based ByteDance to sell TikTok within nine months — which the president could extend to a year — or face a nationwide ban. The policy, which lengthens the time frame for a sale from an earlier House bill, has Senate buy-in along with Biden's support, putting TikTok closer than ever to a ban in the U.S.\nIf they pass, the bills are expected to be packaged together and sent to the Senate, which will have to vote on the whole legislation to send it to Biden's desk to sign into law. It's unclear when that will happen, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are outspoken proponents of the foreign aid provisions in the package.\n'I hope that President Biden will soon have on his desk long-awaited funding to support our friends in Ukraine and Israel and the Indo-Pacific, and aid for innocent civilians in need of humanitarian aid in Gaza and around the world,' Schumer said before the House vote, cautioning that Ukraine's hopes against Russia would diminish without additional U.S. weapons to defend themselves.\nLate Friday, Schumer said the Senate was working to get unanimous agreement to move quickly to vote on the foreign aid legislation. 'We are working on an agreement for consideration of the supplemental,' he said on the Senate floor.\nMcConnell said earlier this week: 'Here's the political reality: If you think the fall of Afghanistan was bad, the fall of a European capital like Kyiv to Russian troops will be unimaginably worse, and if stalled American assistance makes that outcome possible, there's no question when the blame will land, on us.'\nSahil Kapur Rebecca Kaplan and Frank Thorp V contributed.",

After the first 96 prospective jurors were brought into a New York courtroom, Judge Juan Merchan asked if any of those assembled could not be 'fair and impartial.' More than half raised their hands and were excused from serving on the jury.\nThe jury selection process got off to a slow start because lawyers from both sides spent much of the day arguing over some of the more sensational evidence in the case. Prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office want to use material — including the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, headlines from the National Enquirer from the 2016 GOP presidential primary and the timing of Trump's alleged affair with another woman — to show why Trump was eager to bury negative stories about him during the 2016 presidential election.\nMerchan said prosecutors could use a transcript of the 'Access Hollywood' tape but not the tape itself. He also greenlit the request to show jurors Enquirer headlines and said he would allow testimony about the alleged affair.\nTrump, who spent much of the day seated at the defense table flanked by his attorneys, called the case 'an assault' on the nation and repeatedly attacked the prosecution for waging 'election interference.' Merchan said Trump must be in the courtroom for every day of the trial and warned that the former president risks jail time if he disrupts the proceedings.

NBC News found that at least 150 paid 'Premium' subscriber X accounts and thousands of unpaid accounts have posted or amplified pro-Nazi content on X in recent months, often in apparent violation of X's rules. The paid accounts posting the content all consistently posted antisemitic or pro-Nazi material. Examples included praise of Nazi soldiers, sharing of Nazi symbols and denials of the Holocaust.\nThe findings are the latest evidence of a flourishing Nazi network on X under Musk's ownership, where Nazi sympathizers are brought in from dark corners of the internet to a massive platform where they can pay to amplify their content.

            "excerpt": "Johnson faces the increasing possibility that conservatives could vote to remove him from power — or that he'll need Democrats to save him.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — A third House Republican has signed onto an effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson from power, giving his opponents the votes they'd need to remove the Republican leader unless Democrats stepped in to save him.\nRep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., signed onto the \"motion to vacate\" authored by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., both Republicans said Friday. If brought to the floor as a privileged resolution, it would force a vote within two legislative days on whether to oust Johnson as speaker. A simple majority vote would be needed to succeed.\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., joined the motion to vacate earlier this week but has said he doesn't want to force a vote on it, instead pushing for Johnson to resign. The three Republicans and other hard-right members of the conference are furious at the speaker for bringing up votes to provide aid for Ukraine, particularly without U.S. border security provisions attached.\n'We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away,' Gosar said in a statement Friday.\nIf brought to the floor, those three Republican votes would be enough to remove Johnson as speaker if all Democrats vote against him. Some Democrats have indicated they would step in to save Johnson, but Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Friday that \"the pre-requisite to the conversation\" about saving Johnson is that the foreign aid bills pass \"in totality.\"\nThe addition of a third Republican on the motion to vacate is a huge blow to Johnson, raising the likelihood that he is either ousted from power or that he's saved by Democrats, which could further undermine him within the conference.\n'Johnson is done,\" said one Republican who supports the speaker. \"It's sad.'\nGreene \"has the votes,\" said another Republican. The member said they believe Democrats will vote to save Johnson — especially after the way the aid packages were structured, which drew the ire of some conservatives.\nMassie said the intention isn't to force a vote to oust Johnson but instead to show their numbers and get the speaker to resign on his own. That would avoid weeks of chaos on the floor, where the House must hold consecutive votes to install a speaker, and instead allow Republicans to meet behind closed doors and choose a new leader before Johnson voluntarily vacates the chair, Massie told reporters.\n'The strategy all along has been to ask the speaker to resign in a fashion like John Boehner resigned, where John Boehner cleaned the barn and said, 'I'm leaving and you've got plenty of time to replace me,'\" Massie said. \"So, in that circumstance, we didn't end up with the speaker-less House. ... Just like when you leave a job, you give two weeks' notice, we're looking for Mike's notice.'\nMassie suggested that a vote to oust Johnson could result in Republicans ending up in the minority; the balance of power is so close in the House that it wouldn't take much movement to elect Jeffries as speaker. Voting to remove Johnson would lead the House to hold vote after vote \"sometimes two times, three times a day,\" Massie noted. Thus voting for Jeffries just to end the chaos might start to look appealing to a handful of Republicans.\n'If Johnson would do it in the manner that John Boehner did it, there's no chance to go into the minority because it's not fought out on the floor. ... Jeffries is not on the ballot when we do this in conference,\" Massie stressed. \"And so that's the goal.'\nHe added that he had 12 people in mind who could do a better job than Johnson.\nGreene has not indicated if or when she'll try to force a vote on the motion to vacate.\nGosar announced that he had joined the effort to oust Johnson just after the House voted to advance the package of four foreign aid bills — one for Ukraine, one for Israel, another for Taiwan and a fourth that attempts to counter China by providing a pathway to ban TikTok in the U.S. as well as other national security priorities.\nJohnson called the House package of foreign aid bills 'the best possible product that we can get under these circumstances,' noting that Democrats control the Senate and the White House.\nHe said that a discharge petition from Democrats to force the House to take up a Senate-passed foreign aid package would have 'happened imminently' if the House had not acted.\n'The reality here is that if the House did not do this ... we would have had to eat the Senate supplemental bill,' he told reporters.\nKyle Stewart Julie Tsirkin Ali Vitali",

            "excerpt": "A series of early-1900s Supreme Court rulings included discriminatory language and helped ensure that people in U.S. territories would not have the same rights as other Americans.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — A mostly Democratic group of lawmakers are among those launching a renewed push for the Justice Department to condemn racist Supreme Court rulings from a century ago that shaped a legal landscape in which people living in U.S. territories were essentially treated as second-class citizens.\nCivil rights groups and professional legal associations are also joining the effort targeting the so-called \"Insular Cases,\" beginning with a letter sent to the Attorney General Merrick Garland this week.\nLawmakers, including members of the Senate and House of Representatives, are also holding a press conference Wednesday to bring attention to the issue.\nAmong the 43 lawmakers signing the new letter are Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the ranking member of House Judiciary Committee.\n\"Today, the Department of Justice has the opportunity to redress this historic error by unequivocally rejecting the discriminatory and racist doctrine of territorial incorporation established by the Insular Cases ,\" the lawmakers wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by NBC News.\n,\" the lawmakers wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by NBC News. Two Republicans who serve as their territories' delegates in Congress, James Moylan of Guam and Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon of Puerto Rico, also signed on. The other signatories are all Democrats.\nThe Insular Cases were a series of rulings issued in the 1900s soon after the U.S. had acquired Puerto Rico and other territories in which the court said people in those jurisdictions did not have all the constitutional rights of those living in the mainland.\nJustice Henry Billings Brown in a 1901 case referred to territories as lands 'inhabited by alien races' who might not abide by 'Anglo-Saxon principles.' Five years earlier, Brown had authored the notorious Plessy v. Ferguson ruling, which endorsed racial segregation.\nIn a separate opinion in the 1901 case, Justice Edward Douglass White said the U.S. had the right to acquire 'an unknown island, peopled with an uncivilized race,' without having to confer full constitutional protections. Several further rulings developed the theory that certain rights but not others applied to people in territories.\nTo date, the Supreme Court itself has not been receptive to pleas that it officially distance itself from the insular cases. Only two of the nine justices, conservative Neil Gorsuch and liberal Sonia Sotomayor, have expressed concerns about the precedents remaining on the books.\nIn a 2022 opinion, Gorsuch suggested the court take up a case in which the Insular Cases could be reversed, saying they include \"ugly racial stereotypes\" and that their flaws are 'as fundamental as they are shameful.'\nLater in 2022, the court declined to take up a case concerning the rights of American Samoans that could have given the justices the opportunity to address the matter.\nCivil rights groups and some lawmakers have previously asked the Justice Department to abandon reliance on the cases. The department has made some statements distancing itself from the rulings but has not expressly repudiated them.\nIn a March court filing, for example, Justice Department lawyers wrote that the government agreed with critics that \"aspects of the Insular Cases' reasoning and rhetoric, which invoke racist stereotypes, are indefensible and repugnant.\"\nNeil Weare, co-director of an advocacy group called Right to Democracy that has taken aim at the Insular Cases, said the Justice Department \"continues to take a step in the right direction but has fallen short of unequivocally condemning the Insular Cases.\"\nThe new letter would be followed by other actions, which could include new legal filings, he added.\nRep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., who is ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee and helped organize the letter, said in a statement that the Justice Department should \"go further and unequivocally reject these racist decisions, much as it has for other Supreme Court opinions that relied on racist stereotypes that do not abide by the Constitution's command of equality and respect for rule of law.\"\nThere is precedent for such an action, with the Justice Department in 2011 issuing an \"admission of error\" for its role in the 1944 Supreme Court ruling in a case called Korematsu v. United States, which upheld the interment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.\nThe Supreme Court in 2018 officially repudiated Korematsu, with Chief Justice John Roberts saying it was \"gravely wrong on the day it was decided.\"\nA Justice Department spokesman had no immediate comment on the new letter.\nThere are five U.S. territories: Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands. Puerto Rico, with about 3 million residents, is by the far the largest by population.\nLawrence Hurley",

            "excerpt": "The foreign aid package moved forward with the support of an extremely rare bipartisan coalition, with Democrats helping to carry the \"rule\" in committee and on the floor.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The House voted 316-94 to tee up votes on four separate bills that include aid to Ukraine and Israel, a good sign for the prospects of Congress approving U.S. funding for the two countries after months of delay and partisan fighting.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, facing intense opposition from right-wing members, received crucial help from Democrats to move forward with the votes. More Democrats (165) than Republicans (151) voted to pass the 'rule,' a procedural step to set up the votes.\nThe move tees up four House votes that are expected Saturday afternoon: one on Israel aid, another on Ukraine aid, another on Indo-Pacific security and a fourth bill that includes a bill designed to ban TikTok in the U.S. if it does not divest from its China-based owner, as well as various national security priorities. If they pass, the measures would be packaged together and sent to the Democratic-controlled Senate.\nTaken together, the foreign aid measures closely resemble the $95 billion national security package pushed by President Joe Biden. The Senate would have to pass it again, due to some differences with the version that passed the upper chamber in February.\n\"The world is watching what the Congress does. Passing this legislation would send a powerful message about the strength of American leadership at a pivotal moment,\" the White House budget office said in a statement Friday endorsing the House package. \"The Administration urges both chambers of the Congress to quickly send this supplemental funding package to the President's desk.\nThe House's move followed a vote of 9-3 in the Rules Committee late Thursday to send the bills to the floor for a final vote, with Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., breaking with Johnson to vote against it. But all four Democrats voted for the rule and rescued it, an extremely unusual move for the minority party.\n\"We only control one chamber, and I barely have control of that,\" Johnson said Thursday on Newsmax, explaining why he couldn't include GOP immigration measures in the package as some want. \"The Senate won't advance our legislation and the president won't sign it. ... I have a handful of my Republicans, at least, who will not advance a rule to bring that to the floor to combine it with the Ukraine and Israel funding. They won't do it. And so if I don't have Republican votes, that means we have to have Democratic votes.\nJohnson's decision to move forward with the bills comes as two of his members — Massie and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. — threaten to remove him as speaker. They and many other House conservatives oppose additional aid to Ukraine.\n'We'll see what happens. I'm going to do my job. I'm not deterred by threats,' Johnson said Friday. 'We're going to do the right thing and let the chips fall where they may.'\nBut Johnson, who opposed Ukraine aid last year before he became speaker, now says he believes it is \"critically important,\" based on the intelligence and briefings he has since gotten.\n'I think Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed,\" he told reporters earlier this week.\n\"I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,\" Johnson said, adding that his son is entering the Naval Academy this fall. \"This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is so many American families. This is not a game, this is not a joke.'\nThe fourth bill includes a provision to force China-based ByteDance to sell TikTok within nine months, which the president can extend to a year, or face a ban in the U.S. The provision, which has Senate buy-in as well as Biden's support, puts TikTok closer than ever to a prohibition in the country.\nDemocrats praised the move to proceed to House votes, highlighting their party's key role.\n\"It is vital that Congress act to send assistance to support Ukraine and fend off Russian aggression,\" Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., said on X. \"We may be in the minority, but we are not going to let that urgent mission fail. Democrats are doing what it takes to make sure Ukraine gets help.\"\nRep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., said Democrats were effectively in charge: \"We may be in the minority in the House right now, but @RepJeffries is essentially functioning as the real Speaker already. Rs couldn't get their own bills out of the committee they control so Ds had to help them. Work horses not just show horses.\"\nSahil Kapur Rebecca Kaplan Kyle Stewart Lori Rampani and Syedah Asghar contributed.",

            "excerpt": "Johnson faces the increasing possibility that conservatives could vote to remove him from power — or that he'll need Democrats to save him.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — A third House Republican has signed onto an effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson from power, giving his opponents the votes they would need to remove the Republican leader unless Democrats step in to save him.\nRep. Paul Gosar, of Arizona, signed onto the \"motion to vacate\" authored by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, both Republicans said Friday. If brought to the floor as a privileged resolution, it would force a vote within two legislative days on whether to oust Johnson as speaker. A simple majority vote would be needed to succeed.\nRep. Thomas Massie, of Kentucky, joined the motion to vacate earlier this week but has said he doesn't want to force a vote on it, instead pushing for Johnson to resign. The three Republicans and other hard-right members of the conference are furious at the speaker for bringing up votes to provide aid for Ukraine, particularly without U.S. border security provisions attached.\n'We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away,' Gosar said in a statement Friday.\nIf brought to the floor, those three Republican votes would be enough to remove Johnson as speaker if all Democrats vote against him. Some Democrats have indicated they would step in to save Johnson, but Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Friday that \"the pre-requisite to the conversation\" about saving Johnson is that the foreign aid bills pass \"in totality.\"\nThe addition of a third Republican on the motion to vacate is a huge blow to Johnson, raising the likelihood that he is either ousted from power or that he's saved by Democrats, which could further undermine him within the conference.\n'Johnson is done,\" said one Republican who supports the speaker. \"It's sad.'\nGreene \"has the votes,\" said another Republican. The member said they believe Democrats will vote to save Johnson — especially after the way the aid packages were structured, which drew the ire of some conservatives.\nMassie said the intention isn't to force a vote to oust Johnson but instead to show their numbers and get the speaker to resign on his own. That would avoid weeks of chaos on the floor, where the House must hold consecutive votes to install a speaker, and instead allow Republicans to meet behind closed doors and choose a new leader before Johnson voluntarily vacates the chair, Massie told reporters.\n'The strategy all along has been to ask the speaker to resign in a fashion like John Boehner resigned, where John Boehner cleaned the barn and said, 'I'm leaving and you've got plenty of time to replace me,'\" Massie said. \"So, in that circumstance, we didn't end up with the speaker-less House. ... Just like when you leave a job, you give two weeks' notice, we're looking for Mike's notice.'\nMassie suggested that a vote to oust Johnson could result in Republicans ending up in the minority; the balance of power is so close in the House that it wouldn't take much movement to elect Jeffries as speaker. Voting to remove Johnson would lead the House to hold vote after vote \"sometimes two times, three times a day,\" Massie noted. Thus voting for Jeffries just to end the chaos might start to look appealing to a handful of Republicans.\n'If Johnson would do it in the manner that John Boehner did it, there's no chance to go into the minority because it's not fought out on the floor. ...

            "excerpt": "Biden's latest environmental announcements come as he is working to energize young voters for his reelection campaign.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is marking Earth Day by announcing $7 billion in federal grants for residential solar projects serving 900,000-plus households in low- and middle-income communities. He also plans to expand his New Deal-style American Climate Corps green jobs training program.\nThe grants are being awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency, which unveiled the 60 recipients on Monday. The projects are expected to eventually reduce emissions by the equivalent of 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and save households $350 million annually, according to senior administration officials.\nBiden's latest environmental announcements come as he is working to energize young voters for his reelection campaign. Young people were a key part of a broad but potentially fragile coalition that helped him defeat then-President Donald Trump in 2020. Some have joined protests around the country of the administration's handling of Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\nSenior administration officials said young Americans are keenly invested in the Biden climate agenda and want to actually help enact it. The Climate Corps initiative is a way for them to do that, the officials said.\nSolar is gaining traction as a key renewable energy source that could reduce the nation's reliance on fossil fuels, which emit planet-warming greenhouse gases. Not only is it clean, but solar energy can also boost the reliability of the electric grid.\nBut solar energy can have high costs for initial installation, making it inaccessible for many Americans — and potentially meaning a mingling of environmental policy with election-year politics.\nForty-nine of the new grants are state-level awards, six serve Native American tribes and five are multi-state awards. They can be used for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens.\nBiden is making the announcement at northern Virginia's Prince William Forest Park, about 30 miles southwest of Washington. It was established in 1936 as a summer camp for underprivileged youth from Washington, part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps to help create jobs during the Great Depression.\nBiden used executive action last year to create the American Climate Corps modeled on Roosevelt's New Deal. He is announcing Monday that nearly 2,000 corps positions are being offered across 36 states, including jobs offered in partnership with the North American Building Trades Unions.\nBiden has often used Earth Day as a backdrop to further his administration's climate initiatives. Last year, he signed an executive order creating the White House Office of Environmental Justice, meant to help ensure that poverty, race and ethnic status do not lead to worse exposure to pollution and environmental harm.\nHe has tried to draw a contrast with GOP congressional leaders, who have called for less regulation of oil production to lower energy prices. Biden officials counter that GOP policies benefit highly profitable oil companies and could ultimately undermine U.S. efforts to compete with the Chinese in the renewable energy sector.\nBiden will use his Virginia visit to discuss how 'a climate crisis fully manifest to the American people in communities all across the country, is also an opportunity for us to come together,' said White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi.\nHe said the programs can 'unlock economic opportunity to create pathways to middle-class-supporting careers, to save people money and improve their quality of life.'\nThe awards came from the Solar for All program, part of the $27 billion 'green bank' created as part of a sweeping climate law passed in 2022. The bank is intended to reduce climate and air pollution and send money to neighborhoods most in need, especially disadvantaged and low-income communities disproportionately impacted by climate change.\nEPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe said she was 'looking forward to these funds getting out into the community, giving people skills, putting them to work in their local communities, and allowing people to save on their energy bills so that they can put those dollars to other needs.'\nAmong those receiving grants are state projects to provide solar-equipped roofs for homes, college residences and residential-serving community solar projects in West Virginia, a non-profit operating Mississippi solar lease program and solar workforce training initiatives in South Carolina.\nThe taxpayer-funded green bank has faced Republican opposition and concerns over accountability for how the money gets used. EPA previously disbursed the other $20 billion of the bank's funds to nonprofits and community development banks for clean energy projects such as residential heat pumps, additional energy-efficient home improvements and larger-scale projects like electric vehicle charging stations and community cooling centers.\nThe Associated Press",

            "summary": "More and more, parents are opting America's children out of public school.\nThe share of children ages 5 to 17 enrolled in public schools fell by almost 4 percentage points from 2012 to 2022, an NBC News analysis of Census Bureau data found, even as the overall population grew.\nNBC News' analysis found:\n87.0% of children were enrolled in public school in 2022, compared to 90.7% in 2012.\nIn Kentucky, the share of school-age children in public schools decreased by almost 8 percentage points.\nIn South Carolina, the share of children enrolled in public schools decreased by 7.4 percentage points.\nIn Alaska, enrollment decreased by nearly 7 percentage points. During the same period, the share of 5 to 17 year-olds enrolled in private schools increased by 2 percentage points, the Census Bureau data showed. Charter schools saw a similar increase, according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, a nonprofit group dedicated to advancing charter schools.\nEducators and researchers say the swing has been caused in part by laws that have targeted public schools while propping up alternatives.\n'[The rise in charter schools] is a thread of the larger campaign of privatization,' said Abbie Cohen, a Ph.D. candidate in UCLA's School of Education and Information Studies. 'Those two things are happening at the same time, and I don't think it's a coincidence.'\nPolicies that make private, charter and homeschooling options more available to families — dubbed 'school choice' by advocates — have expanded rapidly since 2022. Such policies grant families public funds for alternative schooling in the form of vouchers, tax-credit scholarships, refundable tax credits and more. In 2023, at least 146 school choice bills were introduced across 43 states, according to FutureEd, an education-focused think tank at Georgetown University.\nNineteen school choice laws were enacted last year in 17 states, including South Carolina and Florida, which have seen some of the most dramatic declines of students enrolled in public schools.\nAs part of the push for school choice, states are eliminating income limits and other eligibility requirements, allowing higher-income families to receive benefits. Eight states passed such laws or created such programs in 2023, FutureEd's data shows, bringing the total number of states with these programs — commonly referred to as 'universal school choice' — to 10.\nThough Kentucky has seen the most students leave public schools, it is one of 18 states without a school choice program, and the state doesn't fund charters. Homeschooling and 'microschooling,' where students are homeschooled together and may be supervised by someone other than their own parents, are increasingly popular alternatives. An EdChoice/Morning Consult poll reported that 15% of parents in Kentucky prefer homeschooling, compared to 9% of parents nationwide.\nRobert Enlow, the CEO of the nonprofit school choice advocacy group EdChoice, said he is 'agnostic' to which options are chosen, but believes the money should follow each student wherever they go.\n'Families are saying, ‘Let me have the resources that are due to me, that I get through taxes that are set aside for my kid, and then let me choose,'' Enlow said.\nAt the same time that states are pushing school choice programs, public schools — already dealing with declining enrollment — have faced budget cuts, teacher shortages, and laws and fights over what is taught in the classroom.\nMore than 20 states have considered bills since 2022 that would give parents more control over the curriculum in public schools, from granting parents access to course materials prior to classes, to banning instruction on sexual orientation and gender and allowing parents to opt their children out of any classes.\nOne state that has pushed such laws is Florida. The state has passed several parent rights laws since 2020, including changes to make it easier for parents to ban books from classes, a ban against discussing sexuality and gender identity in younger grades and a ban on teaching critical race theory in classes.\nFlorida's 5 to 17-year-old population has grown 9% since 2012, but NBC News' analysis found that its public school enrollment fell 7% during that span.\nAndrew Spar, the president of the Florida Education Association, the state's largest teachers union, said new laws have unclear directions and handcuff teachers' ability to instruct without fear of retaliation for what's discussed in class.\n'In Florida, there's so much micromanaging of our public schools, so many bureaucratic rules and laws that get in the way, that it becomes increasingly difficult for us to do our jobs,' Spar said. 'Teachers are vilified; they can't do their jobs.'\nCohen, from UCLA, said parents are unenrolling students from public schools when they either feel the curriculum is not teaching accurate history, or hope for more conservative changes in school policies and curricula. Her research found that funding cuts are among the policies 'fueling mistrust' in public schools and could be leading families to alternatives.\nThe states with the largest declines in public school enrollment also have the lowest per-pupil spending, Census Bureau data shows. Educators and researchers question whether public schools will bounce back from recent enrollment declines as districts experience a wave of financial struggles and closures.\n'Who is hurting the most are the students who have been most historically marginalized in society,' Cohen said. 'When more kids are leaving the public schools, that's less funding for the public schools and those who are left, are left with less.'\nCatherine Allen",

            "excerpt": "An NBC News review identified 150 verified \"Premium\" accounts that have posted or amplified pro-Nazi content.",
            "summary": "Elon Musk's X is a thriving hub for Nazi support and propaganda, with paid subscribers sharing speeches by Adolf Hitler or content praising his genocidal regime.\nNBC News found that at least 150 paid 'Premium' subscriber X accounts and thousands of unpaid accounts have posted or amplified pro-Nazi content on X in recent months, often in apparent violation of X's rules. The paid accounts posting the content all consistently posted antisemitic or pro-Nazi material. Examples included praise of Nazi soldiers, sharing of Nazi symbols and denials of the Holocaust.\nThe pro-Nazi content is not confined to the fringes of the platform. During one seven-day period in March, seven of the most widely shared pro-Nazi posts on X accrued 4.5 million views in total. One post with 1.9 million views promoted a false and long-debunked conspiracy theory that 6 million Jews did not die in the Holocaust. More than 5,300 verified and unverified accounts reshared that post, and other popular posts were reshared hundreds of times apiece.\nX's policies ban glorifying violence — a broad prohibition that X has sometimes used to take down pro-Nazi content and accounts. The rules also ban 'praising violent entities' and say the platform will apply labels to hate imagery like swastikas. But NBC News found that X does not appear to be enforcing those policies consistently.\nThe findings are the latest evidence of a flourishing Nazi network on X under Musk's ownership. Previous investigations by news organizations and anti-hate watchdogs have documented many examples of antisemitism, white supremacy and support for Nazism on X.\nNBC News found the Nazi propaganda posts by browsing the platform: scrolling through replies, clicking on user profiles and looking through the engagements on viral posts. NBC News conducted its review during one week in late March. The number of verified subscribers posting pro-Nazi material may be significantly more than 150. When NBC News conducted its review, Premium subscribers had the option to hide their verification check marks from the public.\nThe verified users sharing the pro-Nazi content have entered into a mutually beneficial relationship with Musk's X, paying $8 a month or more for premium services that are available to all premium subscribers. In exchange, they get 'prioritization' when they reply to posts and the opportunity to monetize their content through ads, according to the subscription terms.\nThe result is that X is bringing Nazi sympathizers in from the dark corners of the internet to a massive platform where they can pay to amplify their content. X had 174 million daily active users worldwide on its mobile app in February, according to the research firm Sensor Tower. X claims to have many more than that.\nNBC News conducted its research in March, before X implemented a change to provide free premium subscriptions to accounts with more than 2,500 verified followers. That move has made it more difficult to determine who is a paid subscriber.\nA welcoming social media environment can make Nazi sympathizers feel validated in their views and recruit others to their cause, said Patrick Riccards, executive director of Life After Hate, a Milwaukee-based organization that helps people disengage from violent extremist groups.\n'For those who are already driven by hate, it is a big warm hug,' he said.\nOnline hatred can also contribute to violence offline, he said, citing the racist massacre at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, where 10 Black people died in 2022. The gunman wrote in a document that he supported neo-Nazism. He later said in court that he 'believed what I read online and acted out the hate.'\n'They're wanting to find individuals to take physical action when the time comes,' Riccards said.\nIn most cases, Nazi material on X is about spreading hate, said Megan Squire, deputy director for data analytics at the Southern Poverty Law Center, an anti-hate group founded in 1971.\n'It's not like historians are on there talking about Hitler's speeches,' she said.\nSquire said that in her research she has found that accounts posting Nazi material are run by 'known white supremacist groups that are attempting to normalize their ideas, gain followers and shuffle those followers into platforms' elsewhere online where their organizing work continues.\nBy failing to act against many pro-Nazi accounts, X continues to earn income from their activity in at least two ways: by collecting monthly subscription fees from those posting pro-Nazi content and by running advertisements on those accounts or adjacent to the pro-Nazi content.\nNBC News found ads running on 74 of the 150 premium accounts, either on their profile pages or in the replies below their posts. The advertisers included SiriusXM, The Hollywood Reporter and Cisco subsidiary Splunk. SiriusXM declined to comment. Penske Media, the owner of The Hollywood Reporter, declined to comment. Splunk did not respond to requests for comment sent by email.\nAds from other companies appeared among the search results for a Holocaust-denial hashtag.\nNBC News does not have a comprehensive list of advertisers that use X. Each account on social media sees different ads at different times, so it is unknown how many advertisers' ads have run next to pro-Nazi content.\nAdvertisers online generally have limited control over where their ads appear. X says on a website for advertisers that it gives them the ability to target certain demographics, accounts, keywords, phrases, interests, events and locations. Advertisers can also use 'negative' targeting, asking X's ads system not to place ads near certain keywords. The system, however, does not guarantee placement next to or away from any specific post. Other platforms, such as Instagram, have targeting systems of their own.\nOn a second website for advertisers, X says its rules are meant to ensure brand safety. It says that the rules 'are enforced for all people who use X' and that they 'set the standard for content and behavior not permitted on the platform.' X specifically notes on the page that its policies include rules that address 'violence,' 'terrorism/violent extremism' and 'hateful conduct.'\nX does not disclose publicly which accounts share in ad revenue, and NBC News could not determine how many of the 150 premium subscribers do so.\nMonetizing Nazi content contradicts one of Musk's early pledges after he bought the app, then known as Twitter, in October 2022.\n'Negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted & demonetized, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter,' he wrote in a post in November 2022.\nMusk also said then that no one has a right to amplification online.\n'New Twitter policy is freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach,' he wrote.\nNBC News sought comment on its findings from X. A representative for X asked for examples, and NBC News provided 13 examples of accounts posting pro-Nazi content. Hours later, X had put labels on some of the examples, all of which remained online. Representatives for X did not answer written questions or agree to an interview, but they sent a link to a blog post from September that says X has a 'zero tolerance approach' to violent speech.\nMany of the 150 premium accounts have put links on their X profiles directing people to their websites, books and other media, where they sometimes push Nazi sympathy and antisemitism. One such account, using the name The Impartial Truth, posts recycled and remixed Nazi propaganda content, and its X profile links out to a donation site. The account did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\nOne of the premium accounts belongs to Stew Peters, a Florida-based host of an internet talk show who has praised Nazi book-burning in 1930s Germany. Last month, a post of his denying the Holocaust went viral on X with 1.9 million views. Peters has more than 574,000 followers on X, where his posts often include antisemitism, and his account links to his website charging $10 a month for videos. In response to a request for comment, Peters said NBC News was using 'ad hominem arguments to create narratives out of whole cloth.'\nSome of the accounts posting Nazi propaganda are unabashed in their praise of the Nazis. At least two verified X subscribers recently praised Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister. One said it used artificial intelligence to generate fake audio of Goebbels reading his writing aloud, bringing in more than 23,000 views.\nX's policies require a 'sensitive media' label for 'hateful imagery,' which includes 'symbols historically associated with hate groups, e.g., the Nazi swastika.' Musk cited a related 'incitement to violence' policy when he suspended the rapper Ye, formerly Kanye West, after Ye praised Hitler in an interview and posted an image resembling a swastika.\nSome viral Nazi content stops short of praise and instead drives engagement to accounts with no clear ideology. Two examples came in March from the account @dom_lucre, a conspiracy theorist. It posted two Hitler speeches that together received more than 15 million views. The speeches were translated with artificial intelligence, Lucre said. He, unlike others, included a warning that the speech was graphic and antisemitic, though he did not express disapproval.\n'I am simply sharing what is news as I always do,' he wrote in a post. Lucre, who also goes by Dominick McGee, according to his Facebook page, did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\nLucre and other similar posters who stopped short of praising Nazis were not included in the NBC News count of the 150 premium subscribers posting pro-Nazi content. Those 150 accounts were more explicit in their pro-Nazi ideologies.\nSquire, of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the proliferation of pro-Nazi content is the result of multiple decisions by Musk since he bought the platform: cutting content moderators, changing the rules about who got verification, reinstating banned accounts and restricting the data stream that outside watchdogs used to research Twitter.\nMany researchers have complained that it is now difficult or impossible to measure the reach of extremism on X because of the new restrictions Musk has imposed.\n'It's safety through obscurity: Make it really hard for people to see the problem, and then you can pretend it doesn't exist,' Squire said.\nBefore Musk bought Twitter, it had been working for about five years to crack down on the presence of Nazis. In 2017, after years of complaints by users and advertisers, Twitter said it was banning Nazi swastikas and other hateful imagery from profile photos and that it would kick off users who associate with violent organizations. Opponents of Nazis celebrated the moves as long overdue.\nSome prominent X users are unhappy with what they have seen. Christopher Rufo, an activist and senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, wrote last month that he had seen a rise in 'Kanye-style antisemitism.' A representative for Rufo said he was not available for an interview.\nSome Nazi supporters have also said they have noticed a rise in sympathetic posts. One account, referring to Hitler as 'the Boss,' wrote recently: 'I'm seeing the Boss' speeches and quotes more and more on social media, from people youd never expect.'\nRather than crack down on antisemitic posts, Musk has used his massive platform to promote antisemitic conspiracy theories. Last year, he embraced the concept of the 'great replacement,' which says there is a top-down plot to replace the white population with nonwhite people. His posts on the subject drew condemnation from the White House and led to an exodus of advertisers. Following the backlash over his statements, Musk visited Israel and traveled to the former Nazi death camp Auschwitz with conservative commentator Ben Shapiro.\nMusk also reinstated the accounts of prominent neo-Nazis Andrew Anglin and Nick Fuentes. Both are now suspended, although videos in which Fuentes questions the Holocaust still spread widely on X.\nLast year, the progressive watchdog Media Matters published a report saying Nazi content was running on X alongside advertisements from major corporations. X sued Media Matters, saying its research was flawed because it used an account that, according to the company, was primed to see Nazi material based on the accounts it followed. It also said Media Matters received flawed results because the activity of its researchers was atypical, for example by refreshing a page many times to see which ads appeared. X's suit is ongoing. In a statement to NBC News at the time, Media Matters President Angelo Carusone called the lawsuit \"frivolous\" and said the organization \"stands behind its reporting and looks forward to winning in court.'\nAmong the ads running near pro-Nazi content seen by NBC News was one from the FBI seeking tips about hate crimes. The FBI ad appeared among the replies to a post from @AshaLogos, a verified account with more than 54,000 followers that frequently posts antisemitism, including a recent accusation that Jews have a 'monopoly' on media.\nThe FBI did not respond to requests for comment on the ad or its placement or about NBC News' findings about pro-Nazi propaganda on X.\nHate crime in the U.S. has been surging, with reports jumping 12% in 2021 and 7% in 2022, according to law enforcement reports to the FBI.\nDavid Ingram Lora Kolodny, CNBC contributed.",

One prospective juror professed Trump 'totally guilty' in an interview outside the courthouse on Monday. A day later, that person, an American history teacher, was struck from a rapidly winnowing pool of more than 500 New Yorkers.\nLawyers excavated ancient social media posts; asked jurors to explain inconsistent answers; and tried to strike from the pool candidates they feared could spell danger for their case.\nAt one point, the judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan, warned Trump that he should not try to intimidate potential jurors.\nTrump is defending himself against 34 felony counts of falsifying business records for his alleged role in arranging a hush-money payment to a porn star during the 2016 presidential election. The former president has denied all charges.\nAs Trump's attorneys closely watched each juror, Todd Blanche, his lead attorney, took handwritten notes. Some of the answers prompted a smile. Trump, for his part, mostly looked straight ahead.\nBy the numbers The selection process started with 96 jurors in the first batch. By Tuesday, more than half were excused after saying they could not be fair or impartial. That left 34. From there, 18 were sat in the jury box and winnowed down to six. And then another six brought in, who were reduced to one.\nSeven jurors, including a former waiter, an oncology nurse, an attorney, an IT consultant, a teacher, and a software engineer, were seated by the late afternoon in a process that took two days. Merchan appeared optimistic a jury of 12 New Yorkers and likely six alternates could be sat by the end of the week. The trial resumes on Thursday and Friday.\nHe told the selected jurors to plan to return Monday at 9:30 a.m., signaling the likelihood that the selection process will be over by then.\nWhere jurors get their news TikTok.

'I don't generally read the emails,' she said before she was stuck.\nAnother juror said he reads the New York Times and New York Daily News and used social media. 'I do Google. I do X,' he said.\nJurors were asked if they read the New York Times, or watched CNN as the lawyers queried the pool to get a better sense of their knowledge of the charges against Trump in New York and his other legal cases, and what they think of them.\nSeveral jurors professed not to consume much news at all, including one lawyer who explained that his wife is not a fan.\nwife is not a fan. Another, a teacher and Harlem native said she does not pay attention to politics or the media. She said she does not have strong opinions but that, as a person of color, she has friends with strong opinions on Trump. But she did share one, praising the former president as a person 'who speaks his mind.'\n'I'd rather that than someone who's in office who you don't know what they're thinking,' she said.\nWhen Blanche asked the group if they were familiar with the other charges facing Trump, she appeared to be the sole juror not to raise her hand. She was seated on the jury.\nAnother juror professed to have been away through February and March, living on a lake without wifi. 'Knowing this was going to happen, I really tried not to hear about this case and I blocked the news,' this person said. She was struck by Trump's lawyers.\nSocial media One juror said she doesn't tweet and quit Twitter after two days. Another said her Facebook page and the political materials posted to it weren't representative of her views and that she had sought to remove it. One man, a resident of Hells Kitchen but originally from Mexico, said he could not be held responsible for the views of his Facebook friends. 'Feelings are not facts,' he insisted.\n'Feelings are not facts,' he insisted. At one point, Merchan apologized for causing potential offense as he read political memes about Trump, including one about a group of Thai boys who were trapped in a cave in 2018. Another meme shared by one juror included side-by-side photos of Trump and former President Barack Obama with a caption reading, 'I don't think this is what they meant when they said orange is the new black.'\nIt wasn't clear whether jurors had written every post themselves or reposted others. But the materials were cause for Trump's lawyer to press the jurors repeatedly—including over Facebook posts from Occupy Democrats that one woman claimed not to be responsible for and said she did not know how to remove.\nImpartiality tests The defense scoured the internet, unearthing comments from prospective jurors that showed hostility to Trump or ran contrary to what they told the court in questionnaires.\nSpeculation over seemingly non-partisan events — such as a post about an Election Day celebration in the city in 2020, a Democratic stronghold — became the basis for queries that sought to probe any stronger biases that could sway a juror one way or another.\nOther commentary was more overt. 'Republicans projected to pick up 70 seats in prison,' one potential juror had posted.\nThat person said she lost sleep last night over whether she could judge the case fairly, Blanche said, explaining how the prosecution and defense had 'a fair bit of colloquy' with her.\nBut he argued that while the post may be dated, it still mattered. 'The evidence at trial is going to be six years old,' he said.\n'The evidence at trial is going to be six years old,' he said.

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Top House progressives will unveil a sweeping agenda Thursday to lay down a marker for the policies they'll push next year if Democrats win the 2024 election, from a higher minimum wage and strengthening antitrust laws to new federal benefits for seniors on Social Security and parents raising kids.\nThe Congressional Progressive Caucus agenda, first shared with NBC News, doubles as a blueprint of political advice for how it believes President Joe Biden can win over progressives and young voters who are uninspired by his re-election bid ahead of a rematch with former President Donald Trump.\n'If the progressive base is not excited and enthusiastic — and if they don't feel like we are trying to earn their votes and that they are important — then I think the horrific idea of a second Donald Trump presidency could become reality,' Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the progressive caucus chair, said in an interview. 'We cannot afford to let that happen. And we won't.'\nThe seven-point agenda is heavily focused on economics and lighter on cultural issues, carrying echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. It begins with provisions to boost the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour by 2028 and pass the PRO Act to strengthen unions, as well as other provisions, such as guaranteeing overtime pay. It includes policies to reduce the cost of living — by capping child care costs at 7% of income for all families; expanding Social Security benefits by closing tax loopholes; adding dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare; and enacting a series of policies to protect renters and make housing more affordable.\n2028 and pass the PRO Act to strengthen unions, as well as other provisions, such as guaranteeing overtime pay. It includes policies to reduce the cost of living — by capping child care costs at 7% of income for all families; expanding Social Security benefits by closing tax loopholes; adding dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare; and enacting a series of policies to protect renters and make housing more affordable. 'It's really about worker power and raising wages and lowering costs for poor people, middle-class Americans and the working people across this country,' Jayapal said.\nThe five other planks are investments in education, including universal pre-K and kindergarten; aggressive clean energy standards to tackle climate change; 'making our democracy work' with federal voting rights mandates, Washington, D.C., statehood and elimination of the Senate filibuster; taking on corporations and monopolies; and 'advancing justice' though abortion rights, pro-LGBTQ measures, pro-immigrant policies and setting national policing standards.\nThe agenda is also notable for what's not included. 'Medicare for All,' a rallying cry of the left for years, is excluded. Foreign policy issues like Israel and Gaza, which have sparked fiery pro-Palestinian protests across the country, are also kept out. Jayapal said that's partly because the caucus decided to make it a domestic-issue-only blueprint and partly out of pragmatism — to focus more on unifying issues for Democrats and steer clear of the ones that divide them.\n'The way we came to this agenda is to say that we were going to put into this agenda things that were populist and possible ... and affected a huge number of people,' she said. 'We haven't taken a position on particularly Israel and Gaza in the progressive caucus, and so that's not on here.'\nA supermajority of the 103 lawmakers in the caucus weighed in on the agenda, and 98% supported it, a spokesperson said.\nMuch of the agenda will have no realistic chance of passage unless Democrats sweep control of the White House, the House and the Senate this fall. And Jayapal emphasized that, in addition, Democrats would need 50 senators ready to pierce the 60-vote filibuster rule to get around likely GOP opposition. That would be a herculean task, as Democrats face a daunting map in 2024 Senate races, defending a slew of seats in purple and red states.\n'We are assuming that this is an agenda for a Democratic president with a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House,' Jayapal said.\nProgressives have had a rough two years, having been marginalized after Republicans took control of the House and steered the agenda rightward. Biden has broken with the left on issues like tougher asylum laws and crime. Some prominent Democrats, like Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, have eschewed the 'progressive' label as conservatives have found success in associating it with the left's most divisive ideas. Gallego, who is running for the Senate in his purple state, quietly left the progressive caucus. The caucus recently missed an opportunity to elect one of its members to a rare open Senate seat in deep-blue California, with two of them running and losing.\nStill, Jayapal said she believes that if Democrats win the 2024 elections, the progressive caucus will be well-positioned to advance the ideas in its new agenda, as it did with it opening bid that shaped two of Biden's signature laws, the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act. She has sought to institute changes to make the caucus more cohesive. It recently raised its dues for members.\nSome of the provisions in the new agenda represent items in Biden's 'Build Back Better' agenda that were left on the cutting room floor because of the thin majorities. Others could spark intraparty disagreements, including a far-reaching liberalization of the immigration system with a path to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally. Yet other pieces resemble popular causes that progressives want Biden to get behind, like expanding Social Security and legalizing marijuana.\n'We have to excite our base. We have to show them what the path forward is — not just say, ‘This is the most important election of your life, and we expect you to vote.' I don't think that's going to turn people out. And so I think this agenda, really, speaks to the needs of poor people, working people, progressives across the country who want us to make that case to them,' Jayapal said. 'We are not seeing the momentum that we would like to see. We're going to have a tough election. ... We know we're going to have to put together that progressive coalition. And I think this is the thing that allows us to say, ‘Look, here's what we're fighting for.''\nSahil Kapur",

            "excerpt": "With costs up 22%, it may be time to take that defensive driving course (online!) and bank the discount.",
            "summary": "Car insurance costs are pretty brutal at the moment — they're up more than 22% since this time last year. There's plenty you can do to lower your bill, but some of the best advice out there still requires a certain amount of upfront cash.\nFor example, paying your annual premium all in one go could eliminate the extra fees some insurers charge customers for paying month by month. But that may not be an option if your budget is tight and your premium has surged.\nInsurers have been playing catch-up since the pandemic, said Stephen Crewdson, senior director of insurance intelligence at J.D. Power. They were late to raise rates when auto prices were ticking up, and now their hikes are setting in even as vehicle prices cool. Nearly 14% of consumers reported shopping for new insurance last month, a recent J.D. Power survey found — the highest monthly rate since it started tracking the figure in 2020.\n'We should hopefully see these premium increases taper off as time goes by,' Crewdson said.\nIn the meantime, there are still some ways to lower your bill this year. Here's where to start.\nShop widely for discounts Auto insurance customers this year are 'gonna have to be more aggressive' to find savings, said Lee Baker, an Atlanta-based financial planner and founder of Apex Financial. 'You might need to cast a wider net.'\nThat means checking all the discounts on offer, starting with your current carrier. From military discounts to bundling opportunities, policyholders often leave money on the table simply by not picking up the phone. When J.D. Power surveys consumers, it finds many aren't fully aware what savings are out there, Crewdson said.\nYour benefits package, at least for large employers — there's a lot of little nuggets in there that people gloss over.\nPreston Cherry, founder of Concurrent Financial Planning\nPreston Cherry, founder of Concurrent Financial Planning 'Ask somebody at your insurer. If you have an agent, ask your agent,' he said. 'If you don't have an agent, call in to the insurer, visit the website, look at the app and look at what discounts they offer.'\nExperts also suggest considering the organizations in your orbit. Many professional and trade associations, alumni groups and even fraternity and sorority associations often negotiate discounts with insurers.\nBut your employer may be the best place to start hunting for perks.\n'Your benefits package, at least for large employers — there's a lot of little nuggets in there that people gloss over,' said Preston Cherry, founder of Concurrent Financial Planning in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\nWhile employers typically work with only a single insurer and any discounts probably won't be drastic, experts said, they can help you start chipping away at your monthly costs.\nTake that defensive driving course Financial experts say this is one of the easiest strategies. Many insurance companies offer considerable savings when policyholders complete defensive driving courses — most of which are online — from organizations such as the National Safety Council or Defensive Driving by IMPROV.\n'I always recommend taking defensive driving every year,' said Cherry. 'The discount is worth it.'\nCarriers in at least 34 states and Washington, D.C., typically offer discounts of up to 10% for course completion, according to I Drive Safely, a defensive driving course proctor.\nMany carriers also offer their own programs for good driving behavior — though some require agreeing to a measure of surveillance. Progressive's Snapshot, for example, offers policyholders a mobile app or a plug-in device for their vehicles that track, among other things, your braking patterns and the times of day you get behind the wheel, then use that information to determine your discount eligibility.\nOne caveat: Risky behavior can trigger a higher rate when it's time to renew your policy, said Jude Boudreaux, a certified financial planner and partner at the Planning Center in New Orleans. But 'if you're trying to drive pretty conservatively and around town, using those can be a way to save some additional costs,' he said.\nFor those who work remotely or don't drive much, Boudreaux also suggests pay-per-mile plans. These also rely on mileage- and behavior-tracking devices that may entail privacy trade-offs but could be a boon for some. Nationwide's SmartMiles program, for example, offers a low base rate plus a variable one that depends on mileage. And for periodic longer road trips, it counts only the first 250 miles per day.\nCheck for family-friendly fine print For consumers with kids who drive or are about to start, there's a lot to consider that can affect your bill.\nWhile it's generally cheaper to add a teen driver to an existing policy or bundle than it is to buy a new one, repeated infractions (tickets, fender benders) can drive up your household's costs, so weigh the trade-offs carefully.\n'Sometimes bringing them inside the bundled package works, sometimes not,' said Cherry. 'That's always a tricky one.'\nHe advises starting any young drivers in your family on an inexpensive or mostly paid-off car. Since it has become more expensive to repair vehicles lately, consider how much cash you're willing to risk on your kid's behalf.\n'It's really trying to save costs by placing them in a vehicle that's not much to insure and counterbalances their inexperience risk level to insure,' Cherry said.\nBaker said academic achievements can also help trim your insurance costs. Many carriers offer 'good student' discounts, typically for high-school or college students under age 25. Maintaining a B average or performing well on the SAT or ACT could net substantial savings. State Farm, for example, offers up to 30% off for high marks.\n'There's no guarantee that a student with good grades won't get behind the wheel and do something crazy,' Baker conceded, but insurers are betting — for better or worse — that 'if they're doing right in school, they're probably less risky.'\nTrim the fat from your policy Sometimes savings are staring up at you from your current insurance plan, experts said.\nCheck your policy for redundancies and areas of overlap, said Cherry. For example, if you pay for AAA roadside assistance, you may be able to shave similar coverage off your auto insurance policy. Some newer cars already include some form of roadside assistance, he added.\nA common tactic for lowering monthly premiums is to choose a policy with a higher deductible. Marcus Miller, a Jacksonville, Fla.-based financial planner at Mainstay Capital, urged caution here. Some clients, he said, 'go in and just start slashing' line items from their policies and end up underinsured.\nInstead, it's smart to first build up an emergency fund for a potentially high deductible — and then make the switch, he advised.\nCustomers 'could reasonably increase their deductible, as long as they have that cash set aside,' Miller said. 'That will reduce their premium.'\nJ.J. McCorvey",

            "excerpt": "Far more animals than previously thought likely have consciousness, top scientists say in a new declaration — including fish, lobsters and octopus.",
            "summary": "Bees play by rolling wooden balls — apparently for fun. The cleaner wrasse fish appears to recognize its own visage in an underwater mirror. Octopuses seem to react to anesthetic drugs and will avoid settings where they likely experienced past pain.\nAll three of these discoveries came in the last five years — indications that the more scientists test animals, the more they find that many species may have inner lives and be sentient. A surprising range of creatures have shown evidence of conscious thought or experience, including insects, fish and some crustaceans.\nThat has prompted a group of top researchers on animal cognition to publish a new pronouncement that they hope will transform how scientists and society view — and care — for animals.\nNearly 40 researchers signed 'The New York Declaration on Animal Consciousness,' which was first presented at a conference at New York University on Friday morning. It marks a pivotal moment, as a flood of research on animal cognition collides with debates over how various species ought to be treated.\nThe declaration says there is 'strong scientific support' that birds and mammals have conscious experience, and a 'realistic possibility' of consciousness for all vertebrates — including reptiles, amphibians and fish. That possibility extends to many creatures without backbones, it adds, such as insects, decapod crustaceans (including crabs and lobsters) and cephalopod mollusks, like squid, octopus and cuttlefish.\n'When there is a realistic possibility of conscious experience in an animal, it is irresponsible to ignore that possibility in decisions affecting that animal,' the declaration says. 'We should consider welfare risks and use the evidence to inform our responses to these risks.'\nJonathan Birch, a professor of philosophy at the London School of Economics and a principal investigator on the Foundations of Animal Sentience project, is among the declaration's signatories. Whereas many scientists in the past assumed that questions about animal consciousness were unanswerable, he said, the declaration shows his field is moving in a new direction.\n'This has been a very exciting 10 years for the study of animal minds,' Birch said. 'People are daring to go there in a way they didn't before and to entertain the possibility that animals like bees and octopuses and cuttlefish might have some form of conscious experience.'\nFrom 'automata' to sentient There is not a standard definition for animal sentience or consciousness, but generally the terms denote an ability to have subjective experiences: to sense and map the outside world, to have capacity for feelings like joy or pain. In some cases, it can mean that animals possess a level of self-awareness.\nIn that sense, the new declaration bucks years of historical science orthodoxy. In the 17th century, the French philosopher René Descartes argued that animals were merely 'material automata' — lacking souls or consciousness.\nDescartes believed that animals 'can't feel or can't suffer,' said Rajesh Reddy, an assistant professor and director of the animal law program at Lewis & Clark College. 'To feel compassion for them, or empathy for them, was somewhat silly or anthropomorphizing.'\nIn the early 20th century, prominent behavioral psychologists promoted the idea that science should only study observable behavior in animals, rather than emotions or subjective experiences. But beginning in the 1960s, scientists started to reconsider. Research began to focus on animal cognition, primarily among other primates.\nBirch said the new declaration attempts to 'crystallize a new emerging consensus that rejects the view of 100 years ago that we have no way of studying these questions scientifically.'\nIndeed, a surge of recent findings underpin the new declaration. Scientists are developing new cognition tests and trying pre-existing tests on a wider range of species, with some surprises.\nTake, for example, the mirror-mark test, which scientists sometimes use to see if an animal recognizes itself.\nIn a series of studies, the cleaner wrasse fish seemed to pass the test.\nThe fish were placed in a tank with a covered mirror, to which they exhibited no unusual reaction. But after the cover was lifted, seven of 10 fish launched attacks toward the mirror, signaling they likely interpreted the image as a rival fish.\nAfter several days, the fish settled down and tried odd behaviors in front of the mirror, like swimming upside down, which had not been observed in the species before. Later, some appeared to spend an unusual amount of time in front of the mirror, examining their bodies. Researchers then marked the fish with a brown splotch under the skin, intended to resemble a parasite. Some fish tried to rub the mark off.\n'The sequence of steps that you would only ever have imagined seeing with an incredibly intelligent animal like a chimpanzee or a dolphin, they see in the cleaner wrasse,' Birch said. 'No one in a million years would have expected tiny fish to pass this test.'\nIn other studies, researchers found that zebrafish showed signs of curiosity when new objects were introduced into their tanks and that cuttlefish could remember things they saw or smelled. One experiment created stress for crayfish by electrically shocking them, then gave them anti-anxiety drugs used in humans. The drugs appeared to restore their usual behavior.\nBirch said these experiments are part of an expansion of animal consciousness research over the past 10 to 15 years.\n'We can have this much broader canvas where we're studying it in a very wide range of animals and not just mammals and birds, but also invertebrates like octopuses, cuttlefish,' he said. 'And even increasingly, people are talking about this idea in relation to insects.'\nAs more and more species show these types of signs, Reddy said, researchers might soon need to reframe their line of inquiry altogether: 'Scientists are being forced to reckon with this larger question — not which animals are sentient, but which animals aren't?'\nNew legal horizons Scientists' changing understanding of animal sentience could have implications for U.S. law, which does not classify animals as sentient on a federal level, according to Reddy. Instead, laws pertaining to animals focus primarily on conservation, agriculture or their treatment by zoos, research laboratories and pet retailers.\n'The law is a very slow moving vehicle and it really follows societal views on a lot of these issues,' Reddy said. 'This declaration, and other means of getting the public to appreciate that animals are not just biological automatons, can create a groundswell of support for raising protections.'\nState laws vary widely. A decade ago, Oregon passed a law recognizing animals as sentient and capable of feeling pain, stress and fear, which Reddy said has formed the bedrock of progressive judicial opinions in the state.\nMeanwhile, Washington and California are among several states where lawmakers this year have considered bans on octopus farming, a species for which scientists have found strong evidence of sentience.\nBritish law was recently amended to consider octopuses sentient beings — along with crabs and lobsters.\n'Once you recognize animals as sentient, the concept of humane slaughter starts to matter, and you need to make sure that the sort of methods you're using on them are humane,' Birch said. 'In the case of crabs and lobsters, there are pretty inhumane methods, like dropping them into pans of boiling water, that are very commonly used.'\nEvan Bush",

            "excerpt": "The Senate Finance Committee staff singled out Vanderbilt University Medical Center in a report for caving in to the demands of Tennessee's attorney general.",
            "summary": "Four attorneys general in conservative states have abused their authority to investigate transgender patients and their health care, and hospitals must do more to protect them, a new Senate Finance Committee report argues.\nThe report, titled 'How State Attorneys General Target Transgender Youth and Adults by Weaponizing the Medicaid Program and their Health Oversight Authority,' investigates how attorneys general in Tennessee, Missouri, Indiana and Texas have opened investigations into hospitals for alleged Medicaid fraud or violations of consumer protection laws. They opened the investigations, the report argues, 'in order to further ideological and political goals,' and there has been 'significant variation in hospitals' responses to such requests and their approaches to safeguarding the privacy of one of their most vulnerable patient populations—LGBTQIA+ people.'\nThe investigations have been opened as hundreds of state bills have sought to roll back transgender rights over the last few years. In recent years, 24 states have passed restrictions on gender-affirming medical care for trans minors, including puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery.\nThe report specifically singles out Vanderbilt University Medical Center, which turned over transgender patients' medical records to Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti in June as part of Skrmetti's investigation into alleged medical billing fraud.\n'Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) in Tennessee sits at one extreme: the hospital failed to object in any material manner to the Tennessee Attorney General's sweeping request and then caused undue terror to young patients and their families by supplying the Tennessee Attorney General with some of the records requested and then, again, by erroneously notifying some patients of medical record disclosures that had not occurred,' the report says.\nVUMC provided its correspondence with the attorney general's office to the Finance Committee staff, the report says. Through the correspondence, the report found that over seven months, from December 2022 to June 2023, VUMC provided 65,000 pages of documents to Skrmetti's office, 'including the medical records of 82 transgender patients, 72 of whom are Medicaid beneficiaries.'\nVUMC notified patients their records had been disclosed on June 19, the report found. 'After receiving this information, many patients experienced suicidal ideation and suffered significant emotional distress, including depression and anxiety,' the report says, citing an ongoing class-action lawsuit filed against VUMC by two patients whose medical information it provided to the attorney general.\nMichael Regier, the medical center's general counsel and secretary, said that the hospital disputes the report's findings and that it had 'sent a detailed letter outlining our concerns about its proposed findings before it was released.'\n'Under the current law, state and federal government authorities are permitted to seek medical records for investigations, and healthcare providers must comply. In this case, we made every effort to both protect our patients and follow the law,' Regier said in an emailed statement. 'At no point did we violate privacy laws, and we strongly disagree with any suggestion that we did. VUMC remains committed to protecting patient privacy under the law, and ensuring all who come to our facilities receive world-class medical care.'\nSkrmetti's investigation into VUMC is ongoing, and it 'exclusively targets health care providers, not any patients,' Amy Lannom Wilhite, Skrmetti's spokesperson, said in an emailed statement.\n'Our Civil Medicaid Fraud Unit began investigating after watching a video in which a VUMC doctor described how she manipulated billing codes to avoid insurance coverage limitations. There is no political exception to our fraud laws and we will continue to investigate as the evidence demands, regardless of a doctor's ideology,' Wilhite wrote.\nVUMC declined to comment on Skrmetti's investigation and the video.\nThe Finance Committee report found that two hospitals, in contrast to VUMC, made a variety of efforts to avoid providing transgender patients' records to state attorneys general. Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis refused to share records with Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February 2023 when Bailey filed a civil investigative demand citing a state consumer protection law. The university cited concerns about privacy and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which protects patient information, and it filed a petition in state court questioning whether Bailey had the authority to investigate.\n'As a father of four, this fight is personal for me. There is no more important court battle than to ensure Missouri is the safest state in the nation for children,' Bailey said in an emailed statement.\n'My team will get to the bottom of how this clandestine network of clinics has subjected children to puberty blockers and irreversible surgery, often without parental consent,' he said, mischaracterizing how transition-related care is provided to minors. State laws require physicians to obtain parental permission to provide any care to minors, and widely used standards of care also do not recommend surgery for minors except in rare circumstances.\nMadeline Sieren, a spokesperson for Bailey, said that his office is awaiting a court ruling on the Washington University demand but that judges have ruled in the attorney general's favor in similar cases involving Children's Mercy Hospital in St. Louis, Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri and Planned Parenthood Great Plains.\nThe Finance Committee report also found that Seattle Children's Hospital 'took a hard stance' against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton after he sent the hospital a subpoena in November because he suspected it was providing gender-affirming medical care to trans minors who live in Texas, where such care is prohibited for minors. The hospital filed a petition in Travis County District Court in December to dismiss the subpoena. The case is ongoing.\nPaxton's office did not reply to a request for comment.\nAlongside Tuesday's report, a group of more than 40 Democratic members of Congress, led by Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden, of Oregon, also sent letters asking five hospital and health associations to urge their member hospitals 'to protect American patients' medical privacy from abusive legal demands by state attorneys general.'\n'In at least four states, AGs have abused their legal powers to demand that hospitals and other healthcare facilities disclose transgender youth and adults' complete and identifiable medical and billing records,' the lawmakers wrote in a letter addressed to Dr. Bruce Siegel, president and CEO of America's Essential Hospitals, a hospital association with more than 300 members. 'These thinly veiled political assaults come at the expense of vulnerable patients. We are concerned that hospitals are feebly complying with AGs' requests, betraying their obligation to protect patient privacy.'\nThe Democratic senators sent similar letters to the American Hospital Association, the Federation of American Hospitals, the Children's Hospital Association and the National Rural Health Association.\nWyden said in a statement that Vanderbilt, specifically, 'failed its responsibility to protect their patients' privacy' and cited fears about the potential widespread effect of hospitals' giving up on such privacy, particularly after the repeal of Roe v. Wade, opening 'the door to criminalizing women's private reproductive health choices.'\n'A handful of red-state attorneys general are misusing their authority to terrorize transgender teens in their states, violating patients' privacy and causing real harm to vulnerable kids and adults in the process,' Wyden said. 'It's shameful that law-enforcement officials are choosing to persecute teens trying to live their lives, just to score points with far-right activists.'\nFor more from NBC Out, sign up for our weekly newsletter.\nFor more from NBC Out, sign up for our weekly newsletter.\nJo Yurcaba",

Mike Johnson faces his most perilous moment yet as House speaker By Sahil Kapur House Speaker Mike Johnson faces the biggest threat to his gavel nearly six months into the job, with the walls closing in from both sides of his divided Republican Party on providing aid to U.S. allies.\nAfter wavering for months and exhausting his timeouts, he's finally calling the play: a trigger for separate votes on four bills — assistance for Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and a hodgepodge of other national security priorities important to Republicans.\nEach one will have a unique coalition, and that's the point.\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know In theory, Israel aid can pass with mostly Republicans, over progressive opposition. Ukraine aid — structured as a loan — can pass with mostly Democrats, over conservative opposition. The GOP opponents of assisting Ukraine can vote against it, and the GOP proponents of giving the country weapons to fend off Russian aggression finally get off Johnson's back.\nMeanwhile, Johnson's public Republican opposition just doubled: Rep. Thomas Massie announced Tuesday that he would co-sponsor Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to remove him as speaker. Massie said he's 'pretty certain' Johnson has more GOP opponents today than the eight who ousted Kevin McCarthy as speaker in October, though he didn't name names.\n'Mike Johnson is going for the Triple Crown here against our base. He has voted for an omnibus that spends more than Pelosi. He's put his finger on the scales to pass FISA without warrants. And now he's about to do Ukraine without protecting our own border,' Massie said. 'This will get called and he will lose the vote.'\nTwo votes may not seem like much, but after this Friday, Johnson will have a staggering one-vote majority. Two defections and Johnson loses — unless Democrats step in to rescue him and vote against a motion to vacate. That would be extremely unusual, but some centrist Democrats say they'd do it, especially if Johnson brings up Ukraine aid.\n'He's got to manage his politics. And if they try and kick him out as speaker, I'm going to vote to keep him,' said Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y.\nMassie said a Democratic rescue would ultimately do more harm than good to Johnson.\n'Then he goes further in the hole with Republicans,' Massie said. 'He becomes toxic to the conference. For every Democrat who comes to his aid he'll lose 2-3 more Republicans. … There's no sustainable solution where Democrats save him.'\nAnd that sums up Johnson's dilemma: He can't govern with his far-right rebels, but he can't hold on to his job without them. The same dynamic became too much for McCarthy to navigate. Today, Johnson has an even slimmer majority.\nStill, he recognizes that he can't be cowed by such threats or he becomes fully captured by the agitators. And this could be the last major piece of business until the 2024 election, when voters will redetermine the makeup of Congress.\n'I am not resigning. And it is in my view an absurd notion that someone would bring a vacate motion when we are simply here trying to do our jobs,' Johnson told reporters. 'I am not concerned about this. I am going to do my job.'\nFirst jurors are seated in Trump's hush money trial Donald Trump during jury selection on the second day of his trial at Manhattan Criminal Court on Tuesday. Curtis Means / Getty Images pool By Adam Reiss, Dareh Gregorian, Jonathan Allen and Lisa Rubin The first seven jurors were selected Tuesday in Trump's hush money trial amid a battle over prospective jurors' old Facebook posts and calls to 'lock him up' and a warning from the judge that the former president should not try to intimidate the panelists who will be deciding his fate.\n'I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom. I want to make this crystal clear,' Judge Juan Merchan told Trump and his lawyer Todd Blanche. The judge told Blanche that Trump had 'audibly' said something in the direction of a juror while she was '12 feet away from your client.'\nMerchan said he didn't know what Trump said, but that he'd been 'muttering' and 'gesturing' at the juror, and directed Blanche to talk to his client about his behavior. Blanche then whispered something into Trump's ear.\nThe incident underscores Trump's penchant for acting up in court and the problems his lawyers might have keeping him in check.\nThe drama came on the second day of jury selection. The jury is anonymous so their names weren't used in open court, but the panelists include a salesman, an oncology nurse, an IT consultant, a teacher and a software engineer.\nOverall, the quest to find a jury of 12 people and six alternates who could be 'fair and impartial' when it comes to the polarizing New York native and former commander-in-chief moved at a brisker pace compared to Monday.\nThe trial doesn't sit on Wednesdays, so the process will resume on Thursday.\nRead more on the second day of the Trump trial here →\nTrump needs a different type of swing voter in Manhattan Analysis by Steve Kornacki Trump's legal team argues that the former president faces 'real potential prejudice' in his hush money trial because of its venue: Manhattan, the bluest borough in one of the bluest big cities in America.\nWhether this could actually have any bearing on the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's ability to receive a fair trial is a matter of debate. But simply in terms of its political leanings, Manhattan's partisan bent is stark.\nAs a whole, New York City backed Joe Biden over Trump by a 76-23% margin in 2020. But of the five boroughs that comprise the Big Apple, it was Manhattan that produced Biden's most lopsided margins:\nEach of these boroughs features its own particular demographic and political mix. The lone red redoubt of Staten Island, for instance, has by far the smallest population and is more suburban in character, with considerable local support for secession from the rest of the city.\nThe other four boroughs are densely populated Democratic bastions. But even among these four, Manhattan stands out. Why is it a shade or two bluer than the others? A comparison of its demographics to those of the city as a whole reveals an explanation:\nSimply put, compared to New York City overall, Manhattan is whiter and wealthier and contains a much deeper concentration of white residents with college degrees. That's a demographic mix that, especially in the Trump era, has been political gold for Democrats.\nRegistered voters in Manhattan (one of the sources from which potential jurors are drawn) are more than 10 times more likely to be Democrats (72%) than Republicans (7%). Political engagement runs higher in Manhattan as well: While it accounts for 19.2% of the city's population, it represented 22.9% of all New York City votes cast in 2020.\nThe combination of its size, turnout level and partisan tendencies makes Manhattan one of the biggest single sources of Democratic votes anywhere in the country. To put this in perspective, the 603,040 votes Biden received in Manhattan in 2020 was larger than his total in 20 states.\nWhen it comes to his legal fate in Manhattan, Trump is going to need a very different kind of swing voter.\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

            "excerpt": "Trump is taking aim at Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as several recent polls show he may have more to lose from the independent's presence on the ballot.",
            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he's confident that independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will pull more votes away from President Joe Biden than from him — a net win for the Republican's candidacy.\n'He is Crooked Joe Biden's Political Opponent, not mine,' Trump wrote on Truth Social late last month. 'I love that he is running!'\nBehind closed doors, however, Trump is less sure. A Republican who was in the room with Trump earlier this year as the former president reviewed polling said Trump was unsure of how Kennedy would impact the race, asking the other people on hand whether or not Kennedy was actually good for his candidacy.\nAnd after mostly ignoring Kennedy early in his campaign, Trump has stepped up his efforts to brand the independent candidate as left-wing and make him Biden's problem, suggesting that he and allies are concerned about Kennedy's ability to attract Republican voters. In the same post in which he called Kennedy Biden's political opponent, Trump called Kennedy 'the most Radical Left Candidate in the race, by far,' someone who was 'a big fan of the Green New Scam' and 'other economy killing disasters.'\nIn a video monologue he posted to his social media page this month, Trump described Kennedy as being to Biden's left but said Kennedy has 'got some nice things about him' and 'I happen to like him.'\n'If I were a Democrat, I'd vote for RFK Jr. every single time over Biden because he's frankly more in line with Democrats,' Trump said, adding, 'I do believe that RFK Jr. will do very well. And I do believe he's going to take a lot of votes away from crooked Joe Biden.'\nTrump's increased focus on Kennedy comes as Democrats have increased their attention on third-party contenders, standing up super PACs and other anti-spoiler efforts meant to kneecap independent challengers who could pull from Biden and reduce the vote share Trump needs to get over the top this fall. And in defiance of earlier conventional wisdom about the 2024 race, new polling shows that right now Trump might have the most to lose with Kennedy on the ballot.\nAn NBC News national poll released Sunday found that Kennedy cut deeper into Trump's support than Biden's. The survey found that 15% of voters who picked Trump in a head-to-head matchup with Biden switched to choose Kennedy in a five-way ballot test, while just 7% of those who initially selected Biden in the head-to-head switched to Kennedy when third-party candidates were added.\nThat trend meant Trump went from leading Biden by 2 percentage points in a head-to-head survey to trailing him by 2 points when the race is expanded to five named candidates, including Kennedy. The survey's margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\nRepublican voters view Kennedy much more favorably than Democrats. The poll found that 40% of self-identified Republicans viewed Kennedy favorably, while 15% held negative views of the independent candidate. For Democrats, just 16% had positive views of Kennedy, while 53% expressed a negative view of him.\nThat's in part the result of conservative media and Trump allies heaping praise on Kennedy when he was initially running in the Democratic primary against Biden, as well as prior to this election cycle as Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, railed against the medical establishment and so-called social media 'censorship.'\nA Republican who worked on a door-knocking effort in an early state for a Trump primary opponent told NBC News that Kennedy often came up as the second choice among people who said they were backing Trump.\nA changing posture Trump himself has offered kind words for Kennedy in the past. During a June 2023 interview on the Howie Carr Show, Trump described Kennedy as 'a common sense guy.' Right-wing allies like Steve Bannon, Alex Jones and Roger Stone openly pined for Trump to pick Kennedy as his running mate.\nThe vibe is different now.\nThe pro-Trump PAC MAGA Inc. this month launched a 'Radical F---ing Kennedy' website dedicated to promoting the candidate's left-wing positions. Kennedy, meanwhile, has criticized Trump from the right, hitting him for taking advice from Dr. Anthony Fauci during the pandemic and for running up the deficit. He said another Trump term 'would be bad for the country.'\n'President Trump calls me an ultra-left radical,' Kennedy posted on X in response to the MAGA Inc. website. 'I'm soooo liberal that his emissaries asked me to be his VP. I respectfully declined the offer.' (Trump's campaign has denied that Kennedy was ever approached about being the former president's running mate.)\n'I am against President Trump, and President Biden can't win,' Kennedy's post continued. 'Judging by his new website, it looks like President Trump knows who actually can beat him.'\nOn the whole, there have been public surveys showing both major party candidates suffering more as a result of Kennedy's campaign. The dynamic also may change depending on which state is being surveyed — and which states feature Kennedy on the ballot in November, a battle that is still in progress.\n'Nobody has conducted more polls than I have on Kennedy and his place in the race — and continuously I have seen him draw equally from Biden and Trump,' said Jeremy Zogby, a managing partner at John Zogby Strategies who has polled for Kennedy's campaign. 'Sometimes a point or two towards one side in a poll, and vice versa in another poll. The fact remains Kennedy has crossover appeal among those disaffected within both parties,' like the 'double haters' who dislike both Biden and Trump.\nDemocrats have long worried that Kennedy's association with his famous father and uncles will win over some liberals who are fond of the family. Plus, Kennedy for years gained acclaim as an environmental activist and an anti-corporate crusader, two causes that have him finding common ground with Democratic voters.\nLast week, Biden held an event with Kennedy family members who touted the president and warned of the danger their relative's campaign posed. And on Monday, the Democratic National Committee announced it was launching billboards in Arizona depicting Kennedy as a pro-Trump spoiler candidate.\nA strategist working on the Democrats' anti-third party effort said the data shows Kennedy is clearly taking a slice from both major party candidates, as well as a portion of voters who wouldn't be open to voting for either Trump or Biden.\n'I think the data's moved a little bit over the last month-plus,' this person said. 'But it's all on the margins, it's tough to tell whether this is RFK appealing more to Trump voters, or some Trump voters just looking for an off-ramp, or both. Ditto on the Biden end — is this just reflecting the fact that Biden's ticked up a few points?'\nOne Trump ally said the presumptive GOP nominee should hold off on hitting Kennedy for now, arguing there will be time later this fall to go after him as 'too liberal for America' if these polling trends continue.\n'The second you start attacking him or even addressing him, you start giving credibility to and you start firming up those votes,' this person said, 'At the moment, he's irrelevant. As you get close and votes start hardening in terms of who people are voting for and when and why and how, then you've got to start making moves.'\nIn a statement, Trump's campaign railed against Kennedy's environmental positions and described him as 'no independent , ' while also hitting Democrats for challenging his efforts to get on the ballot.\n,' while also hitting Democrats for challenging his efforts to get on the ballot. 'RFK Jr. is an AOC lover and opposes really any human advancement, preferring that we all live in caves by candlelight, except of course supports charging stations for your $150,000 electric car that can only drive a few miles before dying just like his presidential campaign,' said Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director.\nTony Lyons, a co-founder of the pro-Kennedy super PAC American Values 2024 and the president of Skyhorse Publishing, said there will be a 'pendulum swinging back and forth' throughout the campaign that shows Kennedy at times being better for Trump and at other times boosting Biden's candidacy.\nLyons said Kennedy will soon be promoting a 30-minute infomercial posted online that aims to hit back on the attacks he's facing from his rivals.\n'The fascinating part of it is that Trump says he's ultra left-wing,' Lyons said. 'And Biden says that he's ultra right-wing.'\nAllan Smith Alex Seitz-Wald and Vaughn Hillyard contributed.",

            "excerpt": "How moderate Democrats joined with old enemies on the left to stop their own friends in the center from challenging Joe Biden.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Once upon a time, before the multimillion-dollar negative campaigns and allegations of running 'a conspiracy to commit extortion, voter intimidation, and other criminal behavior,' they were friends. Good friends.\nThe people who run No Labels and Third Way, two of the most prominent centrist organizations in Washington, had all come up together in the small world of Clinton-era center-left politics.\nNancy Jacobson, an early Bill Clinton hire and the founder of No Labels, helped raise the initial money and secure the necessary political blessings to start Third Way. The think tank was co-founded by Jon Cowan, whom Jacobson viewed as something of a mentee. Cowan, now Third Way's president, even signed the ketubah (the Jewish wedding contract) at Jacobson's wedding to Mark Penn, whose firm conducts No Labels' polls.\nThen came the 2024 election — and No Labels' decision to try to field a bipartisan 'unity ticket' against both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, backed by a reported budget of $70 million. Third Way, which may be centrist but is firmly Democratic, viewed this as a misguided, no-hope effort that could only spoil the election for Biden and help to re-elect Trump, with potentially disastrous consequences.\n\"There were deep personal stakes and relationships,\" Cowan said.\nA centrist civil war broke out in the C-suites and steakhouses of Washington and Manhattan. Like so many insider conflicts, it was deeply personal. There were betrayal, a double agent, a secret team of political operatives, some very unlikely allies — and a decisive victory for one side that left the other seething and bitter.\nEven some people close to No Labels acknowledge the campaign against it largely succeeded in its mission: dissuading any potential candidates from joining its ticket. But the cost, they say, will be a gaping wound at the center of what's left of American centrism.\n\"What does Third Way go back to?\" asked former Rep. Max Rose, a moderate New York Democrat who spoke to NBC News at Jacobson's request. \"Because it doesn't seem logical that an organization that considers itself a centrist policy organization randomly makes war on another organization like this.\"\nOr as Holly Page, a longtime moderate Democratic strategist who has worked for both groups but ended up in No Labels' camp put it of Third Way: 'They sold out the center so they could get a seat at the table with [former Biden chief of staff] Ron Klain.\"\nNo Labels was so incensed by what Page referred to as the anti-No Labels campaign's \"little fraternity games\" that the group lodged a complaint with the Justice Department. In a letter and an indignant news conference, they accused their old friends and their new allies of violating anti-racketeering laws, typically used to prosecute the mafia, by engaging in an \"unlawful conspiracy to subvert Americans' voting rights.\" There is no sign the Justice Department took any action on the compliant.\nThird Way and its allies, meanwhile, believe they're the real moderates here. They forged an actual bipartisan coalition of groups spanning Republicans to progressives to support a moderate Democratic president and to stop Trump, few people's idea of a moderate, whom they note No Labels praised as a \"problem solver\" during his 2016 campaign.\nthey're the real moderates here. They forged an actual bipartisan coalition of groups spanning Republicans to progressives to support a moderate Democratic president and to stop Trump, few people's idea of a moderate, whom they note No Labels praised as a \"problem solver\" during his 2016 campaign. 'You're not building a pro-Biden coalition; it's an anti-Trump coalition,' said Sarah Longwell, a Republican strategist and publisher of the conservative website The Bulwark, who supported the anti-No Labels effort. 'They absolutely would subtract people who, when push comes to shove, will vote for Joe Biden.'\nSimilar beginnings go separate ways In many ways, Third Way was an unlikely marshal for a No Labels counterstrike.\nBoth have long been dismissed by the left as stodgy corporatists and crypto-Republicans, and Third Way and No Labels exist in overlapping social circles, draw from similar funders and promote a common ideology. Third Way's previous campaigns took on the left, like when it fought progressive challengers in House primaries and tried to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., from winning the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.\n'Everybody in the centrist donor universe knew No Labels was doing this ticket, and everybody knew we were leading the opposition. You were on one side or the other,' Cowan said. 'And on the other side were some of the wealthiest people in the country and they were very angry at us.'\nThird Way lost a board member who sided with No Labels, and its leaders received word from several other unhappy donors that they should not expect another cent.\nBut while Third Way is fundamentally a Democratic organ, Jacobson has fallen (or been pushed, depending on whom you ask) out of the party's ranks, and now, No Labels views itself as the only group righteous and innovative enough to think outside the red-blue divide.\nStill, that familiarity meant Third Way spoke enough of No Labels' language to understand it and the people funding it — and how to reach the potential candidates it tried to recruit.\nAnd Third Way's moderate credentials helped it pick off potential No Labels allies, from its affiliated members of Congress to New York Times columnist David Brooks — the first major voice to hoist the unity ticket flag, only to later lower it — to the Clintons, the first family of Democratic centrism.\nThe former president and secretary of state hardly needed convincing of the threat a third-party campaign posed to Biden — Hillary Clinton had partly blamed the Green Party for her 2016 loss. So over lunch last July at their home in Chappaqua, New York, the Clintons, each joined by a top aide, talked through strategy with Cowan and Third Way Vice President Matt Bennett and vowed to help privately through their networks, according to three sources familiar with the meeting.\nBill Clinton joined the anti-recruiting team working against No Labels, making personal appeals to two prominent No Labels targets — Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican — that a third-party candidate could not win.\n'Pearl Harbored' Jacobson expressed anger, dismay and a sense of betrayal about Third Way's actions. 'We were Pearl Harbored,' she told supporters on a call, first reported by Puck.\nBill Clinton's lobbying effort was part of a broader campaign, which included dozens groups and prominent figures from the left, the center and the anti-Trump right, built around Third Way's 'war room.'\nAs Bennett put it in the first large gathering of the group, they had to 'build the idea in the minds of the political elites and the people that they talk to ... that if you get involved with this ... you're really risking your entire reputation and your legacy.'\nThird Way identified a long list of potential No Labels targets and set about finding common friends and allies between the potential candidates and the anti-No Labels coalition — people who would be seen as credible messengers. No Labels said 30 candidates passed. And by the end, the opposing coalition says, it reached every name that surfaced.\nThird Way leaders worked the Democratic side of the aisle after securing the blessing of party leaders in the White House, on Capitol Hill and in the Democratic National Committee. Meanwhile, its anti-Trump GOP allies and a clandestine team of 10 to 20 Republican operatives worked to 'surround' potential candidates with appeals, including survey research commissioned from former Rep. Liz Cheney's pollster, which concluded that they could not win running with No Labels.\nEvery potential candidate got a message tailored to their pressure points — their financial needs, their legacies, their future political prospects — from credible figures like local business leaders, clergy and former aides.\nThe chief goal was to make it impossible for No Labels to deliver the kind of big-name ticket it had promised.\n\"This was elite-driven,\" Bennett said. \"We knew they had enough donors that we couldn't deny them money. But we also knew enough about their donors to know they would expect a high-level candidate with a certain stature and would not accept someone who was not obviously credible.\"\nTheir targets included highly publicized suspects like Manchin, Hogan and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, though they were particularly worried about Bill Haslam, the former governor of Tennessee, because he is a billionaire who could self-fund.\nUnlikely allies It wasn't just anti-Trump Republicans like the Lincoln Project and former Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol who joined Third Way's efforts to brush back No Labels. Mainstream Democrats like Klain and former Democratic Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama were joined by leaders on the left who were used to warring, not collaborating, with Third Way.\nLunching with Bennett and working with his group helped 'humanize' people she had viewed as 'an enemy,' said Melissa Byrne, a left-wing activist who has often sparred with moderate Democrats over issues like student debt.\nByrne stressed — 'print this in all caps, bold,' she said — that she will go to war again with Third Way over policy if and when the time comes.\nBennett and the executive director of the liberal group MoveOn, Rahna Epting, ended up working together closely, playing up an odd-couple routine in a series of meetings on Capitol Hill, in the media and even in a public debate against No Labels strategists.\n'Our partnership with Third Way to come together and stop No Labels may be surprising to some, but it is a testament to how high the stakes are to keep Trump out of the White House,' Epting said.\nMeanwhile, some Republicans joined a campaign run by Democrats thanks to a similar calculation: Despite their policy differences, they were united by opposition to Trump and a shared belief that a third-party candidate could be a decisive boon to him.\n\"If you want to go experiment with third-party stuff, go crazy — just not this year,\" said Rick Wilson, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project, another cornerstone of the anti-No Labels campaign.\nThe broad coalition even included a secret member from the most unlikely of sources: No Labels itself.\nNo Labels did its best to keep the names of its delegates, donors and potential candidates under wraps. But the anti-No Labels campaign felt it had a good idea what was going on behind the curtain, thanks to a No Labels delegate who had grown disillusioned and started leaking to the other side.\nThe turncoat, whom Cowan and Bennett would only say was an 'average citizen' who initially joined No Labels out of a sincere belief in its mission, 'was incredibly helpful to us and did so at some personal sacrifice and risk,' Bennett said.\nPeople familiar with No Labels' thinking did not dispute that they had a leaker and said they were unaware of who it might be.\nBut No Labels allies say these kinds of cloak-and-dagger tactics highlight the hypocrisy, as they see it, of supposed champions of democracy and voting rights opposing another party's ballot access.\n'It's just discouraging to see partisans and politicians protecting their turf,' said former Rep. Joe Cunningham, a Democrat from South Carolina who worked with No Labels.\nRose, the former New York congressman, said No Labels' presidential ticket was always a long shot, so its opponents' victory lap is just \"someone seeing where things were going anyway and trying to claim credit.\"\n\"No Labels considered something that didn't really have legs and made a pretty noble decision to not pursue it,' he said.\nWhile No Labels' 2024 push is over, third-party candidates are still in the campaign, especially another ex-Democrat who could affect Biden's chances in November: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Countering Kennedy, though, will be a very different kind of conflict, even as Third Way remains committed to battling Biden's third-party foes.\nThird Way turned out to be the right group for the job of taking down No Labels. Can they take down an outsider too?\nAlex Seitz-Wald",

But in light of Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack in Israel, Israel's ongoing military campaign in Gaza and tensions at home, they said, the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh told them they needed to be vigilant about who enters their business.\n'That's the reality of the world,' Dan Cohen said.\nIt's not the first time they've had to take additional safety precautions. The couple completed their purchase of Pinsker's Books and Judaica in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood in 2018 just days after a white supremacist gunned down 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue a few blocks away in the deadliest antisemitic attack in American history. But this time feels different.\n'Oct. 27 really unified' Squirrel Hill and Pittsburgh, Baila Cohen said of the Tree of Life massacre. 'Oct. 7 … really started polarizing the community itself, because that's when we started seeing much more of the infighting and conflicts.'\nConversations with more than 30 political strategists, activists and voters outlined how that tension has put Jewish voters in an unfamiliar spot ahead of the 2024 elections: on the front lines of the fight for control of the White House and Congress. Nowhere is that more apparent than in Pennsylvania, the swing state with the largest Jewish population — about 300,000 voting-age Jews in a state President Joe Biden won by roughly 80,000 votes in 2020.\nWhat's more, the congressional district that includes Squirrel Hill features a primary Tuesday that is among the first electoral tests of sentiment on both sides of the conflict in Gaza and concerns over rising antisemitism in the U.S. Democratic Rep. Summer Lee, a 'squad'-aligned progressive critical of Israel's handling of the war and one of the first lawmakers to call for a cease-fire last year, will face Bhavini Patel, an Edgewood Borough Council member who has painted Lee's advocacy as harmful to Biden's re-election chances and out of step with her district.\n'We have communities that are hurting. The Jewish community is one of them. And there are people who are … not going to agree 100% on everything that you say,' Lee said in an interview, adding she has been 'very clear and very upfront' about her cease-fire position. 'I have condemned Hamas. We've worked with the families of hostages; we've done everything that I think is necessary to do that. And at the end of the day, we disagree.'\nA dozen Jewish voters in the district who spoke to NBC News, whether supporting Lee or Patel, almost universally said their votes in November would be driven by issues beyond Israel, saying that the Jewish electorate isn't a 'monolith' and that democracy, abortion rights and the economy weighed heavily on them.\nMost Jewish voters in Squirrel Hill — and nationally — align with the Democratic Party. A Pew Research Center survey released this month found 69% of Jews leaning Democratic, while 29% aligned Republican.\nBut Republicans aren't looking for a massive defection. GOP strategists and Republicans involved in Jewish outreach expressed confidence that Democratic divisions over Israel will help move a small but potentially significant number of Jewish voters into their camp in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona. They pointed to surveys showing President Donald Trump's improved performance among Jews in 2020, compared with his 2016 race, as evidence of a slow shift that could continue.\n'Before Oct. 7, most candidates would say this issue is so messy. … It's not necessarily something that I want to focus on in my campaign,' said Tali deGroot, political director for the liberal Jewish group J Street. 'And I would have said, ‘Absolutely, this isn't a voting issue for people we poll year after year.' And it's too soon to tell if it's going to be a voting issue. But not talking about it is not an option.'‘Playing with fire' In Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, the war and its impact at home took center stage last week at a campaign event where Lee launched her 'Jews for Summer' coalition.\nLee talked about 'how our liberation is tied together,' whether 'in western Pennsylvania or the West Bank.' She spoke about how the district still needs 'deep healing' following both the Oct. 7 attack and the killing of Jews at Tree of Life. And she framed her primary as a covert Republican effort to divide a multiethnic, cross-religious support base by using splits over Israel.\n'There are people who have to convince you that the only reason why I could believe in peace is because I actually hate some of our neighbors, not because we love each other,' said Lee, who overcame significant spending by groups aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group, when she narrowly won her first congressional primary in 2022.\nIsrael didn't have the salience it does now. Lee has accused the Israeli government of committing 'war crimes,\" called for an end to unconditional military aid to the country and joined a handful of other progressives in mid-2022, before the Israel-Hamas war, who voted against a GOP-led resolution that said Israel wasn't 'a racist or apartheid state.' She has also condemned Hamas' attack and repeatedly spoken out against antisemitism.\nOn Saturday, she joined 36 Democrats and 21 Republicans in voting against an aid package to the country, which passed overwhelmingly. She and Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., were the only Pennsylvania members to vote against it.\nHer early call for a cease-fire is now largely in step with Democratic voters, but Jewish leaders have expressed unease with how Lee and some of her allies have discussed the issue. Last month, more than 40 Pittsburgh-area rabbis wrote in a letter, after an earlier meeting with Lee, that she has 'continued to use divisive rhetoric' that the group has at times 'perceived as openly antisemitic.'\nTheir letter didn't describe that rhetoric, but it said Lee opposed House measures to condemn antisemitism and criticized her calls for an 'unconditional cease-fire from one side,' which they said 'devalues the lives and beliefs of one group.' They also called on her to return campaign contributions 'from people who have voiced virulently antisemitic sentiments.' In February, Lee canceled an appearance before the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations amid backlash over other speakers' antisemitic and homophobic remarks, which she condemned.\nKaren Hochenberg, president of a local Democratic club that has endorsed Patel, said Lee has lost considerable support in the Jewish community, including hers. While Hochenberg aligns with Lee on many issues, she and others have been 'hurt' by some of her votes and actions, and she said she wished Lee had been more vocal about the Hamas attack.\n'Many Jews now are starting to question where are we on the road map of intersectionality,' Hochenberg said. 'Jews are starting to really take a look at how comfortable we are and if we're going to send candidates to Congress who's going to be there and have the voice of the Jewish community in mind, as well.'\nJeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgher leading a new Jewish voter group, said the pushback Lee faces isn't so much about Israel but about what he called an unwillingness to meet with constituents who don't share her views.\n'She finds the individuals who agree with her already who are anti-Zionist, who are extremist or fringe of the left of politics, and she will hold them up on a pedestal while spreading things' that, Kazzaz said, make local Jews 'less safe.'\nBut overall, Lee is looking stronger in her district now than in her first run, even to some opponents. AIPAC-linked groups aren't getting involved in her primary this time. Lee has framed her campaign around efforts to counter MAGA Republicans and bring federal dollars to the district.\nJonathan Mayo, a Squirrel Hill resident co-leading the Jews for Summer coalition, told NBC News he aligns with Lee's position on Israel but emphasized that he's not a single-issue voter.\n'It is so important to speak out and show that there are members of the Squirrel Hill Jewish community who still very much support Summer Lee,' he said.\nPatel, meanwhile, is framing her challenge to Lee around who offers Biden the most support, hitting Lee for not criticizing activists and groups calling for 'uncommitted' votes against the president in Tuesday's primary.\n'It's essentially playing with fire,' Patel said in an interview, arguing it could boost Trump.\nLee allies have countered that anti-Biden GOP megadonors support Patel's campaign. An outside group boosting Patel recently disclosed that it received an $800,000 donation from right-wing billionaire Jeffrey Yass. (Patel said she 'denounces' Yass, calling any focus on him a distraction.)\nLee has said she is supporting Biden in the fall. She's endorsed by congressional Democratic leadership and by Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has become arguably the most staunchly pro-Israel Democrat in Congress. And in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, Biden shouted out Lee as someone 'who had my back.'\n'We're going to make sure that the person who's sitting in the White House is not going to be replaced,' Lee said at her event on a recent Sunday.\nSeveral attendees said they were casting anti-Biden protest votes Tuesday. But most said they would support him this fall.\nOne of them, Harry Hochheiser, said Biden 'is the only legitimate choice' against Trump. He said the divisions opened up in the Jewish community over the war have been devastating.\n'I don't think any of us enjoy these divisions,' Hochheiser, a University of Pittsburgh professor and pro-Palestinian activist voting uncommitted in the primary but backing Biden against Trump, said of tensions in the Jewish community over Israel.\n‘More salient than it has been' The fight for Jewish votes in Pittsburgh is only part of a bigger landscape. Across Pennsylvania, Republican Dave McCormick has put Israel at the forefront of his campaign against Democratic Sen. Bob Casey. Nationally, groups in both parties are preparing for what they say could be the largest investment ever made to court the Jewish vote at the presidential level.\nBiden's handling of the war is the main flashpoint. Initially, he was more deferential to Israel. But as the death toll mounted in Gaza and left-wing blowback intensified at home, he has sharpened his criticism of Israeli leadership, pushed for increased humanitarian aid and ramped-up efforts to reach a cease-fire agreement. Still, he hasn't gone as far as his critics to his left would like.\nAs for whether Republicans can pick up voters disaffected by the Democratic divide over Israel, Mark Mellman, president of Democratic Majority for Israel, said it's 'mostly noise' but cautioned 'there is a serious chance' depending how the coming months play out.\nJewish voters have 'been extraordinarily appreciative of the support that President Biden and Democratic leaders have given Israel over the course of this conflict,' he said. 'I hear from some people that is beginning to change as people perceive some change in the positions of those Democratic leaders. But look … Biden has been extraordinary.'\nA 2021 Pew Research Center survey found a wide split in partisanship among Jewish voters depending on which movement they aligned with. Orthodox Jews favored Republicans over Democrats by 75% to 20%, while 70% of Conservative Jews and 80% of Reform Jews backed Democrats.\nSam Markstein, national political director at the Republican Jewish Coalition, said much of the Jewish vote is based in states where Republicans have no shot at all, contributing to the gulf in support between Republicans and Democrats. Pointing to an Associated Press VoteCast survey after the 2020 election that found Trump improved on his 2016 performance among Jewish voters, Markstein predicts the Republican Jewish Coalition will make its 'largest investment at the top of the ticket ever' this cycle to target Jewish voters in battlegrounds.\n'That's where you're going to see the most success this year,' he said.\nSome other surveys had more positive trends for Democrats. This month's Pew survey found the share of Jewish voters who align with Democrats has increased 8 points since 2020.\nDan Siegel, who led Jewish outreach for Biden's 2020 campaign, said Jewish voters' foremost concerns are similar to those of any other voting group: the economy, health care and education.\n'I do think [Israel] may be a little bit more top of mind. But I also think at the end of the day, elections are a binary choice,' Siegel said, predicting Jewish voters 'are going to want that strong, steady hand, not an authoritarian demagogue who is unwieldy at best in a crisis.'\nTrump, who strongly favored Israel as president, has offered limited commentary on the war. Speaking last month with Israel Hayom, an Israeli newspaper, Trump said, 'You have to finish up your war. You have to get it done. We have to get to peace. We can't have this going on.'\nBiden's campaign has zoomed in on recent comments Trump has made about Jewish voters; he said on Real America's Voice that 'any Jewish person who votes for Biden does not love Israel and, frankly, should be spoken to.'\nIn a statement, Karoline Leavitt, Trump's national press secretary, slammed Democrats for caving in 'to the demands of far-left Palestinian extremists.\"\nAsked about Trump's comments on the war, Markstein said he believed Trump 'was just giving voice to the frustration of … people [who] want this to be concluded, with Israel defeating Hamas and rescuing the hostages.' On Trump's remarks about Jewish voters, Markstein said Trump 'was just trying to say in a Trumpian way … why haven't they been more vocal in their opposition to what their own leaders of their party are doing?'\nBack in Pittsburgh, Kipp Dawson, a Jewish civil rights activist backing Lee, said she would be horrified by Trump's re-election and expressed hope that Lee would be able to bring skeptical Democrats back on board with Biden this fall.\n'My sense is that things are extraordinarily in flux in this country right now,' she said. 'The big issue for November is who's going to come out to vote.'\nAt Pinsker's, the Cohens declined to say whom they'd support in next week's primary or the general election, though they said a number of Jews in Squirrel Hill were eager to back Patel.\n'The Jewish community really feels that if they don't take the stand now, [U.S. support for Israel] is not going to be assured,' Baila Cohen said. 'Everyone's very interested in getting actively involved and being part of the political scene in a way that doesn't always play out.'\nAllan Smith Emma Barnett",

JOE BIDEN:\nUnder my predecessor, who's busy right now.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nBut enthusiasm for the 2024 election is still the lowest in decades. Steve Kornacki will break down the latest numbers. And, history lessons. Presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin joins me for a Meet the Moment conversation reflecting on the resilience of America even in turbulent times.\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nI always feel so – so positive about what history can teach us, because we've lived through really hard times before.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nJoining me for insight and analysis are NBC News Chief Washington Correspondent Andrea Mitchell, democratic pollster Cornell Belcher and Republican strategist Matt Gorman. Welcome to Sunday, it's Meet the Press.\nANNOUNCER:\nFrom NBC News in Washington, the longest-running show in television history. This is Meet the Press with Kristen Welker.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nGood Sunday morning. We begin with our brand new NBC News poll and the headline President Biden is closing the gap with former President Trump. Trump leads Biden by two points in a head-to-head matchup, 46 to 44%. Biden has narrowed that deficit against Trump from 5 points in January. And when third party candidates, including Robert F. Kennedy, are included, Biden leads by two points, 39 to 37%. The president's job approval has also ticked up to 42%, up five points from January. The last time we've seen a five-point increase for an incumbent president in their re-election year was Bill Clinton in 1996. There are still troubling numbers in the poll for Biden. He trails Trump by 22 points on dealing with inflation and the cost of living. All of it comes amid a major foreign policy development. Six months after the president delivered an Oval Office speech pleading for wartime aid for Ukraine, $61 billion dollars in new funding finally passed on Saturday 311 to 112.\n[START TAPE]\nREP. MARC MOLINARO:\nThe bill is passed.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nA moment of bipartisanship in a Congress primarily defined by its dysfunction. 101 Republicans and 210 Democrats voted in favor. But more Republicans, 112, opposed it. Congress also passed new aid for Israel and Taiwan, along with a measure to force TikTok parent company ByteDance to sell the app. New aid for Ukraine came only after Republican Speaker Mike Johnson, who once opposed it, did an about-face and put his job on the line to get it through, amid threats from three far right Republicans to oust him.\n[START TAPE]\nSPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON:\nIf we turn our backs right now, the consequences could be devastating.\nREPORTER:\nYou're being asked to resign, will you?\nSPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON:\nNo, listen, I – I – as I've said many times I don't walk around this building being worried about a motion to vacate. I have to do my job. We – we did. I've done here what I believe to be the right thing and that is to allow the house to work its will and as I've said you do the right thing and you let the chips fall where they may.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThe Pentagon has said it has a massive infusion of military aid for Ukraine ready to go. It comes as Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said that without this support, we will have no chance of winning. Ukraine's top military commander issued a bleak assessment of the army's positions on the eastern front, saying they have worsened significantly in recent days. And the top American military commander in Europe told members of Congress that Russia will soon be able to fire ten shells for every Ukrainian shell.\n[START TAPE]\nGEN. CHRISTOPHER CAVOLI:\nIf one side can shoot and the other side can't shoot back, the side that can't shoot back loses.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nJoining me now is the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. President Zelenskyy, welcome back to Meet the Press.\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nGood morning, and greetings to you.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, President Zelenskyy, it is an historic morning. I want to get your reaction to this major news, the House approving $61 billion in aid to Ukraine. It's expected to pass through the Senate. But you have been asking for this aid for six months. In that time, you have run out of ammunition. You've suffered setbacks on the battlefield. Will you get this aid in time to make a difference?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nYeah, it's been so important. And we'd like to say thanks to the Congress for the bipartisan support. And we'd like to say thanks to Speaker Johnson and President Biden. Indeed, it is so important, the support from the United States of America. Of course, we need the support of the American people because, of course, the political decisions depend on the public opinion. And this aid will strengthen Ukraine, and send the Kremlin a powerful signal that it will not be the second Afghanistan. The United States will stay with Ukraine, will protect the Ukrainians, and they will protect – they will protect democracy in the world. This is the show of leadership and strength of the United States. And I think, indeed, now we've reached this important moment. For half a year we've been waiting and I would like to say thanks to all the team on my side and on the U.S. side, the team who did everything so that we would get this positive vote. And today, we definitely need this aid. And Kristen, we really need to get this to the final point. We need to get it approved by the Senate. And then we want to get things as fast as possible so that we get some tangible assistance for the soldiers on the front line as soon as possible, not in another six months, so that they will be able to move ahead.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou know, you said this week, President Zelenskyy, that Ukraine would have 'no chance of winning' without more U.S. support. And I guess the question is can Ukraine now win this war? Or is the United States merely giving you enough aid to prolong this war?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nThank you. I think this support will really strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine. And we will have a chance for victory if Ukraine really gets the weapon system which we need so much. We - thousands of soldiers need so much, and this aid should not be just spread into layers all over, but it has to end up in tangible weapon systems. Some really crucial weapon systems which are hard to get. The long-range artillery and I really appreciate that it mentions ATACMs, long-range weapons. And it's important because we need long-range weapons to not lose people on the front line. Because we have – we have casualties because we cannot reach that far. Our weapons are not that long-range. So we need it, and air defense. This is crucial. These are the priorities now.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, as you know, this aid was held up for half a year because there is fierce opposition to sending war aid to Ukraine, particularly amongst some Republicans. How long should Americans be expected to fund the war in Ukraine?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nThe Americans are not funding the war in Ukraine. They foremost protect freedom and democracy all over Europe. And Ukraine is fighting, and Ukraine is sending its best sons and daughters to the front line and this reduces the price for all Europe, for all NATO. It reduces the price for everyone, including the U.S. as the leaders in NATO. U.S. army now does not have to fight protecting NATO countries. Ukrainians are doing that. And it's only the ammo that the civilized world is providing. And I think it's a good decision. That is why we do need to keep supporting. While Ukraine stands, there's no direct war between U.S. or NATO and Russian aggression. So Ukraine is still fighting, and Ukraine is protecting all the others.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nBut President Zelenskyy, can you give Americans a sense of the timeline? Will you still need as much aid this time next year? Or do you think you can turn the corner on Russia? What's the timeline?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nWell, it depends on when we actually get weapons on the ground, as you said it Kristen. If we get it in half a year. Well, we've had the process to hold for half a year. And we had losses in several directions. The losses in men, in equipment. In the east it was very difficult. And we did lose the initiative there. Now we have all the chance to stabilize the situation and to overtake the initiative. And that's why we need to actually have the weapon systems. When we get it, when we have it in our arms, then we do have the chance to take this initiative and to move ahead to protect Ukraine. But giving U.S. specific timeline of the war, well, it depends on how soon we get this aid. There are so many variables, so many factors. And sometimes when we protect the important line, you retreat because you don't have enough forces and equipment. And then retaking the climb would take two or three times more. And I'm not saying that this is how it's going to end up. But things are possible, and I can give you an example with F-16. It's a great example. The decision to supply F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, we've had it a year ago. One year ago, we got the positive response. Ukraine should receive these fighter jets, so that not only air defense could protect the sky, but we also have more than jets. A year has passed. We still don't have the jets in Ukraine. So it's very difficult to do any forecast. I would like us to be open and very, very specific. From the moment we get our hands on these weapon systems, well, from that moment, we can talk about the timeline.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, Ukrainian intelligence suggests that the Kremlin is preparing for a major offensive in the coming months. You have said by your own account that they are prepared to outgun you ten to one in fire power by some estimations. Will you be ready for that offensive?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nWe are preparing. The personnel is preparing. The soldiers are engaged in training. And I don't want to repeat myself, but we are waiting for the weapon systems because we want to have the brigades fully equipped. Some of them are exhausted. We need to replace them. But these new brigades, they have to have the equipment. Russia wants to mobilize 300,000 people by June 1st. We are getting ready for this. By May 9th, Russia expects that in the east of Ukraine they will take Chasiv Yar city. I visited the region recently. I talked to the soldiers. The soldiers say that they lack equipment. They need to fight Russian reconnaissance drones, which essentially guide the artillery and we need artillery shells. I hope we will be able to stay, and the weapons will come on time, and we will repel the enemy and then we'll break the plans of the Russian Federation with regards to this full-scale offensive.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nI want to ask you, President Zelenskyy, about reports of a lack of morale. Some 650,000 men who are eligible to fight, we are told, have fled Ukraine. You have lowered the draft eligible age, but you've resisted a full call-up of all Ukrainian men. What do you say to young men who don't want to fight, who don't want to risk their lives in this war for their country?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nThis war is the war for the sake of all of us. This is our land. We don't have another place to go. And the citizens of Ukraine understand that. Of course, there are people who don't want to, are not ready. But we do have this mobilization campaign. We do have the draft. We do have a strong army. And we can be frank. In Russia, of course they have more people and people are forced there. So, for example, if someone in Russia is deserting the battlefield, they just shoot them on sight. We cannot do that because we have the democratic values, believe in the democratic country. So, to be frank, in Ukraine we have a lot of people who are ready to protect the motherland. But of course the motivation, the morale can go down, especially when they go to the front line and they see that, well, there are no shells. There is no equipment. That's why the aid from the states is so important. And people need to be trained by professional people and they need to have the equipment to be used so that they have this so people, not only on the training field, but also on the actual battlefield. And then, indeed, they can show the performance on the front line. This is very important.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy –\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\n– And then the morale will go high. And then they will indeed defend the motherland.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThe Washington Post is reporting that Donald Trump has said privately he could end Russia's war in Ukraine by pressuring Ukraine to give up some territory like Crimea, like the Donbas region. What is your reaction and realistically speaking do you see this war ending in a negotiation with Russia.\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nLet's just say that, well, I'm a president of a country at war. And rumors and different hearsay, I don't believe that. When Trump comes here and would tell me their formula of peace, then I would be able to provide the response. At the moment, I know that, well, things Putin wants to show, they cannot happen.And I'm sure that people who know him well, they know. But you can never trust Putin. It's impossible. So the strategy of ending the war should be based not on the words which Putin says or some other people from his entourage say, but on something very specific. Something – something very tangible in Ukraine that is independent and democratic. And I'm confident that everyone is interested in that. All the political leaders in the U.S., they are also interested to have Ukraine independent and sovereign and democratic. It's of interest for both the Republicans and the Democrats.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, back in February Donald Trump encouraged Putin to invade NATO countries that he doesn't believe are contributing enough to defense spending. What kind of a message do you think that sends to the world?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nWell, I don't know the details of that speech. I know for sure if Ukraine fails, then Putin – then Putin definitely will invade the Baltic countries. Why? Not because there's some interesting idea, strategy, but because Putin wants to return the influence of the Soviet Union. And he really wants to retake the force to war. He wants to retake all former Soviet republics and now independent states. Whether they are in the NATO or not, he doesn't care. That is why this is his strategy. Of course, after the Baltic states, also Poland and parts of Germany would also –\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, big picture. Germany's top military official has warned that Putin could be ready to attack NATO countries in as soon as five years, following up on what you're saying. How big of a threat do you see Putin to the West?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nI think he does want to go further. As I said, he wants to reinstate Soviet Union and the Soviet – the Soviet bloc. And they do that in terms of information, misinformation. They just drive different political groups and democracies. Not only Europe, in Latin America, in Africa, they have the influence everywhere. And they do this to split the world. So the risk is high. I think this German diplomat said that it's not even about the wish of Putin, but it's that if Putin is not stopped, then Putin is ready to attack NATO. Even look at the sheer size of the army and the weapons that they have. So we have to be ready to stop him now. Because the froze in conflicts, well, we've seen that in Georgia. We've seen that in other countries. So if we give the big pause to Putin, if we freeze the war right where we are, this will enable him because all his industry will start working not for the war in Ukraine, but will start working for the war against NATO.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, you are not just a president. You are also a father. You have survived multiple assassination attempts. Tens of thousands of your fellow citizens have been killed and injured. Millions have left their homes. Have you ever lost hope?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nYou can never lose hope. You can never lose hope. You can never lose freedom. You can never lose independence. Otherwise, you just lose everything. You lose your state. You lose your security for your children, for – all the children in Ukraine are my children. I will then lose everything. And I have to show the example. If I lose hope, well, my children would lose their future independent country. And then we would lose Ukraine as – as the nation. It's not only about the territory. It's about ourselves, our identity. So we cannot lose hope. We've had different moments, some very cruel. There were moments of challenge. And I'm sure in the history of the United States they also had many moments when the people of the U.S. had to fight for their independence. We remember the period of struggling, when many people lost hope. Or some people emigrated to France. But some people raised the banner, the United States, the banner of independence. And some people were skeptical on both sides of the ocean, in Europe too. But people didn't give up. And I think, well, you got the independent country. And the world got this great democracy. So we cannot lose hope either.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, thank you for being here on this monumental morning. We really appreciate your perspective and having a chance to talk to you. When we come back, Steve Kornacki is here with the results of our latest NBC News poll.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. For more on the NBC News poll, I'm joined by National Political Correspondent Steve Kornacki to break down the numbers. A lot of headlines here, Steve.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nAbsolutely, Kristen. I think the biggest headline, this. Let's give you the bottom line. Donald Trump does lead Joe Biden 46% to 44% in our poll. But this is a tightening from our last poll. You could see three months ago Donald Trump had a five-point lead against the current president. That five-point lead, now down to two points, so there is progress here for Biden in the last three months.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nComing after the State of the Union, and he's had a campaign blitz.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nYeah, and the Democratic primaries, such as they were, coming to an end. Perhaps there's Democrats rallying around Biden, too. Also, I think not coincidentally, this slight improvement here for Biden tracks with a slight improvement in his job approval rating. It now sits at 42%. Again, go back to our last poll, look at this. He was in all-time-low-for-him territory last time around. Now up back over 40%, the highest Biden's job approval has been in our poll since last spring. So, again, these are encouraging signs for Joe Biden; although, broader picture here, this 42% approval rating, history says probably by itself not enough. He's probably going to need more because put this in some context here: these are other recent presidents. At this point in their reelection campaigns, where were their approval ratings? Again, you see Biden's 42%. One thing that jumps out: they were all higher than Joe Biden. The other thing, the two presidents on this list who did not win reelection of course: Donald Trump four years ago, he was at 46%; and back in 1992 George H.W. Bush, he was at 43%. Biden below both of those. The last time Biden's been at this level, 46%, you've got to back to the start of 2023. The last time he was higher than that, you've got to go back to the summer of 2021, his first year as president. So Biden has some work to do on that front. And also troubling for the Biden campaign, the erosion of public confidence on a number of critical fronts. We asked voters in this poll about a number of leadership characteristics here. \"Which candidate would be better?\" There are two, only two, where Biden has the edge over Trump. Abortion, we've talked about this one, seen this for a long time here.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThat's a big one.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nIt is. Certainly, that's the biggest Biden advantage in this poll. And then bringing the country together, Biden you see performing better than Trump. But I think the headline here is you add those two numbers together, you're not even close to 100. That means a lot of voters think neither candidate is better on that. And then on every other front here, we talk about the erosion for Biden and now, you start to see it. Look at these numbers. Trump advantages on all of these traits.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd I stop here because competent and effective, that was President Biden's, the crux of his campaign pitch back in 2020.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nAnd we actually polled this question in 2020, and it was basically the exact opposite. It was Biden with about a ten-point advantage over Trump and, again, same with handling of crisis. Biden had the edge over Trump. And how about this? It's the former president, the current president. We don't really see matchups like this. Well, now we can measure it. Who has the strongest record as president? And, again, Trump outpacing Biden on that front. And, again, you've got to mention this one, too. \"Necessary mental and physical health.\" We asked this four years ago, it was a wash. It's now a clear liability for Joe Biden. So these are all troubling numbers for Biden, but it's not to say there aren't warning signs for Donald Trump in this poll either.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, Trump and his campaign are hoping a third-party candidate might give them a little bit of a boost, but our poll shows it's a little bit murkier than that.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nThat's the thing, because, again, we show a 46-44 race here for Donald Trump. Again, all those liabilities for Biden, Trump only ahead two. What the Trump folks have been hoping is RFK, third-party candidates, they gobble up some votes and Trump doesn't need to get to 50%. But look what happens when we add RFK's name to the mix. Suddenly, we have a new leader. Joe Biden, 39%; Donald Trump, 37%. There's Kennedy getting 13%. In other words, we're seeing by a better than 2:1 margin, it's Trump voters who are flipping over to Kennedy in this scenario, not Biden voters. You see it right here. 15% of Trump voters, when we add RFK's name to the mix, they go to RFK. Only 7% of Biden voters. There's a big change right there.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nDefies conventional wisdom. There's no doubt about that.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nAbsolutely. I think we haven't seen this in other polls. And one final note, Kristen, as well, is the question of enthusiasm. And I thought this really jumped out here. The most engaged voters, those who voted in 2020, voted in the midterm elections, those folks are voting for Biden by nine points. Where Trump's strength is, why he leads Biden, it's voters who don't typically turn out in many elections. Didn't vote in '20, didn't vote in '22, they are with Trump by more than 20 points. And the warning sign for Trump in relying on this kind of voter is this: we are seeing the lowest level of –\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWow.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\n– interest since we started asking this question back in 2008. \"Are you very interested in the election?\" Sixty-four percent, that's lower than any other time at this point where we have polled this before. So, again, lower interest. Maybe those voters who in the polls are saying they're for Trump, are we sure they're going to actually vote in November? The Trump campaign better hope so.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWe'll have to see if that ticks up if we get closer to Election Day. Steve Kornacki, thank you so much for being here.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nYou got it.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWe really appreciate it. When we come back, the jury will hear opening statements in Donald Trump's first criminal trial. What impact will it have on voters? The panel is next.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. The panel is here: NBC News chief Washington correspondent Andrea Mitchell; Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher; and Matt Gorman, former senior communications advisor for Tim Scott for America. Andrea, I have to start with you. There's a lot to unpack. Let's start with President Zelenskyy. What were your key takeaways from our conversation?\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nThat he's really worried about the surge – the Russian surge in what we expect to be May, June, July. This six months was critical. They had a really good chance of winning, before the six months of no aid from the U.S., the weapons that only the U.S. can provide. And after six months, they can lose. They can lose, if the weapons don't get there soon enough. So now it's supply chain. He pointed out that the F-16s are still not there, and they were approved a year ago. And talking to Ukrainian officials, and you heard him today, they need the long-range weapons. They still don't have the ATACMS, those long-range missiles. They're supposedly in the package, the administration is deciding. Ukrainian officials say they've got to get them because the Russian launches, the artillery launches, not only do they have the ammo – they don't have the ammo, they don't have the manpower, Ukraine doesn't have any more – but Russia has that huge advantage, 10:1 in artillery, but they can't take that artillery out, because they don't have the long-range missiles. U.S. has been really worried about not letting them fire into Russian territory. The Ukrainians tell me they really want to, but they do have that restriction. They have restrictions that, frankly, are not placed on Israel. And they're watching Israel getting, you know -- despite all the controversy over Gaza, Israel has the support that Ukraine doesn't have. And I also think that it was really interesting that he ducked the two questions you asked about Donald Trump. He knows this is a close election. And the bottom line is he knows that Donald Trump has said that Ukraine can be forced at the negotiating table to give territory up to Russia. By next November, if Donald Trump is elected, I think it's all possible that Ukraine can still lose this war, despite their great spirit.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, I'm so glad that you bring up two points: One, that he did choose his words very carefully on Donald Trump; and the factor of Israel, the fact that Ukraine is so concerned, Matt Gorman, that the world has forgotten about them as attention has turned to the Middle East, to what's happening in Gaza. And of course, House Speaker Mike Johnson really at the center of the battles for more aid for Ukraine and Israel. Both were approved yesterday, but there's so much opposition within his own party, three conservative Republicans threatening to oust him over this. But it seemed like the temperature was turned down a little bit, yesterday. What is your assessment? How in jeopardy is his job?\nMATT GORMAN:\nIn the short term, not as much as I think people think. The real threat to Mike Johnson isn't now; it's November, it's post-election. Republicans are going to choose their leaders for the next Congress. They'll already have to choose a Senate leader. I think, until then, Democrats and Republicans will cobble together a majority on a motion to vacate, if it comes up. And I think Republicans want to hold on until then. Let's face it: also, too, no one really wants to be speaker right now, other than Mike Johnson. I thought it was notable that Steve Scalise and Tom Emmer voted with Johnson; notable who didn't, Elise Stefanik. If a successful move is going to be made, it's not until November.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYeah. Only member of the Republican leadership who did not vote for it. Cornell, let's talk about this poll: President Biden narrowing the gap with former President Trump, not a big surprise. But what stood out to you in the crosstabs?\nCORNELL BELCHER:\nWhat stands out to me is – well, first of all, great interview, by the way, groundbreaking interview. Spot on. What stood out to me is – surprise, surprise – polls are closing. And polls continue to shrink and get tighter and tighter because that's what happens in this country. And if you go back to our polling, go back to our polling back in October of last year, Donald Trump was at 46%. What is he, throughout all our NBC polling? He's at 46%. What is he at right now? At 46%. Donald Trump, what did he get in the last election? He got 46%. His support stays solid. Where I'm worried about or where I see you can see growth here is, I think Donald Trump is at his ceiling, and Biden is close to his floor. Where he's off most? He's off most among young voters. He is – and the other part about this is the enthusiasm, which I think is really the headline, is that if these young voters aren't enthusiastic and they don't show up and break for Biden big, that's how Trump wins.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAndrea, pick up on that point, because this is all going on against the backdrop of Donald Trump in court for his first criminal trial this week.\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nYet, the fact is we don't know how that is going to play. Up until now, these legal cases have only helped him fundraising, made him, you know, tell people he's a victim, energized his base. And so he's risen in the polls with every indictment. Now, we're going to see him really powerless. The judge has been very effective. And how they handle the gag order is yet to be seen, while Joe Biden is campaigning. The problem for Joe Biden and the Democrats is it's is crowding out – the trial is crowding out the trial, is crowding out everything else. So Joe Biden goes out and does major policy things, the steel tariffs in Pennsylvania, everything else that he's doing. Student loans is breaking through, a lit bit. But everything else is crowded out. And it's the Trump story. And that's what happened in 2016 to Hillary Clinton. And that could be replicated this year. I think it's really – I think the enthusiasm issue and the young voter issue is critical. And as long as this war in Gaza goes on, this is going to be a problem with young voters because they have off ramp. That off ramp is RKF Jr. And I know your poll shows that RKF Jr. would hurt Trump more than Biden, hypothetically, and it's very early in polling, you know, to say who, but I know the White House is more afraid of –\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nIs jittery, yeah.\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nThe family certainly is because it was very hard for those siblings to come out and do that. They only did it because they think he really hurts them, Joe Biden, more than Donald Trump.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nMatt Gorman, what about all of that?\nMATT GORMAN:\nYeah. Look, I was encouraged because when I was going into the trial, I was nervous that all the talk was going to be simply coming from Trump, his message was going to be about himself and the trial. I was surprised, going in the bodega, I thought it was smart, it leaned into issues like immigration, the migrant crisis, and crime that are winning issues, as we saw in the poll, for Republicans and Trump. He needs to continue to do that, get a message that's not just about himself, while he's sitting in the courtroom.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nHow does the courtroom optics play, Cornell?\nCORNELL BELCHER:\nAndrea, you're spot on about him – about him dominating the news, but it's negative news, right? This is different –\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nThat's a very good point.\nCORNELL BELCHER:\nAnd he doesn't look strong. He looks - he looks weak there. And so, to a certain extent, I don't –I don't mind if he's in court every day, dominating the news, because it's negative news.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nOkay. All right. Great conversation. We covered a lot of ground, but thank you.\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nCongratulations on a great interview.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThank you, Andrea. Thank you, all. When we come back, as the athletes prepare for the Summer Olympics in Paris, we look back on the U.S. decision to boycott the games after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Our Meet the Press Minute is next.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. We have officially crossed the 100-day mark to the 2024 Olympics, as Paris prepares to host the competition, this summer. But the Olympics are not just about sports; they've also made history. The United States led an international boycott of the 1980 games in Moscow to protest the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. President Jimmy Carter announced his historic decision right here on Meet the Press.\n[START TAPE]\nPRES. JIMMY CARTER:\nNeither I know the American people would support the sending of an American team to Moscow with Soviet invasion troops in Afghanistan. I'll send a message today to the United States Olympic Committee, spelling out my own position, that unless the Soviets withdraw their troops, within a month, from Afghanistan, that the Olympic games be moved from Moscow to an alternate site or multiple sites, or postponed, or canceled. If the Soviets do not withdraw their troops immediately from Afghanistan within a month, I will not support the sending of an American team to the Olympics.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd you can watch the Paris Olympics this summer on NBC and streaming on Peacock. When we come back, presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin joins me for our Meet the Moment conversation with lessons from the past, as America's democracy is being tested once again.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. As she likes to say, Doris Kearns Goodwin has spent most of her career writing about dead presidents, immersing herself in their papers, diaries and letters in an attempt to being them back to life. In a new book, \"An Unfinished Love Story,\" the presidential historian turns that same attention to her marriage. Before his death, she opened more than 300 boxes of documents and memorabilia with her husband Richard Goodwin, who served as a speechwriter for President John F. Kennedy: a time capsule of their life in the 1960's. In her twenties, Doris was chosen to be a White House fellow for President Lyndon Johnson, one of only three women out of the 16 fellows selected, and developed a loyalty and closeness to President Johnson which has lasted her entire life. I sat down with Doris for a Meet the Moment conversation on her new book and the resilience of America, even in turbulent times.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou have typically written presidential biographies. This is a biography to some extent of your husband, and it is also a love story. What was the process like of writing this book as compared to all of your other incredible works?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nWell, I was so used to writing about presidents who had archives, and I would want to talk to them. I knew them so well, because it took me so long to write those books, longer to write the book about World War II than the war to be fought, longer to write about the Civil War than twice the Civil War. And I would always ask them questions, and they never answered me. So this time, I had this guy, my guy, right across the hall from me in the same study, and I was able to talk to him. And he could answer my questions. And he had an archive – a mini archive of what presidents have – memos, diaries, letters. He just had saved everything in 300 boxes and finally decided when he turned 80 to open them. And what it really opened was a door to the 1960s, a decade that I'd lived in but I was able to learn through him starting at the beginning with John Kennedy, ending with Bobby Kennedy's death and the Democratic Convention.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou talk about the fact that after your husband passed, it was a struggle for you to finish this project that was a labor of love. You write, \"I found myself edging toward a commitment to finish the project influenced by headlines announcing divisions between Black and white, old and young, rich and poor, divisions that made it increasingly evident that the momentous issues emanating from the '60s remain the unresolved stuff of our everyday lives.\"\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nYeah, I think that's what really decided me. I knew if I were going to work on it, it was going to take years. My books take so long, so it was a huge commitment, and I was going to be writing as an historian, not simply as somebody writing about my husband. And so, once I realized that the '60s really had a message to the people today, and I believe that's so. Because we look at the '60s in a sad way because it ended with the riots, it ended with anti-war violence, it ended with Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy being killed. But when you start at the beginning, it was a decade in which young people in particular were powered by the conviction they could make a difference. And they joined the Peace Corps. The people who were in the Freedom Rides and the sit-ins, in the marches against segregation, marches for the vote. The beginning of the women's movement is there, the gay rights movement. It's a time when the air is filled with that belief that if you work together, you can change the government.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, when you look across the political spectrum, do you see leaders right now who are meeting this moment where so many people wonder if our democracy will stay intact?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nI mean, I don't know that we're fighting it the same way we need to be. This is one of the most perilous moments, and there are people obviously in local areas. There are people in states. There are some people in Washington. But the overall sense is, sometimes we've become too much of spectators watching what's happening to ourselves. And – and one of the things Dante said is that \"The lowest place in Hell are for those people in a moral crisis who remain neutral or remain silent.\" We are in a moral crisis right now, and that's what history – I always feel so – so positive about what history can teach us, because we've lived through really hard times before. And these are hard times, however, and it won't get better unless we act, unless we take seriously our citizen responsibilities and use the qualities of character that we need to bring into politics.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nHow afraid, how concerned are you that January 6th could happen again?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nWell, because we're not remembering it correctly. That – that – what history – I was so certain as an historian, and I was on television saying, \"This is going to change public sentiment.\" Just as certain things happened in the '50s that made people understand in the '60s that slavery had to be ended, public sentiment finally got changed. I thought it had, but everything is so breaking news today, and one thing tops on another. I thought the summer after January 6th when the hearings took place, that would change public sentiment. But I still think in the end that the majority of the people understood what happened in that election. I think the majority of people are for the basic values that we're talking about right now for democracy. And it's just a matter of them speaking out and recognizing that it is in danger, and it's up to us. It's not up to somebody else, it's up to us to save it.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd the Republican nominee has yet to accept the results of the last election. Within the context of this conversation and your concerns about the nation's democracy, how much of a threat do you think the democracy is facing right now, and do you think the country can survive this threat?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nWell, I think the real threat is when the Republican – former President says that \"if he doesn't win, he won't accept the results of this next election,\" which means that we may have a recurring battle for who's really – who's really elected each time we do this. And that's a real problem. I mean, all the candidates, when you look at the ones who lost, it's really hard to lose, and every single one was able to say, as – as Carter did, \"I promised I'd never tell you a lie. This hurts, it really hurts.\" Or Al Gore working on that concession speech that my husband was honored enough to help him on, where he talked about the fact, \"The law of the land has said that this election is lost. I don't agree with it, but I must do it.\" And Hillary Clinton say, \"We not only believe in the transition of power, we cherish it.\" I looked at all those, and it just makes you so proud of each one of those candidates who had been through an election. They'd lost it, they'd let down their constituents, and they were able to make that transfer of power. And it's an essential part of our democracy that has to happen this next November.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAs we sit here today, how concerned are you that it may not happen?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nI am concerned that it may not happen, but I somehow think if the majority of the people come out who have different values from that and they vote, voting is absolutely essential. It's the premium value. As Lyndon Johnson said, \"It's the – it's the one thing that all the rest of our democracy depends on.\" And what is democracy? You throw a candidate out or you call him in. You either want him to come in, or you want to throw him out. We have to be able to do that. And I think, if the majority comes out to vote, and the majority never comes out in enough numbers to vote, not only young people. They've made a big difference in 2020, 2018, 2022, and they're saying now that they may not vote if they're not happy with either candidate. Again, if they only could know what we felt like in the '60s when we felt we were making a difference, you feel larger. You feel a sense of – of exhilaration, the word you used earlier. And I just hope they feel that this election could turn on them, and the uncommitted people and the undecided people have to come out and vote, and we have to just take the results of the election. That doesn't mean we know how it's going to happen, but if the overwhelming majority vote, then somehow maybe it won't be as close as we think it is going to be. And then we'll have a clear-cut choice.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nI hear so much optimism in your voice still.\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nYes, I think I was born that way, and I think it's the only way we can live. I mean, it sometimes may sound naïve. I remember thinking what I was feeling when I was at the Civil Rights march, that we're going to change America. Maybe we didn't change America completely, but we made huge changes at that time. And if you have optimism, at least you have the confidence that if you act, something will happen. And it may take a long time, as – as Martin Luther King talked about, \"the arc of the universe,\" all that stuff takes a long time, but it moves toward justice. And I do believe that.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThank you, Doris Kearns Goodwin for this incredible conversation.\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nThank you. I'm so glad to have been with you.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell that's all for today, thanks for watching. We'll be back next week, because if it's Sunday it's Meet the Press.",
