If output per hour holds steady, firms must either sacrifice profits or raise prices to pay for wage increases or investment projects.

Economies experiencing productivity booms can experience rapid wage gains and quick growth without as much risk of rapid inflation.\n",

Engineers believe a heater in the shoulder of its robotic arm has been turning on every night, even though it’s needed only when the arm is in use. Theisinger said the heater did not present an immediate concern but could become an issue later in the mission, when it could cut into the rover’s ability to fully recharge its batteries.\n",
