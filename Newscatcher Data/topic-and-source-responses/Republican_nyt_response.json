            "excerpt": "Liberal activists are proposing a ballot measure that would enshrine the right to an abortion in the state Constitution. Republicans in the State Legislature are considering plans to undermine it.",
            "summary": "Facing mounting pressure to strike down a near-total abortion ban revived last week by Arizona's Supreme Court, Republican state legislators are considering efforts to undermine a planned ballot measure this fall that would enshrine abortion rights in the Arizona Constitution, according to a presentation obtained by The New York Times.\nThe 1864 law that is set to take effect in the coming weeks bans nearly all abortions and mandates prison sentences of two to five years for providing abortion care. The proposed ballot measure on abortion rights, known as the Arizona Abortion Access Act, would enshrine the right to an abortion before viability, or about 24 weeks. Supporters of the measure say they have already gathered enough signatures to put the question on the ballot ahead of a July 3 filing deadline.\nRepublicans in the Legislature are under tremendous pressure to overturn, or at least amend, the 1864 ban. Former President Donald J. Trump, the national standard-bearer of the Republican Party, directly intervened on Friday, calling on Republican legislators, in a frantically worded post online, to 'act immediately' to change the law. A top Trump ally in Arizona who is running for the Senate, Kari Lake, has also called for the overturning of the 1864 law, which she had once praised.\nAbortion rights have been a winning message for Democrats since the Supreme Court, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump, overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. And even though it is an objectively unpopular aspect of his White House legacy, Mr. Trump has repeatedly bragged that he is personally responsible for overturning Roe.\nRepublicans in Arizona, however, have already resisted efforts to repeal the 160-year-old law and are bracing for the potential for another floor battle on the ban that is looming for the Legislature, which is set to convene on Wednesday. The plans that circulated among Republican legislators suggest the caucus is considering other measures that would turn attention away from the 1864 law.\nThe presentation to Republican state legislators, written by Linley Wilson, the general counsel for the Republican majority in the Arizona State Legislature, proposed several ways in which the Republican-controlled Legislature could undermine the ballot measure, known as A.A.A., by placing competing constitutional amendments on the ballot that would limit the right to abortion even if the proposed ballot measure succeeded.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "Here's how each member of the House voted on the foreign aid bills.",
            "summary": "Source: Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives\nThe House passed a long-stalled foreign aid package on Saturday that gives funding to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, with a majority of lawmakers backing money for American allies across the globe. The package, which now goes to the Senate, is almost certain to become law.\nThe Senate passed similar legislation in February. But in the face of distinct bases of opposition to different elements of the legislation, which threatened to tank the package as a whole, Speaker Mike Johnson advanced the foreign aid using a convoluted strategy: It split the package into three parts, each of which received its own vote, added a fourth bill with Republican priorities as a sweetener and melded it all together again once everything passed.\nThe plan, laid out in a rule that passed on Friday, was concocted to capitalize on the pools of support for each part of the $95.3 billion package, while preventing opposition to any one piece from taking down all of them.\nNote: Progressive Democrats are members of the House Progressive Caucus. Hard-right Republicans include members who were supported by the House Freedom Fund during the 2022 midterms, opposed Kevin McCarthy's election as speaker in January 2023, or voted to oust Mr. McCarthy from the speakership last October. The fund is the campaign arm of the House Freedom Caucus, a hard-right faction founded in 2015.\nA majority of Republicans voted against Ukraine aid on Saturday in a reflection of the stiff resistance within the G.O.P. to continuing to aid Ukraine against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia's invasion. The coalition that voted against the bill spanned right-wing members of the House Freedom Caucus to leadership, such as Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, the No. 3 House Republican. On Israel aid, on the other hand, most Republicans voted 'yes.'\nThirty-four right-wing Republicans also opposed aid to American allies in the Indo-Pacific, while Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, declined to take a yes-or-no position and voted 'present.' Representative Bob Good, Republican of Virginia and the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, was one of the 21 members of his party who voted against the Israel package. Echoing one of the many grievances shared by hard-right Republicans who opposed all of the aid measures, Mr. Good said his support for 'Israel's right to defend itself remains unshakeable' but that he disagreed with a measure that would add to the nation's debt.\nWhile all Democrats voted in favor of aid to Ukraine and all but Ms. Tlaib supported funding to Taiwan, 37 left-leaning Democrats defected to vote against the Israel aid bill. They said before the vote that they opposed unfettered aid to Israel that could be used in its offensive in Gaza. The opposition to the Israel aid bill represented a minority of Democrats, but reflected the deep resistance to unfettered aid and the divisions in the party on Gaza. Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, represented a notable new 'no' vote among Republicans, and other standouts included Representatives Donald S. Beyer Jr. of Virginia, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon and John Garamendi of California.\nStill, 37 'no' votes, while a break from Washington's ironclad support for the Jewish state, fell short of the opposition bloc progressives had hoped to muster. Thirty-nine Democrats had voted 'no' on Friday on the rule to allow the foreign aid package to come to the House floor, a target that progressives just missed on Saturday on the Israel bill. Fourteen of those Democrats voted on Saturday in favor of aid to Israel, while 12 Democrats who voted to allow the package on the floor on Friday then cast votes against the funding itself.\nTwenty-five Republicans voted against the fourth bill, which included measures that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the United States and that would redirect funds from seized Russian assets to help aid Ukraine. Democrats put up a big vote — 174 — in favor on this bill, which was intended to sweeten the overall package for conservatives.",

            "summary": "The House vote on Saturday to provide $61 billion in American aid to Ukraine was the clearest sign yet that at least on foreign policy, the Republican Party is not fully aligned with former President Donald J. Trump and his 'America First' movement.\nBut more Republicans voted against the aid than for it, showing just how much Mr. Trump's broad isolationism — and his movement's antipathy to Ukraine — has divided the G.O.P. in an election year.\nMr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the third time, had actually soft-pedaled his opposition to Ukraine aid in recent days as the dam began to break on the House Republican blockade. He stood by Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who assembled the complicated aid packages for Ukraine, Israel and America's Asian allies, and against threatened efforts to bring down Mr. Johnson's speakership and plunge the House back into chaos. And he stayed quiet on Saturday, declining to pressure Republicans to vote no.\nBut few issues have been more central to the former president's creed than his foreign policy isolationism, his call for Europe to raise military spending in its own backyard, and his foreign policy shift toward Vladimir V. Putin's Russia.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson after the House passed the foreign aid bills for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Credit... Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times Though he has in recent days stayed quiet, his most vociferous allies in the House, such as Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida, had led efforts to block the aid. Another pro-Trump firebrand, Representative Lauren Boebert of Colorado, jeered Democrats during the vote as they waived Ukrainian flags on the House floor.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Arizona lawmakers are preparing for a renewed attempt on Wednesday to repeal the state's 1864 abortion ban, which was upheld by the State Supreme Court last week in a ruling that exacerbated all the personal emotions and political firestorms surrounding abortion in a battleground state.\nThe court last Tuesday upheld the Civil War-era law, which bans nearly all abortions. The ruling infuriated supporters of abortion rights and presented a grave political threat to Republicans, who narrowly control both houses of the State Legislature.\nDemocrats' immediate attempts to repeal the ban failed last week. A Republican member of the House had sided with Democrats and put forward a measure to repeal it, but G.O.P. leadership adjourned, delaying any action for a week since the Legislature currently meets only on Wednesdays.\nAs a second attempt at repeal looms, both parties are scrambling to count votes and game out legislative strategies to determine whether Democrats have found enough Republican support to strike down the law.\nFormer President Donald J. Trump last week called on legislators to 'act immediately to remedy what has happened,' as Democrats slammed the ban as another sign of Republican extremism in a pivotal state in this fall's election. The ban allows only an exception to save the life of the mother. Doctors prosecuted under the law could face fines and prison terms of two to five years.\nDemocrats likely need only two or three Republicans to vote with them to repeal the law. Activists and lobbyists have jockeyed behind the scenes to sway — or hold — the handful of Republican lawmakers whose actions could determine the law's fate. A variety of procedural elements could also disrupt a repeal's chance of advancing. If the House is able to pass a repeal, it is expected to head to the Senate later on Wednesday.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday encountered stiff resistance from Republicans as he embarked on a complicated and politically perilous strategy to push legislation through the House to send aid to Israel and Ukraine — all while beating back a threat to his own job.\nMr. Johnson, who has agonized for months over whether and how to advance aid to Ukraine that many in his party bitterly oppose, has settled on a multipart plan that will require everything to go right for him this week to prevail.\nIt aims to bring together a complicated mix of bipartisan coalitions and allow different factions in the House to register their opposition to pieces of the aid package without sinking the entire thing. And it would ultimately mean cobbling together just enough support from Democrats and mainstream Republicans to pass the legislation amid resistance from hard-right Republicans to Ukraine funding and among left-wing Democrats to unfettered aid for Israel.\nMr. Johnson plans to advance a legislative package that roughly mirrors the $95 billion aid bill the Senate passed two months ago with aid to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and other American allies — but broken down into three separate pieces that would each be voted on individually. There would also be a fourth vote on a separate measure containing other policies popular among Republicans, including conditioning Ukraine aid as a loan.\nThe strategy has run into a flurry of opposition from members of his own party, including one Republican, Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who on Tuesday announced that he would join a threatened bid to remove Mr. Johnson from the top post.\nRepresentative Thomas Massie on Tuesday joined Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove Mr. Johnson as speaker.

Most big donors steered clear.\nBut in recent weeks, as Mr. Trump finished trouncing his primary opponents and Mr. Biden and the Democrats gathered fund-raising steam, these donors have opened their checkbooks to the former president.\nIn the last two weeks of March alone, one committee backing Mr. Trump raised nearly $18 million, nearly all from six-figure contributions.

            "summary": "When Congress convened in 2023, an empowered far-right Republican faction in the House threatened to upend Washington and President Biden's agenda.\nBut the intransigence of that bloc instead forced Republicans and Democrats into an ad hoc coalition government that is now on the verge of delivering long-delayed foreign military aid and a victory to the Democratic president.\nThe House approval on Saturday of money for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan over angry objections from the extreme right was the latest and perhaps most striking example of a bipartisan approach forged out of necessity. The coalition first sprang up last year to spare the government a catastrophic debt default, and has reassembled at key moments since then to keep federal agencies funded.\nUnable to deliver legislation on their own because of a razor-thin majority and the refusal of those on the right to give ground, House Republicans had no choice but to break with their fringe members and join with Democrats if they wanted to accomplish much of anything, including bolstering Ukraine in its war against Russia.\n'Look at what MAGA extremism has got you: nothing,' Representative James P. McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, told Republicans on the House floor as lawmakers took their first steps toward approving the aid package. 'Nothing. Not a damn thing. In fact, it has empowered Democrats. At every critical juncture in this Congress, it has been Democrats who have been the ones to stand up for our country and do the right thing for the American people.'\nThe moments of bipartisan coming-together are hardly a template for a new paradigm of governing in polarized times. The grudging G.O.P. collaboration with Democrats has only come about on truly existential, must-pass legislation — and typically only at the last minute after Republicans have exhausted all other options, making the coalition unlikely to hold on less critical bills and the social policy issues that sharply divide the two parties.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The move was a nod to ultraconservatives who have demanded that the speaker not advance aid to Ukraine without securing sweeping concessions from Democrats on immigration policy.\nThe legislative package Mr. Johnson is trying to advance roughly mirrors the $95 billion aid bill the Senate passed two months ago with aid to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and other American allies, but he has proposed breaking that package into three pieces that would be voted on individually. There would be a fourth vote on a separate measure containing other policies popular among Republicans, including conditioning Ukraine aid as a loan and a measure that could lead to a nationwide TikTok ban.\nMr. Johnson said the text of the legislative package would be released later Wednesday.\nThe multipart plan has been painstakingly structured to cobble together just enough support from Democrats and mainstream Republicans to pass over the opposition of the hard right to funding for Ukraine funding and left-wing Democrats who do not support unfettered aid for Israel. If all four pieces passed the House, they would then be folded into a single bill for the Senate to take up, in an effort to ensure that senators could not cherry-pick pieces to approve or reject.\nIts success will require everything to go right for Mr. Johnson this week to prevail.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "The departure of two Democratic representatives who won suburban mayoral posts last fall evenly split the Michigan House.",
            "summary": "Michigan Democrats started 2023 with full control of state government for the first time since the 1980s. They ended the year in a political bind after two House members left to become mayors of suburbs, leaving that chamber with an even partisan split and making it impossible for Democrats to pass bills without Republican support.\nOn Tuesday, five months after their House majority evaporated, Democrats won two special elections to reclaim those seats and full control at the Michigan Capitol. The Associated Press said the Democrats Mai Xiong, a Macomb County commissioner, and Peter Herzberg, a Westland City Council member, defeated their Republican opponents.\nThe results of the special elections had never been in great doubt. Both districts, situated in the Detroit area, are liberal strongholds that Democratic candidates had carried by large margins in 2022. But the details of scheduling and running special elections meant a long, slow winter for Democratic lawmakers in Lansing while the House was evenly divided between the two parties. Michigan's governor, Gretchen Whitmer, is a Democrat, and her party has a majority in the State Senate.\nRepublicans hope the Democrats' renewed House majority is short-lived. Michigan, long a swing state, is expected to be a pivotal presidential battleground again this year. President Biden is working to rebuild a coalition that helped him win the state in 2020, but early polling has been favorable to former President Donald J. Trump. Republicans see an opening to deliver Michigan for Mr. Trump in November and to win control of the Michigan House, a goal that could be helped by newly redrawn legislative maps in the Detroit area. All 110 Michigan House seats are up for election in November, including the two seats that were contested on Tuesday.\nBefore losing their House majority last year, Michigan Democrats raced through a list of longstanding policy goals that had been stymied during decades of divided government or Republican control of the state. In the span of several months in 2023, Ms. Whitmer and legislative Democrats enacted new gun laws, codified civil rights for L.G.B.T.Q. people, solidified abortion rights and undid Republican laws that they said weakened labor unions.\nThose efforts slowed in November after one House member, Kevin Coleman, was elected mayor of Westland and another, Lori M. Stone, was elected mayor of Warren. Under Michigan law, Mr. Coleman and Ms. Stone had to resign from the Legislature when they became mayor.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Nevada's once-sleepy Republican primary for Senate, which has been dominated by Sam Brown, a U.S. Army veteran, was jolted to life in the past week, when a deep-pocketed rival took aim at the front-runner.\nJeff Gunter, the ambassador to Iceland under former President Donald J. Trump, is unloading a $3.3 million advertising campaign with a MAGA message, according to his campaign, hoping to cut into Mr. Brown's dominant lead over the crowded field.\nA television ad from Mr. Gunter that began airing on Wednesday called Mr. Brown 'the newest creature to emerge from the swamp,' tying him to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, and deriding his primary opponent as 'Scam Brown.'\nMr. Brown, a veteran who was wounded severely in Afghanistan in 2008, consolidated party support after entering the primary last July, earned the endorsement of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and has appeared at fund-raisers around the country with prominent Republicans. He has lapped his competitors in fund-raising, pulling in $2.4 million in the most recent quarter, according to fund-raising reports.\nMr. Brown has sought to employ the Trump campaign handbook, skipping debates and focusing his attention on Senator Jacky Rosen, the Democratic incumbent, rather than on his Republican rivals.\nThat changed on Thursday, when Mr. Brown appeared to address Mr. Gunter for the first time, at a private fund-raising event in Sparks, Nev., after Mr. Gunter accused him in ads and appearances of being disingenuous and not sufficiently pro-Trump.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "Pressed on his claims of 2020 election irregularities, the Republican candidate for Senate in Wisconsin has questioned the mental capacity of nursing home residents to vote.",
            "summary": "Eric Hovde, the Republican banking executive challenging Senator Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, may be developing a problem with older voters.\nThe bank he leads, Utah-based Sunwest, last month was named as a co-defendant in a California lawsuit that accuses a senior living facility partly owned by the bank of elder abuse, negligence and wrongful death.\nMr. Hovde's campaign called the suit meritless and said it was farcical to hold the chairman and chief executive of a bank responsible for the actions of a business that it seized in a foreclosure in 2021. Whatever its merits, the suit might have been largely irrelevant to Mr. Hovde's political campaign had he himself not boasted recently of having gained expertise in the nursing home industry as a lender to such residences.\nIn comments this month in which he suggested there had been irregularities in the 2020 election, Mr. Hovde drew on that experience to say that residents of nursing homes 'have a five-, six-month life expectancy' and that 'almost nobody in a nursing home is at a point to vote.' Those remarks were quickly condemned by Democrats in Wisconsin and by the former Milwaukee Bucks star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\nThe recent pileup of problems is an inauspicious start to a campaign that Republicans hope will help wrest control of the Senate from Democrats. Mr. Hovde is one of four affluent Republicans who are running to unseat Democratic incumbents, in Ohio, Montana, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\nEach of those states either leans heavily Republican in the upcoming presidential contest or is rated a tossup, and the loss of any one of those seats could cost Democrats control of the Senate. The deep pockets of candidates like Mr. Hovde will ease the G.O.P.'s heavy fund-raising burden as the party confronts Democrats' early financial advantage.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

In Michigan, a former co-chairwoman of the state party is facing charges.\nAs Donald J. Trump goes on trial in the New York criminal case, other investigations and prosecutions in five crucial swing states are continuing to scrutinize the steps that he and his allies took in trying to circumvent the will of voters after the 2020 election.\nThe investigations focus largely on the plan to deploy fake electors in states that Mr. Trump lost. Documents emerging from the state cases highlight divisions among Trump advisers after the 2020 election about whether to use hedging language in the phony certificates that they sent to Washington purporting to designate electoral votes for Mr. Trump. They also undercut claims by some Trump aides that they played little role in the fake-electors plan.\nGeorgia, Michigan and Nevada have already brought charges against a total of 25 fake electors, including current and former Republican Party leaders in those states. The Georgia case, led by Fani T. Willis, the district attorney of Fulton County, has gone further, bringing charges against Mr. Trump himself and a number of his advisers.\nMichael McDonald, the chairman of the Nevada Republican Party, is among those who have been indicted. Credit... Mark J. Terrill/Associated Press Investigations are also playing out in Wisconsin as well as in Arizona, where the state attorney general, Kris Mayes, is expected to bring charges soon. Grand jury subpoenas were recently issued to the people who acted as fake electors in Arizona, including Kelli Ward, a former state Republican chairwoman. Mike Roman, a former Trump campaign official who is already facing charges in Georgia, is also among those subpoenaed in the Arizona case.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The House took a critical step on Friday toward approving a long-stalled package of aid to Ukraine, Israel and other American allies, as Democrats supplied the crucial votes to push the legislation past Republican opposition so that it could be considered on the floor.\nThe 316-94 vote cleared the way for the House to bring up the aid package, teeing up separate votes on Saturday on each of its parts. But passage of those measures, each of which enjoys bipartisan support from different coalitions, was not in doubt, making Friday's action the key indicator that the legislation will have the backing needed to prevail.\nThe rule for considering the bill — historically a straight party-line vote — passed with more Democratic than Republican support, but it also won a majority of G.O.P. votes, making it clear that despite a pocket of deep resistance from the far right, there is broad bipartisan backing for the $95.3 billion package.\nThe vote was an enormous victory in the long effort to fund to Ukraine as it battles against Russian aggression, a major priority of President Biden that has met with bitter resistance from the right. It was a triumph against the forces of isolationism within the G.O.P. and a major moment of bipartisan consensus in a Congress that for the past year has been mostly defined by its dysfunction.\nBut it came only after Speaker Mike Johnson, who put his own job on the line to push through the plan over his party's objections, was forced to turn to Democrats in a significant breach of custom in the House, further imperiling his position even as he paved the way for the legislation to be voted on and approved.\nOn the House floor, Democrats held back their votes until it was clear there was not enough Republican support for the measure to pass without their backing, and then their 'yes' votes began pouring in. Ultimately, 165 Democrats voted for the measure, more than the 149 Republicans who supported it.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

She has led an investigation of a half-dozen institutions for their handling of antisemitism claims. She has subpoenaed internal documents, and called Jewish students to testify.\nOn Wednesday, she will preside over another hearing, this time with officials at Columbia University.\nThe drubbing is part of a campaign by Republicans against what they view as double standards within elite education establishments — practices that they say favor some groups over others, and equity over meritocracy. Others see it as partisan attack.\nRepresentative Foxx, 80, does not like the term 'elite,' and questions whether these schools even deserve the title.\n'I call them the most expensive universities in the country,' she said the other day, while traveling around her district, which winds through small working-class towns in the Blue Ridge Mountains.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "House Republicans took a critical step late Thursday night toward bringing up the long-stalled foreign aid bill for Ukraine and Israel, after being forced to rely on Democratic votes to move a plan to consider it out of a key committee and onto the floor.\nThe 9-to-3 vote in the critical Rules Committee was an early step in the convoluted process the House is expected to go through over the next couple of days to approve the $95 billion aid package. It reflected the extent of far-right anger over Speaker Mike Johnson's plan to push through the legislation over the opposition of ultraconservative Republicans, and underscored how heavily the speaker will have to rely on Democrats to push it across the finish line.\nIn a spasm of anger, three far-right Republicans on the panel, which controls what legislation comes to the House floor, refused to back the rule needed to bring up the foreign aid bill, putting it on track to die in committee. But Democrats on the panel stepped in to save it in an extraordinary breach of custom.\nAll Democrats voted to advance the plan out of committee.\nThe Rules Committee has traditionally been an organ of the speaker, and legislation is typically advanced to the floor in a straight party-line vote.\nDemocrats will all but certainly have to provide the votes on the House floor to approve the rule and allow the aid package to be brought up, lending their support in an yet another unorthodox vote in the face of Republican opposition.\nThe rule is critical to Mr. Johnson's plan for pushing the foreign aid package through the House, because it would allow separate votes on aid to Israel and aid to Ukraine, which are supported by different coalitions, but then would fold them together without requiring lawmakers ever to cast an up-or-down vote on the entire bill.\nThe group of far-right lawmakers who sought to block the measure in committee won their seats on the Rules panel as part of a concession made last year by the speaker at the time, Kevin McCarthy, who had to haggle with ultraconservatives who opposed electing him to the top post and agreed to back him only after he granted them critical leverage. They refused to support the measure to bring up the foreign aid package because it would not allow a vote on severe border security provisions they have said should be prioritized over aiding Ukraine.\nThat amounted to a remarkable act of rebellion, and left Democrats to bail out the speaker and push the measure through the panel.\nMr. Johnson earlier said he expected a House vote to pass the aid package on Saturday.\n'I'd rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,' he said in an interview on Newsmax on Thursday night. 'We don't want to have boots on the ground, and we can prevent that by allowing them to hold Putin at bay.'",

Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times The House voted on Saturday in favor of $95 billion in long-stalled foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, resoundingly approving the funds over months of objections from Republicans on the far right. The Senate is expected to pass the legislation as early as tomorrow, and it is almost certain to become law.\nAs part of the package, the House also advanced a bill that would force the Chinese company ByteDance, parent of TikTok, to either sell the app or risk a nationwide ban in the U.S.\nIn Ukraine, the vote was met with relief as troops are swiftly running out of weapons and munitions. The Pentagon has said it could resume sending weapons to Ukraine within days.\n'I really do believe the intel,' said Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, who marshaled bipartisan support to pass the bill. 'I think that Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed.'\nDetails: The legislation includes $60 billion for Kyiv; $26 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza; and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific region.\nDetails: The legislation includes $60 billion for Kyiv; $26 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza; and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific region.

            "summary": "On a Monday in mid-March, the Wisconsin Republican Party gathered about 50 conservative activists on a Zoom call to train them in how to become poll workers, helping oversee and monitor the casting and counting of votes.\nHeavily Democratic areas of the battleground state were a key focus. 'Eau Claire, Madison, Milwaukee — that type,' Mike Hoffman, the state party's election integrity director, said as he ticked off places being targeted.\n'We're keeping a close eye on you,' he recounted telling one city clerk, according to audio recordings of the party's training sessions obtained by The New York Times.\nThe Wisconsin training sessions are a small part of an expansive operation announced on Friday by former President Donald J. Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee, which plan to dispatch more than 100,000 volunteers and lawyers to monitor and potentially challenge the electoral process in each battleground state. They will focus on every aspect of voting, including mail ballots, voting machines and post-Election Day recounts and audits.\nThe sprawling effort is rooted in Mr. Trump's persistent false claims that Democrats cheated to win the 2020 election. His allies have helped turn that belief into Republican doctrine despite the overwhelming conclusion by Democratic and G.O.P. election officials, as well as federal and state judges, that no evidence of widespread fraud exists.\n'Democrat tricks from 2020 won't work this time,' Charlie Spies, the chief counsel of the R.N.C., pledged in a statement announcing the program. 'In 2024, we're going to beat the Democrats at their own game and the R.N.C. legal team will be working tirelessly to ensure that elections officials follow the rules in administering elections.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

That bill would require TikTok's Chinese owners to sell it within nine months, otherwise the app could be banned.\nAfter the House, the measures head to the Senate, which has already approved a similar package, and then to President Biden, who has vowed to sign them.

            "summary": "Shomari Figures, a Democrat who worked in the Justice Department, will face Caroleene Dobson, a lawyer and Republican political newcomer, this November for the seat in Alabama's Second Congressional District, according to The Associated Press.\nThe two candidates won primary runoff elections on Tuesday in the district, which was redrawn after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year that the state had illegally diluted the power of Black voters.\nNow that the district has more Black voters, who historically have largely supported Democrats, political analysts see the race for it as one of the most competitive in the South. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report ranks it as a likely Democratic seat. (The district's current representative, Barry Moore, is expected to remain in Congress after winning the Republican primary in the neighboring First Congressional District.)\nThe Second District now stretches across the state, encompassing much of Mobile; Montgomery, the Alabama capital; and several counties in the Black Belt, where rich soil once fueled plantations worked by enslaved people.\nIn the Republican primary, Ms. Dobson faced Dick Brewbaker, a former state senator. Mr. Brewbaker repeatedly pointed to his experience in the State Legislature, while Ms. Dobson argued that it was time for a newer political voice in Washington.\nIn the Democratic runoff, Mr. Figures's opponent was State Representative Anthony Daniels, the House Democratic leader.\nMr. Figures's family has a long political legacy in Alabama: He is the son of Michael Figures and Vivian Davis Figures, who have both served in the State Senate, with Ms. Davis Figures winning her husband's seat after his death in 1996. Shomari Figures moved back to Alabama after working in the Justice Department and the Obama administration.\nMr. Daniels does not live in the district — a point of contention in the race, though residency is not a requirement — but grew up there. He argued that his leadership position in the State House had shown that he could deliver for Alabama residents.\nThe November elections could result in Alabama sending two Black representatives to Washington for the first time in its history if Mr. Figures were to win and if Representative Terri Sewell, the Democrat in the Sixth Congressional District, wins re-election, as analysts widely expect.",

            "summary": "Speaker Mike Johnson's elaborate plan for pushing aid to Ukraine through the House over his own party's objections relies on an unusual strategy: He is counting on House Democrats and their leader, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, to provide the votes necessary to clear the way for it to come to the floor.\nIf Democrats were to provide those crucial votes, it would mark the second time in two years that Republican leaders have had to turn to the minority party to rescue them from their own recalcitrant right-wing colleagues in order to allow major legislation to be debated and voted on.\nGiven Republicans' tiny margin of control, Mr. Johnson will need their support on the aid itself. But before he even gets to that, he will need their votes on a procedural motion, known as a rule, to even bring the legislation to the floor — an unconventional expectation of the minority party.\nThat puts Democrats once again in a strange but strong position, wielding substantial influence over the measure, including which proposed changes, if any, are allowed to to be voted on and how the foreign aid is structured. After all, Mr. Johnson knows that if they are unsatisfied and choose to withhold their votes, the legislation risks imploding before it even comes up.\nThe dynamic also increases the likelihood that Mr. Johnson will need Democrats again — to save his precarious speakership, now under threat from two members of his party, Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky. They are enraged at his strategy for sending aid to Ukraine and every day appear to be edging closer to calling a vote to oust him from his post.\n'We're steering toward everything Chuck Schumer wants,' Mr. Massie said on Tuesday, referring to the Democratic Senate majority leader. (Without Democratic help, Mr. Johnson can afford to lose two Republicans, if all members are present and voting, meaning the legislation to send aid to Ukraine would be dead far before arrival.)\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The House voted resoundingly on Saturday to approve $95 billion in foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, as Speaker Mike Johnson put his job on the line to advance the long-stalled aid package by marshaling support from mainstream Republicans and Democrats.\nIn four back-to-back votes, overwhelming bipartisan coalitions of lawmakers approved fresh rounds of funding for the three U.S. allies, as well as another bill meant to sweeten the deal for conservatives that could result in a nationwide ban of TikTok.\nThe scene on the House floor reflected both the broad support in Congress for continuing to help the Ukrainian military beat back Russia, and the extraordinary political risk taken by Mr. Johnson to defy the anti-interventionist wing of his party who had sought to thwart the measure. Minutes before the vote on assistance for Kyiv, Democrats began to wave small Ukrainian flags on the House floor, as hard-right Republicans jeered.\nThe legislation includes $60 billion for Kyiv; $26 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza; and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific region. It would direct the president to seek repayment from the Ukrainian government of $10 billion in economic assistance, a concept supported by former President Donald J. Trump, who had pushed for any aid to Kyiv to be in the form of a loan. But it also would allow the president to forgive those loans starting in 2026.\nIt also contained a measure to help pave the way to selling off frozen Russian sovereign assets to help fund the Ukrainian war effort, and a new round of sanctions on Iran. The Senate is expected to pass the legislation as early as Tuesday and send it to President Biden's desk, capping its tortured journey through Congress.\n'Our adversaries are working together to undermine our Western values and demean our democracy,' Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said Saturday as the House debated the measure. 'We cannot be afraid at this moment. We have to do what's right. Evil is on the march. History is calling and now is the time to act.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Four months ago, the same congressional committee questioned the presidents of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and M.I.T. about similar allegations. After that hearing, the presidents of the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard stepped down, in part because of blowback over their responses.\nLawmakers will also have much more material to work with this time. Since the earlier hearing, Columbia's campus has been host to heated protests related to the war, and the school has become the target of criticism by both pro-Israel groups and supporters of Palestinians over how it has handled them. The committee, led by Representative Virginia Foxx, a Republican of North Carolina, has also received roughly 4,000 pages of internal information from Columbia related to the antisemitism investigation, a committee spokesman said.\nDr. Shafik, an Egyptian-born economist who started in her job last July, will be flanked by the co-chairs of Columbia's board of trustees: Claire Shipman, a journalist and author, and David Greenwald, a corporate attorney. Here are a few things to watch out for:\nElise Stefanik's line of questioning. She is the No. 4 Republican in the House and a potential vice-presidential pick for Donald J. Trump. It was her aggressive grilling of the presidents at the last hearing about whether calling for the genocide of Jews would violate campus rules that got the most traction. She has counted their subsequent resignations as personal wins.\nDr. Shafik's reactions under pressure. Dr. Shafik has decades of experience dealing with complex situations as an executive in organizations including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. But she has not before faced a highly partisan congressional committee.\nWhat lawmakers and university officials say about academic freedom . The committee's questioning is taking place amid a wider battle over what can be taught in American classrooms, and how much influence the government should have over those decisions. Some of Dr. Shafik's supporters are hoping she defends the right of students and faculty to express unpopular, and even controversial, views.\nWhat lawmakers and university officials say about academic freedom.

            "summary": "Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday said he planned this week to advance a long-stalled national security spending package to aid Israel, Ukraine and other American allies, along with a separate bill aimed at mollifying conservatives who have been vehemently opposed to backing Kyiv.\nMr. Johnson's announcement, coming after he has agonized for weeks over whether and how to advance an infusion of critical aid to Ukraine amid stiff Republican resistance, was the first concrete indication that he had settled on a path forward. It came days after Iran launched a large aerial attack on Israel, amplifying calls for Congress to move quickly to approve the pending aid bill.\nEmerging from a meeting in which he briefed G.O.P. lawmakers on his plan, Mr. Johnson said he would cobble together a legislative package that roughly mirrors the $95 billion aid bill the Senate passed two months ago but is broken down into three pieces. Lawmakers would vote separately on a bill providing money for Israel, one providing funding for Ukraine and a third with aid for Taiwan and other allies. They would cast a fourth vote on a separate measure containing other policies popular among Republicans.\nlawmakers on his plan, Mr. Johnson said he would cobble together a legislative package that roughly mirrors the $95 billion aid bill the Senate passed two months ago but is broken down into three pieces. Lawmakers would vote separately on a bill providing money for Israel, one providing funding for Ukraine and a third with aid for Taiwan and other allies. They would cast a fourth vote on a separate measure containing other policies popular among Republicans. 'The overall concept is the same' as the Senate-passed bill, Mr. Johnson said. 'It's the same places that the funding would be sent, and you'll see the House's take on it.'\nIn addition the House would take up legislation that would require that some of the aid to Ukraine to be paid back and that some of it be financed by selling off Russian sovereign assets that have been frozen. That package also would include a bill that could ban TikTok, which passed the House overwhelmingly last month but has since languished in the Senate.\nIt is not clear whether the convoluted strategy will be successful in the House, where Mr. Johnson has a tenuous hold on his divided conference and a bare majority. Its success would require a complicated mix of bipartisan coalitions around each piece of the package. Both Senators Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, had urged Mr. Johnson to pass the Senate-passed aid package as is.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "In more placid times, it would be downright bizarre to classify Owen McCafferty's political drama 'Agreement' as feel-good entertainment.\nIn these fraught, belligerent times, though, there is comfort, even a twinge of hope, in the play's retelling of the knotty negotiations that finally made an enduring peace possible in Northern Ireland. Part of the United Kingdom, it was long violently divided between Catholics and the Protestant majority, with republicans wanting the region to join the predominantly Catholic Republic of Ireland and unionists vehemently opposed. After decades of blood-soaked warring — and bitter, sectarian score-keeping about who did what to whom — the Good Friday Agreement pointed a different way forward.\nPart of the United Kingdom, it was long violently divided between Catholics and the Protestant majority, with republicans wanting the region to join the predominantly Catholic Republic of Ireland and unionists vehemently opposed. After decades of blood-soaked warring — and bitter, sectarian score-keeping about who did what to whom — the Good Friday Agreement pointed a different way forward. It sounds like the makings of theater for wonks, doesn't it? Seven politicians holed up together in Belfast in April 1998, battling their way toward consensus as the clock ticks down. Tony Blair, the British prime minister, has a family vacation to get to in Spain, so they need to complete the deal by Thursday. In Charlotte Westenra's impeccably acted production for Lyric Theater, Belfast, the group blows past that deadline and a delirious dream ballet erupts — all of these exhausted people suddenly dancing.\n'Agreement,' at Irish Arts Center in Manhattan, is generally less colorful than that, and its barrage of contentious details can be overwhelming. But really, negotiations are stuck on the same few specifics: power sharing, economic cooperation, the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons and the release of prisoners.\nThe show's most teasing joke is having the career pacifist John Hume (Dan Gordon), the gentlest pol in the room, ask the audience whether there's any need for him to explain an elusive central point yet again. Whereupon he does not clarify.\n'You all get it, don't you?' Hume says, moving briskly along. 'And if you haven't — pay attention!'\nIn the rushing current of this play, what buoys us isn't the particularities but rather the personalities. Mo Mowlam (Andrea Irvine), the flagrantly unpretentious British secretary of state for Northern Ireland and the only woman in the mix; Gerry Adams (Chris Corrigan), the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, who turns out to be good for a wisecrack at a urinal; Bertie Ahern (Ronan Leahy), the Irish premier, freshly in mourning for his mother and showing up anyway — this is a charismatic bunch.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Two years ago, Nina Jankowicz briefly led an agency at the Department of Homeland Security created to fight disinformation — the establishment of which provoked a political and legal battle over the government's role in policing lies and other harmful content online that continues to reverberate.\nNow she has re-entered the fray with a new nonprofit organization intended to fight against what she and others have described as a coordinated campaign by conservatives and others to undermine researchers, like her, who study the sources of disinformation.\nAlready a lightning rod for critics of her work on the subject, Ms. Jankowicz inaugurated the organization with a letter accusing three Republican committee chairmen in the House of Representatives of abusing their subpoena powers to silence think tanks and universities that expose the sources of disinformation.\n'These tactics echo the dark days of McCarthyism, but with a frightening 21st-century twist,' she wrote in the letter on Monday with the organization's co-founder, Carlos Alvarez-Aranyos, a public-relations consultant who in 2020 was involved in efforts to defend the integrity of the American voting system.\nThe inception of the group, called the American Sunlight Project, reflects how divisive the issue of identifying and combating disinformation has become as the 2024 presidential election approaches. It also represents a tacit admission that the informal networks formed at major universities and research organizations to address the explosion of disinformation online have failed to mount a substantial defense against a campaign, waged largely on the right, depicting their work as part of an effort to silence conservatives.\nTaking place in the courts, in conservative media and the Republican-led House Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, the campaign has largely succeeded in eviscerating efforts to monitor disinformation, especially around the integrity of the American election system.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Gavin Newsom, Democrat of California, produced the ad.\nIt will appear on Monday in Alabama, where Republicans have called for prosecuting women who travel elsewhere for an abortion.

As protests over Israel's war in Gaza continue to intensify, especially on college campuses, activists are preparing to be in Chicago this summer for the Democratic National Convention.\nImage Demonstrators faced off against National Guardsmen outside of the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Credit... Barton Silverman/The New York Times The very idea sends some Democrats right back to 1968, when their convention, also in Chicago, was overshadowed by infighting and violence between the police and antiwar protesters. Back then, many voters watching the nightly news got the impression that the party could not control its own delegates, never mind a country that was wrestling with an unpopular war.\nProtests over the Israel-Hamas war could also complicate this year's convention and the Democratic messaging for President Biden, whom Republicans have eagerly cast as too indulgent of chaos and disorder in American society. Last week, Fox News and other conservative outlets repeatedly showed demonstrations that made the country seem on the edge: Columbia University sending in the police to arrest students on campus; protesters shouting 'genocide!' at President Biden at a campaign stop; demonstrators chaining themselves to cars to block traffic, creating gridlock.\n'The whole Republican message is, ‘The world is out of control and Biden is not in command,'' said David Axelrod, the Democratic strategist and adviser to former President Barack Obama. 'They will exploit any images of disorder to abet and support it.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump said in a letter to Republican vendors that candidates may use his name, image and likeness in campaign materials only if they send at least 5 percent of donations that they receive to Mr. Trump's campaign.\nThe move in effect imposes a tax on using the Trump brand for campaign purposes. Mr. Trump has sought to close a significant financial gap between him and President Biden, his Democratic rival. The Biden campaign and its political committees reported $192 million in cash on hand at the end of March, more than double the $93 million of Trump and the Republican Party.\nDanielle Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, said in a statement that 'it is important to protect small-dollar donors from scammers that use the president's name and likeness.'\nIn a letter this week signed by Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, who identified themselves as co-campaign managers, the campaign also said it was tightening control of campaign materials that use Mr. Trump's name, prohibiting strident language that has become common in donor appeals such as 'President Trump needs you' or 'If you support President Trump, you'll contribute now.'\nThe letter said the messaging guidelines were part of an effort 'to treat our donors with the utmost respect.' After Mr. Trump appeared in court on Monday, the campaign sent a fund-raising pitch falsely claiming in all-capital letters that Mr. Trump had 'just stormed out of Biden's kangaroo court!' Mr. Trump had not actually stormed out of the Manhattan courthouse.\nThe letter added that the campaign would punish campaign vendors if candidates whom they worked with did not comply with the new rules.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

But her grilling of the presidents of Harvard, University of Pennsylvania and M.I.T. at a December hearing became a defining moment.\nMs. Stefanik pressed the leaders to say whether students would violate their universities' codes of conduct if they called for the genocide of Jews. Their dispassionate, lawyerly answers about context and free speech set off a firestorm that ultimately helped cost two of them, Claudine Gay of Harvard and Elizabeth Magill of the Penn, their jobs.\nThe exchange also helped win Ms. Stefanik widespread attention and rare plaudits from grudging liberals, who typically revile her for embracing former President Donald J. Trump and his lies about the 2020 election. On Wednesday, she was named one of Time's 100 most influential people of 2024.\nMs. Stefanik is a graduate of Harvard herself. When she first won her seat in 2014, she was the youngest woman ever elected to the House of Representatives. She beat a centrist Democrat, and in the early days of her career, she took on more moderate stances.\nThese days, she describes herself as 'ultra MAGA' and 'proud of it.'\nMs. Stefanik, 39, has said she was 'stunned' by the responses of the presidents during the last hearing. She plans to reprise that role on Wednesday, grilling the president of Columbia University, Nemat Shafik, and members of its board of trustees.\nIn an opinion piece in The New York Post before the hearing, Ms. Stefanik said antisemitism at Columbia had become 'egregious and commonplace.' She charged Dr. Shafik with failing 'to ensure Jewish students are able to attend school in a safe environment.'",

            "summary": "Speaker Ben Toma walked off the floor of the Arizona House of Representatives, resolute — if stressed — after he cast the pivotal vote to again block an effort to repeal the state's 1864 abortion ban.\nHe knew he was going against the wishes of top Republicans like former President Donald J. Trump, who had called on the Legislature to change the ban. He worried about political blowback to Republicans in the coming elections.\nBut Mr. Toma saw himself as upholding moral principles far more foundational than current politics, the past president or even the ban itself. Attempts to undercut it as 'a Civil-War-era law' were 'sort of ridiculous,' he said in an interview on Wednesday after the vote. He pointed to the Constitution and Bill of Rights — and the Bible.\n'Even all of our laws are actually based on, what, the Ten Commandments, and the Book of Genesis, which are thousands of years ago,' he said. 'The whole idea that we are equal in the sight of God, our maker, that we have unalienable rights, all that, that is all fundamentally a Christian worldview.'\nThis commitment to Arizona's 1864 ban — a near-total ban that the State Supreme Court recently reinstated — underscores the power of conservative Christian abortion opponents in shaping American abortion laws, even as they represent a minority view. Despite a popular backlash against the Supreme Court's decision overturning a constitutional right to abortion in 2022, anti-abortion forces have maintained a stronghold in many state legislatures, not only in deeply conservative states like Alabama, but also closely divided ones like Arizona.\nMembers of Students for Life of America went door to door try to persuade voters not to support a proposed ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights in the Arizona Constitution.

            "summary": "For weeks after the Senate passed a sprawling aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, Speaker Mike Johnson agonized over whether and how the House would take up funding legislation that would almost certainly infuriate the right wing of his party and could cost him his job.\nHe huddled with top national security officials, including William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, in the Oval Office to discuss classified intelligence. He met repeatedly with broad factions of Republicans in both swing and deep red districts, and considered their voters' attitudes toward funding Ukraine. He thought about his son, who is set to attend the U.S. Naval Academy in the fall.\nAnd finally, when his plan to work with Democrats to clear the way for aiding Ukraine met with an outpouring of venom from ultraconservatives already threatening to depose him, Mr. Johnson, an evangelical Christian, knelt and prayed for guidance.\n'I want to be on the right side of history,' Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, recalled the speaker telling him.\nMr. Johnson's decision to risk his speakership to push the $95 billion foreign aid bill through the House on Saturday was the culmination of a remarkable personal and political arc for the Louisiana Republican. It was also an improbable outcome for a man plucked from relative obscurity last fall by the hard right — which had just deposed a speaker they deemed a traitor to their agenda — to be the speaker of a deeply dysfunctional House.\nAs a rank-and-file hard-liner, Mr. Johnson had largely opposed efforts to fund Kyiv's war effort. And early in his speakership, he declared he would never allow the matter to come to a vote until his party's border demands were met.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Representative David Trone, a Democrat who apologized for using a racial slur during a recent House committee meeting, has poured nearly $42 million from his personal fortune into his Senate bid in Maryland, according to the latest federal quarter filings, putting him among the top self-funders in Senate primary history.\nMr. Trone, who founded and owns a lucrative wine and liquor retailer alongside his brother, invested $18.5 million of his own money from January to March alone, ending last month with $1 million on hand. He drew only about $216,100 from other donors in that time, according to the filings.\nMr. Trone is seeking to make up ground in his hotly contested Democratic primary against Angela Alsobrooks, the prominent executive of Prince George's County, and a slate of lesser known candidates. Now in his third term in the House of Representatives, Mr. Trone has picked up endorsements from top House Democrats. But his use of the slur has drawn criticism.\nLast month, while praising President Biden's tax proposals at a congressional budget hearing, Mr. Trone dropped a derogatory term used to caricature Black people. He later apologized, adding that he misspoke and meant to say 'bugaboo.' 'Regardless of what I meant to say, I shouldn't have used that language, and I apologize,' he said at the time.\nFive Black Democrats in the House then endorsed Ms. Alsobrooks, who is Black, though they made no mention of the slur. She ended the latest quarter with nearly $3.2 million cash on hand, according to federal filings. The primary is on May 14.\nThe winner is likely to face Larry Hogan, a popular former governor of the state who is seeking the Republican nomination, in what is expected to be a competitive general election. While Maryland has not elected a Republican senator in more than 40 years, it elected Mr. Hogan as governor twice.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "On Jan. 19, 2021, as part of a series of pardons on his last full day in office, President Donald J. Trump commuted the sentence of a man who had spent almost 30 years of a life sentence in federal prison for what prosecutors said was his role in the murder of an undercover police officer in upstate New York.\nThe commutation went largely unnoticed as the country grappled with the aftermath of a pro-Trump mob's attack on the Capitol, which included assaults on Capitol Police officers. Since then, Mr. Trump has referred to the rioters as 'patriots' and 'hostages,' and has criticized an officer who shot and killed a woman trying to breach a doorway near the House chamber.\nAnd yet Mr. Trump, who is the first former president to face criminal indictment, has sought to portray himself as a champion of law enforcement, surrounding himself at events with a tableau of police officers and law-enforcement officials as he campaigns to return to the White House.\nMr. Trump has been endorsed by three police unions. He recently stood next to the Nassau County Police commissioner at a microphone outside a funeral home where he paid a condolence call at the wake for a slain New York Police officer, Jonathan Diller. Days later, Mr. Trump promised at a rally that he would pass a law for a mandatory death penalty for people who kill police officers.\n'You'll see the whole situation come to a halt,' Mr. Trump said of police deaths.\nMr. Trump often poses for photos with local police officers who are helping to guard his motorcades at various stops, including last week when he took pictures with officers at a campaign stop in Upper Manhattan on the second day of his criminal trial. His aides regularly post photos and videos of the encounters on social media, a montage intended to underscore a law-and-order image of the presumptive Republican nominee — who was also arraigned four times last year.\nwhen he took pictures with officers at a campaign stop in Upper Manhattan on the second day of his criminal trial.

            "summary": "HABSBURGS ON THE RIO GRANDE: The Rise and Fall of the Second Mexican Empire, by Raymond Jonas\nHABSBURGS ON THE RIO GRANDE: The Rise and Fall of the Second Mexican Empire, by Raymond Jonas In October 1863, a Mexican delegation arrived in Trieste, a polyglot city in southern Europe on the borderlands of the Hapsburg Empire. In a turreted castle on the Adriatic coast, the delegates — many of them Europhile bankers and industrialists — offered the crown of Mexico to Maximilian, a Hapsburg prince, and his wife, Charlotte, daughter of the king of Belgium.\nSince gaining independence in 1821, Mexico had squandered the 'splendid legacy' of European rule, the delegates explained, and the country now led a 'sad existence' as a shaky, vulnerable republic. Only the resurrection of monarchy could guarantee stability and prosperity. The timing was crucial. Mexico's republican neighbor, the United States, was too preoccupied by a civil war to block European intervention.\nMaximilian thought of himself as a progressive monarch; he would accept the invitation only if it represented the true will of the Mexican people. When the delegates returned the following April, they brought enthusiastic testimonials from towns and villages across Mexico. Satisfied, flattered and ambitious, Maximilian and Charlotte set sail for North America as the emperor and empress of Mexico.\nTwo years later, a shattered Charlotte was back in Europe, eating nothing but fruit she peeled and nuts she shelled herself for fear of poisoning. Maximilian would soon be dead, executed by Mexico's republican forces on a rocky hillside outside Querétaro.\nThe rise and fall of the Second Mexican Empire is the subject of 'Habsburgs on the Rio Grande,' by the historian Raymond Jonas. Seen from the American perspective, Maximilian's fleeting rule is all too easily understood as a European fantasy that failed to grasp history's ineluctable path from monarchy to democracy. Jonas instead argues for its global significance, placing it at the center of a transcontinental power struggle between an expansionist United States and faltering European supremacy.\nWhen Mexico first cast off Spanish rule, the country established its own independent monarchy — the First Mexican Empire — and then, in 1824, a republic. Two decades of turbulent constitutional change and civil strife followed. In 1845, the United States annexed Texas from Mexico. It then launched a war of aggression that would strip Mexico of half of its territory. U.S. ambitions appeared unlimited, its appetite for territory insatiable, and many Mexicans feared their young republic would succumb entirely.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Not since Eugene V. Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning.\nFor now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, beyond having to be present in a courtroom, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But some of the cases are proceeding at a pace that could bring verdicts before the election — and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that will arise if he is convicted.\nOthers would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges.\nHere is what we know, and what we don't know.\nThis is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes.\nThe Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be 'natural born' citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years.\nThere are no limitations based on character or criminal record. While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices.\nThe Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground.\n'We let states set the time, place and manner' of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, 'but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don't let the state add new substantive requirements.'\nWhile that view is not universal among legal experts, it prevailed in court in 2019, after California passed a law requiring candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the law from taking effect, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' after taking an oath to support the Constitution.\nNumerous lawsuits had argued that Mr. Trump's actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, met this bar. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine's secretary of state did the same. But the Supreme Court — led by a conservative supermajority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself — concluded that only Congress had the power to enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. (Four of the justices, including the three liberals, wanted to allow a wider range of options for disqualification.)\nCongress is not going to do that with Republicans in control of the House. And the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal cases, meaning convictions would not disqualify Mr. Trump either.\nCongress can designate either groups of people to whom Section 3 applies (such as people who fought for the Confederacy) or specific crimes that, upon conviction, would trigger disqualification, said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University. But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty.\n'Whether or not Trump is tried, convicted, acquitted, that's a separate question from whether or not he's disqualified,' said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nOne of the charges in the federal case related to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election — conspiracy to violate civil rights — once carried a disqualification penalty, Mr. Kreis said, but Congress removed it decades ago.\nNow that Mr. Trump has secured a majority of delegates to the Republican convention, the party has no mechanism to nominate somebody else. Under the party's official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, 'such support shall not be recognized.'\nNor have top Republicans shown any interest in another nominee.\nIf he were forced to withdraw from the race after the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him.\nafter the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him. Probably not.\nMr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony.\nMost felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day.\nHe could also petition for clemency, which would require the approval of the governor — Ron DeSantis, who ran against Mr. Trump in the Republican primary — and two Florida cabinet members. Chris Taylor, the director of external affairs for the Florida Commission on Offender Review, confirmed that a Florida resident convicted of a felony could apply to have their voting rights restored through that process even if their conviction happened outside Florida.\nSince Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison.\nSo if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he could be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote.\nNo one knows.\n'We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 'It's just guessing.'\nLegally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. 'I don't think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,' Professor Levinson said.\nIn practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts.\nIn theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself.\nMore likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump's lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch.\nOn the federal charges only, he could also try to pardon himself — or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a 'self pardon' was constitutional.\nOr President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that 'the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,' Professor Chemerinsky said.\nBut that wouldn't apply to the New York or Georgia cases, because the president does not have pardon power for state charges.\nAgain, no one knows, particularly when it comes to the New York and Georgia cases.\nIn the two federal cases, a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges.\nThe Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents — that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties — applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario.\n'The reasons why we wouldn't want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn't want to prosecute a sitting president,' said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department's reasoning. 'My guess is, if the Trump prosecution were still ongoing in some way and Trump were elected, the Justice Department — which would be the Trump Justice Department — would say, ‘We're following the 1973 memo.''\nLike so much else here, this would be legally untested, and it is impossible to say what the Supreme Court would do if the question reached it.\nIn its Clinton v. Jones ruling in 1997, the court allowed a lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed. But that case was civil, not criminal, and it was filed by a private citizen, not by the government itself.\nCharlie Savage contributed reporting.",

            "summary": "Former President Donald J. Trump's presidential campaign committee ended March with $45 million on hand, federal filings showed Saturday, as he tries to close the fund-raising gap with President Biden.\nBut Mr. Trump's campaign is spending much less than it was at the start of the year, which has helped it inch closer. In March, it spent just $3.7 million, the new filings show, compared with $11.4 million in January — and much less than the $29.2 million spent by Mr. Biden's campaign in March. In other words, Mr. Trump's campaign is guarding resources as it seeks to build a campaign war chest for the general election.\nThis cycle began with the announcement of former President Donald J. Trump's campaign in November 2022 and President Biden's in April 2023.\nMarch 2024 This cycle March 2024 This cycle Raised $43.8 $158.5 $15.3 $114.7 Spent $29.2 $74.3 $4 $70.1 Net cash $85.5 — $44.6 — Figures are for the 2024 Biden and Trump presidential campaign committees as of the last day of the month. They do not include data from leadership PACs, super PACs or other associated fundraising or spending. Figures are adjusted for debt.\nSource: Federal Election Commission\nBy Albert Sun\nMr. Biden's campaign had $85.5 million on hand at the end of March, according to its monthly filing with the Federal Election Commission, a significant increase from the month before: He ended February with $71 million in his campaign account while Mr. Trump ended February with less than half that.\nAs Mr. Trump and Republicans chase the Democrats' financial edge, Mr. Biden has also started to narrow the polling gap between himself and Mr. Trump. Since late February, the president has cut a deficit of five percentage points to a single point, a virtual tie, according to a recent survey by The New York Times and Siena College.\nThe rivals each capitalized on splashy fund-raisers in the past month that brought in tens of millions of dollars for their respective campaigns. But Mr. Trump's haul from an April 6 event in Palm Beach, Fla., will be reflected on a future filing. His campaign reported that it and the Republican National Committee raked in more than $50.5 million from the dinner, which was held at the home of the billionaire John Paulson.\nBy the end of the 2020 cycle Biden had raised and spent more than $1 billion and Trump more than $700 million dollars.\nFigures are for the 2020 and 2024 Biden and Trump presidential campaign committees as of the last day of the month. They do not include data from leadership PACs, super PACs or other associated fundraising or spending.

            "summary": "The first criminal trial of an American president will begin Monday as prosecutors and defense lawyers convene in a Manhattan courtroom to begin selecting the jury that will decide Donald J. Trump's fate.\nThe Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has charged Mr. Trump with 34 felonies, accusing him of falsifying documents to conceal a sex scandal involving a porn star.\nThe case, one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, could reshape the political landscape ahead of Election Day.\nJury selection could last two weeks or more and the trial may spill into June. Mr. Trump is expected to be in the courtroom for much of it, bringing campaign theatrics to the sober atmosphere of a criminal proceeding.\nThe spectacle will be remarkable: a former president face-to-face with a part of his past that he has tried to bury but that could instead make him a felon. In 2016, Mr. Trump's former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, paid $130,000 to the porn star, Stormy Daniels, to buy her silence about a story of having had sex with Mr. Trump a decade earlier.\nMr. Trump, who might take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied the sexual encounter. But prosecutors say that he falsified a series of documents to hide reimbursements to Mr. Cohen.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Monday marked another key moment in the criminal trial of Donald J. Trump: opening statements, during which the former president listened quietly to the prosecution's allegations of crimes, and the defense's counterargument that he was a simple man, wrongly accused.\nThe jury that will decide Mr. Trump's case concentrated intently on the statements, which began the presentation of what will be weeks of testimony and other evidence, all in a tense courtroom in Lower Manhattan.\nThe presumptive Republican presidential nominee once more, Mr. Trump, 77, is charged with falsifying 34 business records in an attempt to cover up a payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, in the days before the 2016 election. Ms. Daniels, who may testify, says that she and Mr. Trump had a sexual encounter in 2006, a claim the former president denies.\nMr. Trump has also denied the 34 felony charges, calling them orchestrated by Democrats; if convicted, the former president could face probation or up to four years in prison.\nHere are five takeaways from Mr. Trump's fifth day on trial:\nThe charges faced by Mr. Trump may sound bland — 'falsifying business records' doesn't really set the heart racing — but the prosecution made clear on Monday that it plans on painting a much broader picture.\nMatthew Colangelo, a prosecutor, laid out in his opening statement a tale that touched on tabloid journalism, tawdry affairs and covertly recorded phone calls. Jurors will likely be told about events inside fancy hotel rooms, Trump Tower and even the Oval Office. And the stakes? The presidency.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Voir dire is the part of jury selection in which lawyers directly question potential jurors, trying to detect any beliefs or biases that could help or harm their cases.\nJoshua Steinglass, a prosecutor with the Manhattan district attorney's office, quickly mentioned the elephant in the room (an appropriate metaphor, it would seem, for the presumptive Republican nominee for president).\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states.\nBut for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West.\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks.\nThe City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis — the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing.\nThe conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them.\nAdvocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

It was about three hours into a congressional hearing examining antisemitism at Columbia University, and the president, Nemat Shafik, paused, sighed and gave a nervous laugh.\nMs. Stefanik had asked whether the university would remove a professor who praised the Oct. 7 Hamas attack from a role as chair of the university's academic review committee.\nAfter a few seconds, Dr. Shafik responded. 'I think that would be — I think, I would, yes. Let me come back with yes,' she said.\nRepublican lawmakers on the House Committee on Education and the Work Force had come ready to pounce. They tested for weaknesses and prodded vulnerabilities, while their witnesses, a group of Columbia leaders, seemed conciliatory.\nAnd yet, by the end, it seemed Dr. Shafik and other campus leaders had successfully diffused Republican lines of attack, repeatedly and vigorously agreeing that antisemitism was a serious problem on their campus and vowing that they would do more to fight it.\nBut as Dr. Shafik spoke, the tempest that she had been brought in to account for appeared to intensify. Back on campus in Manhattan, pro-Palestinian students erected an encampment with dozens of tents on a central campus lawn, vowing not to move until Columbia divested from companies with ties to Israel and met other demands. Hundreds of other students joined them to rally throughout the day.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The Senate on Wednesday dismissed the first of two articles of impeachment against Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary, voting along party lines before his trial got underway to sweep aside the charge accusing him of failing to enforce immigration laws.\nBy a vote of 51 to 48, with one senator voting 'present,' the Senate ruled that the charge was unconstitutional because it failed to meet the constitutional bar of a high crime or misdemeanor. Republicans united in opposition except for Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the lone 'present' vote, while Democrats were unanimous in favor, after arguing that a cabinet member cannot be impeached and removed merely for carrying out the policies of the administration he serves.\n'To validate this gross abuse by the House would be a grave mistake and could set a dangerous precedent for the future,' said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader.\nRepublicans, for their part, warned that the dangerous precedent was the one that Democrats set by moving to skip an impeachment trial altogether, which they argued was a shirking of the Senate's constitutional duty. They tried several times to delay the dismissal, failing on a series of party-line votes.\n'Tabling articles of impeachment would be unprecedented in the history of the Senate — it's as simple as that,' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader.\nDemocrats moved immediately to strike down the second article of impeachment against Mr. Mayorkas, alleging a breach of the public trust, thus skipping the trial altogether. A vote was expected later on Wednesday.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The president of Columbia said the university had suspended 15 students. She promised that one visiting professor 'will never work at Columbia again.'\nAnd when she was grilled over whether she would remove another professor from his leadership position, she appeared to make a decision right there on Capitol Hill: 'I think I would, yes.'\nThe president, Nemat Shafik, disclosed the disciplinary details, which are usually confidential, as part of a all-out effort on Wednesday to persuade a House committee investigating Columbia that she was taking serious action to combat a wave of antisemitism following the Israel-Hamas war.\nIn nearly four hours of testimony before the Republican-led Committee on Education and the Workforce, Dr. Shafik conceded that Columbia had initially been overwhelmed by an outbreak of campus protests. But she said its leaders now agreed that some had used antisemitic language and that certain contested phrases — like 'from the river to the sea' — might warrant discipline.\n'I promise you, from the messages I'm hearing from students, they are getting the message that violations of our policies will have consequences,' Dr. Shafik said.\nTestifying alongside her, Claire Shipman, the co-chair of Columbia's board of trustees, made the point bluntly. 'We have a moral crisis on our campus,' she said.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Legislative auditors in Arkansas found that the purchase last year of a $19,000 lectern by Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders's office potentially violated state laws, according to a report released on Monday.\nBut the findings may be moot after the state attorney general, Tim Griffin, said last week that state purchasing laws do not apply to the governor or other executive branch officials.\nMs. Sanders, a Republican, faced sharp scrutiny for the purchase, even from members of her own party. But on Monday, she appeared eager to fling away those attacks, posting a video montage seemingly mocking the lectern controversy on social media, complete with hype music and dramatic edits.\nHer office described the report as 'deeply flawed' and said that 'no laws were broken.'\nThe potential violations found by the audit include shredding a document that should have been preserved and mishandling the purchase process. The legislative auditors said that their report would be forwarded to the Sixth Judicial District prosecuting attorney and to Mr. Griffin's office.\nState lawmakers approved the audit last year after it was revealed that the governor's office had purchased the lectern and an accompanying traveling case in June, using a state-issued credit card to pay $19,029.25 to Beckett Events L.L.C., an event management company with ties to Ms. Sanders.\nMatthew Campbell, a lawyer and blogger who had filed a broad public records request, was the first to obtain the information.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "In recent decades, American universities have expanded their diversity programs to address concerns about the underrepresentation of minority groups on campus.\nBut over the past few years, many Republican-led states have taken steps to restrict or eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs and initiatives at public universities and colleges, with conservative lawmakers and groups arguing that such programs can be discriminatory to the people who are left out. But supporters of such efforts say they are necessary to promote diversity and help students from various backgrounds succeed on campus.\nFor some universities, the opposition to diversity programs comes at a challenging time, as they face an incoming student shortage and skepticism of the value of a college degree at today's prices. And after the Supreme Court's ban on race-conscious admissions last year, some educators are even more concerned about diversity on their campuses.\nHere's what to know about the efforts to limit D.E.I. programs in higher education.\nBy and large, D.E.I. initiatives in colleges and universities include programs, campus activities and events, curriculums, recruitment, admissions and policies that are focused on promoting and increasing the representation and participation of individuals from groups that have historically been underrepresented.\nThose groups can be based on race, ethnicity, national origin, gender and gender identity, age, culture, religion, disability status, socioeconomic status and sexual orientation, as well as other aspects of one's social identity.\nSome schools also have a requirement for prospective students and faculty members to include diversity statements in their applications, meaning a written pledge describing how they would help foster diversity on campus.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab New York City courtroom as Mr. Trump looked on.\nBefore jury selection began, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, rejected another effort to force his recusal by the defense, which cited several issues, including his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant.\nHe also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost.\nBut Mr. Trump's lawyers did persuade Justice Merchan that mentioning sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump was recorded bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial.\nEntering the courtroom Monday, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here,' but he looked less enthusiastic in front of Justice Merchan. He quietly slouched and scowled — and at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep.\nBy afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into the courtroom. Some quickly left: When the judge asked the first group of 96 if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused.\nThe remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.",

The review provides new details about the Islamic State bomber who carried out the suicide mission, including how he slipped into the crowds trying to evacuate the capital's airport just moments before detonating explosives.\nSome Marines who were at the gate have said they identified the suspected bomber — who became known to investigators as 'Bald Man in Black' — in the crowds hours before the attack but were twice denied permission by their superiors to shoot him. But the review, building on a previous investigation made public in February 2022, rejected those accusations.\nThe narrative of missed opportunities to avert tragedy has gained momentum over the past year among conservatives and has contributed to broader Republican criticisms of the Biden administration's troop withdrawal and evacuation from Kabul in August 2021.\nThe bombing was a searing experience for the military after 20 years of war in Afghanistan. Thirteen flag-draped coffins were flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, and a succession of funerals were held across the country for the service members, most of them under the age of 25.\nMilitary officials had stood by the conclusions of the earlier inquiry that a lone Islamic State suicide bomber carried out the attack and was not joined by accomplices firing into the crowd.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Few British politicians have American ties as deep as those of David Lammy, who is set to become Britain's foreign secretary if the opposition Labour Party wins the coming election, as the polls suggest it will.\nA son of Guyanese immigrants who grew up poor in working-class London, he spent summers with relatives in Brooklyn and Queens, working at Con Edison, before earning a master's degree at Harvard Law School and befriending Barack Obama, for whom he canvassed in Chicago during his first presidential campaign.\nYet now, on the cusp of becoming Britain's chief diplomat, Mr. Lammy finds himself facing an uncertain, even potentially hostile, American political landscape. President Biden and the Democrats, with whom Mr. Lammy has cultivated a deep network of contacts, are fighting to hold off a resurgent Donald J. Trump.\nHaving been chosen by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, partly because of his trans-Atlantic credentials, Mr. Lammy, 51, is scrambling to build ties with Republicans and, more challengingly, with those around Mr. Trump. It's a very different American establishment from the Democratic one he knows so well.\nWould Mr. Lammy pay a visit to Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's Palm Beach estate, as David Cameron, Britain's current foreign secretary, did two weeks ago to lobby the former president on military aid to Ukraine?\n'Of course,' he said in an interview this week in Portcullis House, the parliamentary office building across the street from Big Ben. Noting that he was headed soon to New York and Washington, he said, 'I'm happy to talk to whomever the American people decide they want to run the country.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Book bans in public schools continued to surge in the first half of this school year, according to a report released on Tuesday by PEN America, a free speech organization.\nFrom July to December 2023, PEN found that more than 4,300 books were removed from schools across 23 states — a figure that surpassed the number of bans from the entire previous academic year.\nThe rise in book bans has accelerated in recent years, driven by conservative groups and by new laws and regulations that limit what kinds of books children can access. Since the summer of 2021, PEN has tracked book removals in 42 states and found instances in both Republican- and Democratic-controlled districts.\nThe numbers likely fail to capture the full scale of book removals. PEN compiles its figures based on news reports, public records requests and publicly available data, but many removals go unreported.\nHere are some of the report's key findings.\nBook bans are not new in the United States. School and public libraries have long had procedures for addressing complaints, which were often brought by parents concerned about their children's reading material.\nBut the current wave stands out in its scope. Censorship efforts have become increasingly organized and politicized, supercharged by conservative groups like Moms for Liberty and Utah Parents United, which have pushed for legislation that regulates the content of library collections. Since PEN began tracking book bans, it has counted more than 10,000 instances of books being removed from schools. Many of the targeted titles feature L.G.B.T.Q. characters, or deal with race and racism, PEN found.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Former President Donald J. Trump, his Republican opponent, will get a short reprieve from his felony criminal trial in New York with a scheduled break.\nMr. Biden has hammered Mr. Trump during his appearances in Pennsylvania so far. Visiting his hometown, Scranton, on Tuesday, Mr. Biden portrayed Mr. Trump as cozy with billionaires and plutocrats, while emphasizing that his own proposals would raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy and use the revenue to help working families. Mr. Biden also needled Mr. Trump about his financial troubles, as well as the plummeting price of shares in his social media company.\n'If Trump's stock in Truth Social — his company — drops any lower, he might do better under my tax plan than his,' Mr. Biden quipped.\nBut in Mr. Trump's view, the greater insult is that he has been in a New York courtroom while Mr. Biden campaigns. The former president and his campaign continued to express outrage that the trial was keeping Mr. Trump from the campaign trail.\n'Election interference!' Mr. Trump wrote on Tuesday morning on Truth Social, and added, in all caps: 'Rigged, unconstitutional trial!'\nWhile stuck in the deep-blue state of New York, Mr. Trump made a campaign stop at a bodega in Harlem after his trial adjourned on Tuesday. Surrounded by supporters, detractors and curious onlookers, the former president took the optimistic perspective that the Empire State was competitive in this year's election, vowing that he would 'make a big play for New York' — adding that his court schedule would allow him to campaign nearby.\nMr. Biden defeated Mr. Trump in New York in the 2020 election by a margin of nearly two million votes.\nNicholas Nehamas contributed reporting from Scranton, Pa. and Michael Gold contributed reporting.",

            "summary": "Manhattan prosecutors delivered a raw recounting of Donald J. Trump's seamy past on Monday as they debuted their case against him to jurors, the nation and the world, reducing the former president to a co-conspirator in a plot to cover up three sex scandals that threatened his 2016 election win.\nTheir opening statement was a pivotal moment in the first prosecution of an American president, a sweeping synopsis of the case against Mr. Trump, who watched from the defense table, occasionally shaking his head. Moments later, Mr. Trump's lawyer delivered his own opening, beginning with the simple claim that 'President Trump is innocent,' then noting that he is once again the presumptive Republican nominee and concluding with an exhortation for jurors to 'use your common sense.'\nThe jury of 12 New Yorkers who will weigh Mr. Trump's legal fate before millions of voters decide his political future also heard brief testimony from the prosecution's leadoff witness, David Pecker, a former tabloid publisher who was close with Mr. Trump. Mr. Pecker, who ran The National Enquirer, testified that his supermarket tabloids practiced 'checkbook journalism.' In this case, prosecutors say, he bought and buried stories that could have imperiled Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign.\nPolice officers patrolled the area around the dingy courthouse, where reporters set up a temporary camp. Credit... Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times The flurry of activity on the landmark trial's first formal day captivated jurors, many of whom jotted notes as they followed along.\nAnd it sent nervous energy through a Lower Manhattan courthouse as bomb-sniffing dogs, the U.S. Secret Service and the police patrolled the dingy building. The spectacle was a vivid reminder of the proceeding's unprecedented nature: A courthouse accustomed to cycling through trials of murderers, fraudsters and felons of all types now had its first former president.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "In 2009, long before Jeff Yass became a Republican megadonor, his firm, Susquehanna International Group, invested in a Chinese real estate start-up that boasted a sophisticated search algorithm.\nThe company, 99Fang, promised to help buyers find their perfect homes. Behind the scenes, employees of a Chinese subsidiary of Mr. Yass's firm were so deeply involved, records show, that they conceived the idea for the company and handpicked its chief executive. They said in one email that he was not the company's 'real founder.'\nAs a real estate venture, 99Fang ultimately fizzled. But it was significant, according to a lawsuit by former Susquehanna contractors, because of what it spawned. They say that 99Fang's chief executive — and the search technology — resurfaced at another Susquehanna venture: ByteDance.\nByteDance, the owner of TikTok, is now one of the world's most highly valued start-ups, worth $225 billion, according to CB Insights, a firm that tracks venture capital. ByteDance is also at the center of a tempest on Capitol Hill, where some lawmakers see the company as a threat to American security. They are considering a bill that could break up the company. The man picked by Susquehanna to run the housing site, Zhang Yiming, became ByteDance's founder.\nCourt documents reveal a complex origin story for ByteDance and TikTok. The records include emails, chat messages and memos from inside Susquehanna. They describe a middling business experiment, founder-investor tension and, ultimately, a powerful search engine that just needed a purpose.\nThe records also show that Mr. Yass's firm was more deeply involved in TikTok's genesis than previously known. It has been widely reported in The New York Times and elsewhere that Susquehanna owns roughly 15 percent of ByteDance, but the documents make clear that the firm was no passive investor. It nurtured Mr. Zhang's career and signed off on the idea for the company.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Speaker Mike Johnson's push to advance an aid package for Ukraine in the face of vehement opposition from his own party was never going to be easy.\nBut it has been made even more politically perilous by a pair of concessions to the far right that he inherited from his predecessor: allowing a single lawmaker to call a snap vote to oust the speaker, and giving ultraconservatives a bloc of seats on a crucial panel that controls what legislation can make it to the House floor.\nBoth of those concessions, agreed to by former Speaker Kevin McCarthy more than a year ago, are now tormenting Mr. Johnson as he tries to push through a $95 billion aid bill for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. They have hemmed him in to having to rely heavily on Democrats — not only to clear the way for the legislation and drag it across the finish line, but potentially to save his job.\nMr. Johnson's predicament was on vivid display on the House floor on Thursday as a group of ultraconservatives huddled around him in a heated back and forth. One after another, they urged the speaker to tie the foreign aid package to stringent anti-immigration measures, but Mr. Johnson pushed back, replying that he would not have enough Republican support to advance such a measure, according to people involved in the private conversation.\nMinutes after the clash, some hard-right lawmakers who previously resisted joining the G.O.P. push to oust him began to sound more open to the idea.\n'My hope was that the motion to vacate would be an elixir that only required one dose for effectiveness,' said Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, who led the ouster of Mr. McCarthy. 'But sometimes there are some therapies that require more than one dose. And I hope that's not the case with the motion to vacate, but we'll administer the elixir as many times as is necessary to save the country.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The song opened on cue with a 'little ditty about Jack and Diane,' but then the music abruptly stopped. John Mellencamp had barely finished the second verse of his smash hit when an exchange with a heckler had clearly gotten on his nerves.\n'You know what?' he told concertgoers last month in Toledo, Ohio. 'Show's over.'\nVideos capturing the moment when the singer walked off the stage have ricocheted for weeks online. A cascade of right-wing chatter on social media has fueled the perception that Mr. Mellencamp brought it on himself by promoting President Biden during the show.\nBut that was not the case.\nAn audio recording provided to The New York Times by Mr. Mellencamp's representatives, and an interview with a reporter who covered the March 17 concert for The Blade in Toledo, show that the exchange started when a heckler grew frustrated with the singer's long-winded reminiscences about his late grandmother. Representatives for Mr. Mellencamp, who returned to the stage and resumed the concert that night several minutes after walking out, declined further comment.\nMr. Mellencamp is an unabashed liberal who has previously barred several Republican presidential candidates from using his songs at political events and has assailed Congress for its response to gun violence. But the exchange with the heckler in Toledo did not stem from any political commentary that happened onstage.\n'The word Biden or election never escaped John Mellencamp's mouth that night,' Jason Webber, who covers music for The Blade, said in an interview.\nMr. Mellencamp, 72, a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, had been sharing an anecdote about how his grandmother, who had lived until the age of 100, had once cautioned him that 'you're not going to get into heaven if you don't stop this cussing and smoking all the time.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The prospect of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. threatening to upend the presidential race went from an idea to a reality in one of the country's most consequential battlegrounds on Thursday, when Mr. Kennedy qualified for the ballot in Michigan.\nThe decision by the Natural Law Party to grant Mr. Kennedy its ballot line in November ensures he will be a factor in a pivotal swing state where the presidential election is expected to be incredibly close and where President Biden has already shown vulnerability with key Democratic constituencies. During Michigan's primary in February, a protest movement over Mr. Biden's support for Israel's war in Gaza drew significant support.\nMr. Kennedy, a lifelong Democrat and the scion of perhaps the nation's most famous Democratic family, is running as an independent in 2024 and polling higher in early surveys than any third-party candidate since Ross Perot, the self-funding billionaire who ran in the 1990s.\nHis independent candidacy has earned him the estrangement of his own family — who campaigned this week with Mr. Biden in Pennsylvania — and many of his previous colleagues from the environmental movement, who denounced his candidacy publicly on Friday.\nMr. Kennedy has emerged as a leading voice of vaccine skepticism, both before and after Covid-19 vaccine, and dabbled in conspiratorial theories, including about the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, his father. He had initially declared his 2024 campaign as a Democratic challenger to Mr. Biden — and was heavily featured in conservative media — until he switched last fall to run as an independent.\nBoth parties are already rushing to define Mr. Kennedy as he races to get on the ballot nationwide.\nBrian Hughes, an adviser to Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, called Mr. Kennedy 'a leftist and liberal with a history of supporting an extreme environmental agenda that rivals Joe Biden for its ability to kill American jobs.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "As President Biden tours Pennsylvania, his campaign will run a new ad promoting his commitment to organized labor and attacking the economic policies of former President Donald J. Trump.\nThe ad features JoJo Burgess, who is a steelworker and the mayor of Washington, Pa., a small town southwest of Pittsburgh. Mr. Biden is scheduled to speak on Wednesday at the headquarters of the United Steelworkers union in Pittsburgh, where he is expected to call on his trade representative to increase some tariffs on steel and aluminum products from China.\n'Donald Trump has shown through his history that workers mean nothing to him,' Mr. Burgess says in the ad, a minute-long spot. 'Right now, we have the most pro-American worker president in office that we've ever had in our history.'\nThe Biden campaign said it was spending in the 'mid-six figures' to push the message across television and digital platforms in Pennsylvania, separate from a $30 million ad campaign across the major battleground states. It hopes the ad will complement news media coverage of Mr. Biden's three-day Pennsylvania visit, which is set to conclude on Thursday in Philadelphia. Winning the state, where he narrowly defeated Mr. Trump in 2020, is crucial to his re-election strategy.\nThe new ad amplifies the argument that Mr. Biden is pursuing against Mr. Trump on the economy, accusing the former president of siding with billionaires over workers. In a speech laying out his tax policy on Tuesday in Scranton, his hometown, Mr. Biden laid into Mr. Trump.\n'He learned the best way to get rich is to inherit it,' Mr. Biden said of his rival.\nMr. Burgess, a Democrat, was a guest of Mr. Biden's at the president's State of the Union address in 2022. He became the first Black mayor of Washington, Pa., last year. The Biden campaign said the ad featuring Mr. Burgess would run during news programs, as well as on regional sports networks.\nThe campaign also released a shorter ad with Mr. Burgess for digital platforms. In that ad, Mr. Burgess defends Mr. Biden against attacks from Mr. Trump and other Republicans on his age and mental fitness.\n'When you meet him, this guy is as sharp as a knife,' Mr. Burgess says of the president. 'They have nothing else to attack because they can't attack the things that he is doing that are so good for this country.'",

            "summary": "Kari Lake, a top ally of Donald J. Trump who is running for a Senate seat in Arizona, called on her supporters on Sunday to arm themselves ahead of an 'intense' period leading up to the election, urging them to 'strap on a Glock,' referring to a brand of firearm.\n'The next six months is going to be intense,' Ms. Lake said during a rally in Lake Havasu City. 'We're going to strap on our seatbelt. We're going to put on our helmet — or your Kari Lake ball cap. We are going to put on the armor of God. And maybe strap on a Glock on the side of us just in case.'\nThe crowd roared its approval, and she continued, 'You can put one here,' gesturing to the side of her hip, 'and one in the back or one in the front. Whatever you guys decide. Because we're not going to be the victims of crime. We're not going to have our Second Amendment taken away. We're certainly not going to have our First Amendment taken away by these tyrants.'\nWhen asked about Ms. Lake's remarks on Tuesday, Alex Nicoll, a representative of the campaign, said that 'Kari Lake is clearly talking about the Second Amendment right for Arizonans to defend themselves.'\nIt is not the first time Ms. Lake has alluded to armed conflict with her and her supporters. Last year, she said: 'If you want to get to President Trump, you are going to have go through me, and you are going to have to go through 75 million Americans just like me. And I'm going to tell you, most of us are card-carrying members of the N.R.A.,' referring to the National Rifle Association. She added, 'That's not a threat — that's a public service announcement.'\nHer voice is just one in a rising chorus of violent, authoritarian or otherwise aggressive political rhetoric from Mr. Trump and his allies. The former president shared a video late last month featuring an image of President Biden, his Democratic rival, hogtied. He has also said that migrants are 'poisoning the blood of our country' and described his political opponents last year as 'vermin' who needed to be 'rooted out.'\nAnd Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, on Monday urged people whose routes were blocked by pro-Palestinian demonstrators to 'take matters into your own hands' and confront the offenders, endorsing the use of physical force against peaceful protesters.",

            "summary": "David H. Pryor, a liberal Democrat who won two terms as governor of Arkansas and three in the United States Senate, and who paved the way for the political rise of his young ally Bill Clinton in an era of changing racial attitudes in the South, died on Saturday at his home in Little Rock. He was 89.\nHis death was announced by his son Mark, himself a former two-term United States senator.\nMr. Pryor was eight years older than Mr. Clinton, and they didn't know each other well until they became accomplished politicians. But they had much in common. They both grew up in segregated small towns in Arkansas, raised by families of modest means and liberal outlook, who resisted pressures to scorn their Black neighbors.\nMr. Pryor's mother played the piano for services in a Black church, cooked meals for Black prisoners in a county jail and, at 56, became a missionary among the descendants of slaves in British Guiana. Mr. Clinton's maternal grandparents, who raised him, ran a small grocery store and during the harsh winters sold goods on credit to people of all races.\nAlong with another white liberal Democrat, Dale Bumpers, Mr. Pryor and Mr. Clinton courted union members and Black voters. All three won their first primary elections for governor against the same notorious segregationist, former Gov. Orval E. Faubus, who had called out the National Guard in 1957 in a futile effort to block the integration of Little Rock High School.\nMr. Pryor, center, with President-elect Bill Clinton and his fellow Arkansas senator Dale Bumpers at the Capitol in January 1993, shortly before Mr. Clinton's inauguration. Credit... Laura Patterson/CQ Roll Call, via Getty Image Attempting comebacks three times, Mr. Faubus lost Democratic primaries to Mr. Bumpers in 1970, Mr. Pryor in 1974 and Mr. Clinton in 1986. In heavily Democratic Arkansas, each man crushed his Republican opponent in the general election. Their governorships became springboards to national prominence — for Mr. Bumpers and Mr. Pryor in the Senate, and for Mr. Clinton in the White House for two terms.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "A broad coalition of the Kennedy family will endorse President Biden on Thursday at a campaign rally in Philadelphia, pointedly rejecting one of their own in Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the independent candidate who many Democrats believe poses a significant threat to Mr. Biden's re-election chances.\nAmong the relatives of Mr. Kennedy expected to back Mr. Biden are his siblings Joseph, Kerry, Rory, Kathleen, Maxwell and Christopher. The Biden campaign released a list of 15 Kennedys set to appear at the rally, but it said other family members would endorse the president as well. Kerry Kennedy will introduce Mr. Biden at the rally, the campaign said, and Joe Kennedy III, Mr. Kennedy's nephew and a former Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, will do so at a second event.\nThe show of force will send the clearest signal yet that America's most storied Democratic family is deeply fearful that one of its own could tip the 2024 election to former President Donald J. Trump, and hopes to use its influence to try to stop him.\nMany family members have previously expressed strong disapproval of Mr. Kennedy's candidacy, voicing anguish about his promotion of conspiracy theories and confusion about why he is challenging a Democratic president they admire. Like many Democrats, they worry that he could help Mr. Trump win if he draws even a small number of votes away from Mr. Biden in the battleground states — contests that were decided by tens of thousands of votes in 2020.\nMr. Trump is likely to remain the main target of attacks at the Philadelphia event, but the symbolic repudiation of Mr. Kennedy will not be subtle.\n'We can say today, with no less urgency, that our rights and freedoms are once again in peril,' Kerry Kennedy is expected to say, according to excerpts from her speech shared by the Biden campaign. 'That is why we all need to come together in a campaign that should unite not only Democrats, but all Americans, including Republicans, and independents, who believe in what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, told CBS that President Biden needed to ensure 'that young people feel included in the conversation, not just as a vote but as part of the governing coalition.' He added, 'I think part of the frustration by young people is that they oftentimes don't feel heard. They feel like their voices and their votes are taken advantage of come election time.' He said he thought Biden had taken steps toward including them. April 21, 2024, 12:15 p.m. ET April 21, 2024, 12:15 p.m. ET Representative Tony Gonzales, a Republican of Texas whose district encompasses a vast swath of the U.S.-Mexico border, delivered a harsh criticism of his hard-right G.O.P. colleagues who voted against the military aid package to U.S. allies, comparing some members with the Ku Klux Klan. 'The way to take out the bully is to bloody their nose,' he said after saying that the days where rank-and-file members were 'kind of easygoing' and 'put their head down' were over. 'The fight is here,' he added. April 21, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET April 21, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a Republican vice-presidential contender who supported federal abortion bans when she was in Congress, told CNN that she didn't anymore because the overturning of Roe v. Wade 'returned the power back to the states.' She then sought to distance herself from her own state's law, which bans abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest, saying it was passed before she became governor. April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET Asked on CNN if Biden should debate Trump, Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Democrat of Illinois, said Biden was 'a terrific debater' but Trump 'lies and lies and lies, and it's so hard to respond to that in the middle of a debate.' He added, 'Do you talk about what you want to do for the future, or do you respond to the lies that have come out of Donald Trump's mouth every minute? So I'm concerned about that, just to be honest with you.' April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a potential vice-presidential pick for Donald Trump, refused to say on CNN whether she would have certified the 2020 election as Mike Pence did on Jan. 6. 'That was the day we hope we never see again,' she said. 'We did not do justice by our country by showing and fighting over that day. We should focus on our freedoms and continue to uphold our Constitution. So talking in hypotheticals is not something that I do.' President Trump's campaign committee ended March with $45 million on hand, up from $33.5 million at the end of February, an improvement as he seeks to close the formidable fund-raising gap with President Biden, whose campaign had $85.5 million. It's not just about donors, though: The Trump campaign's spending has slowed – in March, it spent just $3.7 million, compared with $29.2 million spent by the Biden campaign. Credit... Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a potential vice-presidential pick for former President Donald J. Trump, refused to say on Sunday whether she would have certified the 2020 election if she had been in Vice President Mike Pence's position. She also dodged questions about whether she supported exceptions to abortion bans for rape and incest. 'You can go back and keep talking about Jan. 6, but the fact of the matter is that was a day we hope we never see again here in this country,' Ms. Noem said on CNN. 'We did not do justice by our country by showing and fighting over that day. We should focus on our freedoms and continue to uphold our Constitution. So talking in hypotheticals is not something that I do.' When the interviewer, Dana Bash, pressed her on whether Mr. Pence had been wrong to certify the election results, Ms. Noem again avoided a direct answer, instead criticizing Mr. Pence for denouncing Mr. Trump after Jan. 6. 'I wasn't in Mike Pence's shoes, and the information that he had at that time — I don't know how he based his decisions,' she said. 'I think he's a nice man. I think that he's failed Donald Trump since that day, because he certainly does not recognize that we need someone in the White House who needs him out on the trail advocating for him, instead of constantly criticizing and going back and ripping him apart.' On abortion, Ms. Noem, who supported a federal ban when she was a member of Congress, said she now believed restrictions should be left to individual states. That is the position Mr. Trump took this month, though his allies have developed plans that could functionally ban abortion nationwide without formally doing so. Mr. Trump has also expressed support for rape and incest exceptions, which South Dakota's near-total abortion ban does not include. When asked about that, Ms. Noem tried to distance herself from her own state's law, noting that it was a 'trigger ban' enacted years ago to take effect if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 'The law in my state was passed decades before I ever became governor,' she said, adding: 'That may be a topic that will continue to be discussed in South Dakota. Our law today allows an exception to save the life of the mother, but the people in South Dakota will decide what their laws look like.' She did not give a clear answer when Ms. Bash asked what she believed South Dakota's laws should look like. 'I can have an opinion, and I can weigh forward and I can look at the science and what we've learned about babies in the womb and believe that we should protect life, but I think that our law today is what South Dakota wants,' she said. 'And they'll continue to have that debate, and I'll continue to follow through on my role, which is to make sure the will of the people is enforced.' Ms. Bash repeated her question, and Ms. Noem implied — but did not say outright — that she might oppose a rape and incest exception. 'We have a law that says that there is an exception for the life of the mother, and I just don't believe a tragedy should perpetuate another tragedy,' she said. Versions of that statement are common among people who believe abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape and incest. 'I believe in taking care of mothers that are in a crisis situation and that we should be locking alongside them, giving them all the information and the best information they can make before they have to be put in a situation where an abortion is the only option that they have,' she added. Ms. Noem also echoed Mr. Trump's claims that the criminal charges against him in New York — where his trial began last week — were political, and affirmed that she would support him even if he were convicted of felonies. 'When he was in the White House, every single day as governor, I got to be on offense, I got to solve problems,' she said. 'And since Joe Biden has been in the White House, I just have to defend the freedoms of my people in South Dakota. I'm every day trying to push back on what this federal government is trying to do by increasing costs for the everyday families that get up every day and go to work. So yes, Donald Trump should be back in that White House. I'm going to do all I can to help him win.' Credit... Chris Seward/Associated Press Former President Donald J. Trump's presidential campaign committee ended March with $45 million on hand, federal filings showed Saturday, as he tries to close the fund-raising gap with President Biden. But Mr. Trump's campaign is spending much less than it was at the start of the year, which has helped it inch closer. In March, it spent just $3.7 million, the new filings show, compared with $11.4 million in January — and much less than the $29.2 million spent by Mr. Biden's campaign in March. In other words, Mr. Trump's campaign is guarding resources as it seeks to build a campaign war chest for the general election. This cycle began with the announcement of former President Donald J. Trump's campaign in November 2022 and President Biden's in April 2023. Raised $43.8 $158.5 $15.3 $114.7 Spent $29.2 $74.3 $4 $70.1 Net cash $85.5 — $44.6 — Mr. Biden's campaign had $85.5 million on hand at the end of March, according to its monthly filing with the Federal Election Commission, a significant increase from the month before: He ended February with $71 million in his campaign account while Mr. Trump ended February with less than half that. As Mr. Trump and Republicans chase the Democrats' financial edge, Mr. Biden has also started to narrow the polling gap between himself and Mr. Trump. Since late February, the president has cut a deficit of five percentage points to a single point, a virtual tie, according to a recent survey by The New York Times and Siena College. The rivals each capitalized on splashy fund-raisers in the past month that brought in tens of millions of dollars for their respective campaigns. But Mr. Trump's haul from an April 6 event in Palm Beach, Fla., will be reflected on a future filing. His campaign reported that it and the Republican National Committee raked in more than $50.5 million from the dinner, which was held at the home of the billionaire John Paulson. The total nearly doubled the $26 million that Mr. Biden's campaign said it raised on March 28 at Radio City Music Hall in New York, a star-studded event headlined by the president and two former presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Those funds were included in Mr. Biden's March fund-raising numbers. Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump are primarily raising money though joint fund-raising agreements with their respective parties, arrangements that legally allow them to pull in hundreds of thousands of dollars from individual donors, some of which flows into their campaigns. Joint fund-raising committees for both candidates filed reports with the Federal Election Commission this week, providing the first details of 2024 of major donors to both candidates, and the total scale of their fund-raising haul. But the F.E.C. reports for presidential campaigns, which are filed monthly in election years, offer different insights about candidates' activities and how the committees backing them are spending money. By the end of the 2020 cycle Biden had raised and spent more than $1 billion and Trump more than $700 million dollars. For example, federal law guarantees political campaigns bottom-dollar rates for broadcast advertising, so campaign committees are often used to pay for television time. In the first three months of 2024, Mr. Biden's campaign has spent $45.2 million on media buys and production, filings show — more than half of its total of $74.1 million in spending. The Biden campaign has spent $6.9 million on payroll and related expenses, and an additional $6.9 million on 'text message outreach.' His campaign's spending shot up in March, after two relatively steady months. In contrast, Mr. Trump's campaign spending has slowed sharply since the beginning of the year, when he was still fending off Republican primary challengers. Since Jan. 1, Mr. Trump's campaign has spent $23 million — but just $3.7 million of that was in March. His campaign has paid $6 million for placed media this year, all of it before Super Tuesday. One of Mr. Trump's committees — a leadership PAC called Save America, which he has used to pay his legal bills — reported on Saturday that it had almost $4.1 million on hand at the end of March, roughly the same amount as it had at the end of February. The group spent $5 million in March, including $3.7 million in bills to the legal teams defending him. Mr. Trump's campaign itself also paid about $473,000 in legal expenses. A super PAC backing Mr. Trump, MAGA Inc., reported raising $14.4 million in March, including a $5 million contribution from the former Trump cabinet official Linda McMahon and $4.2 million from Robert T. Bigelow, an aerospace and real estate mogul. The group also transferred $5 million to Save America — part of a huge refund of money from the super PAC to the committee over the past year. With national polls consistently suggesting that the rematch between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden could hinge on a few states or a single one, that has magnified the candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running as an independent. It has also drawn attention to how the liberal scion is paying for his campaign and what he is spending money on, including for ballot access and security. His selection of Nicole Shanahan, a wealthy Silicon Valley lawyer and investor, as his running mate already appears to have become a boon for his campaign. Of the $5.4 million that Mr. Kennedy raised in March, $2 million came from Ms. Shanahan, who until last year was married to the Google co-founder Sergey Brin. A correction was made on : An earlier version of this story misstated the total amount MAGA Inc. raised in March. It was $14.4 million, not $9.4 million. The lower figure inaccurately took into account a $5 million transfer from the group to another Trump committee. How we handle corrections Credit... Travis Dove for The New York Times After former President Donald J. Trump sat in a courtroom in New York for much of the last week, Saturday night was supposed to herald a return to the campaign trail and the large rallies where he often gives long, freewheeling speeches. With thousands gathered on the tarmac at an airport in Wilmington, N.C., Mr. Trump's campaign was building anticipation. Two hours before he was set to speak, the campaign sent a fund-raising blast with a message from Mr. Trump: 'They can't keep me off stage! Did they think I would run and hide?' Ninety minutes later, the skies darkened to charcoal and lightning flashed. As thunderstorms swept toward the area and the National Weather Service issued watches and warnings concerning dangerous winds and hail, the rally was canceled over safety concerns. 'We'll make up for this very quickly at another time,' Mr. Trump said on a call he made into the rally that was broadcast over the speakers. 'We'll do it as quick as possible. I'm devastated that this could happen.' But the cancellation, which Mr. Trump indicated was out of his hands, highlights the challenges that he may face as he tries to balance his presidential campaign with a criminal trial that will keep him busy through May. For much of the last week, Mr. Trump's public comments had been limited to social media posts and remarks to reporters outside the courtroom. His only campaign stop was at a bodega in New York City, in a state he overwhelmingly lost in the last two elections and that is not expected to be in play in November. Saturday's rally was expected to serve as a preview of the upcoming weeks, with Mr. Trump traveling on weekends to campaign in battleground states that are more central to his efforts to return to the White House. He has repeatedly claimed that the trial is preventing him from campaigning in places like North Carolina, which he won in 2016 and 2020, but where Democrats are making a big push in November. Opening arguments are slated to start on Monday, and the trial is set to last six to eight weeks. As is often the case with Mr. Trump's rallies, the crowds began lining up hours ahead of his expected remarks. Among those gathered outside was a group wearing shirts with the logo of the Proud Boys, a prominent far-right extremist group. One person held a sign that read 'Free All of the J6 Prisoners,' a reference to those serving sentences in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Mr. Trump, who faces four criminal indictments that include charges tied to his efforts to overturn his election loss, has recently embraced dozens of Jan. 6 defendants. He has called them 'hostages' and has said he would consider pardoning them. In a statement, Ammar Moussa, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, criticized the group's presence, pointing to remarks Mr. Trump made in a debate in 2020, in which he told the Proud Boys to 'stand back and stand by.' 'This is Donald Trump's America: where white nationalists and violent far-right extremists are empowered and working families are left behind,' Mr. Moussa wrote. Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, responded in a statement, 'We don't comment on stupid.' Mr. Trump's remarks were expected to face particular scrutiny given that he is under a gag order in his criminal trial that bans him from attacking witnesses, prosecutors, jurors and court staff, as well as their relatives and relatives of the judge. Prosecutors have said Mr. Trump has violated the gag order seven times, and there is a hearing about the issue on Tuesday. Mr. Trump did travel to North Carolina earlier in the day, attending a fund-raiser in Charlotte in the afternoon. When he called into the rally, he told the attendees that he was minutes away from 'flying in' to Wilmington but that the authorities 'would prefer that we not come in' over safety concerns. 'I'm so sorry,' Mr. Trump said. 'But we'll do it again, and we'll do it bigger and better. You have my promise.' As the crowd left to seek shelter in their cars, vendors outside were still selling an array of merchandise, some of which had been created specifically for the occasion. One T-shirt promoted what it called the Wilmington stop on Mr. Trump's 'Save America' tour. 'I was there!' The shirt read. 'Where were you???'

Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, told CBS that President Biden needed to ensure 'that young people feel included in the conversation, not just as a vote but as part of the governing coalition.' He added, 'I think part of the frustration by young people is that they oftentimes don't feel heard. They feel like their voices and their votes are taken advantage of come election time.' He said he thought Biden had taken steps toward including them.\nApril 21, 2024, 12:15 p.m. ET April 21, 2024, 12:15 p.m. ET Representative Tony Gonzales, a Republican of Texas whose district encompasses a vast swath of the U.S.-Mexico border, delivered a harsh criticism of his hard-right G.O.P. colleagues who voted against the military aid package to U.S. allies, comparing some members with the Ku Klux Klan. 'The way to take out the bully is to bloody their nose,' he said after saying that the days where rank-and-file members were 'kind of easygoing' and 'put their head down' were over. 'The fight is here,' he added.\nApril 21, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET April 21, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a Republican vice-presidential contender who supported federal abortion bans when she was in Congress, told CNN that she didn't anymore because the overturning of Roe v. Wade 'returned the power back to the states.' She then sought to distance herself from her own state's law, which bans abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest, saying it was passed before she became governor.\nApril 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET Asked on CNN if Biden should debate Trump, Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Democrat of Illinois, said Biden was 'a terrific debater' but Trump 'lies and lies and lies, and it's so hard to respond to that in the middle of a debate.' He added, 'Do you talk about what you want to do for the future, or do you respond to the lies that have come out of Donald Trump's mouth every minute? So I'm concerned about that, just to be honest with you.'\nApril 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a potential vice-presidential pick for Donald Trump, refused to say on CNN whether she would have certified the 2020 election as Mike Pence did on Jan. 6. 'That was the day we hope we never see again,' she said. 'We did not do justice by our country by showing and fighting over that day. We should focus on our freedoms and continue to uphold our Constitution. So talking in hypotheticals is not something that I do.'\nPresident Trump's campaign committee ended March with $45 million on hand, up from $33.5 million at the end of February, an improvement as he seeks to close the formidable fund-raising gap with President Biden, whose campaign had $85.5 million. It's not just about donors, though: The Trump campaign's spending has slowed – in March, it spent just $3.7 million, compared with $29.2 million spent by the Biden campaign.\nCredit... Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a potential vice-presidential pick for former President Donald J. Trump, refused to say on Sunday whether she would have certified the 2020 election if she had been in Vice President Mike Pence's position. She also dodged questions about whether she supported exceptions to abortion bans for rape and incest.\n'You can go back and keep talking about Jan. 6, but the fact of the matter is that was a day we hope we never see again here in this country,' Ms. Noem said on CNN. 'We did not do justice by our country by showing and fighting over that day. We should focus on our freedoms and continue to uphold our Constitution. So talking in hypotheticals is not something that I do.'\nWhen the interviewer, Dana Bash, pressed her on whether Mr. Pence had been wrong to certify the election results, Ms. Noem again avoided a direct answer, instead criticizing Mr. Pence for denouncing Mr. Trump after Jan. 6.\n'I wasn't in Mike Pence's shoes, and the information that he had at that time — I don't know how he based his decisions,' she said. 'I think he's a nice man. I think that he's failed Donald Trump since that day, because he certainly does not recognize that we need someone in the White House who needs him out on the trail advocating for him, instead of constantly criticizing and going back and ripping him apart.'\nOn abortion, Ms. Noem, who supported a federal ban when she was a member of Congress, said she now believed restrictions should be left to individual states. That is the position Mr. Trump took this month, though his allies have developed plans that could functionally ban abortion nationwide without formally doing so.\nMr. Trump has also expressed support for rape and incest exceptions, which South Dakota's near-total abortion ban does not include. When asked about that, Ms. Noem tried to distance herself from her own state's law, noting that it was a 'trigger ban' enacted years ago to take effect if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n'The law in my state was passed decades before I ever became governor,' she said, adding: 'That may be a topic that will continue to be discussed in South Dakota. Our law today allows an exception to save the life of the mother, but the people in South Dakota will decide what their laws look like.'\nShe did not give a clear answer when Ms. Bash asked what she believed South Dakota's laws should look like.\n'I can have an opinion, and I can weigh forward and I can look at the science and what we've learned about babies in the womb and believe that we should protect life, but I think that our law today is what South Dakota wants,' she said. 'And they'll continue to have that debate, and I'll continue to follow through on my role, which is to make sure the will of the people is enforced.'\nMs. Bash repeated her question, and Ms. Noem implied — but did not say outright — that she might oppose a rape and incest exception.\n'We have a law that says that there is an exception for the life of the mother, and I just don't believe a tragedy should perpetuate another tragedy,' she said. Versions of that statement are common among people who believe abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape and incest.\n'I believe in taking care of mothers that are in a crisis situation and that we should be locking alongside them, giving them all the information and the best information they can make before they have to be put in a situation where an abortion is the only option that they have,' she added.\nMs. Noem also echoed Mr. Trump's claims that the criminal charges against him in New York — where his trial began last week — were political, and affirmed that she would support him even if he were convicted of felonies.\n'When he was in the White House, every single day as governor, I got to be on offense, I got to solve problems,' she said. 'And since Joe Biden has been in the White House, I just have to defend the freedoms of my people in South Dakota. I'm every day trying to push back on what this federal government is trying to do by increasing costs for the everyday families that get up every day and go to work. So yes, Donald Trump should be back in that White House. I'm going to do all I can to help him win.'\nCredit... Chris Seward/Associated Press Former President Donald J. Trump's presidential campaign committee ended March with $45 million on hand, federal filings showed Saturday, as he tries to close the fund-raising gap with President Biden.\nBut Mr. Trump's campaign is spending much less than it was at the start of the year, which has helped it inch closer. In March, it spent just $3.7 million, the new filings show, compared with $11.4 million in January — and much less than the $29.2 million spent by Mr. Biden's campaign in March. In other words, Mr. Trump's campaign is guarding resources as it seeks to build a campaign war chest for the general election.\nThis cycle began with the announcement of former President Donald J. Trump's campaign in November 2022 and President Biden's in April 2023.\nRaised $43.8 $158.5 $15.3 $114.7 Spent $29.2 $74.3 $4 $70.1 Net cash $85.5 — $44.6 — Mr. Biden's campaign had $85.5 million on hand at the end of March, according to its monthly filing with the Federal Election Commission, a significant increase from the month before: He ended February with $71 million in his campaign account while Mr. Trump ended February with less than half that.\nAs Mr. Trump and Republicans chase the Democrats' financial edge, Mr. Biden has also started to narrow the polling gap between himself and Mr. Trump. Since late February, the president has cut a deficit of five percentage points to a single point, a virtual tie, according to a recent survey by The New York Times and Siena College.\nThe rivals each capitalized on splashy fund-raisers in the past month that brought in tens of millions of dollars for their respective campaigns. But Mr. Trump's haul from an April 6 event in Palm Beach, Fla., will be reflected on a future filing. His campaign reported that it and the Republican National Committee raked in more than $50.5 million from the dinner, which was held at the home of the billionaire John Paulson.\nThe total nearly doubled the $26 million that Mr. Biden's campaign said it raised on March 28 at Radio City Music Hall in New York, a star-studded event headlined by the president and two former presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.

            "summary": "The House on Saturday was heading toward passage of a $95 billion foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, as Speaker Mike Johnson put his job on the line to advance the long-stalled legislation in defiance against hard-liners his own party.\nLawmakers were expected on Saturday afternoon to vote separately on aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, as well as on another bill that includes a measure that could result in a nationwide ban of TikTok and new sanctions on Iran. The fourth bill was meant to sweeten the deal for conservatives.\nMr. Johnson structured the measures, which will be melded together into one after each piece is approved, to capture different coalitions of support without allowing opposition to any one element to sink the whole deal. Each of the aid bills for the three nations is expected to pass overwhelmingly, and the Senate is expected to take it up quickly and send the legislation to President Biden's desk, capping its tortured path to enactment.\nThe legislation includes $60 billion for Kyiv; $26 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza; and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific. It would direct the president to seek repayment from the Ukrainian government of $10 billion in economic assistance, a stipulation supported by former President Donald J. Trump, who has pushed for any aid to Ukraine to be in the form of a loan. But the legislation also would allow the president to forgive those loans starting in 2026.\nThe scene that is expected to play out on the House floor on Saturday will reflect both the broad bipartisan support in Congress for continuing to help the Ukrainian military beat back Russian forces, and the extraordinary political risk taken by Mr. Johnson to defy the anti-interventionist wing of his party who had blocked the measure for months. In the end, the speaker, himself an ultraconservative who had previously voted against funding Ukraine's war effort, circumvented his right flank and was relying on Democrats to push the measure through.\nFor months, it was uncertain whether Congress would approve another round of funding for Ukraine, even as the momentum of the war in Ukraine shifted in Russia's favor. Republicans dug in against another aid package for Kyiv unless President Biden agreed to stringent anti-immigration measures, and then refused to take up legislation that paired the aid with stiffer border enforcement provisions.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Several Columbia faculty members — and particularly their apparent pro-Palestinian stances — were in the spotlight at Wednesday's hearing.\nOne of the professors, the focus of Representative Tim Walberg's questioning, was Joseph Andoni Massad. Dr. Massad, who is of Palestinian Christian descent, teaches modern Arab politics and intellectual history at Columbia, where he also received his Ph.D. in political science.\nLong known for his anti-Israel positions, he published a controversial article in The Electronic Intifada last October, in the wake of the Hamas attack, describing it as a 'resistance offensive' staged in retaliation to Israel's settler-colonies near the Gaza border.\nThe piece drew a visceral response and demands for his dismissal in a petition by a Columbia student that was signed by tens of thousands of people. The petition specifically criticized Dr. Massad's use of the word 'awesome' to describe the scene of the attack.\nDr. Massad's posture has drawn controversy for years. When he was awarded tenure in 2009, 14 Columbia professors expressed their concern in a letter to the provost. Generally, professors with tenure face a much higher bar for termination than those without the status.\nMore recently, however, professors nationally have rallied to support him, emphasizing his academic right to voice his opinion.\nIn testimony responding to questions from Mr. Walberg, a Michigan Republican, Columbia's President, Nemat Shafik, disclosed that Dr. Massad had since been removed from a leadership role at the university, where he headed an academic review panel.\nKatherine Franke, a law professor at Columbia, was also mentioned in the hearing for her activist role and a comment that 'all Israeli students who served in the I.D.F. are dangerous and shouldn't be on campus,' referring to the Israel Defense Forces.\nMs. Franke recently wrote a piece in The Nation raising questions about academic freedom at Columbia, where she has taught since 1999.\nDr. Shafik, who goes by Minouche, said Professors Massad and Franke were 'under investigation for discriminatory remarks.'\nMohamed Abdou was also named in the hearing. Dr. Abdou was hired as a visiting scholar for the Spring 2024 term, and was teaching a course called 'Decolonial-Queerness and Abolition.'\nA biography on Columbia's website describes Dr. Abdou as 'a North African-Egyptian Muslim anarchist interdisciplinary activist-scholar of Indigenous, Black, critical race and Islamic studies, as well as gender, sexuality, abolition and decolonization.'\nRepresentative Elise Stefanik asked why he was hired even after his social media post on Oct. 11 that read, 'I'm with Hamas & Hezbollah & Islamic Jihad.' Dr. Shafik said, 'He will never work at Columbia again.'",

            "summary": "Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Tuesday announced a new partnership with more than a dozen state attorneys general to investigate consumer complaints against airlines.\nThe partnership sets up a process for state attorney general's offices to review complaints from travelers and then pass the baton to the federal Transportation Department, which could take enforcement action against airlines.\n'The support that's being offered by state attorney general's offices means that our capacity to protect airline passengers is expanding,' Mr. Buttigieg said at Denver International Airport, where he appeared with Colorado's attorney general, Phil Weiser, a Democrat who is among those joining the partnership.\nThe federal-state initiative is Mr. Buttigieg's latest step aimed at improving protections for air travelers and ensuring that airlines are held accountable when they err. The Transportation Department has issued more than $164 million in penalties against airlines during his tenure, according to the agency. Mr. Buttigieg has also pressed airlines to seat children with their parents for free and to improve the services they offer to travelers who experience lengthy delays or cancellations.\nThe Transportation Department said attorneys general from 15 states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin — had signed agreements to be part of the partnership.\nThe attorneys general from the District of Columbia, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands also have joined, the department said, bringing the total number involved to 18. Of those, 16 are Democrats and two are Republicans.\nUnder federal law, states are generally barred from enforcing their own consumer protection laws against airlines. State attorneys general have pushed for federal legislation that would empower them to take action against airlines, just as they can against companies in other industries.\nThe new partnership does not grant them that power. Instead, their offices would investigate complaints from travelers, and if they determine that federal consumer protection rules may have been violated, they could refer the matter to the Transportation Department under a fast-track process. The federal agency would then review the complaint and could take enforcement action.\n'The ideal world would be one where states are given formal authority to enforce consumer protection law alongside the Department of Transportation,' Mr. Weiser said. 'Congress has failed to act on that thus far, but we are not waiting for action.'\nIn a statement, Airlines for America, a trade group representing the country's largest air carriers, said it regularly worked with the Transportation Department and state attorneys general to improve the flying experience for travelers.\n'We appreciate the role of state attorneys general and their work on behalf of consumers,' the group said, adding that it looked forward to continuing to work with them.",

And the lawyers representing him in his criminal trial in Manhattan showed themselves to be savvy at using it during jury selection this week to try to get some prospective jurors dismissed.\nMr. Trump's defense lawyers, Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles, managed to dig up old social media posts by a number of prospective jurors that attacked the former president, creating fascinating exchanges with people who had to explain, under oath, comments that were often years-old.\nWhile Mr. Trump's team succeeded in getting some prospective jurors removed, Day 3 of jury selection ended on Thursday with a full panel of 12 jurors in the case, which could move to opening arguments on Monday.\nIn one lengthy exchange on Thursday, Ms. Necheles highlighted a series of posts by a woman that were highly critical of Mr. Trump and the Republican Party, leading the woman to apologize in court in front of the former president.\nIn posts written over a span of years, Ms. Necheles said, the woman suggested that Mr. Trump was a liar, that the GOP was a cult and that the former president 'is an anathema' to everything she knows. The defense lawyers sought to have her removed, and the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, asked her about the posts.\nThe woman read aloud one of them, which called Mr. Trump racist, sexist and narcissist. She stopped reading — 'Oops. That sounds bad,' she said and apologized.\nJustice Merchan dismissed the woman for cause, a victory for Mr. Trump's lawyers who also had several prospective jurors removed during jury selection on Tuesday over their social media posts.\nBoth the defense lawyers and prosecutors started jury selection on Monday with 10 opportunities each to strike a prospective juror from the trial without explanation, in what is known a peremptory challenge. By Thursday, Mr. Trump's legal team only had four opportunities remaining.\nWhen the team asked prospective jurors about their posts, some of them defended their posts by arguing they were reposts, a tactic also used by Mr. Trump to deflect criticism of some of his online comments.\ndefended their posts by arguing they were reposts, a tactic also used by Mr. Trump to deflect criticism of some of his online comments. On Tuesday, Mr. Blanche asked a woman about a video she posted on Facebook of people celebrating the results of the 2020 presidential election, when Mr. Trump lost to Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n'I very, very strongly believe that regardless of my thoughts about anyone or anything or political feelings or convictions, that the job of a juror is to understand the facts of the trial and to be the judge of those facts,' the woman said.\nWhile she was responding to Mr. Blanche, Mr. Trump began to mutter and gesture — which caught the attention of the judge. 'I won't tolerate that,' Justice Merchan said, before saying that he found that the woman could be fair and denying the defense's request to dismiss her for cause.",

            "excerpt": "Despite a juicy premise, this Colt Coeur production, starring Tim Daly and Jayne Atkinson, never manages to take off.",
            "summary": "In her essay 'The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction,' the novelist Ursula K. Le Guin hymned the bag as the proper shape for stories: it 'is full of beginnings without ends, of initiations, of losses, of transformations and translations, and far more tricks than conflicts.'\nOne of the characters in Lia Romeo's 'Still,' a writer, carries just such a bag — a possible wink to her fellow novelist. The tote is large enough to house a ukulele, an avocado and a package of macadamia nuts — all of which are divulged in the play's single moment of spontaneity — but its owner can't seem to effect any Le Guinian 'transformations' or 'tricks.' There is a sense of stasis to the aptly named two-hander, which never ripens from a situation into a story.\n'Still,' a Colt Coeur production that opened recently at DR2 Theater in the East Village, begins with two characters, former flames, meeting in a bar. Mark (a suave Tim Daly) and Helen (Jayne Atkinson) are in their mid-60s and haven't seen each other in years. Sharing a bottle of wine, they shoot the breeze about their children and recent divorce (him) and new book and cancer diagnosis (her).\nAt first, they are content to pretend their past romance has subsided into a platonic relationship, but as the alcohol goes to their heads, they admit to carrying a torch for each other. A highlight of the show is their seduction scene: It's the first I've seen onstage that unabashedly invokes the corporeal indignities of aging. The director Adrienne Campbell-Holt has Mark and Helen walk slowly toward each other while making sotto voce confessions: 'I'm missing the nail on my right big toe,' 'I have three fake teeth,' 'I have arthritis in my knees.' Do I need to spell out what happens next?\nAlexander Woodward's softly lit set spins to reveal a hotel room. Resting against each other in bed, Mark and Helen proceed, post-coitally this time, with their confessions. Mark, who lives in Colorado, is considering relocating to Washington, D.C., to run for Congress, as a 'moderate' Republican. 'I wish you'd told me that before we ——' Helen says, gesturing limply to the bed with rumpled sheets. She considers herself a liberal, but political differences aren't the only thing on her mind.\nPart of the reason their relationship ended was because she had an abortion. Despite what Mark told her decades ago, he wanted Helen to have the baby. She, on the other hand, had felt — and still feels — that it would have been a mistake. 'When we walked out of that clinic, I was — scraped out, and I was sad. But I felt so light, knowing that … all my cells were my own again,' she tells him. The stage is thus set for a real conflict.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index Donald J. Trump's lawyers faced an uphill battle Monday with Justice Juan M. Merchan, a no-nonsense jurist. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab courtroom in New York City while Mr. Trump looked on. Mr. Trump was charged in Manhattan, a deeply Democratic county and his former home, with falsifying nearly three dozen business records in an attempt to cover up a payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, who has said she had a brief sexual encounter with him in 2006. Mr. Trump denies that encounter happened, and has declared his innocence, calling the charges politically motivated. He has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a Democrat, who also attended the first day of trial on Monday. Mr. Trump faces 34 felony counts and could face probation or up to four years of prison time. The trial, which is expected to last weeks, has a fascinating list of potential witnesses: Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer turned apostate, who made the payment; Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who says she, too, had an affair with Mr. Trump; and Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels herself may testify. Before any of that happens, a jury must be selected, a winnowing that began Monday. Here are five takeaways from Mr. Trump's first day on trial: Justice Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, has been consistent about batting back defense motions on issues including the tardy disclosure of documents by prosecutors and efforts to delay or even dismiss the case. That pattern continued on Monday, as Justice Merchan rejected a defense effort to force his recusal. The defense had cited several issues, including the fact that his daughter is a Democratic political consultant. He also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost. But Mr. Trump's lawyers convinced Justice Merchan that sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the so-called Access Hollywood tape, in which Mr. Trump was caught bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial, calling them 'complete rumors, complete gossip, completely hearsay.' Justice Merchan's decisions on Monday made it clear that the trial will resurface unsavory events in the former president's life. Those include the Access Hollywood tape and other stories that Mr. Trump sought to suppress including an alleged affair with Ms. McDougal. Justice Merchan said on Monday that both could be discussed. In a minor victory for the defense, the judge reaffirmed that the 'Access Hollywood' tape itself could not be played, but that Trump's exact words could be entered into the record. Still, most of Mr. Merchan's rulings indicated that salacious details of Mr. Trump's biography will be heard in court. Entering the courtroom, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here.' Once he was in front of Mr. Merchan, Mr. Trump looked a lot less enthusiastic. He slouched. He scowled. He scoffed. And he was quiet, not the norm for a man who built a political career with his gift for slashing attacks and vicious put-downs. In court, the former president spoke only briefly, when asked a few questions by Justice Merchan about procedural matters, and whether he understood the consequences — ejection or jail — if he interrupted proceedings. He did whisper with his lawyers. And when the prosecution played a recording of him claiming to have great respect for women, he mouthed the word 'true.' But all in all, it seems it could be an exhausting experience for Mr. Trump; at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep. It's easy to forget how long it takes to do a little in legal settings. On Monday, the morning session was dominated by maneuvering by prosecutors and the defense, even as prospective jurors waited. By lunch, they were still waiting. Jury selection could take days or weeks, and the trial itself may take two months. The Passover holiday could cause delays, Justice Merchan said, though he might make some of that up by holding hearings on court matters on Wednesdays, which was previously going to be an off day. By afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into Justice Merchan's courtroom. He warmly welcomed them, introduced the lawyers and Mr. Trump and read them a summary of the case. Justice Merchan asked if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president. Of the 96 prospective jurors in the room at that time, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused. The remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial. April 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET Trump spoke briefly to TV cameras after court adjourned for the day, repeating his longstanding claims that the trial is a 'political witch hunt' before heading to his motorcade and departing the courthouse. Video Reporter: [inaudible] the trial — [inaudible] So thank you very much. We had some amazing things happen today. As you know, my son is graduating from high school and it looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation of my son, who's worked very, very hard. He's a great student and he's very proud of the fact that he did so well. And was looking forward for years to have his graduation with his mother and father there. And it looks like the judges isn't going to allow me to escape this scam. It's a scam trial. If you read all of the legal pundits, all of the legal scholars today, there's not one that I see that said, this is a case that should be brought or tried. It's a scam. It's a political witch hunt.

DavidAs former President Donald J. Trump's first criminal trial began inside a Manhattan courthouse on Monday, the scene outside had elements of a feisty political skirmish and a surreal circus rolled into one. The streets below the courtroom drew a mix of gawkers, activists and publicity hounds, along with a large contingent of journalists. Laura Loomer, a right-wing activist known for her aggressive tactics and closeness with Mr. Trump, led a chant of 'Donald Trump Did Nothing Wrong!' alongside Andrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and Trump lawyer. 'We're going to be here every single day talking to all you fake-news media freaks,' Ms. Loomer said through a Harvey Milk-style bullhorn in a video she posted on social media. 'And letting you know that Donald Trump did nothing wrong until you start reporting the truth.' Ms. Loomer described the case as a 'witch hunt' — a frequent assertion of Mr. Trump's — and criticized a key witness for the prosecution, Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, and the wife of the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan. Mr. Trump promptly reposted the video on Truth Social — despite a gag order that bars him from attacking witnesses in the case or Justice Merchan's family. His post, made during the lunch break, came shortly before Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month on prosecutors' request that Mr. Trump be held in contempt of court over statements they say violate the order. Performance artists also vied for attention. One, known as Crackhead Barney, stood screaming outside the gates surrounding Collect Pond Park that she had been kicked out, and demanded police officers' badge numbers. Another played the flute atop a park bench, notes drifting through the wind and his instrument glinting in the sunlight. Some anti-Trump demonstrators held handmade signs emblazoned with 'Loser' and 'Convict Trump Already,' while others tried to confront Ms. Loomer. One, Sue Scarlett Montgomery, asked reporters why they were paying attention to Ms. Loomer, a former Republican candidate for Congress who previously visited a treacherous migrant crossing in Panama as part of her anti-Muslim activism. 'They're covering me because I broke the story about this corrupt judge here,' Ms. Loomer shot back, attacking Judge Merchan's daughter, a Democratic political consultant who has also been a target of Mr. Trump.

Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Everyone expected that picking a jury to try a polarizing figure like former President Donald J. Trump was going to be a challenge. But the experience of the first round of about 100 potential panelists gave a flavor of just how difficult the process could be: More than half told the judge that they could not hear the case against Mr. Trump fairly and were immediately excused. Justice Juan M. Merchan, who is presiding over the case, read aloud to the prospective jurors a list of people who might serve as witnesses or be mentioned during the trial, asking them whether they recognized the names. Many of those names were indeed very recognizable. Among those who could come up during the trial were Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump's former adviser, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and one of Mr. Trump's lawyers. Several of Mr. Trump's relatives were also on the list, including his wife, Melania, his older daughter, Ivanka, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner.  April 15, 2024, 3:28 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:28 p.m. ET The first prospective juror is a young woman of color with a business degree who reads The New York Times and watches CNN. She seemed unbothered by the need to be fair and impartial and answered questions rapidly and almost nonchalantly. April 15, 2024, 3:45 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:45 p.m. ET The second prospective juror is a white creative director with glasses who lives in Midtown. Also a Times reader (thank you prospective juror). He did not answer with any surprises. When we start to get different answers to the final series of questions — which are more political and some of which concern Trump — is when we'll get something a little more interesting. April 15, 2024, 3:46 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:46 p.m. ET The third prospective juror, asked about her hobbies, said she likes to 'go to the club.' She said it in a playful voice, prompting a big laugh from reporters in the overflow room. April 15, 2024, 3:27 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:27 p.m. ET One thing that is striking: Trump has used the previous court appearances in other cases to project an image of grandeur. That is hard to do in this dingy courtroom, which smells slightly off and where he is an island amid a sea of people. April 15, 2024, 3:25 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:25 p.m. ET Prospective jurors who have not indicated that they wish to be dismissed are now being seated to answer the 42 questions that lawyers have agreed upon. They are being seated by jury identification number. April 15, 2024, 3:26 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:26 p.m. ET Trump is reading along with the juror questionnaire as the first possible juror, a young woman, ticks through her answers. April 15, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET Of the 96 possible jurors brought into the room, more than 50 raised their hands to say they couldn't be fair. They were immediately excused. April 15, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET Trump turned and stared at possible jurors as they raised their hands indicating they couldn't be fair in the case. April 15, 2024, 3:12 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:12 p.m. ET It's remarkable that more than half of the potential jurors brought in for a first round of questioning immediately said they could not hear Trump's case fairly. We knew that it would be hard to pick a jury, but a fail rate of 50 percent or higher right out of the gate is surpassingly rare.  April 15, 2024, 3:05 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:05 p.m. ET Among the notable names that the judge just read out as potential witnesses or people who could come up were Stephen K. Bannon, Rudy Giuliani, Melania Trump and Jared Kushner. Not all will appear as witnesses or even potentially be mentioned. But it certainly gives jurors a sense of the cast of characters.  The jury selection process in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan could take two weeks or more. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Lawyers representing the State of New York and Donald J. Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate. The potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair. The process could take two weeks or more — and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court. 'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.' The stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County — Manhattan, as most people know it — which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020. Mr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated. Prosecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28. Unlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.' Some may not be completely forthcoming. 'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said. Mr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors. 'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'     Former President Donald J. Trump smirked and scoffed during pretrial proceedings on Monday in Manhattan. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Former President Donald J. Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted Monday morning, as his lawyers and prosecutors hashed out pretrial motions before jury selection in his criminal case. Even as a judge was hearing arguments on last-minute issues in a criminal case that centers on salacious allegations and threatens to upend his bid for the presidency, Mr. Trump appeared to nod off a few times, his mouth going slack and his head drooping onto his chest. The former president's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, passed him notes for several minutes before Mr. Trump appeared to jolt awake and notice them. At other times, Mr. Trump whispered and exchanged notes with Mr. Blanche. He sat motionless while his own words from the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape — on which bragged about grabbing women's genitals — were read from a transcript by a prosecutor. At times, Mr. Trump's emotions were characteristically on display. He smirked and scoffed, and appeared frustrated when the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, did not immediately agree that he could miss court to attend the graduation of his youngest son, Barron. But when Justice Merchan warned that Mr. Trump could be ejected or thrown in jail if he disrupts the proceedings, the former president indicated that he understood. The only time Mr. Trump showed a flash of humor was when he laughed at one of his own social media posts, which attacked his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be the prosecution's central witness.  Former President Donald J. Trump's comments on the 'Access Hollywood' tape will allowed to be introduced as evidence. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times The judge in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial on Monday again refused to allow the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape to be played for jurors, but said that the comments Mr. Trump made on the tape could be introduced as evidence. On the tape, revealed in The Washington Post about a month before Mr. Trump was elected president in 2016, he is heard bragging about grabbing women's genitals, saying he could do so with abandon because 'when you're a star, they let you do it.' 'You can do anything,' Mr. Trump said on the recording. The tape rocked Mr. Trump's campaign. And prosecutors in Manhattan say it led him to agree to pay off Stormy Daniels, a porn star, who was shopping a story of a 2006 sexual encounter with the candidate. Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, paid Ms. Daniels $130,000. The payment is at the heart of the 34 felony charges against Mr. Trump, who is accused of falsifying business records to cover it up. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, had previously ruled that prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office could question witnesses about the tape, but found that it would be prejudicial to allow the actual video to the played. He reaffirmed that ruling on Monday. 'You can bring out what was said in the tape,' Justice Merchan said, adding that he didn't want jurors 'to hear Mr. Trump's voice and his gestures' in the tape. In a victory for the defense, the judge also ruled that the prosecution could not introduce evidence about sexual assault allegations against Mr. Trump that surfaced in the aftermath of the tape becoming public, calling them 'complete hearsay.' However, Justice Merchan said that prosecutors could introduce emails that followed the tape's disclosure, showing frantic efforts by Trump advisers to contain the fallout. The correspondence, he said, 'bolsters the people's claim that this was a crucial event.' Todd Blanche, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, had called on Justice Merchan to reconsider admitting 'this extremely salacious evidence,' which he described as 'very prejudicial.' Mr. Trump, who is again the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has denied any wrongdoing and has cast the case against him as politically motivated. Justice Juan M. Merchan has already reprimanded Donald J. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Inside a dreary Lower Manhattan courtroom on a recent Wednesday, Justice Juan M. Merchan convened a special session for people with mental health troubles who had landed in legal jeopardy. He calmly counseled them, praised any signs of progress and shook the hand of one man who, thanks to medication, had turned his life around. But a different type of criminal defendant is now testing the judge's equanimity: Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump's trial on charges that he covered up a sex scandal before and after the 2016 presidential election will bring a maelstrom that no other judge in New York's vast judiciary has ever experienced. Known as a no-nonsense, drama-averse jurist, Justice Merchan, 61, has already reprimanded Mr. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous and issued a gag order intended to protect prosecutors, witnesses and his own family from Mr. Trump's vitriol — and yet the former president has continued to post articles with pictures of the judge's daughter, a political consultant who has worked with Democratic candidates. Although Justice Merchan is a registered Democrat, records show he was previously a Republican, and people who know him described the judge as a moderate, law-and-order former prosecutor. Two people close to Justice Merchan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the judge had privately expressed pain over the attacks on his daughter, but the people said that those attacks won't compromise his ability to oversee the case. Other people who know the judge said that he will cast aside Mr. Trump's drama — and exert control over the trial. 'It is Judge Merchan's show,' said Jill Konviser, a retired judge who has known Justice Merchan for more than 15 years. She added: 'He will do everything he can to, one, control his courtroom and two, ensure a fair trial for the defendant.' In Justice Merchan's 17 years on the bench, 13 as presiding judge in the Mental Health Court he created, he has had his share of unusual cases. There was a murder trial involving a supposed curse on the defendant; the daredevils who jumped off the World Trade Center with parachutes; and a so-called soccer-mom madam accused of running a high-end brothel on the Upper East Side. In that case, an appeals court reduced the steep bail Justice Merchan had set, calling it 'unreasonable.' None of those defendants challenged the judge quite like Mr. Trump, who claims that the case is a witch hunt and declared that Justice Merchan's gag order had infringed on his First Amendment rights. The former president has tested the order's limits by posting articles that named and attacked Justice Merchan's daughter, Loren, and his wife, Lara. The articles, by the conservative activist Laura Loomer, included photos of Loren Merchan and copies of a 2007 mortgage statement for a house owned by Justice Merchan and his wife. Previously, Mr. Trump falsely accused Loren Merchan of posting an image of him behind bars on social media. The trial, which could last two months as a parade of former aides and allies takes the stand against him, will dominate Justice Merchan's calendar this spring. On off-days, he will continue to preside over Mental Health Court. The program is for defendants charged with felonies and diagnosed with a serious mental illness. People who are accepted enter a guilty plea and then begin a period of treatment and judicial supervision. Those who complete the program successfully can have their charges reduced or dismissed. During one recent session, Justice Merchan showed particular interest in the relationship between a defendant and his child, and praised him for his dedication. 'You want to do better by your daughter,' Justice Merchan said. 'I'm sure she's going to appreciate that.'  Donald J. Trump has repeatedly tried to have Juan M. Merchan removed as the judge in his case. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Juan M. Merchan, the judge overseeing Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan, has declined to step aside from the case, rejecting the former president's effort to delay the trial and attack his integrity. The judge announced the decision in the opening minutes of Mr. Trump's trial on Monday morning. After Justice Merchan rules on a variety of legal issues, the trial will begin in earnest with jury selection. 'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said Monday before rejecting the request. 'We want to follow the law,' he added. 'We want justice to be done.' Mr. Trump's lawyers had called on Justice Merchan to recuse himself in a recent court filing, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. The Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case that accuses Mr. Trump of falsifying records to conceal a sex scandal from voters, had argued that no conflict of interest existed. And judicial ethics experts cast doubt on Mr. Trump's request, noting that the judge was not responsible for his daughter's career. It was just the latest attempt by Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to both delay the trial and oust Justice Merchan. Nor will it be the last: In a separate civil action filed last week, Mr. Trump asked an appeals court to pause the case while it considers whether to remove Justice Merchan. It is a long-shot bid that a single appeals court judge rejected and will be likely to fail before a full five-judge panel. When Mr. Trump tried last year to have Justice Merchan kicked off the case, Justice Merchan rejected it then as well, citing a state advisory committee on judicial ethics that determined that his impartiality could not reasonably be questioned based on his daughter's interests. The repeated attempts reflect the former president's long-running effort to delay all four of his criminal cases past Election Day. Stalling is one of Mr. Trump's favored legal tactics, and he uses it liberally in Manhattan, as well as in the three other cities where he faces criminal charges. If Mr. Trump reclaims the White House, the criminal cases against him would most likely grind to a halt. In the attempt in appeals court to compel the judge's recusal, Emil Bove, a lawyer for the former president, argued that certain facts had changed since Justice Merchan first declined to step aside last year, including that Mr. Trump was now the presumptive Republican nominee for president. But a lawyer for the court system, Lisa Evans, said that there was no reason that the judge should step aside. 'There is absolutely no evidence to show that Judge Merchan will stand to benefit from the outcome of this trial,' Ms. Evans said.

Adam Gray/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The streets outside the Manhattan courtroom where former President Donald J. Trump was set to go on trial were buzzing with anticipation on Monday morning as a crush of reporters — and a trickle of protesters — gathered to bear witness. Right-wing activists were planning rallies in the park directly opposite the court, which was subject to a heavy police presence. Some journalists and line-sitters had arrived late Sunday night, staking out places in the line to secure limited spaces inside the court's overflow room, where most reporters were gathered. Cameras lined the sidewalks outside the courthouse, a glowering edifice at 100 Centre Street, just blocks from New York's City Hall. TV crews were going live in intervals since before dawn, even as the police manned metal barricades. As the sun rose, some anti-Trump demonstrators had arrived, including one toting a sign reading 'Loser,' a favorite insult of the former president. Nadine Seiler, 58, took a midnight bus from Waldorf, Md., to get to the courthouse by dawn. 'This is the first and possibly only trial he's going to be on,' she said, holding up a spray-painted sheet reading 'Convict Trump Already.' Mr. Trump also had fans outside the courthouse, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist who argued with an anti-Trump protester as a gaggle of journalists surrounded them. Andrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City and lawyer for Mr. Trump, also came by to show support, arguing that the trial was a political persecution. 'He's somebody who I consider to be a mentor, almost like an uncle to me,' said Mr. Giuliani. Noting Mr. Trump's status as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Mr. Giuliani claimed: 'They want to tie him up for months at a time.' Others were simply there to witness the moment. 'I think it's a really difficult moment in American history,' said Sue Scarlett Montgomery, a filmmaker. 'It's a sad day, but here we are.'  The first criminal trial of an American president officially began on Monday as prosecutors and defense lawyers convened in a Manhattan courtroom to start selecting the jury that will decide Donald J. Trump's fate. The initial pool of prospective jurors dwindled rapidly. More than half of the first group of 96 were dismissed in short order after indicating that they did not believe they could be impartial. Court adjourned for the day roughly two hours after jury selection began, with zero jurors chosen. Before beginning the arduous process of choosing a jury for the landmark trial — on allegations that Mr. Trump falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star — the judge overseeing the case once again declined to step aside, rejecting Mr. Trump's latest effort to oust him. But there was also a ruling that favored the former president: The judge, Juan M. Merchan, rejected a request by prosecutors to introduce accusations of sexual assault that women lodged against Mr. Trump years ago, calling them 'rumors' and 'complete gossip.' The Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case against Mr. Trump, also asked the judge to hold Mr. Trump in contempt and penalize him $3,000 for violating a gag order barring him from attacking witnesses in the case. On social media over the weekend, Mr. Trump assailed one of the prosecution's key witnesses: Michael D. Cohen, his former fixer. Mr. Cohen paid $130,000 to the porn star, Stormy Daniels, during the 2016 presidential campaign to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she said she had with Mr. Trump. After the lunch break — during which Mr. Trump posted a video of an ally yelling about the judge's wife — Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month to discuss potential violations of the gag order, which also bars Mr. Trump from attacking the judge's family. The jury selection process could take two weeks or more, and the trial may spill into June. Mr. Trump is expected to be in the courtroom for much of it. Mr. Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted during pretrial arguments on Monday, sometimes smirking and scoffing, but also appearing to nod off, his mouth slack and his head drooping to his chest. After the trial got underway in the afternoon, he chuckled when Justice Merchan told the first group of 96 prospective jurors that he would ensure a fair trial. Mr. Trump, who might take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied the sexual encounter with Ms. Daniels. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records to hide the reimbursements to Mr. Cohen. They argue the payment to Ms. Daniels was part of a pattern: Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election. Here's what else to know about Mr. Trump's trial: This is the Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump, and it was brought by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a year ago. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. The case, one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America. Mr. Trump's team will be looking for red needles in a blue haystack.\nMr. Trump has twice sought Justice Merchan's recusal, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. Justice Merchan has declined to step aside, noting a ruling by a judicial ethics commission that found his daughter's work posed no conflict for him. 'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said in court on Monday, adding, 'we want to follow the law, we want justice to be done.' Mr. Trump has also attacked the judge's daughter on social media.\nHundreds of potential jurors have been summoned. Those who say they cannot be fair or otherwise serve are being excused, and the remaining prospective jurors will answer 42 questions compiled before the trial. Lawyers on both sides will be able to remove a limited number of them without explanation. The lawyers can also ask to remove a potential juror 'for cause' by providing specific reasons they believe that person cannot be fair. In addition to the payment to Ms. Daniels, Mr. Bragg's office is expected to highlight two other deals involving The National Enquirer, a tabloid that has longstanding ties to Mr. Trump. In one deal, the tabloid bought the silence of a man who had heard that Mr. Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock, a rumor that turned out to be false, and in the other, it paid Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, who wanted to sell her story of an affair with Mr. Trump.\nThe prosecution's witness list is expected to include David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, as well as Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal could also testify. Prospective jurors will answer a uniform set of questions aimed at discerning bias for or against the former president. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Follow our live coverage of Trump's hush money trial . The hundreds of New Yorkers who report for jury duty Monday morning in Manhattan will embark on an experience not found in history books: They will be vetted as jurors for the trial of a former U.S. president. The task won't be easy. Lawyers for Donald J. Trump and prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney's office will narrow the pool to 12 jurors and several alternates. Both sides will try to discern biases that could alter the outcome of the trial, posing dozens of questions that have been discussed and debated for weeks. The jurors, for their part, will be expected to answer each question honestly in an intimidating environment, just steps away from the former president, who is expected to attend much of the trial. Here's what we know about the process: The jury pool is composed of Manhattanites. Beyond that, little about the group is known, even by prosecutors and defense lawyers. Both sides will use the next several days, or weeks, to find out all they can. Because New York State does not allow juries to operate in full anonymity, the parties, including the former president, will know the jurors' names. The lawyers will also have access to their addresses. (Mr. Trump will not.) The public may never know the jurors' names. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, granted the prosecutors' request to withhold them. After reading a summary of the allegations, Justice Merchan will ask the prospective jurors whether they believe they can be fair and impartial. They will also be asked if they have any scheduling conflicts that would prevent them from attending every day of the trial, which could last more than six weeks. Those who raise concerns will most likely be removed from the pool. The jurors who remain will all be asked the same set of questions. One by one, they will talk — briefly and vaguely — about what they do for a living, their education and their families. They will be asked where they get their news, what radio and podcasts they listen to and whether they've read books written by Mr. Trump or his former fixer Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be a central witness. Other questions will be more pointed. Jurors will be asked if they've ever volunteered or attended a campaign event for Mr. Trump or one of his opponents. They will also be asked to divulge feelings or opinions they have about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case. But the jurors will not be asked how they voted in past elections, whom they plan to vote for, whether they have made political contributions or their party registration. Mr. Trump's legal team and prosecutors for the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, can challenge the inclusion of prospective jurors by providing specific reasons they believe a juror cannot be fair and impartial. The judge has the final say. Both sides will also receive a certain number of chances to remove jurors without explanation. After all of the challenged jurors are removed from the jury pool, Justice Merchan will seat the jury with those who remain. If Mr. Trump's behavior at previous trials is any guide, he is likely to be very involved in jury selection. In a previous defamation case, Mr. Trump was fixated on the jurors from the moment they walked into the courtroom. He pivoted in his chair to study them as they answered biographical questions. He frequently talked to his attorneys. But Mr. Trump's comments about the jurors in this case should start and stop in the courtroom. In addition to being ordered not to reveal their names, Mr. Trump is also subject to a gag order issued by Justice Merchan preventing him from making public statements about them.  © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nDonald J. Trump's lawyers faced an uphill battle Monday with Justice Juan M. Merchan, a no-nonsense jurist. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab courtroom in New York City while Mr. Trump looked on.\nMr. Trump was charged in Manhattan, a deeply Democratic county and his former home, with falsifying nearly three dozen business records in an attempt to cover up a payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, who has said she had a brief sexual encounter with him in 2006.\nMr. Trump denies that encounter happened, and has declared his innocence, calling the charges politically motivated. He has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a Democrat, who also attended the first day of trial on Monday.\nMr. Trump faces 34 felony counts and could face probation or up to four years of prison time.\nThe trial, which is expected to last weeks, has a fascinating list of potential witnesses: Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer turned apostate, who made the payment; Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who says she, too, had an affair with Mr. Trump; and Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels herself may testify.\nBefore any of that happens, a jury must be selected, a winnowing that began Monday.\nHere are five takeaways from Mr. Trump's first day on trial:\nJustice Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, has been consistent about batting back defense motions on issues including the tardy disclosure of documents by prosecutors and efforts to delay or even dismiss the case.\nThat pattern continued on Monday, as Justice Merchan rejected a defense effort to force his recusal. The defense had cited several issues, including the fact that his daughter is a Democratic political consultant.\nHe also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost.\nBut Mr. Trump's lawyers convinced Justice Merchan that sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the so-called Access Hollywood tape, in which Mr. Trump was caught bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial, calling them 'complete rumors, complete gossip, completely hearsay.'\nJustice Merchan's decisions on Monday made it clear that the trial will resurface unsavory events in the former president's life.\nThose include the Access Hollywood tape and other stories that Mr. Trump sought to suppress including an alleged affair with Ms. McDougal. Justice Merchan said on Monday that both could be discussed.\nIn a minor victory for the defense, the judge reaffirmed that the 'Access Hollywood' tape itself could not be played, but that Trump's exact words could be entered into the record.\nStill, most of Mr. Merchan's rulings indicated that salacious details of Mr. Trump's biography will be heard in court.\nEntering the courtroom, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here.'\nOnce he was in front of Mr. Merchan, Mr. Trump looked a lot less enthusiastic. He slouched. He scowled. He scoffed. And he was quiet, not the norm for a man who built a political career with his gift for slashing attacks and vicious put-downs.\nIn court, the former president spoke only briefly, when asked a few questions by Justice Merchan about procedural matters, and whether he understood the consequences — ejection or jail — if he interrupted proceedings. He did whisper with his lawyers. And when the prosecution played a recording of him claiming to have great respect for women, he mouthed the word 'true.'\nBut all in all, it seems it could be an exhausting experience for Mr. Trump; at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep.\nIt's easy to forget how long it takes to do a little in legal settings. On Monday, the morning session was dominated by maneuvering by prosecutors and the defense, even as prospective jurors waited. By lunch, they were still waiting.\nJury selection could take days or weeks, and the trial itself may take two months. The Passover holiday could cause delays, Justice Merchan said, though he might make some of that up by holding hearings on court matters on Wednesdays, which was previously going to be an off day.\nBy afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into Justice Merchan's courtroom. He warmly welcomed them, introduced the lawyers and Mr. Trump and read them a summary of the case.\nJustice Merchan asked if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president. Of the 96 prospective jurors in the room at that time, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused.\nThe remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.\nApril 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET Trump spoke briefly to TV cameras after court adjourned for the day, repeating his longstanding claims that the trial is a 'political witch hunt' before heading to his motorcade and departing the courthouse.\nVideo Reporter: [inaudible] the trial — [inaudible] So thank you very much. We had some amazing things happen today. As you know, my son is graduating from high school and it looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation of my son, who's worked very, very hard. He's a great student and he's very proud of the fact that he did so well. And was looking forward for years to have his graduation with his mother and father there. And it looks like the judges isn't going to allow me to escape this scam. It's a scam trial.

Trump's first criminal trial began inside a Manhattan courthouse on Monday, the scene outside had elements of a feisty political skirmish and a surreal circus rolled into one.\nThe streets below the courtroom drew a mix of gawkers, activists and publicity hounds, along with a large contingent of journalists.\nLaura Loomer, a right-wing activist known for her aggressive tactics and closeness with Mr. Trump, led a chant of 'Donald Trump Did Nothing Wrong!' alongside Andrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and Trump lawyer.\n'We're going to be here every single day talking to all you fake-news media freaks,' Ms. Loomer said through a Harvey Milk-style bullhorn in a video she posted on social media. 'And letting you know that Donald Trump did nothing wrong until you start reporting the truth.'\nMs. Loomer described the case as a 'witch hunt' — a frequent assertion of Mr. Trump's — and criticized a key witness for the prosecution, Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, and the wife of the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan.\nMr. Trump promptly reposted the video on Truth Social — despite a gag order that bars him from attacking witnesses in the case or Justice Merchan's family. His post, made during the lunch break, came shortly before Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month on prosecutors' request that Mr. Trump be held in contempt of court over statements they say violate the order.\nPerformance artists also vied for attention. One, known as Crackhead Barney, stood screaming outside the gates surrounding Collect Pond Park that she had been kicked out, and demanded police officers' badge numbers. Another played the flute atop a park bench, notes drifting through the wind and his instrument glinting in the sunlight.\nSome anti-Trump demonstrators held handmade signs emblazoned with 'Loser' and 'Convict Trump Already,' while others tried to confront Ms. Loomer. One, Sue Scarlett Montgomery, asked reporters why they were paying attention to Ms. Loomer, a former Republican candidate for Congress who previously visited a treacherous migrant crossing in Panama as part of her anti-Muslim activism.\n'They're covering me because I broke the story about this corrupt judge here,' Ms. Loomer shot back, attacking Judge Merchan's daughter, a Democratic political consultant who has also been a target of Mr. Trump.\nApril 15, 2024, 4:15 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 4:15 p.m. ET The latest potential juror to be questioned reads The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, but is also the first person to say they are a New York Post reader.

Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate.\nThe potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair.\nThe process could take two weeks or more — and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court.\n'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.'\nThe stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County — Manhattan, as most people know it — which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020.\nMr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions.\nMr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated.\nProsecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28.\nUnlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.'\nSome may not be completely forthcoming.\n'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said.\nMr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors.\n'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J.

He sat motionless while his own words from the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape — on which bragged about grabbing women's genitals — were read from a transcript by a prosecutor.\nAt times, Mr. Trump's emotions were characteristically on display. He smirked and scoffed, and appeared frustrated when the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, did not immediately agree that he could miss court to attend the graduation of his youngest son, Barron.\nBut when Justice Merchan warned that Mr. Trump could be ejected or thrown in jail if he disrupts the proceedings, the former president indicated that he understood.\nThe only time Mr. Trump showed a flash of humor was when he laughed at one of his own social media posts, which attacked his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be the prosecution's central witness.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J.

Trump's criminal trial on Monday again refused to allow the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape to be played for jurors, but said that the comments Mr. Trump made on the tape could be introduced as evidence.\nOn the tape, revealed in The Washington Post about a month before Mr. Trump was elected president in 2016, he is heard bragging about grabbing women's genitals, saying he could do so with abandon because 'when you're a star, they let you do it.'\n'You can do anything,' Mr. Trump said on the recording.\nThe tape rocked Mr. Trump's campaign. And prosecutors in Manhattan say it led him to agree to pay off Stormy Daniels, a porn star, who was shopping a story of a 2006 sexual encounter with the candidate.\nMichael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, paid Ms. Daniels $130,000. The payment is at the heart of the 34 felony charges against Mr. Trump, who is accused of falsifying business records to cover it up.\nThe judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, had previously ruled that prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office could question witnesses about the tape, but found that it would be prejudicial to allow the actual video to the played. He reaffirmed that ruling on Monday.\n'You can bring out what was said in the tape,' Justice Merchan said, adding that he didn't want jurors 'to hear Mr. Trump's voice and his gestures' in the tape.\nIn a victory for the defense, the judge also ruled that the prosecution could not introduce evidence about sexual assault allegations against Mr. Trump that surfaced in the aftermath of the tape becoming public, calling them 'complete hearsay.'\nHowever, Justice Merchan said that prosecutors could introduce emails that followed the tape's disclosure, showing frantic efforts by Trump advisers to contain the fallout. The correspondence, he said, 'bolsters the people's claim that this was a crucial event.'\nTodd Blanche, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, had called on Justice Merchan to reconsider admitting 'this extremely salacious evidence,' which he described as 'very prejudicial.'\nMr. Trump, who is again the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has denied any wrongdoing and has cast the case against him as politically motivated.\nJustice Juan M.

Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Inside a dreary Lower Manhattan courtroom on a recent Wednesday, Justice Juan M. Merchan convened a special session for people with mental health troubles who had landed in legal jeopardy. He calmly counseled them, praised any signs of progress and shook the hand of one man who, thanks to medication, had turned his life around.\nBut a different type of criminal defendant is now testing the judge's equanimity: Donald J. Trump.\nMr. Trump's trial on charges that he covered up a sex scandal before and after the 2016 presidential election will bring a maelstrom that no other judge in New York's vast judiciary has ever experienced.\nKnown as a no-nonsense, drama-averse jurist, Justice Merchan, 61, has already reprimanded Mr. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous and issued a gag order intended to protect prosecutors, witnesses and his own family from Mr. Trump's vitriol — and yet the former president has continued to post articles with pictures of the judge's daughter, a political consultant who has worked with Democratic candidates.\nAlthough Justice Merchan is a registered Democrat, records show he was previously a Republican, and people who know him described the judge as a moderate, law-and-order former prosecutor.\nTwo people close to Justice Merchan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the judge had privately expressed pain over the attacks on his daughter, but the people said that those attacks won't compromise his ability to oversee the case. Other people who know the judge said that he will cast aside Mr. Trump's drama — and exert control over the trial.\n'It is Judge Merchan's show,' said Jill Konviser, a retired judge who has known Justice Merchan for more than 15 years. She added: 'He will do everything he can to, one, control his courtroom and two, ensure a fair trial for the defendant.'\nIn Justice Merchan's 17 years on the bench, 13 as presiding judge in the Mental Health Court he created, he has had his share of unusual cases. There was a murder trial involving a supposed curse on the defendant; the daredevils who jumped off the World Trade Center with parachutes; and a so-called soccer-mom madam accused of running a high-end brothel on the Upper East Side. In that case, an appeals court reduced the steep bail Justice Merchan had set, calling it 'unreasonable.'\nNone of those defendants challenged the judge quite like Mr. Trump, who claims that the case is a witch hunt and declared that Justice Merchan's gag order had infringed on his First Amendment rights.\nThe former president has tested the order's limits by posting articles that named and attacked Justice Merchan's daughter, Loren, and his wife, Lara. The articles, by the conservative activist Laura Loomer, included photos of Loren Merchan and copies of a 2007 mortgage statement for a house owned by Justice Merchan and his wife. Previously, Mr. Trump falsely accused Loren Merchan of posting an image of him behind bars on social media.\nThe trial, which could last two months as a parade of former aides and allies takes the stand against him, will dominate Justice Merchan's calendar this spring.\nOn off-days, he will continue to preside over Mental Health Court. The program is for defendants charged with felonies and diagnosed with a serious mental illness. People who are accepted enter a guilty plea and then begin a period of treatment and judicial supervision. Those who complete the program successfully can have their charges reduced or dismissed.\nDuring one recent session, Justice Merchan showed particular interest in the relationship between a defendant and his child, and praised him for his dedication.\n'You want to do better by your daughter,' Justice Merchan said. 'I'm sure she's going to appreciate that.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Donald J. Trump has repeatedly tried to have Juan M. Merchan removed as the judge in his case. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Juan M. Merchan, the judge overseeing Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan, has declined to step aside from the case, rejecting the former president's effort to delay the trial and attack his integrity.\nThe judge announced the decision in the opening minutes of Mr. Trump's trial on Monday morning. After Justice Merchan rules on a variety of legal issues, the trial will begin in earnest with jury selection.\n'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said Monday before rejecting the request. 'We want to follow the law,' he added. 'We want justice to be done.'\nMr. Trump's lawyers had called on Justice Merchan to recuse himself in a recent court filing, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant.\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case that accuses Mr. Trump of falsifying records to conceal a sex scandal from voters, had argued that no conflict of interest existed. And judicial ethics experts cast doubt on Mr. Trump's request, noting that the judge was not responsible for his daughter's career.\nIt was just the latest attempt by Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to both delay the trial and oust Justice Merchan. Nor will it be the last: In a separate civil action filed last week, Mr. Trump asked an appeals court to pause the case while it considers whether to remove Justice Merchan. It is a long-shot bid that a single appeals court judge rejected and will be likely to fail before a full five-judge panel.\nWhen Mr. Trump tried last year to have Justice Merchan kicked off the case, Justice Merchan rejected it then as well, citing a state advisory committee on judicial ethics that determined that his impartiality could not reasonably be questioned based on his daughter's interests.\nThe repeated attempts reflect the former president's long-running effort to delay all four of his criminal cases past Election Day. Stalling is one of Mr. Trump's favored legal tactics, and he uses it liberally in Manhattan, as well as in the three other cities where he faces criminal charges. If Mr. Trump reclaims the White House, the criminal cases against him would most likely grind to a halt.\nIn the attempt in appeals court to compel the judge's recusal, Emil Bove, a lawyer for the former president, argued that certain facts had changed since Justice Merchan first declined to step aside last year, including that Mr. Trump was now the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\nBut a lawyer for the court system, Lisa Evans, said that there was no reason that the judge should step aside.\n'There is absolutely no evidence to show that Judge Merchan will stand to benefit from the outcome of this trial,' Ms. Evans said.\nVideo transcript\nTrump Supporters Rally Outside New York Courthouse Pro-Trump protesters gathered near the Manhattan courthouse where the former president's criminal trial is taking place.

'This is the first and possibly only trial he's going to be on,' she said, holding up a spray-painted sheet reading 'Convict Trump Already.'\nMr. Trump also had fans outside the courthouse, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist who argued with an anti-Trump protester as a gaggle of journalists surrounded them.\nAndrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City and lawyer for Mr. Trump, also came by to show support, arguing that the trial was a political persecution.\n'He's somebody who I consider to be a mentor, almost like an uncle to me,' said Mr. Giuliani.\nNoting Mr. Trump's status as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Mr. Giuliani claimed: 'They want to tie him up for months at a time.'\nOthers were simply there to witness the moment. 'I think it's a really difficult moment in American history,' said Sue Scarlett Montgomery, a filmmaker. 'It's a sad day, but here we are.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT The first criminal trial of an American president officially began on Monday as prosecutors and defense lawyers convened in a Manhattan courtroom to start selecting the jury that will decide Donald J. Trump's fate.\nThe initial pool of prospective jurors dwindled rapidly. More than half of the first group of 96 were dismissed in short order after indicating that they did not believe they could be impartial. Court adjourned for the day roughly two hours after jury selection began, with zero jurors chosen.\nBefore beginning the arduous process of choosing a jury for the landmark trial — on allegations that Mr. Trump falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star — the judge overseeing the case once again declined to step aside, rejecting Mr. Trump's latest effort to oust him.\nBut there was also a ruling that favored the former president: The judge, Juan M. Merchan, rejected a request by prosecutors to introduce accusations of sexual assault that women lodged against Mr. Trump years ago, calling them 'rumors' and 'complete gossip.'\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case against Mr. Trump, also asked the judge to hold Mr. Trump in contempt and penalize him $3,000 for violating a gag order barring him from attacking witnesses in the case.\nOn social media over the weekend, Mr. Trump assailed one of the prosecution's key witnesses: Michael D. Cohen, his former fixer. Mr. Cohen paid $130,000 to the porn star, Stormy Daniels, during the 2016 presidential campaign to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she said she had with Mr. Trump.\nAfter the lunch break — during which Mr. Trump posted a video of an ally yelling about the judge's wife — Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month to discuss potential violations of the gag order, which also bars Mr. Trump from attacking the judge's family.\nThe jury selection process could take two weeks or more, and the trial may spill into June. Mr. Trump is expected to be in the courtroom for much of it.\nMr. Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted during pretrial arguments on Monday, sometimes smirking and scoffing, but also appearing to nod off, his mouth slack and his head drooping to his chest. After the trial got underway in the afternoon, he chuckled when Justice Merchan told the first group of 96 prospective jurors that he would ensure a fair trial.\nMr. Trump, who might take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied the sexual encounter with Ms. Daniels. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records to hide the reimbursements to Mr. Cohen. They argue the payment to Ms. Daniels was part of a pattern: Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election.\nHere's what else to know about Mr. Trump's trial:\nThis is the Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump, and it was brought by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a year ago. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. The case, one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America. Mr. Trump's team will be looking for red needles in a blue haystack.\nMr. Trump has twice sought Justice Merchan's recusal, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. Justice Merchan has declined to step aside, noting a ruling by a judicial ethics commission that found his daughter's work posed no conflict for him. 'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said in court on Monday, adding, 'we want to follow the law, we want justice to be done.' Mr. Trump has also attacked the judge's daughter on social media.\nHundreds of potential jurors have been summoned. Those who say they cannot be fair or otherwise serve are being excused, and the remaining prospective jurors will answer 42 questions compiled before the trial. Lawyers on both sides will be able to remove a limited number of them without explanation. The lawyers can also ask to remove a potential juror 'for cause' by providing specific reasons they believe that person cannot be fair.\nIn addition to the payment to Ms. Daniels, Mr. Bragg's office is expected to highlight two other deals involving The National Enquirer, a tabloid that has longstanding ties to Mr. Trump. In one deal, the tabloid bought the silence of a man who had heard that Mr. Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock, a rumor that turned out to be false, and in the other, it paid Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, who wanted to sell her story of an affair with Mr. Trump.\nThe prosecution's witness list is expected to include David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, as well as Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal could also testify.\nProspective jurors will answer a uniform set of questions aimed at discerning bias for or against the former president. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Follow our live coverage of Trump's hush money trial .\nFollow our live coverage of Trump's hush money trial . The hundreds of New Yorkers who report for jury duty Monday morning in Manhattan will embark on an experience not found in history books: They will be vetted as jurors for the trial of a former U.S. president.\nThe task won't be easy. Lawyers for Donald J. Trump and prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney's office will narrow the pool to 12 jurors and several alternates. Both sides will try to discern biases that could alter the outcome of the trial, posing dozens of questions that have been discussed and debated for weeks.\nThe jurors, for their part, will be expected to answer each question honestly in an intimidating environment, just steps away from the former president, who is expected to attend much of the trial.\nHere's what we know about the process:\nThe jury pool is composed of Manhattanites. Beyond that, little about the group is known, even by prosecutors and defense lawyers. Both sides will use the next several days, or weeks, to find out all they can.\nBecause New York State does not allow juries to operate in full anonymity, the parties, including the former president, will know the jurors' names. The lawyers will also have access to their addresses. (Mr. Trump will not.)\nThe public may never know the jurors' names. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, granted the prosecutors' request to withhold them.\nAfter reading a summary of the allegations, Justice Merchan will ask the prospective jurors whether they believe they can be fair and impartial. They will also be asked if they have any scheduling conflicts that would prevent them from attending every day of the trial, which could last more than six weeks. Those who raise concerns will most likely be removed from the pool.\nThe jurors who remain will all be asked the same set of questions. One by one, they will talk — briefly and vaguely — about what they do for a living, their education and their families. They will be asked where they get their news, what radio and podcasts they listen to and whether they've read books written by Mr. Trump or his former fixer Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be a central witness.\nOther questions will be more pointed. Jurors will be asked if they've ever volunteered or attended a campaign event for Mr. Trump or one of his opponents. They will also be asked to divulge feelings or opinions they have about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case.\nBut the jurors will not be asked how they voted in past elections, whom they plan to vote for, whether they have made political contributions or their party registration.\nMr. Trump's legal team and prosecutors for the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, can challenge the inclusion of prospective jurors by providing specific reasons they believe a juror cannot be fair and impartial. The judge has the final say.\nBoth sides will also receive a certain number of chances to remove jurors without explanation. After all of the challenged jurors are removed from the jury pool, Justice Merchan will seat the jury with those who remain.\nIf Mr. Trump's behavior at previous trials is any guide, he is likely to be very involved in jury selection. In a previous defamation case, Mr. Trump was fixated on the jurors from the moment they walked into the courtroom. He pivoted in his chair to study them as they answered biographical questions. He frequently talked to his attorneys.\nBut Mr. Trump's comments about the jurors in this case should start and stop in the courtroom. In addition to being ordered not to reveal their names, Mr. Trump is also subject to a gag order issued by Justice Merchan preventing him from making public statements about them.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",

            "summary": "A high-energy crowd rallied on Sunday in Pittsburgh to support Representative Summer Lee, a left-leaning congresswoman whose primary on Tuesday is a high-profile test whether she can stave off a challenge aimed in part at her stance over the war in Gaza.\nSpeakers framed Ms. Lee's race, in Pennsylvania's 12th District, as crucial to building a movement for working people and to fighting what they cast as billionaire influence in the race.\nThe rally with several hundred supporters drew a small group of protesters who held signs outside the headquarters of the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers to criticize Ms. Lee and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's stances on the war in Israel and Gaza. Ms. Lee's primary is one of the first down-ballot electoral tests of the Israel-Gaza conflict this year.\n'To fight for common sense in the House is to often be alone. I have seen Summer walk alone,' Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. 'On Tuesday, what we must do is show her and show the world and show the people in that big white house that she is not alone.'\n'It's not about winning — it's about winning big,' she added.\nMs. Lee won a close primary in 2022 against a moderate challenger on her way to become the first Black woman to represent Pennsylvania in Congress. She has garnered broad support from Democrats this year. Even so, she has also faced pressure within her district after becoming one of the first members of Congress to call for an immediate cease-fire, just over a week after Hamas attacked Israel, and Israel responded with a military assault on Gaza.\nDuring her remarks, Ms. Lee reiterated her support for union jobs, affordable housing and a 'pro peace movement.' At one point, she told the audience that there was 'no room for people who would use our communities against each other for their own political ambitions.'\nShe framed her race as being about democracy and appeared to acknowledge the heightened focus on her Israel-Gaza stance, saying, 'You don't have a democracy if one issue determines whether or not my community has representation.'\nHer opponent, Bhavini Patel, a municipal councilwoman, has repeatedly criticized Ms. Lee's votes relating to the conflict. Ms. Patel said in an interview that on Sunday she attended a 'rally focused on the Jewish community' and decried her opponent's rally as 'bringing people here who are not from here.'\nMs. Lee and her supporters have sharply criticized the involvement of Jeff Yass, a Republican megadonor in Pennsylvania who gave significantly to Moderate PAC, a super PAC backing centrist Democrats and running ads supporting Ms. Patel. Ms. Lee and her supporters have seized on them: Her campaign distributed signs on Sunday that read 'Move, Yass! Get out of the way.' (Ms. Patel said she had denounced Mr. Yass and his support.)\nAllies of Ms. Lee also indirectly praised her Gaza stance. Mr. Jones told the crowd that Ms. Lee 'shows us that solidarity is about consistency in showing up for each other,' and that solidarity includes a spectrum of people, 'whether it's workers in Pittsburgh or the people of Palestine.'\n'Summer is somebody who knows that sometimes confrontation is confirmation that we are on the right path for victory,' he said.\nAnd when Ms. Ocasio-Cortez began to criticize AIPAC, the pro-Israel group that is backing challenges to progressive incumbents outside Pennsylvania, the audience promptly booed the group's mention.\nBackers of Ms. Lee have pointed to her diverse coalition as evidence that she can draw support from the groups that the national Democratic Party is looking to motivate, such as young people and voters of color.\nMeanwhile, a handful of critics outside the venue, several of whom said they were backing Ms. Patel, held signs that criticized Iran and cast Ms. Lee and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez as opposing Israel. The protesters said they were especially unhappy with Ms. Lee's vote last week against parts of a foreign aid package that allocated billions to Israel and imposed new sanctions on Iran.\n'We as a Jewish community are afraid, and we want her to understand that by not supporting things like Iran sanctions, it makes not just Israel but also America less safe,' said Julie Paris, a regional director for the pro-Israel group StandWithUs and Pittsburgh resident.\nBut Ms. Lee's backers vastly outnumbered Ms. Paris and her compatriots.\nWill Allison, who served as president of College Democrats at the University of Pittsburgh, said his group had endorsed Ms. Lee, the first primary endorsement he said the group had made.\n'We're very lucky to have her as a congresswoman who can bring the money back to the district and can make the system work for us as her constituents, but who can also authentically hold to her positions and take those tough votes,' he said.\nAnd when Mayor Ed Gainey of Pittsburgh took the stage and asked the crowd, 'Y'all know what time it is?' the audience emphatically shouted back: 'Summer time!'\nA correction was made on : Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated how Ms. Lee voted on some parts of the foreign aid package. She voted last week against parts of a foreign aid package that allocated billions to Israel and imposed new sanctions on Iran, but supported bills that provided aid to Ukraine and Taiwan.\nUkraine and Taiwan.

            "summary": "Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The challenging process of choosing a jury in the first criminal trial of a former American president proceeded slowly on Tuesday, as prospective jurors were questioned individually about their ability to fairly consider the charges against Donald J. Trump. Shortly before noon, lawyers began directly questioning the first group of prospective jurors to make it through initial queries. Questions involved their opinions on campaign finance law and on the trial's potential witnesses, including a porn star and a tabloid publisher. Earlier, some prospective jurors who had previously indicated that they would be able to be impartial had changed their minds after taking a night to think about it. 'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I hoped I could be,' one admitted. He was excused. It could take two weeks or more to pick the 12 jurors who will decide the case, which centers on allegations that the former president falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star, Stormy Daniels. The pool of possible jurors being scrutinized on Tuesday came from an initial group of 96, dozens of whom were dismissed immediately on Monday after indicating that they felt they could not fairly reach a decision. The dismissals underscored the difficulty of picking a jury in a city where the defendant is widely reviled. Mr. Trump, who may take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied all wrongdoing. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records that hid reimbursements to his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who had paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to buy her silence. Prosecutors say that Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election. Here's what to know about the case: The case was brought a year ago by Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. It is one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, but may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nA day after Mr. Trump appeared to nod off during pretrial motions, he was back at the defense table. He appeared somewhat bored as the jury selection process continued, with prospective jurors responding to a series of mostly yes or no questions.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America.\nMr. Trump has repeatedly complained that the case is a politically motivated witch hunt and has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and his family, as well as key witnesses, including Mr. Cohen. Justice Merchan has imposed a gag order on Mr. Trump that bars him from attacking witnesses, jurors, prosecutors or the judge's family. Even before the trial began on Monday, prosecutors asked Justice Merchan to hold the former president in contempt of court over social media posts about Mr. Cohen; the judge said he would hold a hearing later this month. April 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET Anusha Bayya Reporting from outside the courthouse A midday addition to the crowd here, albeit briefly: Mayor Eric Adams has come by, flanked by his security detail, and was soon peppered with questions by reporters. Asked about the fairness of Trump being on trial in Manhattan, where he's an unpopular figure, Adams replied, 'That is beyond my pay grade.' But, he added, 'This city is a fair city.' April 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET Olivia Bensimon Reporting from outside the courthouse 'Justice is going to take its course here in the city,' Adams told the assembled reporters. After stressing that the trial was proceeding in an 'orderly fashion,' he was escorted down Centre Street away from the news media. Video Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, accused Donald J. Trump of falsifying business records connected to a hush money payment to a porn star. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony counts. Credit Credit... Andrew Seng for The New York Times All 34 felony counts at the center of the Manhattan criminal case against former President Donald J. Trump stem from a $130,000 hush-money payment handed over to a porn star in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign. The specific charges are far less titillating: falsifying business records in the first degree. But a conviction could still result in jail time. The payment was made by Mr. Trump's fixer, Michael D. Cohen, to Stormy Daniels in order to buy her silence about a sexual liaison she said she had with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump directed him to make the payment. Paying hush money is not illegal. But while serving as the commander in chief, prosecutors say, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen in a manner that constituted fraud: In internal records, Mr. Trump's company classified the reimbursement as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet there were no such expenses, according to prosecutors, who say the agreement was also fictional. Those records underpin the 34 counts of falsifying business records: 11 involve the checks, 11 center on monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted to the company and 12 involve entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust. Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing. In announcing the charges a year ago, Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, said that his office must keep a close eye on how companies conduct business in New York. 'This is the business capital of the world,' Mr. Bragg said. 'We regularly do cases involving false business statements. The bedrock — in fact, the basis for business integrity and a well-functioning business marketplace — is true and accurate record-keeping.' The charges against Mr. Trump are all Class E felonies, the lowest category in New York. Each count carries a maximum prison sentence of four years. Nothing in the law requires the judge, Juan E. Merchan, to imprison Mr. Trump if the jury convicts him. The judge could instead sentence him to probation. But Justice Merchan has made it clear that he takes white-collar crime seriously and could put Mr. Trump behind bars. It's possible, however, if Mr. Trump is convicted of more than one count, Justice Merchan would impose a concurrent sentence, under which Mr. Trump would serve all time simultaneously. Key Players in the Trump Criminal Trial ›  April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET Olivia Bensimon Reporting from outside the courthouse Journalists still vastly outnumber the Trump supporters who have gathered near the courthouse today. One man's Stars and Stripes flag flaps in the breeze, two other people are sitting on benches. Neighborhood workers on their lunch breaks bask in the spring sun. Jury selection is often a lengthy process, but in the first criminal trial of a former American president, currently taking place in a Manhattan criminal courthouse, it's going more slowly than normal. In part, that is because of the nature of the case: Jurors, once seated, will be asked to decide whether Donald J. Trump committed a crime. Prosecutors have charged him with 34 felonies, accusing him of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal that could have hurt his first presidential run. But the process has been particularly drawn-out because, once would-be jurors say they can be fair and impartial, they are being asked a series of 42 questions. After that, they face additional scrutiny from lawyers for the prosecution and the defense. Here are the 42 questions: 1. Without telling us your address, in what neighborhood do you live? For example, Upper East Side, Lower East Side, Inwood, etc. How long have you lived there? Are you a native New Yorker? If not, where did you live previously? 2. What do you do for a living?

If so, what was the experience? Would that experience prevent you from being a fair and impartial juror in this case? 19. Have you, a relative, or a close friend ever been accused or convicted of committing a crime? 20. Do you, a relative, or a close friend have a pending criminal case? 21. Do you have any political, moral, intellectual or religious beliefs or opinions which might prevent you from following the Court's instructions on the law or which might slant your approach to this case? Do you have any political, moral, intellectual or religious beliefs or opinions that would interfere with your ability to render a verdict in this criminal case? 22. Do you have a health condition that might interfere with your ability to be here on the appointed days and times or otherwise prevent you from serving as a juror? 23. Without telling us the name(s), do you take any medication that would prevent you from being able to concentrate or pay attention during the proceedings or during the deliberations? 24.

Is there any reason, whether it be a bias or something else, that would prevent you from being fair and impartial if you are selected as a juror for this case? New York State makes no provision for anonymous juries, even in a case as sensitive as this one. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Last month, Justice Juan M. Merchan ordered that prospective jurors' names would be shielded from the public, underscoring the need for privacy for those who may decide Donald J. Trump's criminal fate — and tempt the anger of his followers. Yet on the first two days of jury selection, several prospective jurors revealed potentially identifying information, reflecting the difficulty of having an anonymous jury in a case with an intense media spotlight. On the first day, a woman said she worked for a city agency of approximately 500 people and revealed its name. Later, a man who identified himself as a bookseller revealed the name of the small store where he works. This continued on Tuesday when others revealed the names of employers. While some worked for companies that were large, where the potential jurors could likely remain unidentifiable, others were less cautious. One woman revealed the name of the three-person company she owns with her husband. Justice Merchan did not interject as the prospective jurors divulged the information, nor did he caution them against doing so. Juries are not completely anonymous in New York State. Mr. Trump, his lawyers and the prosecutors have access to the names of the prospective jurors. But after a request by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, Justice Merchan decided to withhold the names from the public. Mr. Trump did not oppose the request. The accidental self-identifications are a notable departure from how federal Judge Lewis A. Kaplan conducted jury selection in Mr. Trump's defamation trial in January, brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. In the federal system, jurors are allowed to remain anonymous, even to parties in the case. Before potential jurors answered basic questions about their backgrounds, Judge Kaplan instructed them not to reveal personal information. 'Don't give us anything that could enable anybody to pin you down geographically,' he said. He also cautioned them not to reveal their names to each other, and when the trial concluded, he left them with these ominous words: 'My advice to you is that you never disclose that you were on this jury,' Judge Kaplan said. 'And I won't say anything more about it.'

We are running 5 to 7 minutes per person. The very premise of the trial is that prosecutors believe Donald J. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times Donald J. Trump first ran for president nearly a decade ago. Now, as he runs again in a political climate that he helped create, his Manhattan criminal trial is partly a referendum on his tactics during that first campaign. The trial's very premise is that prosecutors believe Mr. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign — sex scandals involving a porn star and a Playboy model, for example — he concealed them, the prosecutors say. But in a development that will bolster their case, prosecutors on Monday secured permission from the judge to admit evidence connected to Mr. Trump's overall political strategy in 2016. Much of it bears the former president's imprint: aggressive tweets, false denials, coordination with a tabloid publisher and more. The judge's ruling showed how the weapons that worked so well for Mr. Trump then are being turned against him in the courtroom now. The techniques prosecutors highlighted Monday were not invented by Mr. Trump for use in his campaign; they are behaviors he exhibited throughout his life as a businessman and a reality-television star. But in modern American political history, such raw tactics had rarely been seen at such a high level. One example is Mr. Trump's relationship with The National Enquirer tabloid and its publisher, David Pecker, who is expected to appear as a witness. The Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case, obtained permission from the judge on Monday to introduce evidence related to a 2015 meeting among Mr. Trump, Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump's former fixer, Michael D. Cohen. A prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, said on Monday that the three men had 'conspired to influence the 2016 election.' That meeting laid the groundwork for hush-money deals with a porn star, Stormy Daniels, and a Playboy model, Karen McDougal. But another result of that meeting, Mr. Steinglass said, were explosive headlines about Mr. Trump's opponents in the Republican primary, including those claiming that Ben Carson had committed 'medical malpractice' and that Senator Ted Cruz had a 'family connection to J.F.K.'s assassin.' A lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, protested the admission of evidence related to that meeting, saying that newspaper publishers met with candidates 'all the time,' and that there was nothing improper about it, let alone illegal. That admission worked against him. The judge, Juan M. Merchan, said that he was glad that Mr. Blanche believed that there was nothing wrong with the meeting — because it meant that he should not mind that the evidence would be introduced. 'There is no reason not to allow it in,' Justice Merchan said. Mr. Steinglass won again when he persuaded Justice Merchan to admit evidence of the Trump campaign in crisis after the publication in 2016 of the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump boasted about grabbing women by their genitals. 'The video sent the campaign into a tailspin,' Mr. Steinglass said. He offered up an email sent by a Washington Post reporter to Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump's campaign spokeswoman. Mr. Steinglass said that Ms. Hicks had forwarded the exchange to Stephen K. Bannon, Kellyanne Conway and other members of the campaign team, 'suggesting that their response should be to deny, deny, deny.' Eventually, he said, Mr. Bannon sent it to Mr. Cohen. Mr. Blanche again protested, but was again rebuffed. The judge said he would allow jurors to see the email, saying that the ensuing thread was relevant. The exchanges that prosecutors and defense lawyers debated on Monday underscored Mr. Trump's penchant for delegating dirty work to others, giving himself some distance in the process. The hush-money deals worked that way: Mr. Cohen paid off Ms. Daniels, while The National Enquirer bought Ms. McDougal's silence. (Mr. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to his reimbursement of Mr. Cohen.) That habit is still on display this year, and can be helpful given that Justice Merchan has barred Mr. Trump from attacking witnesses, prosecutors and the judge's own family. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump posted on social media a video of Laura Loomer, a political ally, in the park outside the courthouse. Ms. Loomer, speaking into a bullhorn, insinuated that the judge's family was politically compromised. Had Mr. Trump said that himself, he would have risked violating the judge's gag order.

Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The scene outside Manhattan's Criminal Court on Tuesday morning was placid — by New York standards — after the tense crush on the first day of Donald J. Trump's trial. On Monday, cable news stations had staked out every concrete surface bordering Centre Street. On Tuesday, there were swaths of open ground in the space reserved for media organizations. As the sun rose and workers in Collect Pond Park removed overflowing trash cans around 5:30 a.m., only five people were in the line for those holding official passes for entry. In the line for the general public were some familiar faces among court-watchers, including Ron Sinibaldi, whose hobbies include following high-profile cases. He's previously attended proceedings involving Senator Robert Menendez, who is accused of taking bribes, and New Jersey officials involved in closing the George Washington Bridge as political retribution. Everyday street scenes played out nearby. Around 7 a.m., a lone man fed pigeons in the park, which was sparsely populated by the time Mr. Trump's motorcade arrived nearly two hours later. An exception: one older man holding up a red Trump 2024 flag and shouting at television reporters: 'Fight! Fight! Fight for Donald Trump!' Shortly after, a line of young children toddled through, flanked by teacher's aides and clutching a rope, their neon orange vests a pop of color. Anusha Bayya contributed reporting.

Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab New York City courtroom as Mr. Trump looked on. Before jury selection began, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, rejected another effort to force his recusal by the defense, which cited several issues, including his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. He also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost. But Mr. Trump's lawyers did persuade Justice Merchan that mentioning sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump was recorded bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial. Entering the courtroom Monday, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here,' but he looked less enthusiastic in front of Justice Merchan. He quietly slouched and scowled — and at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep. By afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into the courtroom. Some quickly left: When the judge asked the first group of 96 if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused. The remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.   The jury selection process in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan could take two weeks or more. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Lawyers representing the State of New York and Donald J. Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate. The potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair. The process could take two weeks or more — and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court. 'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.' The stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County — Manhattan, as most people know it — which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020. Mr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated. Prosecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28. Unlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.' Some may not be completely forthcoming. 'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said. Mr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors. 'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'  Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Not since Eugene V. Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning. Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases: two federal, one in New York and another in Georgia. The first of those to go to trial is the sex scandal cover-up in New York, where jury selection began on Monday. For now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, beyond having to be present in a courtroom, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But some of the cases are proceeding at a pace that could bring verdicts before the election — and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that will arise if he is convicted. Others would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges. Here is what we know, and what we don't know. This is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes. The Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be 'natural born' citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years. There are no limitations based on character or criminal record. While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices. The Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground. 'We let states set the time, place and manner' of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, 'but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don't let the state add new substantive requirements.' While that view is not universal among legal experts, it prevailed in court in 2019, after California passed a law requiring candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the law from taking effect, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' after taking an oath to support the Constitution. Numerous lawsuits had argued that Mr. Trump's actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, met this bar. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine's secretary of state did the same. But the Supreme Court — led by a conservative supermajority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself — concluded that only Congress had the power to enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. (Four of the justices, including the three liberals, wanted to allow a wider range of options for disqualification.) Congress is not going to do that with Republicans in control of the House. And the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal cases, meaning convictions would not disqualify Mr. Trump either. Congress can designate either groups of people to whom Section 3 applies (such as people who fought for the Confederacy) or specific crimes that, upon conviction, would trigger disqualification, said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University. But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty. 'Whether or not Trump is tried, convicted, acquitted, that's a separate question from whether or not he's disqualified,' said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. One of the charges in the federal case related to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election — conspiracy to violate civil rights — once carried a disqualification penalty, Mr. Kreis said, but Congress removed it decades ago. Now that Mr. Trump has secured a majority of delegates to the Republican convention, the party has no mechanism to nominate somebody else. Under the party's official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, 'such support shall not be recognized.' Nor have top Republicans shown any interest in another nominee. If he were forced to withdraw from the race after the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him. Probably not. Mr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony. Most felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day. He could also petition for clemency, which would require the approval of the governor — Ron DeSantis, who ran against Mr. Trump in the Republican primary — and two Florida cabinet members. Chris Taylor, the director of external affairs for the Florida Commission on Offender Review, confirmed that a Florida resident convicted of a felony could apply to have their voting rights restored through that process even if their conviction happened outside Florida. Since Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison. So if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he could be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote. No one knows. 'We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 'It's just guessing.' Legally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. 'I don't think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,' Professor Levinson said. In practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts. In theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself. More likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump's lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch. On the federal charges only, he could also try to pardon himself — or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a 'self pardon' was constitutional. Or President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that 'the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,' Professor Chemerinsky said. But that wouldn't apply to the New York or Georgia cases, because the president does not have pardon power for state charges. Again, no one knows, particularly when it comes to the New York and Georgia cases. In the two federal cases, a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges. The Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents — that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties — applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario. 'The reasons why we wouldn't want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn't want to prosecute a sitting president,' said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department's reasoning. 'My guess is, if the Trump prosecution were still ongoing in some way and Trump were elected, the Justice Department — which would be the Trump Justice Department — would say, ‘We're following the 1973 memo.'' Like so much else here, this would be legally untested, and it is impossible to say what the Supreme Court would do if the question reached it. In its Clinton v. Jones ruling in 1997, the court allowed a lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed. But that case was civil, not criminal, and it was filed by a private citizen, not by the government itself.

He was excused.\nIt could take two weeks or more to pick the 12 jurors who will decide the case, which centers on allegations that the former president falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star, Stormy Daniels.\nThe pool of possible jurors being scrutinized on Tuesday came from an initial group of 96, dozens of whom were dismissed immediately on Monday after indicating that they felt they could not fairly reach a decision. The dismissals underscored the difficulty of picking a jury in a city where the defendant is widely reviled.\nMr. Trump, who may take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied all wrongdoing. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records that hid reimbursements to his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who had paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to buy her silence. Prosecutors say that Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election.\nHere's what to know about the case:\nThe case was brought a year ago by Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. It is one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, but may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nA day after Mr. Trump appeared to nod off during pretrial motions, he was back at the defense table. He appeared somewhat bored as the jury selection process continued, with prospective jurors responding to a series of mostly yes or no questions.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America.\nMr. Trump has repeatedly complained that the case is a politically motivated witch hunt and has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and his family, as well as key witnesses, including Mr. Cohen. Justice Merchan has imposed a gag order on Mr. Trump that bars him from attacking witnesses, jurors, prosecutors or the judge's family. Even before the trial began on Monday, prosecutors asked Justice Merchan to hold the former president in contempt of court over social media posts about Mr. Cohen; the judge said he would hold a hearing later this month.\nApril 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET Anusha Bayya\nAnusha Bayya Reporting from outside the courthouse A midday addition to the crowd here, albeit briefly: Mayor Eric Adams has come by, flanked by his security detail, and was soon peppered with questions by reporters.

Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, accused Donald J. Trump of falsifying business records connected to a hush money payment to a porn star. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony counts. Credit Credit... Andrew Seng for The New York Times All 34 felony counts at the center of the Manhattan criminal case against former President Donald J. Trump stem from a $130,000 hush-money payment handed over to a porn star in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe specific charges are far less titillating: falsifying business records in the first degree. But a conviction could still result in jail time.\nThe payment was made by Mr. Trump's fixer, Michael D. Cohen, to Stormy Daniels in order to buy her silence about a sexual liaison she said she had with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump directed him to make the payment.\nPaying hush money is not illegal. But while serving as the commander in chief, prosecutors say, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen in a manner that constituted fraud: In internal records, Mr. Trump's company classified the reimbursement as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet there were no such expenses, according to prosecutors, who say the agreement was also fictional.\nThose records underpin the 34 counts of falsifying business records: 11 involve the checks, 11 center on monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted to the company and 12 involve entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust. Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing.\nIn announcing the charges a year ago, Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, said that his office must keep a close eye on how companies conduct business in New York.\n'This is the business capital of the world,' Mr. Bragg said. 'We regularly do cases involving false business statements. The bedrock — in fact, the basis for business integrity and a well-functioning business marketplace — is true and accurate record-keeping.'\nThe charges against Mr. Trump are all Class E felonies, the lowest category in New York. Each count carries a maximum prison sentence of four years.\nNothing in the law requires the judge, Juan E. Merchan, to imprison Mr. Trump if the jury convicts him. The judge could instead sentence him to probation.\nBut Justice Merchan has made it clear that he takes white-collar crime seriously and could put Mr. Trump behind bars. It's possible, however, if Mr. Trump is convicted of more than one count, Justice Merchan would impose a concurrent sentence, under which Mr. Trump would serve all time simultaneously.\nKey Players in the Trump Criminal Trial › Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET Olivia Bensimon\nOlivia Bensimon Reporting from outside the courthouse Journalists still vastly outnumber the Trump supporters who have gathered near the courthouse today. One man's Stars and Stripes flag flaps in the breeze, two other people are sitting on benches. Neighborhood workers on their lunch breaks bask in the spring sun.\nJury selection is often a lengthy process, but in the first criminal trial of a former American president, currently taking place in a Manhattan criminal courthouse, it's going more slowly than normal.\nIn part, that is because of the nature of the case: Jurors, once seated, will be asked to decide whether Donald J. Trump committed a crime. Prosecutors have charged him with 34 felonies, accusing him of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal that could have hurt his first presidential run.\nBut the process has been particularly drawn-out because, once would-be jurors say they can be fair and impartial, they are being asked a series of 42 questions. After that, they face additional scrutiny from lawyers for the prosecution and the defense.\nHere are the 42 questions:\n1. Without telling us your address, in what neighborhood do you live?

Is there any reason, whether it be a bias or something else, that would prevent you from being fair and impartial if you are selected as a juror for this case?\nNew York State makes no provision for anonymous juries, even in a case as sensitive as this one. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Last month, Justice Juan M. Merchan ordered that prospective jurors' names would be shielded from the public, underscoring the need for privacy for those who may decide Donald J. Trump's criminal fate — and tempt the anger of his followers.\nYet on the first two days of jury selection, several prospective jurors revealed potentially identifying information, reflecting the difficulty of having an anonymous jury in a case with an intense media spotlight.\nOn the first day, a woman said she worked for a city agency of approximately 500 people and revealed its name. Later, a man who identified himself as a bookseller revealed the name of the small store where he works.\nThis continued on Tuesday when others revealed the names of employers. While some worked for companies that were large, where the potential jurors could likely remain unidentifiable, others were less cautious. One woman revealed the name of the three-person company she owns with her husband.\nJustice Merchan did not interject as the prospective jurors divulged the information, nor did he caution them against doing so.\nJuries are not completely anonymous in New York State. Mr. Trump, his lawyers and the prosecutors have access to the names of the prospective jurors. But after a request by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, Justice Merchan decided to withhold the names from the public. Mr. Trump did not oppose the request.\nThe accidental self-identifications are a notable departure from how federal Judge Lewis A. Kaplan conducted jury selection in Mr. Trump's defamation trial in January, brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll.\nIn the federal system, jurors are allowed to remain anonymous, even to parties in the case. Before potential jurors answered basic questions about their backgrounds, Judge Kaplan instructed them not to reveal personal information.\n'Don't give us anything that could enable anybody to pin you down geographically,' he said.\nHe also cautioned them not to reveal their names to each other, and when the trial concluded, he left them with these ominous words: 'My advice to you is that you never disclose that you were on this jury,' Judge Kaplan said. 'And I won't say anything more about it.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 16, 2024, 1:11 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:11 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich\nJonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse The prospective jurors have just been excused for lunch.

We are running 5 to 7 minutes per person.\nThe very premise of the trial is that prosecutors believe Donald J. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times Donald J. Trump first ran for president nearly a decade ago.\nNow, as he runs again in a political climate that he helped create, his Manhattan criminal trial is partly a referendum on his tactics during that first campaign.\nThe trial's very premise is that prosecutors believe Mr. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign — sex scandals involving a porn star and a Playboy model, for example — he concealed them, the prosecutors say.\nBut in a development that will bolster their case, prosecutors on Monday secured permission from the judge to admit evidence connected to Mr. Trump's overall political strategy in 2016. Much of it bears the former president's imprint: aggressive tweets, false denials, coordination with a tabloid publisher and more.\nThe judge's ruling showed how the weapons that worked so well for Mr. Trump then are being turned against him in the courtroom now.\nThe techniques prosecutors highlighted Monday were not invented by Mr. Trump for use in his campaign; they are behaviors he exhibited throughout his life as a businessman and a reality-television star. But in modern American political history, such raw tactics had rarely been seen at such a high level.\nOne example is Mr. Trump's relationship with The National Enquirer tabloid and its publisher, David Pecker, who is expected to appear as a witness.\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case, obtained permission from the judge on Monday to introduce evidence related to a 2015 meeting among Mr. Trump, Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump's former fixer, Michael D. Cohen. A prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, said on Monday that the three men had 'conspired to influence the 2016 election.'\nThat meeting laid the groundwork for hush-money deals with a porn star, Stormy Daniels, and a Playboy model, Karen McDougal. But another result of that meeting, Mr. Steinglass said, were explosive headlines about Mr. Trump's opponents in the Republican primary, including those claiming that Ben Carson had committed 'medical malpractice' and that Senator Ted Cruz had a 'family connection to J.F.K.'s assassin.'\nA lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, protested the admission of evidence related to that meeting, saying that newspaper publishers met with candidates 'all the time,' and that there was nothing improper about it, let alone illegal.\nThat admission worked against him. The judge, Juan M. Merchan, said that he was glad that Mr. Blanche believed that there was nothing wrong with the meeting — because it meant that he should not mind that the evidence would be introduced.\n'There is no reason not to allow it in,' Justice Merchan said.\nMr. Steinglass won again when he persuaded Justice Merchan to admit evidence of the Trump campaign in crisis after the publication in 2016 of the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump boasted about grabbing women by their genitals.\n'The video sent the campaign into a tailspin,' Mr. Steinglass said.\nHe offered up an email sent by a Washington Post reporter to Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump's campaign spokeswoman. Mr. Steinglass said that Ms. Hicks had forwarded the exchange to Stephen K. Bannon, Kellyanne Conway and other members of the campaign team, 'suggesting that their response should be to deny, deny, deny.' Eventually, he said, Mr. Bannon sent it to Mr. Cohen.\nMr. Blanche again protested, but was again rebuffed. The judge said he would allow jurors to see the email, saying that the ensuing thread was relevant.\nThe exchanges that prosecutors and defense lawyers debated on Monday underscored Mr. Trump's penchant for delegating dirty work to others, giving himself some distance in the process.\nThe hush-money deals worked that way: Mr. Cohen paid off Ms. Daniels, while The National Enquirer bought Ms. McDougal's silence. (Mr. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to his reimbursement of Mr. Cohen.)\nThat habit is still on display this year, and can be helpful given that Justice Merchan has barred Mr. Trump from attacking witnesses, prosecutors and the judge's own family.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump posted on social media a video of Laura Loomer, a political ally, in the park outside the courthouse. Ms. Loomer, speaking into a bullhorn, insinuated that the judge's family was politically compromised.\nHad Mr. Trump said that himself, he would have risked violating the judge's gag order.\nApril 16, 2024, 10:51 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 10:51 a.m. ET Kate Christobek\nKate Christobek Reporting from the courthouse Jury selection has been a slow and slogging exercise but there are occasional moments of levity.

Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab New York City courtroom as Mr. Trump looked on.\nBefore jury selection began, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, rejected another effort to force his recusal by the defense, which cited several issues, including his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant.\nHe also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost.\nBut Mr. Trump's lawyers did persuade Justice Merchan that mentioning sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump was recorded bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial.\nEntering the courtroom Monday, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here,' but he looked less enthusiastic in front of Justice Merchan. He quietly slouched and scowled — and at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep.\nBy afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into the courtroom. Some quickly left: When the judge asked the first group of 96 if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused.\nThe remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT The jury selection process in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan could take two weeks or more. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Lawyers representing the State of New York and Donald J. Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate.\nThe potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair.\nThe process could take two weeks or more — and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court.\n'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.'\nThe stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County — Manhattan, as most people know it — which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020.\nMr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions.\nMr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated.\nProsecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28.\nUnlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.'\nSome may not be completely forthcoming.\n'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said.\nMr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors.\n'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Not since Eugene V. Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning.\nFormer President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases: two federal, one in New York and another in Georgia. The first of those to go to trial is the sex scandal cover-up in New York, where jury selection began on Monday.\nFor now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, beyond having to be present in a courtroom, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But some of the cases are proceeding at a pace that could bring verdicts before the election — and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that will arise if he is convicted.\nOthers would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges.\nHere is what we know, and what we don't know.\nThis is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes.\nThe Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be 'natural born' citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years.\nThere are no limitations based on character or criminal record. While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices.\nThe Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground.\n'We let states set the time, place and manner' of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, 'but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don't let the state add new substantive requirements.'\nWhile that view is not universal among legal experts, it prevailed in court in 2019, after California passed a law requiring candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the law from taking effect, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' after taking an oath to support the Constitution.\nNumerous lawsuits had argued that Mr. Trump's actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, met this bar. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine's secretary of state did the same. But the Supreme Court — led by a conservative supermajority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself — concluded that only Congress had the power to enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. (Four of the justices, including the three liberals, wanted to allow a wider range of options for disqualification.)\nCongress is not going to do that with Republicans in control of the House. And the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal cases, meaning convictions would not disqualify Mr. Trump either.\nCongress can designate either groups of people to whom Section 3 applies (such as people who fought for the Confederacy) or specific crimes that, upon conviction, would trigger disqualification, said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University. But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty.\n'Whether or not Trump is tried, convicted, acquitted, that's a separate question from whether or not he's disqualified,' said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nOne of the charges in the federal case related to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election — conspiracy to violate civil rights — once carried a disqualification penalty, Mr. Kreis said, but Congress removed it decades ago.\nNow that Mr. Trump has secured a majority of delegates to the Republican convention, the party has no mechanism to nominate somebody else. Under the party's official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, 'such support shall not be recognized.'\nNor have top Republicans shown any interest in another nominee.\nIf he were forced to withdraw from the race after the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him.\nafter the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him. Probably not.\nMr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony.\nMost felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day.\nHe could also petition for clemency, which would require the approval of the governor — Ron DeSantis, who ran against Mr. Trump in the Republican primary — and two Florida cabinet members. Chris Taylor, the director of external affairs for the Florida Commission on Offender Review, confirmed that a Florida resident convicted of a felony could apply to have their voting rights restored through that process even if their conviction happened outside Florida.\nSince Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison.\nSo if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he could be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote.\nNo one knows.\n'We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 'It's just guessing.'\nLegally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. 'I don't think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,' Professor Levinson said.\nIn practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts.\nIn theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself.\nMore likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump's lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch.\nOn the federal charges only, he could also try to pardon himself — or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a 'self pardon' was constitutional.\nOr President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that 'the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,' Professor Chemerinsky said.\nBut that wouldn't apply to the New York or Georgia cases, because the president does not have pardon power for state charges.\nAgain, no one knows, particularly when it comes to the New York and Georgia cases.\nIn the two federal cases, a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges.\nThe Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents — that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties — applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario.\n'The reasons why we wouldn't want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn't want to prosecute a sitting president,' said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department's reasoning. 'My guess is, if the Trump prosecution were still ongoing in some way and Trump were elected, the Justice Department — which would be the Trump Justice Department — would say, ‘We're following the 1973 memo.''\nLike so much else here, this would be legally untested, and it is impossible to say what the Supreme Court would do if the question reached it.\nIn its Clinton v. Jones ruling in 1997, the court allowed a lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed. But that case was civil, not criminal, and it was filed by a private citizen, not by the government itself.\nCharlie Savage contributed reporting.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",

            "summary": "Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The United States and other members of the United Nations Security Council urged restraint in the Middle East on Sunday, as officials in Israel debated how to respond to a direct attack by Iran over the weekend that threatened to further destabilize the region. Israel's military, with the help of the United States, Britain and Jordan, shot down nearly all of the drones and missiles that Iran fired on Saturday, in what was believed to be the first direct Iranian attack on Israel after years of a shadow war. Life largely returned to normal in Israel on Sunday, and there were indications that the military would not seek to immediately retaliate against Iran, even as tensions remained high in the region. Iranian officials also appeared to signal that its operation against Israel was over. Israel's war cabinet concluded a meeting on Sunday evening without deciding how to respond to Iran's assault, according to an official briefed on the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks more freely. By nightfall, the military had yet to detail possible options, the official said.\nIn public, Israeli ministers appeared divided over how to respond. Benny Gantz, a centrist minister and one of three voting members of the war cabinet, said that Israel should exact a price from Iran, but only 'in a way and at a time that suits us.' Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right minister, then criticized Mr. Gantz for his perceived moderation, arguing that Israel should deter Iran by going 'crazy.'\nThe Biden administration is advising Israel that it does not necessarily need to fire back at Iran, with U.S. officials saying that Israel had proved its ability to protect itself.\nIranian officials issued a series of statements that appeared designed to keep tensions from escalating further. Iran's foreign minister said that Tehran 'has no intention of continuing defensive operations, but if necessary it will not hesitate to protect its legitimate interests against any new aggression.' Residents remove possessions and inspect their homes following Israeli airstrikes in Khan Yunis, Gaza, on Saturday. Israeli military analysts are divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza. Credit...Within moments of Israel and its allies shooting down a fusillade of Iranian missiles and drones this weekend, many began wondering what the latest exchange between Israel and Iran would mean for the war in the Gaza Strip. The Iranian attack was retaliation for what was widely believed to be an Israeli strike this month on an embassy building in Damascus that killed seven Iranian officials, including three top commanders in Iran's armed forces. But it occurred against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel is battling Hamas, a militant group funded and armed by Iran. Israeli military analysts were divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza, now in its sixth month. The next fulcrum in that war could hinge on whether Israel decides to pursue Hamas in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have fled amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis. Some analysts argued that the implications for Gaza would depend on whether Israel responded with a major counterattack against Iran. Others contended that Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip would be unaffected. Shlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and a former director of the Israeli military's strategic planning division, said that if Israel responds with substantial force to the Iranian attack, it could spark a multifront war that would compel the Israeli leadership to move its attention away from Gaza. In the case of a significant regional conflagration, General Brom said, Israel might choose to delay its plans to invade Rafah, which Israeli officials describe as the last Hamas stronghold. 'It's not comfortable for us to have simultaneous, high-intensity wars in multiple theaters,' General Brom added. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to send ground forces into Rafah, despite international pressure to back off the operation. On Sunday, an Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that the Iranian attack would have no effect on the military's plan to invade Rafah. A large-scale direct confrontation with Iran could potentially bring the war in Gaza to a close, General Brom said. But for the war to end in such a way, it would require a broader cease-fire that encompassed several parties, including Israel, Iran and the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. 'There's an idea that in order to resolve a crisis, the situation first needs to become worse,' he said, explaining that an escalation followed by a comprehensive cease-fire with Iran might incline that country to push its regional proxies to stop fighting with Israel. While the members of Israel's war cabinet did not issue a formal statement after meeting on Sunday, a separate Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, indicated that the country would respond to the Iranian assault — although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how. Other military experts, however, dismissed the link between the Iranian attack and the war in Gaza. 'There's no connection at all,' said Amos Gilead, a retired major general who served in Israeli military intelligence. General Gilead said that Israel's army had enough resources to fight against Iran and continue to wage war against Hamas in Gaza. Others analysts made a similar point, arguing that the resources needed to fight Iran were different from those needed in Gaza. Israel needs fighter jets and air defense systems to counter Iran, they said. In contrast, they added, the army mainly requires ground troops, drones, and attack helicopters to fight Hamas in Gaza. 'There's no real tension between these two things,' said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel's National Security Council. Still, General Eiland said that the success of the coalition that repelled the Iranian attack, which included the United States, Britain and Jordan, could inspire Israel to take advantage of the momentum to overcome its declining status internationally by ending the war in Gaza. Though the United States, Israel's closest ally, has broadly supported Israel's decision to go to war in Gaza, it has increasingly signaled its displeasure over the mounting death toll and warned against a major ground assault in Rafah. The support the United States provided Israel on Sunday in shooting down Iranian drones and missiles could give it more leverage over its Israeli counterparts. While General Eiland said such an outcome could help Israel develop good will in the international community and contribute to reaching a solution to end the war in Gaza and skirmishes with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, he was doubtful that Mr. Netanyahu would purse such a path. 'He says he wants to achieve ‘total victory' in Gaza and conquer Rafah, a process that could last two or three months,' he said, referring to the prime minister. 'It's clear Netanyahu has a different mind-set and priorities.' Aaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

Credit... Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, with diplomats urging restraint by all parties to prevent conflict in the region from escalating. The brazen attack this weekend, when Iran launched a barrage of drones and missiles in retaliation for Israel's attacking its embassy compound in Syria earlier in the month, was the first time Iran had launched open attacks against Israel from its soil. The attack has unnerved a region already roiling in conflict, raising concerns among diplomats and U.N. officials that a new, potentially wide and destructive war could spark if both sides don't stand down. António Guterres, the Secretary General of the U.N., told the Council that it was 'time to step back from the brink,' and that its members, as well as the United Nations at large, had the collective responsibility 'to actively engage all parties concerned to prevent further escalation.' The meeting on Sunday was convened at the request of Israel. The Council has not collectively issued a statement condemning Iran's attack, and it has also not issued a statement condemning Israel's attack on Iran's embassy in Damascus that killed several senior commanders. All 15 members of the Council must reach a consensus for a statement to be issued and none was reached on both issues. The Security Council is one of the few venues where adversaries engaged in conflict come face to face and sit in the same chamber. On Sunday, both Israel and Iran's ambassadors were present and delivered fiery comments about the other's country, blaming each other for actions they both called terrorism. Gilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador, said Iran's attack had 'crossed every red line' and Israel reserved the right to retaliate. Mr. Erdan called for the Council to take severe action against Iran, including 'crippling' sanctions and statements of condemnation. 'The fact that Israel's air defense proved to be superior does not change the brutality of Iran's attack,' he said. Iran's ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, said his country had an 'inherent right to self-defense' after Israel's attack on its diplomatic compound. Mr. Iravani said that Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region,' but that if its interests, people or national security came under attack it would 'respond to any such threat or aggressions vigorously and in accordance with international law.' The United States and Iran both said that they do not seek war with one another, but that if one attacks the other's interests, there would be a defensive response. Robert A. Wood, a U.S. representative to the U.N., told the Security Council that the 'U.S. is not seeking escalation, our actions have been defensive in nature,' and said the U.S. goal was to 'de-escalate' and then get back to securing an end to the conflict in Gaza. Mr. Wood said the U.S. planned to bring further action on Iran at the Council and called on the Council to unequivocally condemn Iran's actions. Any resolution against Iran put forth by the U.S. at the Council would likely be vetoed by Russia and China, two of Iran's close allies, who sharply criticized Israel for what they said was reckless violation of international law when it attacked Iran's embassy compound. 'What happened in the night of the 14th of April did not happen in a vacuum,' said Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's ambassador to the U.N. China's ambassador, Dai Bing, called on the Council to 'exercise maximum calm and restraint' and said the implementation of an immediate cease-fire is the 'top priority.' Israel has said that the embassy compound was a legitimate military target because senior commanders from Iran's Quds Forces, the external branch of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, were holding a meeting inside the building.

Shear Reporting from Washington The White House said that President Biden and King Abdullah II of Jordan spoke on Sunday about the Iranian attacks and pledged to stay in contact in the days ahead. Officials said the two men also discussed the situation in Gaza, pledging to increase humanitarian aid and to work to end the conflict as soon as possible.

Ramadan Abed/Reuters As thousands of displaced Palestinians attempted to return to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, Israeli troops fired at the crowd, forcing people to turn back in panic, according to an emergency worker and two people who tried to make the journey. Wafa, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency, reported that five people were killed and 23 wounded by Israeli gunfire and artillery in the incident on Al-Rashid Street south of Gaza City as a crowd of Gazans headed north to their homes. The circumstances of the deaths could not be confirmed independently, and the Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions about whether its forces opened fire on Palestinian civilians trying to cross to northern Gaza. For months, the Israeli military has barred Palestinians who have been displaced by the war in Gaza from returning to their homes in northern Gaza. It has become a sticking point in negotiations between Israel and Hamas. It was not clear why some Palestinians believed that Israel would not block them from returning on Sunday. But they were making the journey on a day when Iran had launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel. More than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its assault there in October, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. The assault occurred in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people. On Sunday morning Jamila Ibrahim, 39, said that she began hearing of some Palestinians who left early and managed to get back to the north. She later spoke with friends who were able to return north. But there were very few. Around 10:30 a.m. she and her three children — who are between 10 and 17 — set out, joining other people on the journey. She said there were no official notices from the Israel military, which has occupied large parts of Gaza after it launched a ground invasion, that residents would be allowed to return to their homes. It was just based on word of mouth, as well as people seeing others leaving and being encouraged to join the trek home, she said. 'Some people were scared, they didn't know what fate they were heading to, they didn't know what would happen,' she said. 'Some were happy that they were going to return.' Most people were on foot — carrying what little food they had or their few belongings in bags and luggage — and some paid large sums of money to go by car, trucks or donkey carts, she said. But they all took the same seaside road, heading north toward an Israeli checkpoint that has cut off southern Gaza from the north. 'There was lots of tension, lots of tension among the people, they were scared they could be shot,' she said. Those who tried to cross north in the middle of the night — around 4 a.m. — managed to make it to the north, she said, based on her conversation with friends who crossed successfully. But later that morning, by the time she and other displaced Palestinians tried to follow, Israeli forces opened fire on them, she said. 'Around 12:30 the Israelis started shooting,' she said. Mazen Al-Harazeen, a first responder in Gaza, said Israeli forces fired weapons and he did not know how many had been killed, but he said, 'There was shooting and martyrs.' Early Sunday morning, Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces, or I.D.F., wrote on social media that the rumors that the army was allowing residents to return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip were false. 'The I.D.F. will not allow the return of residents,' he added. 'For your safety, do not approach the forces operating there.' Nearly 2 million Gazans have been displaced by the war between Hamas and Israel, now in its sixth month. One of their biggest concerns is when and if they will be allowed to return to their homes, or whether they will be permanently displaced, as previous generations were. Around 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes in 1947 and 1948 during the wars surrounding Israel's establishment as a state. Bilal Shbair contributed reporting.

At Amina al-Hasoni's house in the village of al-Fur'ah, Israel, the Iranian attack wounded her and ripped holes in the roof and floor. Credit... Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times The hospital waiting room was quiet on Sunday: There was no crowd of relatives, no flood of patients. Israel's air defenses had just fended off a large-scale Iranian attack, with only one serious casualty recorded. But there was no sense that a crisis had been averted outside the pediatric intensive care unit at Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel's city of Beersheba. Instead, tension filled the air until the doors to the ward swung open and a gasping mother stumbled out, her face contorted. Then raw emotion quickly took its place as she crumbled into a chair, crying. While Israel suffered little in the way of significant damage overnight, this one family was dealt a devastating blow. Amina al-Hasoni, 7, was clinging to life — the sole serious casualty of the Iranian barrage. And were it not for systemic inequities in Israel, her relatives said, maybe she too could have been spared. There are roughly 300,000 Arab Bedouins in the Negev desert. About a quarter of them live in villages that are not recognized by Israeli officials. Without state recognition, those communities have long suffered from a lack of planning and basic services like running water, sewers and electricity. And few have access to bomb shelters, despite repeated requests to the state. The Hasoni family lives in one such community, sharing a hilltop in the Negev village of al-Fur'ah with a plot of disconnected houses. When rocket warning sirens went off on Saturday night, Amina's uncle Ismail said he felt stuck — there was nowhere to go. Booms overhead signaled air defenses intercepting missiles before there was a big explosion. Then he heard a woman screaming — his sister — and 'I started running,' he said. Ismail, 38, found his sister outside her house holding Amina, who was bleeding from the head. Her family had decided to flee the rockets, running out the front door. But Amina, who slept in a back room with pink walls covered in painted butterflies, didn't make it. A missile fragment ripped through the home's thin metal roof, shearing a hole with sharp metallic edges. It made impact just in front of the door — which is where Amina was knocked unconscious. 'I think it hit her while she was running away,' Ismail said. He said he took the injured Amina from his sister and lifted the girl into his own arms. Ismail then tracked down a car that raced her toward the hospital, more than 40 minutes away on a rutted, winding road that fades out in some places, with camels crossing in others. Only then, with Amina on her way, did he go inside the house, where he said he saw a large, black piece of shrapnel about the size of a pretzel jar. And 'there was blood,' he said, a puddle that had turned into a stream across the tile floor, to the front door. By Sunday afternoon, the orange patterned tiles had been cleaned. None of the dozen or so relatives there could say who had done it, only that 'it was bad for the children to see' all the blood. But Ismail hasn't gone back inside. 'It's difficult,' he said, his jeans and boots still spattered with blood. Not far from where he sat, a pink Minnie Mouse blanket and a small black-and-white girl's dress hung on a family clothesline. 'We could have built shelters here,' Ismail added. He dismissed any suggestions that what happened to Amina was bad luck. 'It's part of a policy,' he said. 'We can't do anything.' The missile fragment that tore into Amina's home was one of more than 150 collected in the area on Sunday by police bomb disposal teams, and the family said officers had taken away the piece that hit their home. The teams combed the desert for hours, searching for debris and carting away huge hunks of twisted metal — efforts repeated across Israel. The Hasoni home is not far from a military base, Nevatim, that was reportedly a target of the Iranian assault and that Israeli officials said was lightly damaged. That is little consolation to Amina's father, Muhammad, who spent the morning at the hospital taking turns at her bedside. He didn't say much to her, he said, and just repeated her name. Amina — the youngest of his 14 children — 'likes to laugh and have fun all the time,' said Muhammad, 49. She's a good student with a 'strong personality,' he added, who doesn't always listen to instructions. And she loves to draw. He called Iran's actions 'inhumane.' 'May God demolish them,' he said, without hesitation.

Tomer Neuberg/Associated Press After convening a virtual meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, Group of 7 leaders adopted a joint declaration that reaffirmed their 'full solidarity and support to Israel' and accused Iran of having risked 'provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation' that must be avoided. Iran's attack, which appeared to have been mostly intercepted by Israel and its allies, was carried out in retaliation for Israeli attacks on an Iranian Embassy building in Syria earlier this month. Iranian leaders have signaled that their retaliation is over unless they are attacked again. The joint declaration from the leaders of G7 nations — Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, as well as the European Union — demanded that 'Iran and its proxies cease their attacks.' The leaders said they were ready 'to take further measures now and in response to further destabilizing initiatives.' Hoping to head off Israel from further escalating the conflict, President Biden privately advised Israel against firing back on Iran, U.S. officials said on Sunday. It was not yet clear how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his government would respond. Leaders of the European Union have publicly urged restraint from both countries as they, too, condemned Iran's actions. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, called the attack 'blatant and unjustifiable,' adding that 'all actors must now refrain from further escalation.' Charles Michel, president of the European Council, said that the condemnation from G7 leaders was unanimous and that 'all parties must exercise restraint.' 'Ending the crisis in Gaza as soon as possible, notably through an immediate cease-fire, will make a difference,' Mr. Michel added.

It was not immediately clear what the group had decided about possibly responding to Iran's overnight strikes. Demonstrators gather at Palestine Square in Tehran on Sunday. Credit... Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times Many Iranians stayed glued to their television screens and phones Saturday night, anxiously following updates as their country launched a military attack on Israel and fearing a wider war that would only add to the country's current economic upheaval. In Tehran and several other big cities, lines of cars stretched a mile or more outside gas stations in the middle of the night. Some parents kept their children home from school on Sunday. Tehran's airport closed down, and will remain that way until at least Monday morning. Iranians living inside the country said in interviews that they were worried the confrontation with Israel would spiral out of control and hoped both sides would avoid escalating the conflict. Soheil, a 37-year-old engineer in Isfahan who, like several other Iranians, asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution, said all he and his colleagues could talk about at work on Sunday was the prospect of a broader conflict. 'I'm afraid of war,' he said. 'It will have a great impact on our daily lives, especially on the economy and the price of dollar, and the anxiety will affect our mental health.' Since a strike two weeks ago on the Iranian Embassy complex in Syria that killed three top military commanders, Iran's currency, the rial, has fallen sharply against the U.S. dollar, shrinking purchasing power as Iran's leaders vowed to respond. Nafiseh, a 36-year-old high school teacher in Tehran, said that many of her students did not attend school on Sunday because parents were worried about counterattacks from Israel. 'It's all everyone is talking about, from teenagers to teachers and family members, it's all about the war and attacks,' she said. Supporters of the government hailed the attacks as Iran's showcasing its military might to defend itself on Saturday, with several hundred gathering in Tehran's Palestine Square to celebrate with fireworks and chants of 'Death to Israel.' A large mural on the square depicted Iranian missiles with a message written in Farsi and Hebrew that read, 'Next time the slap will be harder.' On Sunday night, a crowd formed again in the square, carrying signs and chanting anti-Israel slogans. Others took to social media to say they would fight for their country unconditionally if Iran were to go to war. 'When a foreign enemy is involved, honor means standing with our country even at the cost of our lives,' Reza Rashidpour, a civil engineer, wrote on social media. 'Long live Iran, long live soldiers of Iran.' But critics of the government denounced the attacks, seeing them as a misadventure that risks harming ordinary Iranians. Many Iranians oppose government policies that include funding, arming and training groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed group that has increasingly traded fire with Israel since the Oct. 7 attacks that set off the current fighting in Gaza. In protests against the government over the past few years a recurring chant has been, 'No to Gaza, no to Lebanon, my life for Iran.' Ali, a 53-year-old veteran of the Iran-Iraq war who lives in Kerman, said the existence of the Islamic Republic depends on 'crisis.' 'Now they are exploiting the war and the crisis to survive,' he said. April 14, 2024, 4:08 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 4:08 p.m. ET Gaya Gupta Reporting from New York The United Nations Security Council has begun its emergency meeting to address Iran's attacks on Israel. 'The people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating, full-scale conflict,' the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, said in opening remarks. 'Now is the time to defuse and deescalate. Now is the time for maximum restraint.' April 14, 2024, 4:36 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 4:36 p.m. ET For the Security Council to issue any statement condemning Iran's actions all of its 15 members would have to agree — a prospect that appears unlikely, given its recent lack of consensus over issuing condemnation statements on Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks and the attack on the Iranian Embassy compound in Syria, which prompted Iran's strikes.

Hannah Mckay/Reuters After many Israelis spent a long night huddled in bomb shelters, life crept back toward calm on Sunday, even as the people of Israel waited tensely to see how their government would respond to the Iranian strikes that set off rarely heard sirens in Jerusalem. Jerusalem is targeted much less frequently than border communities or the coastal metropolis of Tel Aviv, but during the assault loud booms resounded in the skies, where missiles and interceptors wove around one another like fireflies. In areas of Jerusalem with a mostly Jewish population, many crowded into public bomb shelters, some wearing pajamas and lugging sleeping bags. 'There were more people there than usual,' said Zev Palatnik, 33, who spent some of the night in his building's bomb shelter alongside his neighbors. 'There's a sense that the rockets from Iran are more sophisticated than the ones from Gaza,' he said, adding that there was a higher level of anxiety as a result. But on Sunday, a relatively steady amount of foot traffic flowed in downtown Jerusalem as Israelis returned to work. Ron Cohen, a 37-year-old engineer, said he had hoped that the Israeli government would immediately strike back at Iran, but he did not expect a significant Israeli response. 'Not much, maybe a few small things,' he said. 'Our government knows how to defend, but not how to attack.' For the Israelis among the tens of thousands forced to flee communities along the borders with Gaza and Lebanon, the assault compounded six exhausting months of war. Many expressed uncertainty over the best way for the government to respond. Gidi Lapid, who left his home in Metula, near the border with Lebanon, with his family at the beginning of the war, said Israel might be able to show strength through restrained action. But at the same time, Iranians 'should be the ones in existential dread, in bomb shelters, stocking up on food and water,' Mr. Lapid said by phone from Eliav, a small town near Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem. 'Not our peace-seeking nation.'

Although Hezbollah, Iran's most powerful regional proxy, launched rockets into the Golan Heights amid the overnight attack, it largely remained on the sidelines. April 14, 2024, 2:48 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 2:48 p.m. ET Adam Sella Reporting from Tel Aviv With much attention shifted to Iran, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an Israeli grass-roots citizens' group, reiterated its call for a deal to release the approximately 100 hostages held in Gaza. The group said in a statement that the fear and uncertainty felt by Israelis during Iran's overnight strike 'pale in comparison to the terror, dread, despair, loneliness, cold, physical and mental torment' experienced by the hostages. April 14, 2024, 2:32 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 2:32 p.m. ET Eric Schmitt Reporting from Washington American officials said U.S. fighter jets shot down more than 70 exploding drones in the attack Saturday, while two Navy warships in the eastern Mediterranean destroyed between four and six ballistic missiles and an Army Patriot battery in Iraq knocked down at least one missile that passed overhead. The more than 300 drones and missiles Iran launched was on the high end of what U.S. analysts had expected, one official said.

'We're going to try again this week,' Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday about voting on a bill to aid Israel. Credit... Kenny Holston/The New York Times Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday after Iran's overnight attack on Israel that the House would vote in the coming days on aid for Israel, and he suggested that aid for Ukraine could be included in the legislation. 'House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel,' Mr. Johnson said on Fox News, noting that he had previously advanced two aid bills to help the U.S. ally. 'We're going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together. Right now, we're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.' U.S. funding for both Israel and Ukraine has languished in Congress; Mr. Johnson initially refused to take up a $95 billion aid package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan passed by the Senate, and the Senate refused to take up a House Republican proposal that conditioned aid to Israel on domestic spending cuts. In recent weeks, Mr. Johnson has repeatedly vowed to ensure that the House moves to assist Ukraine. He has been searching for a way to structure a foreign aid package that could secure a critical mass of support amid stiff Republican resistance to sending aid to Kyiv and mounting opposition among Democrats to unfettered military aid for Israel. But the attacks from Iran have ratcheted up the pressure on Mr. Johnson to bring some kind of package to the floor this week, potentially forcing him to make a decision he has been agonizing over for weeks. He left it unclear on Sunday whether the legislation he said the House would advance this week would also include aid for Ukraine. Mr. Johnson said he believed that some proposals around Ukraine aid enjoyed broad support among House Republicans. He noted that he met with former President Donald J. Trump on Friday at his estate in Florida and that Mr. Trump had been supportive of conditioning the aid as a loan. 'I think these are ideas that I think can get consensus, and that's what we've been working through,' Mr. Johnson said. 'We'll send our package. We'll put something together and send it to the Senate and get these obligations completed.' Before the attacks in Israel over the weekend, Mr. Johnson had privately floated bringing up the $95 billion spending package for Ukraine and Israel passed by the Senate in February — and moving it through the House in tandem with a second bill containing policies endorsed by the conservative wing of his party. That plan envisioned two consecutive votes — one on the Senate-passed bill and another on a package of sweeteners geared toward appeasing Republicans who otherwise would be infuriated by Mr. Johnson's decision to push through a bipartisan aid package for Ukraine. Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Sunday that the two conflicts were tied together, and that he hoped they would be addressed together. 'What happened in Israel last night happens in Ukraine every night,' he said on CBS's 'Face The Nation.' Mr. McCaul said that he had previously secured a 'commitment' from Mr. Johnson that a broad national security bill would be brought to the House floor for a vote, but that the timing was unclear. 'My preference,' he said, 'is this week.' Minho Kim contributed reporting.

Iranian officials also appeared to signal that its operation against Israel was over.\nIsrael's war cabinet concluded a meeting on Sunday evening without deciding how to respond to Iran's assault, according to an official briefed on the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks more freely. By nightfall, the military had yet to detail possible options, the official said.\nIn public, Israeli ministers appeared divided over how to respond. Benny Gantz, a centrist minister and one of three voting members of the war cabinet, said that Israel should exact a price from Iran, but only 'in a way and at a time that suits us.'

Israeli military analysts are divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza. Credit...Within moments of Israel and its allies shooting down a fusillade of Iranian missiles and drones this weekend, many began wondering what the latest exchange between Israel and Iran would mean for the war in the Gaza Strip.\nThe Iranian attack was retaliation for what was widely believed to be an Israeli strike this month on an embassy building in Damascus that killed seven Iranian officials, including three top commanders in Iran's armed forces. But it occurred against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel is battling Hamas, a militant group funded and armed by Iran.\nIsraeli military analysts were divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza, now in its sixth month. The next fulcrum in that war could hinge on whether Israel decides to pursue Hamas in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have fled amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis.\nSome analysts argued that the implications for Gaza would depend on whether Israel responded with a major counterattack against Iran. Others contended that Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip would be unaffected.\nShlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and a former director of the Israeli military's strategic planning division, said that if Israel responds with substantial force to the Iranian attack, it could spark a multifront war that would compel the Israeli leadership to move its attention away from Gaza.\nIn the case of a significant regional conflagration, General Brom said, Israel might choose to delay its plans to invade Rafah, which Israeli officials describe as the last Hamas stronghold.\n'It's not comfortable for us to have simultaneous, high-intensity wars in multiple theaters,' General Brom added.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to send ground forces into Rafah, despite international pressure to back off the operation. On Sunday, an Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that the Iranian attack would have no effect on the military's plan to invade Rafah.\nA large-scale direct confrontation with Iran could potentially bring the war in Gaza to a close, General Brom said. But for the war to end in such a way, it would require a broader cease-fire that encompassed several parties, including Israel, Iran and the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.\n'There's an idea that in order to resolve a crisis, the situation first needs to become worse,' he said, explaining that an escalation followed by a comprehensive cease-fire with Iran might incline that country to push its regional proxies to stop fighting with Israel.\nWhile the members of Israel's war cabinet did not issue a formal statement after meeting on Sunday, a separate Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, indicated that the country would respond to the Iranian assault — although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how.\nOther military experts, however, dismissed the link between the Iranian attack and the war in Gaza.\n'There's no connection at all,' said Amos Gilead, a retired major general who served in Israeli military intelligence.\nGeneral Gilead said that Israel's army had enough resources to fight against Iran and continue to wage war against Hamas in Gaza.\nOthers analysts made a similar point, arguing that the resources needed to fight Iran were different from those needed in Gaza. Israel needs fighter jets and air defense systems to counter Iran, they said. In contrast, they added, the army mainly requires ground troops, drones, and attack helicopters to fight Hamas in Gaza.\n'There's no real tension between these two things,' said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel's National Security Council.\nStill, General Eiland said that the success of the coalition that repelled the Iranian attack, which included the United States, Britain and Jordan, could inspire Israel to take advantage of the momentum to overcome its declining status internationally by ending the war in Gaza.\nThough the United States, Israel's closest ally, has broadly supported Israel's decision to go to war in Gaza, it has increasingly signaled its displeasure over the mounting death toll and warned against a major ground assault in Rafah. The support the United States provided Israel on Sunday in shooting down Iranian drones and missiles could give it more leverage over its Israeli counterparts.\nWhile General Eiland said such an outcome could help Israel develop good will in the international community and contribute to reaching a solution to end the war in Gaza and skirmishes with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, he was doubtful that Mr. Netanyahu would purse such a path.\n'He says he wants to achieve ‘total victory' in Gaza and conquer Rafah, a process that could last two or three months,' he said, referring to the prime minister. 'It's clear Netanyahu has a different mind-set and priorities.'\nAaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.\nWhere air defense systems were seen intercepting missiles or drones Damage or other evidence of attack visible\nWhere air defense systems were seen intercepting missiles or drones Damage or other evidence of attack visible United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addresses the United Nations Security Council during an emergency meeting at U.N. headquarters on Sunday. Credit... Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, with diplomats urging restraint by all parties to prevent conflict in the region from escalating.\nThe brazen attack this weekend, when Iran launched a barrage of drones and missiles in retaliation for Israel's attacking its embassy compound in Syria earlier in the month, was the first time Iran had launched open attacks against Israel from its soil. The attack has unnerved a region already roiling in conflict, raising concerns among diplomats and U.N. officials that a new, potentially wide and destructive war could spark if both sides don't stand down.\nAntónio Guterres, the Secretary General of the U.N., told the Council that it was 'time to step back from the brink,' and that its members, as well as the United Nations at large, had the collective responsibility 'to actively engage all parties concerned to prevent further escalation.'\nThe meeting on Sunday was convened at the request of Israel. The Council has not collectively issued a statement condemning Iran's attack, and it has also not issued a statement condemning Israel's attack on Iran's embassy in Damascus that killed several senior commanders. All 15 members of the Council must reach a consensus for a statement to be issued and none was reached on both issues.\nThe Security Council is one of the few venues where adversaries engaged in conflict come face to face and sit in the same chamber. On Sunday, both Israel and Iran's ambassadors were present and delivered fiery comments about the other's country, blaming each other for actions they both called terrorism.\nGilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador, said Iran's attack had 'crossed every red line' and Israel reserved the right to retaliate. Mr. Erdan called for the Council to take severe action against Iran, including 'crippling' sanctions and statements of condemnation.\n'The fact that Israel's air defense proved to be superior does not change the brutality of Iran's attack,' he said.\nIran's ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, said his country had an 'inherent right to self-defense' after Israel's attack on its diplomatic compound. Mr. Iravani said that Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region,' but that if its interests, people or national security came under attack it would 'respond to any such threat or aggressions vigorously and in accordance with international law.'\nThe United States and Iran both said that they do not seek war with one another, but that if one attacks the other's interests, there would be a defensive response.\nRobert A. Wood, a U.S. representative to the U.N., told the Security Council that the 'U.S. is not seeking escalation, our actions have been defensive in nature,' and said the U.S. goal was to 'de-escalate' and then get back to securing an end to the conflict in Gaza. Mr. Wood said the U.S. planned to bring further action on Iran at the Council and called on the Council to unequivocally condemn Iran's actions.\nAny resolution against Iran put forth by the U.S. at the Council would likely be vetoed by Russia and China, two of Iran's close allies, who sharply criticized Israel for what they said was reckless violation of international law when it attacked Iran's embassy compound.\n'What happened in the night of the 14th of April did not happen in a vacuum,' said Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's ambassador to the U.N.\nChina's ambassador, Dai Bing, called on the Council to 'exercise maximum calm and restraint' and said the implementation of an immediate cease-fire is the 'top priority.'\nIsrael has said that the embassy compound was a legitimate military target because senior commanders from Iran's Quds Forces, the external branch of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, were holding a meeting inside the building.\nApril 14, 2024, 7:11 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 7:11 p.m. ET Michael D.

Ramadan Abed/Reuters As thousands of displaced Palestinians attempted to return to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, Israeli troops fired at the crowd, forcing people to turn back in panic, according to an emergency worker and two people who tried to make the journey.\nWafa, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency, reported that five people were killed and 23 wounded by Israeli gunfire and artillery in the incident on Al-Rashid Street south of Gaza City as a crowd of Gazans headed north to their homes.\nThe circumstances of the deaths could not be confirmed independently, and the Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions about whether its forces opened fire on Palestinian civilians trying to cross to northern Gaza.\nFor months, the Israeli military has barred Palestinians who have been displaced by the war in Gaza from returning to their homes in northern Gaza. It has become a sticking point in negotiations between Israel and Hamas.\nIt was not clear why some Palestinians believed that Israel would not block them from returning on Sunday. But they were making the journey on a day when Iran had launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel.\nMore than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its assault there in October, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. The assault occurred in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people.\nOn Sunday morning Jamila Ibrahim, 39, said that she began hearing of some Palestinians who left early and managed to get back to the north. She later spoke with friends who were able to return north. But there were very few.\nAround 10:30 a.m. she and her three children — who are between 10 and 17 — set out, joining other people on the journey.\nShe said there were no official notices from the Israel military, which has occupied large parts of Gaza after it launched a ground invasion, that residents would be allowed to return to their homes. It was just based on word of mouth, as well as people seeing others leaving and being encouraged to join the trek home, she said.\n'Some people were scared, they didn't know what fate they were heading to, they didn't know what would happen,' she said. 'Some were happy that they were going to return.'\nMost people were on foot — carrying what little food they had or their few belongings in bags and luggage — and some paid large sums of money to go by car, trucks or donkey carts, she said. But they all took the same seaside road, heading north toward an Israeli checkpoint that has cut off southern Gaza from the north.\n'There was lots of tension, lots of tension among the people, they were scared they could be shot,' she said.\nThose who tried to cross north in the middle of the night — around 4 a.m. — managed to make it to the north, she said, based on her conversation with friends who crossed successfully.\nBut later that morning, by the time she and other displaced Palestinians tried to follow, Israeli forces opened fire on them, she said.\n'Around 12:30 the Israelis started shooting,' she said.\nMazen Al-Harazeen, a first responder in Gaza, said Israeli forces fired weapons and he did not know how many had been killed, but he said, 'There was shooting and martyrs.'\nEarly Sunday morning, Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces, or I.D.F., wrote on social media that the rumors that the army was allowing residents to return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip were false.\n'The I.D.F. will not allow the return of residents,' he added. 'For your safety, do not approach the forces operating there.'\nNearly 2 million Gazans have been displaced by the war between Hamas and Israel, now in its sixth month. One of their biggest concerns is when and if they will be allowed to return to their homes, or whether they will be permanently displaced, as previous generations were.\nAround 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes in 1947 and 1948 during the wars surrounding Israel's establishment as a state.\nBilal Shbair contributed reporting.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:49 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:49 p.m. ET Aaron Boxerman\nAaron Boxerman Reporting from Jerusalem While Israel's war cabinet members didn't issue a formal statement after the meeting, an Israeli official familiar with the discussions indicated that Israel would undoubtedly respond — although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how.

Credit... Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times The hospital waiting room was quiet on Sunday: There was no crowd of relatives, no flood of patients. Israel's air defenses had just fended off a large-scale Iranian attack, with only one serious casualty recorded.\nBut there was no sense that a crisis had been averted outside the pediatric intensive care unit at Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel's city of Beersheba. Instead, tension filled the air until the doors to the ward swung open and a gasping mother stumbled out, her face contorted. Then raw emotion quickly took its place as she crumbled into a chair, crying.\nWhile Israel suffered little in the way of significant damage overnight, this one family was dealt a devastating blow. Amina al-Hasoni, 7, was clinging to life — the sole serious casualty of the Iranian barrage. And were it not for systemic inequities in Israel, her relatives said, maybe she too could have been spared.\nThere are roughly 300,000 Arab Bedouins in the Negev desert. About a quarter of them live in villages that are not recognized by Israeli officials. Without state recognition, those communities have long suffered from a lack of planning and basic services like running water, sewers and electricity. And few have access to bomb shelters, despite repeated requests to the state.\nThe Hasoni family lives in one such community, sharing a hilltop in the Negev village of al-Fur'ah with a plot of disconnected houses. When rocket warning sirens went off on Saturday night, Amina's uncle Ismail said he felt stuck — there was nowhere to go.\nBooms overhead signaled air defenses intercepting missiles before there was a big explosion. Then he heard a woman screaming — his sister — and 'I started running,' he said.\nIsmail, 38, found his sister outside her house holding Amina, who was bleeding from the head. Her family had decided to flee the rockets, running out the front door. But Amina, who slept in a back room with pink walls covered in painted butterflies, didn't make it.\nA missile fragment ripped through the home's thin metal roof, shearing a hole with sharp metallic edges. It made impact just in front of the door — which is where Amina was knocked unconscious.\n'I think it hit her while she was running away,' Ismail said.\nHe said he took the injured Amina from his sister and lifted the girl into his own arms. Ismail then tracked down a car that raced her toward the hospital, more than 40 minutes away on a rutted, winding road that fades out in some places, with camels crossing in others.\nOnly then, with Amina on her way, did he go inside the house, where he said he saw a large, black piece of shrapnel about the size of a pretzel jar. And 'there was blood,' he said, a puddle that had turned into a stream across the tile floor, to the front door.\nBy Sunday afternoon, the orange patterned tiles had been cleaned. None of the dozen or so relatives there could say who had done it, only that 'it was bad for the children to see' all the blood. But Ismail hasn't gone back inside.\n'It's difficult,' he said, his jeans and boots still spattered with blood. Not far from where he sat, a pink Minnie Mouse blanket and a small black-and-white girl's dress hung on a family clothesline.\n'We could have built shelters here,' Ismail added.\nHe dismissed any suggestions that what happened to Amina was bad luck.\n'It's part of a policy,' he said. 'We can't do anything.'\nThe missile fragment that tore into Amina's home was one of more than 150 collected in the area on Sunday by police bomb disposal teams, and the family said officers had taken away the piece that hit their home. The teams combed the desert for hours, searching for debris and carting away huge hunks of twisted metal — efforts repeated across Israel.\nThe Hasoni home is not far from a military base, Nevatim, that was reportedly a target of the Iranian assault and that Israeli officials said was lightly damaged.\nThat is little consolation to Amina's father, Muhammad, who spent the morning at the hospital taking turns at her bedside. He didn't say much to her, he said, and just repeated her name.\nAmina — the youngest of his 14 children — 'likes to laugh and have fun all the time,' said Muhammad, 49. She's a good student with a 'strong personality,' he added, who doesn't always listen to instructions. And she loves to draw.\nHe called Iran's actions 'inhumane.'\n'May God demolish them,' he said, without hesitation.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET Iran's ambassador to the U.N., Amir Saeid Iravani, addressed the Council after his Israeli counterpart and defended his country's actions as the 'inherent right to self-defense' in response to the attack on its diplomatic compound in Syria two weeks ago.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET Iravani said Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region' and has 'no intention' of engaging in conflict with the United States, but warned that it would respond proportionately if Israel or the U.S. military were to attack Iran or its interests.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:26 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:26 p.m. ET Israel's U.N. ambassador, Gilad Erdan, who had requested the emergency meeting of the Security Council, assailed Iran and its proxies, saying Iran had crossed every red line in its attack and that Israel reserved the right to retaliate.

Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times Many Iranians stayed glued to their television screens and phones Saturday night, anxiously following updates as their country launched a military attack on Israel and fearing a wider war that would only add to the country's current economic upheaval.\nIn Tehran and several other big cities, lines of cars stretched a mile or more outside gas stations in the middle of the night. Some parents kept their children home from school on Sunday. Tehran's airport closed down, and will remain that way until at least Monday morning.\nIranians living inside the country said in interviews that they were worried the confrontation with Israel would spiral out of control and hoped both sides would avoid escalating the conflict.\nSoheil, a 37-year-old engineer in Isfahan who, like several other Iranians, asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution, said all he and his colleagues could talk about at work on Sunday was the prospect of a broader conflict.\n'I'm afraid of war,' he said. 'It will have a great impact on our daily lives, especially on the economy and the price of dollar, and the anxiety will affect our mental health.'\nSince a strike two weeks ago on the Iranian Embassy complex in Syria that killed three top military commanders, Iran's currency, the rial, has fallen sharply against the U.S. dollar, shrinking purchasing power as Iran's leaders vowed to respond.\nNafiseh, a 36-year-old high school teacher in Tehran, said that many of her students did not attend school on Sunday because parents were worried about counterattacks from Israel. 'It's all everyone is talking about, from teenagers to teachers and family members, it's all about the war and attacks,' she said.\nSupporters of the government hailed the attacks as Iran's showcasing its military might to defend itself on Saturday, with several hundred gathering in Tehran's Palestine Square to celebrate with fireworks and chants of 'Death to Israel.' A large mural on the square depicted Iranian missiles with a message written in Farsi and Hebrew that read, 'Next time the slap will be harder.' On Sunday night, a crowd formed again in the square, carrying signs and chanting anti-Israel slogans.\nOthers took to social media to say they would fight for their country unconditionally if Iran were to go to war.\n'When a foreign enemy is involved, honor means standing with our country even at the cost of our lives,' Reza Rashidpour, a civil engineer, wrote on social media. 'Long live Iran, long live soldiers of Iran.'\nBut critics of the government denounced the attacks, seeing them as a misadventure that risks harming ordinary Iranians.\nMany Iranians oppose government policies that include funding, arming and training groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed group that has increasingly traded fire with Israel since the Oct. 7 attacks that set off the current fighting in Gaza. In protests against the government over the past few years a recurring chant has been, 'No to Gaza, no to Lebanon, my life for Iran.'\nAli, a 53-year-old veteran of the Iran-Iraq war who lives in Kerman, said the existence of the Islamic Republic depends on 'crisis.'\n'Now they are exploiting the war and the crisis to survive,' he said.\nApril 14, 2024, 4:08 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 4:08 p.m. ET Gaya Gupta\nGaya Gupta Reporting from New York The United Nations Security Council has begun its emergency meeting to address Iran's attacks on Israel.

Hannah Mckay/Reuters After many Israelis spent a long night huddled in bomb shelters, life crept back toward calm on Sunday, even as the people of Israel waited tensely to see how their government would respond to the Iranian strikes that set off rarely heard sirens in Jerusalem.\nJerusalem is targeted much less frequently than border communities or the coastal metropolis of Tel Aviv, but during the assault loud booms resounded in the skies, where missiles and interceptors wove around one another like fireflies.\nIn areas of Jerusalem with a mostly Jewish population, many crowded into public bomb shelters, some wearing pajamas and lugging sleeping bags.\n'There were more people there than usual,' said Zev Palatnik, 33, who spent some of the night in his building's bomb shelter alongside his neighbors. 'There's a sense that the rockets from Iran are more sophisticated than the ones from Gaza,' he said, adding that there was a higher level of anxiety as a result.\nBut on Sunday, a relatively steady amount of foot traffic flowed in downtown Jerusalem as Israelis returned to work. Ron Cohen, a 37-year-old engineer, said he had hoped that the Israeli government would immediately strike back at Iran, but he did not expect a significant Israeli response.\n'Not much, maybe a few small things,' he said. 'Our government knows how to defend, but not how to attack.'\nFor the Israelis among the tens of thousands forced to flee communities along the borders with Gaza and Lebanon, the assault compounded six exhausting months of war. Many expressed uncertainty over the best way for the government to respond.\nGidi Lapid, who left his home in Metula, near the border with Lebanon, with his family at the beginning of the war, said Israel might be able to show strength through restrained action.\nBut at the same time, Iranians 'should be the ones in existential dread, in bomb shelters, stocking up on food and water,' Mr. Lapid said by phone from Eliav, a small town near Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem.

Kenny Holston/The New York Times Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday after Iran's overnight attack on Israel that the House would vote in the coming days on aid for Israel, and he suggested that aid for Ukraine could be included in the legislation.\n'House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel,' Mr. Johnson said on Fox News, noting that he had previously advanced two aid bills to help the U.S. ally. 'We're going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together. Right now, we're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.'\nU.S. funding for both Israel and Ukraine has languished in Congress; Mr. Johnson initially refused to take up a $95 billion aid package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan passed by the Senate, and the Senate refused to take up a House Republican proposal that conditioned aid to Israel on domestic spending cuts.\nIn recent weeks, Mr. Johnson has repeatedly vowed to ensure that the House moves to assist Ukraine. He has been searching for a way to structure a foreign aid package that could secure a critical mass of support amid stiff Republican resistance to sending aid to Kyiv and mounting opposition among Democrats to unfettered military aid for Israel.\nBut the attacks from Iran have ratcheted up the pressure on Mr. Johnson to bring some kind of package to the floor this week, potentially forcing him to make a decision he has been agonizing over for weeks.\nHe left it unclear on Sunday whether the legislation he said the House would advance this week would also include aid for Ukraine.\nMr. Johnson said he believed that some proposals around Ukraine aid enjoyed broad support among House Republicans. He noted that he met with former President Donald J. Trump on Friday at his estate in Florida and that Mr. Trump had been supportive of conditioning the aid as a loan.\n'I think these are ideas that I think can get consensus, and that's what we've been working through,' Mr. Johnson said. 'We'll send our package. We'll put something together and send it to the Senate and get these obligations completed.'\nBefore the attacks in Israel over the weekend, Mr. Johnson had privately floated bringing up the $95 billion spending package for Ukraine and Israel passed by the Senate in February — and moving it through the House in tandem with a second bill containing policies endorsed by the conservative wing of his party. That plan envisioned two consecutive votes — one on the Senate-passed bill and another on a package of sweeteners geared toward appeasing Republicans who otherwise would be infuriated by Mr. Johnson's decision to push through a bipartisan aid package for Ukraine.\nRepresentative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Sunday that the two conflicts were tied together, and that he hoped they would be addressed together. 'What happened in Israel last night happens in Ukraine every night,' he said on CBS's 'Face The Nation.'\nMr. McCaul said that he had previously secured a 'commitment' from Mr. Johnson that a broad national security bill would be brought to the House floor for a vote, but that the timing was unclear.\n'My preference,' he said, 'is this week.'\nMinho Kim contributed reporting.\nApril 14, 2024, 1:02 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 1:02 p.m. ET Adam Sella\nAdam Sella Reporting from Tel Aviv The Israeli military said in a statement that it is calling up 'approximately two reserve brigades for operational activities on the Gaza front.'

Credit... Jim Hollander/EPA, via Shutterstock In a deeply divided Israel, even the dramatic scene above the country's skies on Sunday is open to political interpretation.\nFor supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's display of defensive technology against an Iranian salvo that included hundreds of drones and missiles proves Mr. Netanyahu has long been right to warn about the threat posed by Iran.\nHis opponents are loath to give him any credit, reserving their praise for the air force.\n'Like everything in Israel in recent years, the story is split into two narratives,' said Mazal Mualem, an Israeli political commentator for Al-Monitor, a Middle East news site, and the author of a recent biography of the Israeli leader.\n'The division and polarization in Israeli society prevents people from seeing the full picture,' Ms. Mualem added.\nIran's barrage on Sunday, launched in response to an Israeli attack on an Iranian Embassy building this month in Damascus that killed several high-ranking commanders in Iran's armed forces, came at a perilous time for Mr. Netanyahu.\nAt home, he is an unpopular leader whom many hold responsible for his government's policy and intelligence failures that led to the deadly Hamas-led attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, which prompted Israel to go to war in Gaza. Abroad, he is the focus of international censure over Israel's prosecution of that war, which has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Gazans.\nHow he ultimately emerges from this episode may depend on what happens next.\nMr. Netanyahu now must make a choice. Will he respond to Iran with a forceful counterattack and potentially entangle Israel and other countries in a broader war? Or will he absorb the attack, which gravely injured one 7-year-old girl but otherwise did limited damage, and defer to the coalition that helped defend Israel in the interests of regional stability?\nIsrael's allies have been urging restraint.\n'The question is whether Israel is going to retaliate immediately, or surprise the Iranians in one way or another,' said Efraim Halevy, who served as director of Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, during the latter part of Mr. Netanyahu's first term in the 1990s.\nNo Israeli leader has warned about Iran so consistently as Mr. Netanyahu or, for that matter, has spent so long in office. Israel's longest serving prime minister, he has been in power for about 17 years overall.\nSince his first year in office in 1996, Mr. Netanyahu warned that a nuclear Iran would be catastrophic and that time was running out. For the nearly three decades since, he has been sounding the same alarm.\nIran maintains a network of proxy militias across the region, including in Gaza, which the government funds and supplies with weapons. Some of those militias in Yemen, Syria and Lebanon have battled with Israel, creating distractions for the Israeli government and military amid the war with Hamas.\nBut perhaps more troubling, experts say, is that Iran is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon. Mr. Netanyahu's backers still credit him with having put Iran's nuclear program on the world agenda then, and they praise him now for investing in the mighty, multilayered air defense system that allowed Israel and its allies, including the United States, to intercept the vast majority of Iranian drones and missiles this weekend before they reached Israel.\nSometimes resorting to gimmicks and antics to draw attention to Iran's nuclear progress, Mr. Netanyahu has in the past made opposing Iran a key part of his global diplomacy. Once, at the United Nations General Assembly he held up a cartoonish drawing of a bomb marked with red lines depicting enrichment levels. Another time, at the Munich Security Conference, he waved around a piece of wreckage from what he said was an Iranian drone sent from Syria and shot down by Israel.\n'Everywhere he went he was talking about it,' recalled Jeremy Issacharoff, a former Israeli ambassador to Germany and for years the Ministry of Foreign Affairs point man coordinating diplomatic efforts on regional security and the Iranian threat.\nAt times, Mr. Netanyahu's campaign against Iran has severely strained Israel's relations with American presidents, though bipartisan U.S. support for Israel has long been considered a strategic asset.\nAround 2012, Mr. Netanyahu infuriated the Obama administration by pushing hard for President Barack Obama to set clear 'red lines' on Iran's nuclear progress that would prompt the United States to undertake a military strike. Before that, the Israeli prime minister was making plans for a unilateral Israeli strike in the face of tough opposition from Washington and public criticism from a string of former Israeli security chiefs. It was never clear if Mr. Netanyahu was bluffing, and the prospect of an imminent strike receded.\nHe further challenged Mr. Obama in 2015 with an impassioned speech to a joint meeting of Congress denouncing what he called a 'bad deal' being negotiated by the United States and other world powers with Iran to curb its nuclear program.\nWhen President Donald J. Trump came to power, Mr. Netanyahu encouraged him to withdraw from the agreement — a move that many Israeli experts have called a dire mistake and a failure of Mr. Netanyahu's Iran policy.\n'Since then, there have been no constraints on the program,' Mr. Issacharoff said, adding, 'It has never been more advanced.'\nBut it was also under Mr. Netanyahu's watch that Israel forged diplomatic relations with more Arab states that are considered part of the moderate, anti-Iranian axis, including the United Arab Emirates.\nRegardless of what comes next, Ms. Mualem, the Netanyahu biographer, said, 'Bibi is still in the game,' referring to him by his nickname. 'He's a central player, and it isn't over, diplomatically or politically. And he plays a long game.'\nMourners on Sunday with the bodies of Palestinians in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip. Credit... Ramadan Abed/Reuters As the world's attention shifted to Iran's attack on Israel, Palestinians in Gaza experienced a relatively calm night for the first time in more than six months but were quickly jolted back to reality when airstrikes there continued on Sunday morning.\nWhile Iranian drones and aircraft were making their way to Israeli territory on Saturday night, the incessant noise of Israeli drones and warplanes disappeared from Gaza's skies, residents said.\n'Finally some calmness after six months of buzzing and noises!' Yousef Mema, a Gazan activist with a significant social media following, wrote on Instagram.\nAnother influencer, Mahmoud Shurrab, recorded himself walking in the middle of the street, the skies overhead quiet. 'I can't believe it, silence,' he said in a video posted on Instagram.\nThe calm did not last. The Israeli military said on Sunday that its forces were pressing on with a raid in the central Gaza Strip for the fourth day, where they 'eliminated dozens of terrorists in face-to-face battles and with air support.' And Wafa, the Palestinian Authority news agency, reported that several Palestinians had been killed in a strike on a home in Nuseirat in central Gaza, and that at least eight others were wounded in a strike on three homes in Beit Hanoun, a city in the northeast of the strip.\nSome Palestinians worried that an escalation between Israel and Iran would distract from the dire situation in the Gaza Strip, potentially diverting international attention from the Israeli bombardment and looming famine there.\n'I think it is not at all in the Palestinians' side or favor to have a new front open with Israel,' said Amer Nasser, 64. 'This will distract the people around the world from seeing what is happening in Gaza,' he added.\nFor many, the Iranian attack was unexpected.\nFayez al-Samman, a 76-year-old car trader from Gaza City who is sheltering in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza, said he spent the night listening to the news on the radio. 'It was a surprise for me when I heard the missiles were targeting Israeli sites,' he said.\nOsama al-Hato, 53, another man from Gaza City staying in Deir al-Balah, said he was happy that Iran had targeted Israel. 'However, I did not follow the news nor expect the Iranian reaction to this extent,' he added.\nAymen Zidan, 57, a wholesale vegetable supplier from Deir al-Balah, said he had had little expectation that Iran would target Israel, although he believed Iran's attack was for its own interests, not for the sake of Palestinians in Gaza like him.\nEven so, he said, he felt 'relieved that there is a country that said no to Israel.'\nRaja Abdulrahim contributed reporting from New York.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",

            "summary": "On Monday, Donald J. Trump is set to become the first former U.S. president to face a criminal trial. Manhattan prosecutors charged him last year with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, accusing Mr. Trump of covering up a sex scandal with the porn star Stormy Daniels around the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has pleaded not guilty.\nJustice Merchan presided over the 2022 criminal trial and conviction of the Trump Organization and some of its executives, fining the company the maximum penalty of $1.6 million. A 17-year veteran of the court, Justice Merchan has been subject to verbal attacks by Mr. Trump, who has also targeted the judge's family.\nJust before the 2016 election, Ms. Daniels received a $130,000 hush-money payment from Mr. Trump's attorney, Michael Cohen, in exchange for her silence about her story of a 2006 sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. The former president has denied the encounter, and has frequently attacked Ms. Daniels since the payment became public in 2018.\nMr. Cohen has said that the hush-money payment he made to Ms. Daniels was paid at Mr. Trump's direction. He has also said that Mr. Trump covered up the deal through a series of reimbursements to Mr. Cohen, in order to avoid a sex scandal during and after the 2016 election. Mr. Cohen later served time in prison after pleading guilty in 2018 to federal campaign finance charges related to the hush-money scheme. Mr. Trump has called Mr. Cohen a liar and tried to block his testimony in this case by accusing him of perjury.\nLeading up to the 2016 election, Mr. Pecker, who was the publisher at the time, agreed to work with Mr. Cohen to suppress negative stories about Mr. Trump, a practice known in the tabloid world as 'catch and kill.' Mr. Pecker, a longtime Trump friend, brokered the hush-money deals with Ms. Daniels and a former former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump.\nIn the effort to bury negative stories about Mr. Trump before the 2016 election, Mr. Howard, who was the editor at the time, connected Mr. Cohen with a lawyer for Ms. Daniels, setting the hush-money deal in motion.\nAs part of the scheme to suppress negative stories about Mr. Trump before the 2016 election, American Media Inc., the parent company to the National Enquirer, paid Ms. McDougal $150,000 for the rights to her story of an affair with Mr. Trump in order to bury it. Mr. Trump denies the affair.\nIn October 2016, Mr. Davidson negotiated the hush-money deal with Mr. Cohen to buy Ms. Daniels's silence about the sexual encounter she said she had with Mr. Trump.\nMs. Hicks, who worked on Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign and served in the White House until 2018, spoke with Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen in 2016 on the day they learned that Ms. Daniels wanted money for her story, and again with Mr. Cohen on the day after he wired the $130,000 payment to Ms. Daniels's lawyer.\nMr. McConney facilitated payments to Mr. Cohen – which served as reimbursement for the $130,000 paid to Ms. Daniels – that were falsely described as 'legal expenses' in Trump Organization payment records.\nMr. Garten previously told a federal judge that payments by the Trump Organization to Mr. Cohen in 2017 were to reimburse him for a settlement payment to Ms. Daniels, and to compensate him for private counsel services for Mr. Trump.\nOut of various Trump investigations he inherited when he took office in 2022, Mr. Bragg zeroed in on the hush-money deal and resurrected the case, leading last year to Mr. Trump's first criminal indictment. Now Mr. Bragg is set to be the first criminal prosecutor to put Mr. Trump on trial, which has made him a frequent target of the former president's attacks.\nA former high-ranking official at the New York attorney general's office, Mr. Colangelo previously led a civil inquiry into Mr. Trump and oversaw an investigation into the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which led to its dissolution.\nAfter helping to lead the effort to convict the Trump Organization in 2022, Mr. Steinglass was recently added to the prosecution team. He typically prosecutes significant violent crime and secured a conviction against two Proud Boy extremists for a violent brawl in 2019.\nMr. Conroy, who has been at the Manhattan district attorney's office since 1996 and previously led the major economic crimes unit, has worked on the investigations into Mr. Trump longer than any other member of the team.\nShe joined Mr. Bragg's major economic crimes unit in 2022 after clerking for a U.S. District Court judge in New Jersey and working in private practice on criminal and regulatory investigations.\nA former federal prosecutor, Mr. Blanche left a large law firm to defend Mr. Trump in this case. He is also representing Mr. Trump in the federal classified documents case and the federal election interference case.\nA lawyer for Mr. Trump since 2021, Ms. Necheles also represented the Trump Organization in the criminal tax fraud trial in Manhattan, which resulted in a conviction and $1.6 million fine. She previously represented defendants in major organized-crime and public-corruption cases.\nAs a law partner to Ms. Necheles, Mr. Stern also defended the Trump Organization in its criminal tax fraud trial and has previously represented clients charged with bribery, fraud and conspiracy.\nThe newest addition to Mr. Trump's trial team, Mr. Bove served as a federal prosecutor in New York before turning to private practice where he has represented defendants charged with white-collar crimes.",

            "summary": "Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis. The case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces. The issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years. The dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. A group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter. City officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond. Here's what else to know: The case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution. 'The city of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town,' the lawsuit said. 'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness — policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances — the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks. April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET The argument is scheduled for 65 minutes. But it will probably last more than twice that long. April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET The stakes are high. In San Francisco, which is embroiled in a lawsuit over encampments, city officials have complained for months that a sweeping injunction based on the Grants Pass decision and other Ninth Circuit rulings has complicated law enforcement around downtown tent camps. Over the weekend, I asked Senator Scott Wiener, a Democratic legislator who represents San Francisco, what he was hoping for from the Supreme Court. 'Certainty,' he told me, 'because things have been chaotic here.'  April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET In briefs on the case, California leaders have tried to take a nuanced position, arguing, in essence, that they don't want to criminalize homelessness but need more flexibility to clear the most dangerous encampments and compel people to take shelter when it is offered. This tricky balance was reflected in Gov. Gavin Newsom's brief 'in support of neither party.' April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET Outside the Supreme Court building this morning, activists hoping to protect the rights of homeless people have gathered with signs that call for 'Housing Not Handcuffs.'

Mark Abramson for The New York Times Tent encampments lining public parks and city sidewalks. Piles of garbage, human waste and used needles. According to leaders across the political spectrum who have asked the Supreme Court to address homelessness, those are the consequences of a sharp increase in homelessness that have forced many cities to 'a breaking point.' Although the case before the court on Monday centers on the narrow issue of whether the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment shields homeless people with no options for shelter from fines, fees and jail time, officials and advocates across the country are watching the case closely for its potential to reshape homelessness policy. The case underscores deep divisions over how best to address homelessness and how much leeway to give to local and state officials to help solve the problem. Theane Evangelis, a lawyer for the city of Grants Pass, Ore., who also represented the city of Boise, Idaho, in a similar case in 2018, warned that 'the stakes could not be higher for every city in the country.' If the Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling on behalf of the homeless plaintiffs, she added, cities everywhere 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.' Those who side with the homeless plaintiffs counter that the issue before the court is a focused one, on how to interpret the Constitution. The cities' willingness to embrace solutions like more affordable housing will determine whether the homelessness crisis will begin to abate, they say. 'The first thing for folks who aren't in this field — or understanding the nuances of this case — to understand is that nobody wants a country where people are forced to sleep outside,' said Ann Oliva, chief executive of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, an advocacy group founded in the 1980s with bipartisan roots. In briefs, supporters of Grants Pass have contended that local and state policymakers, not judges, are best placed to devise homelessness policies. The cases from Grants Pass and Boise had allowed 'federal judges to serve as the nation's ‘homelessness policy czars,'' wrote the Cicero Institute, a Texas policy group critical of longstanding federal policy that channels funds to programs to provide the homeless with permanent housing without requiring people to undergo mental health or drug treatment. Lawyers for the National Alliance to End Homelessness say that imposing penalties, rather than providing housing and services, ignores the roots of the issue. In its brief to the court, the group said that the city of Grants Pass and its defenders, 'rather than working to end it,' sought 'to banish homeless people out of sight and out of mind.' 'The threat of criminal penalties does not reduce homelessness,' the brief argued. 'At most, it drives unsheltered homeless people into hiding, leading to greater health and safety concerns for localities. Criminal punishment for peaceably sleeping outside as an unsheltered homeless person is not only cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but unnecessary, expensive and counterproductive.'  April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET It is early in California, but today's arguments are being closely watched here. California has about 12 percent of the nation's population, but roughly a third of the nation's homeless people. A lot of factors play into that, including the sunny weather to a crippling housing shortage. But rulings by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit constraining tent camp enforcement have made California's homelessness crisis particularly wrenching and visible. April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET This is the start of a big week at the court, featuring the final arguments of the term. In addition to the homelessness case today, the justices will hear an abortion case on Wednesday and a case on Trump's claim that he is immune from prosecution on Thursday. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has said that he opposes criminalizing homelessness but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass have impeded the ability of the local authorities to move people into shelters and temporary housing. Credit... Jeff Chiu/Associated Press The Goldwater Institute and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ordinarily have little in common. One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states. But for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West. On Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis — the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing. The conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them. Advocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless. In the nine Western states in the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, however, officials have increasingly begged the court to explicitly define the point at which a community can reclaim its shared spaces without triggering lawsuits. Some echo conservative appointees on the Ninth Circuit like Judge Daniel Bress, who issued a scathing response last year after the liberal majority voted not to give the Grants Pass case a rehearing before the full appeals court. (The three-judge had panel found that penalties for bunking outdoors violated the Constitution if the local population of homeless people exceeded the city's shelter capacity.) The Ninth Circuit, he wrote, need only look to its doorstep to see the fruit of its decision — a dystopia of 'homelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics dealing, severe mental health impairment' and post-Covid 'hollowing out.' In Phoenix, where a massive encampment near the Arizona State Capitol consumed millions of state dollars and years of litigation, Timothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs of the Goldwater Institute, noted that both sides had asked the court for clarification. 'It just shows,' he said, 'that across the board, the Ninth Circuit ruling that you have a constitutional right to sleep in a public park is unworkable and has got to be reversed.' In California, where more than 180,000 people are homeless, Mr. Newsom wrote in his brief to the court that he opposes criminalizing homelessness, but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass 'have impeded not only the ability to enforce basic health and safety measures, but also the ability to move people into available shelter beds and temporary housing.' Since his election in 2018, California has pumped more than $20 billion into programs to address homelessness, including specialized housing, a new court-based approach for dealing with addiction and mental illness and a $6.38 billion bond. At a news conference last week, he recalled pitching in to dismantle one tent camp in Oakland that 'felt like a scene out of a ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark' where, you know, thousands and thousands of rats appeared running all around us.' 'This is to me just about common sense, not about ideology,' the governor said.  'Suddenly, I found myself homeless,' Laura Gutowski said. 'I never expected it to come to this.' Credit... Mason Trinca for The New York Times Inside a warming shelter, Laura Gutowski detailed how her life had changed since she became homeless two and a half years ago in Grants Pass, a former timber hub in the foothills of southern Oregon. Her husband's death left her without steady income. She lived in a sedan, and then in a tent, in sight of the elementary school where her son was once a student. She constantly scrambled to move her belongings to avoid racking up more fines from the police. 'I never expected it to come to this,' said Ms. Gutowski, 55. She is one of several hundred homeless people in this city of about 40,000 that is at the center of a major case before the Supreme Court on Monday with broad ramifications for the nationwide struggle with homelessness. After Grants Pass stepped up enforcement of local ordinances that banned sleeping and camping in public spaces by ticketing, fining and jailing homeless people, lower courts ruled that it amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishment' by penalizing people who had nowhere else to go. Many states and cities that are increasingly overwhelmed by homelessness are hoping the Supreme Court overturns that decision — or severely limits it. They argue that it has crippled their efforts to address sprawling encampments, rampant public drug use and fearful constituents who say they cannot safely use public spaces. That prospect has alarmed homeless people and their advocates, who contend that a ruling against them would lead cities to fall back on jails, instead of solutions like affordable housing and social services. The case highlights the fierce divide over the thorny issue of how to regulate homelessness. Theane Evangelis, a lawyer representing Grants Pass, said the Supreme Court's decision would reverberate widely. If it does not overturn the lower-court decision, she said, cities around the United States 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.' Ed Johnson, a lawyer for the Oregon Law Center, a nonprofit legal aid group, who represents the homeless residents, said a ruling against them would strip them of their few protections. 'Can a city make it illegal on every inch of city land, every minute of the day, for people to live outside when they have nowhere else to go?' he said. Homelessness across the country climbed to the highest total on record last year, increasing by 12 percent to more than 650,000 people, according to a count by the federal government. Lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Credit... Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times At the core of the Supreme Court battle over a small Oregon town's treatment of its homeless people is a narrow question: Does the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual treatment apply to a city's efforts to crack down on public sleeping and camping? The Eighth Amendment is most commonly applied to punishments, not to laws themselves, and it is often the focus of litigation around the death penalty, solitary confinement and life without the possibility of parole. But in the case on Monday, lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Because the town, Grants Pass, has no homeless shelter, unaffiliated with any religious group, that is open to everyone, they argue, all homeless people there are involuntarily homeless and cannot be punished for having nowhere to go. To make that argument, the homeless plaintiffs have looked to rulings that apply the amendment beyond punishments themselves and to the concept that a person cannot be penalized for their state of being. In one landmark 1962 decision, Robinson v. California, the court found that a person could not be punished for being addicted to drugs, paving the way for subsequent applications. Because those rulings found that the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishing people for having 'an involuntary status,' the homeless plaintiffs say that it would also be relevant to their situation. They add that they are being disciplined for circumstances outside their control, in this instance 'universal biological necessities like sleeping and using a blanket to survive cold temperatures when they have no choice but to be outside.' The city argues that this is an inappropriate use of the Eighth Amendment and a fundamental misunderstanding of its purpose. Two legal experts, in filing a friend-of-the-court brief siding with Grants Pass, argued that the Constitution did bar criminalizing someone's state of being, rather than their specific conduct. But that prohibition, the law professors — Peter W. Low of the University of Virginia and Joel S. Johnson of Pepperdine — added, had a 'shaky Eighth Amendment footing.'  © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis.\nThe case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces.\nThe issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years.\nThe dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces.

'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness — policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances — the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks.\nApril 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET The argument is scheduled for 65 minutes. But it will probably last more than twice that long.\nApril 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET The stakes are high. In San Francisco, which is embroiled in a lawsuit over encampments, city officials have complained for months that a sweeping injunction based on the Grants Pass decision and other Ninth Circuit rulings has complicated law enforcement around downtown tent camps.

'At most, it drives unsheltered homeless people into hiding, leading to greater health and safety concerns for localities. Criminal punishment for peaceably sleeping outside as an unsheltered homeless person is not only cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but unnecessary, expensive and counterproductive.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET It is early in California, but today's arguments are being closely watched here.

One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states.\nBut for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West.\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks.\nThe City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis — the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing.\nThe conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them.\nAdvocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless.\nIn the nine Western states in the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, however, officials have increasingly begged the court to explicitly define the point at which a community can reclaim its shared spaces without triggering lawsuits. Some echo conservative appointees on the Ninth Circuit like Judge Daniel Bress, who issued a scathing response last year after the liberal majority voted not to give the Grants Pass case a rehearing before the full appeals court. (The three-judge had panel found that penalties for bunking outdoors violated the Constitution if the local population of homeless people exceeded the city's shelter capacity.)\nThe Ninth Circuit, he wrote, need only look to its doorstep to see the fruit of its decision — a dystopia of 'homelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics dealing, severe mental health impairment' and post-Covid 'hollowing out.'\nIn Phoenix, where a massive encampment near the Arizona State Capitol consumed millions of state dollars and years of litigation, Timothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs of the Goldwater Institute, noted that both sides had asked the court for clarification.\n'It just shows,' he said, 'that across the board, the Ninth Circuit ruling that you have a constitutional right to sleep in a public park is unworkable and has got to be reversed.'\nIn California, where more than 180,000 people are homeless, Mr. Newsom wrote in his brief to the court that he opposes criminalizing homelessness, but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass 'have impeded not only the ability to enforce basic health and safety measures, but also the ability to move people into available shelter beds and temporary housing.' Since his election in 2018, California has pumped more than $20 billion into programs to address homelessness, including specialized housing, a new court-based approach for dealing with addiction and mental illness and a $6.38 billion bond.\nAt a news conference last week, he recalled pitching in to dismantle one tent camp in Oakland that 'felt like a scene out of a ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark' where, you know, thousands and thousands of rats appeared running all around us.'\n'This is to me just about common sense, not about ideology,' the governor said.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT 'Suddenly, I found myself homeless,' Laura Gutowski said. 'I never expected it to come to this.' Credit... Mason Trinca for The New York Times Inside a warming shelter, Laura Gutowski detailed how her life had changed since she became homeless two and a half years ago in Grants Pass, a former timber hub in the foothills of southern Oregon.\nHer husband's death left her without steady income. She lived in a sedan, and then in a tent, in sight of the elementary school where her son was once a student. She constantly scrambled to move her belongings to avoid racking up more fines from the police.\n'I never expected it to come to this,' said Ms. Gutowski, 55. She is one of several hundred homeless people in this city of about 40,000 that is at the center of a major case before the Supreme Court on Monday with broad ramifications for the nationwide struggle with homelessness.\nAfter Grants Pass stepped up enforcement of local ordinances that banned sleeping and camping in public spaces by ticketing, fining and jailing homeless people, lower courts ruled that it amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishment' by penalizing people who had nowhere else to go.\nMany states and cities that are increasingly overwhelmed by homelessness are hoping the Supreme Court overturns that decision — or severely limits it. They argue that it has crippled their efforts to address sprawling encampments, rampant public drug use and fearful constituents who say they cannot safely use public spaces.\nThat prospect has alarmed homeless people and their advocates, who contend that a ruling against them would lead cities to fall back on jails, instead of solutions like affordable housing and social services.\nThe case highlights the fierce divide over the thorny issue of how to regulate homelessness.\nTheane Evangelis, a lawyer representing Grants Pass, said the Supreme Court's decision would reverberate widely. If it does not overturn the lower-court decision, she said, cities around the United States 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.'\nEd Johnson, a lawyer for the Oregon Law Center, a nonprofit legal aid group, who represents the homeless residents, said a ruling against them would strip them of their few protections. 'Can a city make it illegal on every inch of city land, every minute of the day, for people to live outside when they have nowhere else to go?' he said.\nHomelessness across the country climbed to the highest total on record last year, increasing by 12 percent to more than 650,000 people, according to a count by the federal government.\nLawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Credit... Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times At the core of the Supreme Court battle over a small Oregon town's treatment of its homeless people is a narrow question: Does the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual treatment apply to a city's efforts to crack down on public sleeping and camping?\nThe Eighth Amendment is most commonly applied to punishments, not to laws themselves, and it is often the focus of litigation around the death penalty, solitary confinement and life without the possibility of parole.\nBut in the case on Monday, lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Because the town, Grants Pass, has no homeless shelter, unaffiliated with any religious group, that is open to everyone, they argue, all homeless people there are involuntarily homeless and cannot be punished for having nowhere to go.\nTo make that argument, the homeless plaintiffs have looked to rulings that apply the amendment beyond punishments themselves and to the concept that a person cannot be penalized for their state of being.\nIn one landmark 1962 decision, Robinson v. California, the court found that a person could not be punished for being addicted to drugs, paving the way for subsequent applications. Because those rulings found that the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishing people for having 'an involuntary status,' the homeless plaintiffs say that it would also be relevant to their situation. They add that they are being disciplined for circumstances outside their control, in this instance 'universal biological necessities like sleeping and using a blanket to survive cold temperatures when they have no choice but to be outside.'\nThe city argues that this is an inappropriate use of the Eighth Amendment and a fundamental misunderstanding of its purpose.\nTwo legal experts, in filing a friend-of-the-court brief siding with Grants Pass, argued that the Constitution did bar criminalizing someone's state of being, rather than their specific conduct. But that prohibition, the law professors — Peter W. Low of the University of Virginia and Joel S. Johnson of Pepperdine — added, had a 'shaky Eighth Amendment footing.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",

The case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces. The issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years. The dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. A group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter. City officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond. Here's what else to know: The case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution.

Because the town, Grants Pass, has no homeless shelter, unaffiliated with any religious group, that is open to everyone, they argue, all homeless people there are involuntarily homeless and cannot be punished for having nowhere to go. To make that argument, the homeless plaintiffs have looked to rulings that apply the amendment beyond punishments themselves and to the concept that a person cannot be penalized for their state of being. In one landmark 1962 decision, Robinson v. California, the court found that a person could not be punished for being addicted to drugs, paving the way for subsequent applications. Because those rulings found that the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishing people for having 'an involuntary status,' the homeless plaintiffs say that it would also be relevant to their situation. They add that they are being disciplined for circumstances outside their control, in this instance 'universal biological necessities like sleeping and using a blanket to survive cold temperatures when they have no choice but to be outside.' The city argues that this is an inappropriate use of the Eighth Amendment and a fundamental misunderstanding of its purpose. Two legal experts, in filing a friend-of-the-court brief siding with Grants Pass, argued that the Constitution did bar criminalizing someone's state of being, rather than their specific conduct. But that prohibition, the law professors — Peter W. Low of the University of Virginia and Joel S. Johnson of Pepperdine — added, had a 'shaky Eighth Amendment footing.'  © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis.\nThe case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces.\nThe issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years.\nThe dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\nA group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter.\nCity officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond.\nHere's what else to know:\nThe case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution. 'The city of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town,' the lawsuit said. 'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness — policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances — the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks.\nApril 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET The argument is scheduled for 65 minutes. But it will probably last more than twice that long.\nApril 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET The stakes are high. In San Francisco, which is embroiled in a lawsuit over encampments, city officials have complained for months that a sweeping injunction based on the Grants Pass decision and other Ninth Circuit rulings has complicated law enforcement around downtown tent camps. Over the weekend, I asked Senator Scott Wiener, a Democratic legislator who represents San Francisco, what he was hoping for from the Supreme Court. 'Certainty,' he told me, 'because things have been chaotic here.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET In briefs on the case, California leaders have tried to take a nuanced position, arguing, in essence, that they don't want to criminalize homelessness but need more flexibility to clear the most dangerous encampments and compel people to take shelter when it is offered. This tricky balance was reflected in Gov. Gavin Newsom's brief 'in support of neither party.'\nApril 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET Outside the Supreme Court building this morning, activists hoping to protect the rights of homeless people have gathered with signs that call for 'Housing Not Handcuffs.'

According to leaders across the political spectrum who have asked the Supreme Court to address homelessness, those are the consequences of a sharp increase in homelessness that have forced many cities to 'a breaking point.'\nAlthough the case before the court on Monday centers on the narrow issue of whether the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment shields homeless people with no options for shelter from fines, fees and jail time, officials and advocates across the country are watching the case closely for its potential to reshape homelessness policy.\nThe case underscores deep divisions over how best to address homelessness and how much leeway to give to local and state officials to help solve the problem.\nTheane Evangelis, a lawyer for the city of Grants Pass, Ore., who also represented the city of Boise, Idaho, in a similar case in 2018, warned that 'the stakes could not be higher for every city in the country.'\nIf the Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling on behalf of the homeless plaintiffs, she added, cities everywhere 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.'\nThose who side with the homeless plaintiffs counter that the issue before the court is a focused one, on how to interpret the Constitution. The cities' willingness to embrace solutions like more affordable housing will determine whether the homelessness crisis will begin to abate, they say.\n'The first thing for folks who aren't in this field — or understanding the nuances of this case — to understand is that nobody wants a country where people are forced to sleep outside,' said Ann Oliva, chief executive of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, an advocacy group founded in the 1980s with bipartisan roots.\nIn briefs, supporters of Grants Pass have contended that local and state policymakers, not judges, are best placed to devise homelessness policies.\nThe cases from Grants Pass and Boise had allowed 'federal judges to serve as the nation's ‘homelessness policy czars,'' wrote the Cicero Institute, a Texas policy group critical of longstanding federal policy that channels funds to programs to provide the homeless with permanent housing without requiring people to undergo mental health or drug treatment.\nLawyers for the National Alliance to End Homelessness say that imposing penalties, rather than providing housing and services, ignores the roots of the issue.\nIn its brief to the court, the group said that the city of Grants Pass and its defenders, 'rather than working to end it,' sought 'to banish homeless people out of sight and out of mind.'\n'The threat of criminal penalties does not reduce homelessness,' the brief argued. 'At most, it drives unsheltered homeless people into hiding, leading to greater health and safety concerns for localities. Criminal punishment for peaceably sleeping outside as an unsheltered homeless person is not only cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but unnecessary, expensive and counterproductive.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET It is early in California, but today's arguments are being closely watched here. California has about 12 percent of the nation's population, but roughly a third of the nation's homeless people. A lot of factors play into that, including the sunny weather to a crippling housing shortage. But rulings by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit constraining tent camp enforcement have made California's homelessness crisis particularly wrenching and visible.\nApril 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET This is the start of a big week at the court, featuring the final arguments of the term. In addition to the homelessness case today, the justices will hear an abortion case on Wednesday and a case on Trump's claim that he is immune from prosecution on Thursday.\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California has said that he opposes criminalizing homelessness but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass have impeded the ability of the local authorities to move people into shelters and temporary housing. Credit... Jeff Chiu/Associated Press The Goldwater Institute and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ordinarily have little in common. One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states.\nBut for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West.\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks.\nThe City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis — the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing.\nThe conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them.\nAdvocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless.\nIn the nine Western states in the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, however, officials have increasingly begged the court to explicitly define the point at which a community can reclaim its shared spaces without triggering lawsuits. Some echo conservative appointees on the Ninth Circuit like Judge Daniel Bress, who issued a scathing response last year after the liberal majority voted not to give the Grants Pass case a rehearing before the full appeals court. (The three-judge had panel found that penalties for bunking outdoors violated the Constitution if the local population of homeless people exceeded the city's shelter capacity.)\nThe Ninth Circuit, he wrote, need only look to its doorstep to see the fruit of its decision — a dystopia of 'homelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics dealing, severe mental health impairment' and post-Covid 'hollowing out.'\nIn Phoenix, where a massive encampment near the Arizona State Capitol consumed millions of state dollars and years of litigation, Timothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs of the Goldwater Institute, noted that both sides had asked the court for clarification.\n'It just shows,' he said, 'that across the board, the Ninth Circuit ruling that you have a constitutional right to sleep in a public park is unworkable and has got to be reversed.'\nIn California, where more than 180,000 people are homeless, Mr. Newsom wrote in his brief to the court that he opposes criminalizing homelessness, but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass 'have impeded not only the ability to enforce basic health and safety measures, but also the ability to move people into available shelter beds and temporary housing.' Since his election in 2018, California has pumped more than $20 billion into programs to address homelessness, including specialized housing, a new court-based approach for dealing with addiction and mental illness and a $6.38 billion bond.\nAt a news conference last week, he recalled pitching in to dismantle one tent camp in Oakland that 'felt like a scene out of a ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark' where, you know, thousands and thousands of rats appeared running all around us.'\n'This is to me just about common sense, not about ideology,' the governor said.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT 'Suddenly, I found myself homeless,' Laura Gutowski said.

Mason Trinca for The New York Times Inside a warming shelter, Laura Gutowski detailed how her life had changed since she became homeless two and a half years ago in Grants Pass, a former timber hub in the foothills of southern Oregon.\nHer husband's death left her without steady income. She lived in a sedan, and then in a tent, in sight of the elementary school where her son was once a student. She constantly scrambled to move her belongings to avoid racking up more fines from the police.\n'I never expected it to come to this,' said Ms. Gutowski, 55. She is one of several hundred homeless people in this city of about 40,000 that is at the center of a major case before the Supreme Court on Monday with broad ramifications for the nationwide struggle with homelessness.\nAfter Grants Pass stepped up enforcement of local ordinances that banned sleeping and camping in public spaces by ticketing, fining and jailing homeless people, lower courts ruled that it amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishment' by penalizing people who had nowhere else to go.\nMany states and cities that are increasingly overwhelmed by homelessness are hoping the Supreme Court overturns that decision — or severely limits it. They argue that it has crippled their efforts to address sprawling encampments, rampant public drug use and fearful constituents who say they cannot safely use public spaces.\nThat prospect has alarmed homeless people and their advocates, who contend that a ruling against them would lead cities to fall back on jails, instead of solutions like affordable housing and social services.\nThe case highlights the fierce divide over the thorny issue of how to regulate homelessness.\nTheane Evangelis, a lawyer representing Grants Pass, said the Supreme Court's decision would reverberate widely. If it does not overturn the lower-court decision, she said, cities around the United States 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.'\nEd Johnson, a lawyer for the Oregon Law Center, a nonprofit legal aid group, who represents the homeless residents, said a ruling against them would strip them of their few protections. 'Can a city make it illegal on every inch of city land, every minute of the day, for people to live outside when they have nowhere else to go?' he said.\nHomelessness across the country climbed to the highest total on record last year, increasing by 12 percent to more than 650,000 people, according to a count by the federal government.\nLawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city.

The Iranian officials said that a strike had hit a military air base near the city of Isfahan, in central Iran. Initial reaction in both Israel and Iran was muted, which analysts said was a sign that the rivals were seeking to lower the temperature of their conflict. World leaders, who for nearly a week have urged Israel and Iran to avoid starting a broader war in the region, called for both sides to de-escalate tensions on Friday. The Israeli military declined to comment on the strike. A senior U.S. official said that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before the attack. All the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The explosions came less than a week after Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel — nearly all of which were shot down — in response to an April 1 strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed seven Iranian officials. That attack brought the decades-long shadow war between Israel and Iran — waged on land, at sea, in air and in cyberspace — more clearly into the open. A Western official and two Iranian officials said that Israel used both missiles fired from warplanes and drones in the strike, suggesting that the attack included more advanced firepower than initial reports indicated. Iranian officials initially told The New York Times that the attack had been carried out only by small drones, possibly launched from inside Iran, and that radar systems had not detected unidentified aircraft entering Iranian airspace. They said that a separate group of small drones was shot down in the region of Tabriz, roughly 500 miles north of Isfahan.\nIn public, Iranian officials sought to downplay the strike. Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi, the commander in chief of Iran's army, said explosions heard early Friday in Isfahan 'were from our air defense firing at a suspicious object,' and that there had been 'no damage.' Iranian news agencies appeared keen to show that things were 'back to normal' in the city.\nPresident Ebrahim Raisi of Iran had warned that 'the tiniest act of aggression' on his country's soil would draw a response. But in the hours after Israel's strike, there have been no public calls for retribution by Iranian officials. One lawmaker, Seyed Nezamedin Mousavi, called the strike 'ridiculous,' saying it showed Israel 'is content with these ineffective actions.'\nIsfahan is one of Iran's most famous and historic cities. The area also hosts a number of Iranian military sites. Iranian media reported that nuclear facilities in Isfahan had not been hit.\nIsraeli leaders came close to ordering widespread strikes in Iran on the night Iran attacked, officials said, but the war cabinet postponed a decision. Mr. Biden and other world leaders urged Israel for days not to retaliate in a way that would inflame a wider Middle East war while it fights Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both allies of Iran. April 19, 2024, 8:07 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 8:07 p.m. ET Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, who is in New York attending U.N. meetings, told Iran's state news agency that the small quadcopter targeting a military base in Isfahan did not have casualties or damage. 'Israel is determined to portray its defeat as a victory,' Mr. Amir Abdollahian said, the most senior official to comment on the attacks and draw a link to Israel publicly. Credit... Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The Israeli attack on an Iranian air base in Isfahan hit a crucial part of an air defense system, a New York Times analysis of satellite imagery found. Images showed that the precision attack at the 8th Shekari Air Base damaged or destroyed the 'flap-lid' radar, which is used in S-300 air defense systems to track incoming targets. The Times used several satellite images in its analysis; the location of the damaged area was first pointed out on the social media platform X by Aurora Intel, and the findings have also been confirmed by a former U.S. government imagery analyst, Chris Biggers. The radar is typically surrounded by several vehicles, including four trucks carrying missiles. Before the strike, the missiles were seen positioned next to the radar. After the strike, they had been moved and did not appear visibly damaged. It was not clear why the missiles had been moved. However, the fact that they appear undamaged indicated that the attack had a very precise target, according to Mr. Biggers. An air defense system at the air base in Isfahan in October 2021.

Maxar Technologies, via Google Earth Other areas of the air base and adjacent airport also appeared to be undamaged. The precision of the strike, deep within Iran and with several sensitive sites close by, suggested Israel chose the specific and narrow target, the air defense system. According to the Missile Defense Project of the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, Iran has acquired Russian-made S-300 air defense systems to deter Israeli and other airstrikes. Some Democrats are fine sending defensive weapons to Israel, but want to see some limits on offensive weapons, which could be used against civilians in Gaza. Credit... -/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images A group of left-leaning House Democrats is urging its colleagues to oppose the $26 billion aid package for Israel, hoping to maximize the number of 'no' votes from the party and send a warning to President Biden about the depth of his political coalition's discontent over his support for Israel's tactics in Gaza. Framing the upcoming vote as a make-or-break moral choice akin to Congress's votes to authorize and fund the Iraq war, progressive leaders in the House are working to muster a sizable bloc of Democratic opposition to the aid measure, which is expected to pass on Saturday and become law in the coming days. 'In the wake of those votes, people came around much, much later and said, ‘We shouldn't have allowed that to go forward,'' Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington and the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said of the decades-ago debate over Iraq. 'And I think that this is that moment.' Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, called it a 'defining vote,' adding, 'We're either going to participate in the carnage, or we're not.' There is little doubt that the bill, which would send roughly $13 billion in military assistance to Israel as it continues its offensive in Gaza, will pass the House, along with money for Ukraine, Taiwan and other American allies. But progressive Democrats estimated that 40 to 60 members of their party may oppose it on the House floor on Saturday. That would be a striking signal from Congress, where ironclad bipartisan backing for Israel has long been the norm. And it would highlight the fraught divisions the war in Gaza has sown within the Democratic Party, even as more Democrats including Mr. Biden have begun to criticize Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's approach to the conflict and urge him to better protect civilians. The legislation would allocate $5 billion to Israel's defense capabilities and $9 billion for 'worldwide humanitarian aid,' including for civilians in Gaza. But it would not place further conditions on how Israel could use American military aid, nor block future arms transfers from the United States as an increasing number of Democrats have sought to do. Democrats who are leading the push against the Israel aid bill said they strongly supported the Jewish state and its right to defend itself, and would vote in favor of sending military aid that supports Israel's defense capabilities, such as by replenishing the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Iron Beam defense systems. They also denounced the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas that prompted the war, and said the hostages taken by Hamas must be released. But they argued that approving more offensive weaponry without conditions was an untenable moral and political position that would amount to an endorsement of Mr. Netanyahu's prosecution of the war, including his intention to invade Rafah over the objections of the Biden administration. More than 33,000 people in Gaza have been killed since the start of the conflict, according to the health ministry there, and the population is facing a hunger crisis. 'I understand the need for defensive weapons for Israel, particularly in light of the attack by Iran,' said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, who ran his first campaign on an antiwar platform and helped lead efforts to end U.S. participation in the war in Yemen. 'But there is no justification to provide bombs and weapons to Netanyahu to continue the war in Gaza that is killing thousands of innocent Palestinian women and children.' Saturday's vote will recall a similar situation from 2007, when the speaker at the time, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, split a piece of spending legislation to allow Democrats to register their opposition to funding the Iraq war while backing a domestic funding bill. Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, similarly divided the foreign aid package to be considered on Saturday in order to get each element across the finish line in the face of distinct coalitions of resistance to different pieces of the bill. In a critical test vote on Friday, the House agreed, 316 to 94, to bring up the package, with 39 Democrats — mostly progressives — joining 55 Republicans in opposition. 'This is a moment for members of Congress who support a safe and secure Israel to send a message that giving Netanyahu more offensive weapons is not a path for peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians,' Representative Becca Balint, Democrat of Vermont and the first Jewish member of Congress to call for a cease-fire, said in an interview. 'To give Netanyahu more offensive weapons at this stage, I believe, is to condone the destruction of Gaza that we've seen in the last six months. And it's also a green light for an invasion of Rafah.' Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat who led the opposition to funding for the Iraq war in 2007, said the conversations among Democrats in Congress opposing continued U.S. backing for the war in Gaza were 'not unlike' those that took place 17 years ago. 'We may well be casting the vote on whether a much wider war takes place, and whether American weapons go that result in the death of thousands of innocent people,' Mr. Doggett said. The Democrats who oppose the aid package for Israel represent a minority of their caucus. But they see a 'no' vote as part of a strategy to pressure Mr. Biden to condition aid and halt future offensive weapons transfers. Through many meetings, text chains and conversations with the administration, they have worked to shift the president's approach to Israel, while underscoring the electoral risks Mr. Biden faces among voters who helped power him to the White House in 2020 and are now furious over his handling of the war. 'The only way to get a course correction is for a sizable number within the Democratic caucus to say it must shift,' Ms. Balint said. Representative Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat who has been pressing Mr. Biden to withhold offensive weapons from Israel, said a big 'no' vote would strengthen the president's hand to do so. 'It helps the administration to have some number of Democrats express ourselves in this way,' he said. Representative Greg Casar, Democrat of Texas, said he hoped a substantial number of Democrats opposing the bill would give the Biden administration greater leverage to influence the Israeli government's approach to the war. 'I hope this vote will show the world that there is a really significant segment of the United States that doesn't want to see expanded and widening wars,' he said.

Ohad Zwigenberg/Associated Press Israeli warplanes fired missiles on Iran during a retaliatory strike early Friday morning, one Western official and two Iranian officials said, suggesting that the attack included more advanced firepower than initial reports indicated. It was not immediately clear the types of missiles used, from where they were fired, whether any were intercepted by Iran's defenses or where they landed. The Western official and the Iranian officials requested anonymity to discuss classified information. Previously, Iranian officials said Friday's attack on a military base in central Iran was conducted by small aerial drones, most likely launched from inside Iranian territory. A separate group of small drones, they said soon after the attack, was shot down in the region of Tabriz, roughly 500 miles north of Isfahan. Israel has not publicly claimed responsibility for Friday's attack and would not comment on the use of planes or missiles. Israel's strike came in response to an Iranian attack last weekend in which Iran fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. A majority of the weapons used in that salvo were fired from Iranian territory and intercepted by Israel and its allies before causing any damage. By contrast, the Iranian officials said, Iran's military did not detect anything entering Iran's airspace on Friday, including drones, missiles and aircraft. Iran's state news agency IRNA reported that no missile attacks occurred and that Iran's air defense system was not activated. Iran's decision to launch its strike primarily from its own soil last week was perceived by Israel as an escalation in the countries' long-simmering shadow war. The Iranians believe the large salvo is helping with deterrence. Throughout the yearslong conflict, the two countries have traded clandestine attacks, including targeted assassinations, cyberattacks and conventional strikes conducted from and within third countries. Iran's attack last week was itself prompted by an Israeli strike on April 1, in which Israeli aircraft killed several Iranian armed forces commanders in Syria. By using drones seemingly launched from inside Iran's territory rather than its own, Israel hinted at a willingness to turn down the temperature on the conflict while also demonstrating an ability to conduct attacks that Iran could not detect. One Iranian official, a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, said that even though the strike did little damage, the likelihood that drones were fired from under Iran's nose sent a message about Israel's capabilities. A guided missile fired from an undetected warplane, even if it landed outside Iranian territory, would most likely deliver a similar threat. Officials from both countries remained largely quiet about Friday's attack, a gesture that appeared aimed at de-escalating a conflict some fear could spiral into a broader regional war. Israel's silence on the attack, an Iranian official said, would allow Tehran to treat the strike as it had comparable previous attacks and not prompt an immediate response. Mahdi Mohammadi, a senior adviser to Iran's Parliament speaker, said that Israel's limited attack on Iran showed that Iran had achieved its goal of deterrence. Israel's refusal to openly claim responsibility, he said, amounts to a victory for Iran. Israel's attack, he said on the messaging app Telegram, was meant to show that it had the 'capability to access Iran but in practice it also showed that it has accepted that it should not repeat its miscalculation.'

'I'm not going to speak or speculate about any of the reports that are out there,' Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said at her daily briefing.

Pete Marovich for The New York Times The Israeli military struck a Syrian air defense site in southern Syria with missiles early Friday, causing material damage, though no casualties were reported, according to Syrian state news media. Syria's official news agency, SANA, provided no other details and Israel did not comment on whether it was responsible for the attack, in keeping with its usual practice. The strike happened around the same time that Israel carried out a strike on a military air base near the city of Isfahan, in central Iran. That strike came less than a week after Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel — nearly all of which were shot down — in retaliation for an April 1 attack on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed seven Iranian military officers. Friday's strike in Syria targeted a radar system in the southern province of Dara'a, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain. The Syrian military detected Israeli aircraft entering Syrian airspace, but its air defenses did not try to intercept the strikes, the Observatory said. Iranian-backed armed groups throughout Syria have been on high alert since Iran's strikes on Israel last weekend, the Observatory said. The groups obscured their positions and gave some of their leaders a week of leave. Iran is closely allied with Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia, and with the Syrian government, and both Hezbollah and Iran's Quds Force operate in Syria. For years, Iranian proxies like Hezbollah have launched strikes at northern Israel. Israel has repeatedly targeted Iran and its allies with strikes in Syria, including in Damascus, the capital, and Aleppo. Attacks across Israel's borders with Syria and Lebanon have escalated since the Oct. 7 assault by Hamas on Israel. Since the first of the year, Israel has carried out nearly three dozen attacks in Syria, destroying buildings, military headquarters and weapon and ammunition warehouses, the Observatory said. The strikes have killed 129 fighters and 12 civilians, the group said.

Jordan lies between the two enemies, and it played a key role in helping shoot down the barrage of missiles and drones Iran fired at Israel on Saturday. A group at the ancient Si-o-Se Pol bridge in Isfahan, Iran, in 2023. Daily life appeared to return to normal in Isfahan on Friday, according to Iranian state news media and a resident who was interviewed, hours after Israel's attack on a nearby military base continued the cycle of strikes and counterstrikes between the two countries. But tensions from the overnight attack reverberated through the city, and some residents described the threat of full-fledged war as crippling — despite analysts' assessment that both nations were trying to avoid further escalation. Mehrdad, 43, an engineer from Isfahan, said the latest retaliation left him and his pregnant wife feeling stressed and unwell. He asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution. 'The future of this country concerns me,' he said. 'I believe nothing good is expected.' Though he said that the city had returned 'back to its normal' and reactions from officials were muted — which he believed was to help make people feel at ease — many residents remain scared after a stressful night of explosions. For the first six months of the war between Israel and Hamas, Iran's involvement in fighting had been limited to its proxies, including the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and the Yemeni Houthi militia. But after Iran's first direct strike on Israel last weekend, Mehrdad said, 'things are coming to the surface.' He hoped that diplomatic mediation would put an end to the threat of war, and he worried that the county's infrastructure would be 'ruined' by further Israeli attacks. 'Our economic situation is awful. We have 50 percent annual inflation,' he said. 'Now guess what would happen if the war materialized. What would happen to our living conditions in this country?' Mahsa, 34, an accountant from Isfahan who also asked that her last name not be used for fear of retribution, described a tense atmosphere of fear and instability. The economy is often the main topic of conversation when people gather, she said, and many are worried about the consequences of a wider war. 'When Iran attacked, we were all worried and we really didn't know what to expect,' she said, describing the cycle of retaliation between Israel and Iran as a 'show game.' 'Of course, after this Israeli attack, the direction of the game will be determined,' she added. 'Either a full-scale war, or the end of this line, or just threats.' The distress is crushing. Mahsa said her mental health had deteriorated, describing an instance last week when she broke down sobbing in the middle of the street for seemingly no reason while on a run. Dreams seem 'more impossible to achieve, day by day,' she said. 'We don't have much mental energy left,' she added.

'It appears we are out of the danger zone and, because Israel's strike was limited, it has allowed both countries to back down for now,' said Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House.

Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times For decades, Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war across the Middle East, trading attacks by land, sea, air and in cyberspace. A recent round of strikes — mainly an aerial barrage by Iran against Israel last weekend — has brought the conflict more clearly into the open and raised fears of a broader war. A retaliatory Israeli strike on an Iranian air base on Friday, however, appeared limited in scope, and analysts said it suggested an effort to pull back from the dangerous cycle and potentially move the war back into the shadows. Here is a recent history of the conflict: August 2019: An Israeli airstrike killed two Iranian-trained militants in Syria, a drone set off a blast near a Hezbollah office in Lebanon and an airstrike in Qaim, Iraq, killed a commander of an Iran-backed Iraqi militia. Israel accused Iran at the time of trying to establish an overland arms-supply line through Iraq and northern Syria to Lebanon, and analysts said the strikes were aimed at stopping Iran and signaling to its proxies that Israel would not tolerate a fleet of smart missiles on its borders. January 2020: Israel greeted with satisfaction the assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of the foreign-facing arm of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, in an American drone strike in Baghdad. Iran hit back by attacking two bases in Iraq that housed American troops with a barrage of missiles, wounding about 100 U.S. military personnel. 2021-22: In July 2021, an oil tanker managed by an Israeli-owned shipping company was attacked off the coast of Oman, killing two crew members, according to the company and three Israeli officials. Two of the officials said that the attack appeared to have been carried out by Iranian drones. Iran did not explicitly claim or deny responsibility, but a state-owned television channel described the episode as a response to an Israeli strike in Syria. In November 2021, Israel killed Iran's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, and followed up with the assassination of a Revolutionary Guards commander, Col. Sayad Khodayee, in May 2022. December 2023: After Israel's bombardment of Gaza began in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led assault, Iranian-backed militias stepped up their own attacks. And late last year, Iran accused Israel of killing a high-level military figure, Brig. Gen. Sayyed Razi Mousavi, in a missile strike in Syria. A senior adviser to the Revolutionary Guards, General Mousavi was described as having been a close associate of General Suleimani and was said to have helped oversee the shipment of arms to Hezbollah. Israel, adopting its customary stance, declined to comment directly on whether it was behind General Mousavi's death. January 2024: An explosion in a suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, killed Saleh al-Arouri, a Hamas leader, along with two commanders from that group's armed wing, the first assassination of a top Hamas official outside the West Bank and Gaza in recent years. Officials from Hamas, Lebanon and the United States ascribed the blast to Israel, which did not publicly confirm involvement. Hezbollah, which receives major support from Iran, stepped up its assaults on Israel after Mr. al-Arouri's death. Israel's military hit back at Hezbollah in Lebanon, killing several of the group's commanders. March: An Israeli drone strike hit a car in southern Lebanon, killing at least one person. Israel's military said it had killed the deputy commander of Hezbollah's rocket and missile unit. Hezbollah acknowledged the death of a man, Ali Abdulhassan Naim, but did not provide further details. The same day, airstrikes killed soldiers near Aleppo, northern Syria, in what appeared to be one of the heaviest Israeli attacks in the country in years. The strikes killed 36 Syrian soldiers, seven Hezbollah fighters and a Syrian from a pro-Iran militia, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group that tracks Syria's civil war. Israel's military did not claim responsibility. But the country's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, wrote on social media, 'We will pursue Hezbollah every place it operates and we will expand the pressure and the pace of the attacks.' April: A strike on an Iranian Embassy building in Damascus on April 1 killed three top Iranian commanders and four officers. Iran blamed Israel and vowed to hit back forcefully. Two weeks later, Tehran launched a barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel, an unexpectedly large-scale attack, although nearly all the weapons were shot down by Israel and allies. Israel said for days it would respond, before a strike on Friday hit a military air base near the central Iranian city of Isfahan.

Planet Labs PBC Iranian officials said that the Israeli strike on Friday morning was carried out by small exploding drones, a tactic that would follow a well-established pattern in Israeli attacks on Iranian military targets. As Israel has targeted Iranian defense and military officials and infrastructure, small drones — specifically ones known as quadcopters — have been a signature of those operations. Quadcopter drones, so named because they have four rotors, have a short flight range and can explode on impact. The drones might have been launched from inside Iran, whose radar systems had not detected unidentified aircraft entering Iranian airspace, Iranian officials said. If the drones were launched within the country, it demonstrates once again Israel's ability to mount clandestine operations in Iranian territory. Israel's military has not commented on Friday's strike. Though it rarely claims responsibility publicly for attacks against Iranian targets, several attacks in recent years have used drones: August 2019: Israel sent an exploding drone into the heart of a Hezbollah-dominated neighborhood in Beirut, Lebanon, to destroy what Israeli officials described as machinery used in the production of precision missiles.\nJune 2021: A quadcopter exploded outside Tehran at one of Iran's main manufacturing centers for centrifuges, which purify uranium and are used at the country's two major uranium enrichment facilities. Western officials have closely watched activity at those facilities for signs that Iran could be moving toward producing a nuclear weapon. Iran claimed that there had been no damage to the site outside Tehran, but satellite images showed evidence of significant damage.\nFebruary 2022: Six quadcopters exploded at Kermanshah, Iran's main manufacturing and storage plant for military drones.\nMay 2022: A strike targeted the highly sensitive Parchin military site outside Tehran, where Iran develops missile, nuclear and drone technology. Quadcopter drones exploded into a building, killing an engineer and injuring another person, Iranians with knowledge of the attack said at the time.\nJanuary 2023: A drone attack on an Iranian military facility in January 2023 caused a large explosion in the center of Isfahan, the city near the air base that was struck on Friday. At the time, Iran made no effort to hide the fact that an attack had happened, but said it had done little damage. Iranian state media reported that drones had targeted an ammunition manufacturing plant but had been shot down by a surface-to-air defense system. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken at a news conference in Capri, Italy, on Friday. Credit... Gregorio Borgia/Associated Press Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Friday that the United States 'has not been involved in any offensive operations' in Iran when asked about Israel's strike on the country on Friday, but he declined to comment further. Mr. Blinken spoke on the last day of a meeting of Group of 7 ministers in Capri, Italy, where the agenda was dominated by the conflict in the Middle East, including the exchanges of strikes in the past week between Israel and Iran. In remarks to reporters before departing the island, Mr. Blinken said the G7 was unified in urging de-escalation between Iran and Israel to avoid a wider war. But Mr. Blinken would not even directly confirm the Israeli strike, which appeared to be the country's first military response to Iran's attack last weekend, referring instead to 'reported events,' and he would not say whether the United States had been notified in advance of the Israeli action. Shortly before he spoke, Italy's foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, told reporters that the United States had been 'informed at the last minute' of the Israeli strike. 'But there was no involvement on the part of the United States,' Mr. Tajani said. 'It was simply information which was provided,' adding that he believed the G7's collective efforts deserved credit for 'the small scale of the event.' Mr. Tajani did not say how he knew the United States had not been notified in advance, but he had recently come from a meeting with Mr. Blinken and other G7 ministers. A senior American official said on Friday that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before its attack on Iran. The G7 weighed in collectively in a statement concluding the three-day meeting, urging countries to prevent further escalation 'in light of reports of strikes' on Friday. The G7 includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and the European Union. The statement also said that the member nations 'condemn in the strongest terms Iran's direct and unprecedented attack' on Israel. 'Israel and its people have our full solidarity and support and we reaffirm our commitment toward Israel's security,' it added. The G7 also issued a new warning to Tehran, demanding that 'Iran and its affiliated groups cease their attacks' throughout the Middle East and saying that 'we stand ready to adopt further sanctions or take other measures.' Mr. Blinken said of Iran that 'degrading its missile and drone capabilities' was a key G7 goal. Mr. Blinken also addressed the ongoing conflict in Gaza, pointing a finger at Hamas for the failure so far to reach a cease-fire deal that would include the release of Israeli prisoners. 'The only thing standing behind the Gaza people and a cease-fire is Hamas,' he said. But he also addressed a major friction point with Israel, warning against what Israel says is its planned attack on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have sought shelter from fighting elsewhere in the enclave. Israel has said an invasion of Rafah is necessary to eliminate Hamas battalions in the city. 'We cannot support a major military operation in Rafah,' Mr. Blinken said. Mr. Blinken said that protecting and caring for civilians amid such an operation was 'a monumental task for which we have yet to see a plan.' Asked about the U.S. veto on Thursday of a United Nations Security Council resolution to recognize a Palestinian state, Mr. Blinken said that while the United States supports the creation of such a state, doing so requires negotiations and that the proposed resolution 'will have no effect on actually moving things forward and achieving a Palestinian state.' He added: 'You can put something down on a piece of paper and wave it around. It has no effect. What does and can have an effect is actual diplomacy.' Mr. Blinken also noted that, under U.S. law passed by Congress, U.N. acceptance of a Palestinian member state would require 'cutting off all of our funding for the United Nations.'

Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times World leaders on Friday urged Israel and Iran to de-escalate tensions after Israel struck an Iranian military base, the latest salvo in a cycle of retaliation that has raised fears of a broader war in recent weeks. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain, whose military participated in defending Israel last weekend against Iran's missile and drone attack, told reporters, 'Significant escalation is not in anyone's interests — what we want to see is calm heads prevail across the region.' Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, told reporters during a visit to China, 'It is absolutely essential that the region remains stable and that all sides refrain from further action.' Italy's foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said the Group of 7 nations — which includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States — had changed the agenda of its meeting Friday on the resort island of Capri to 'address the Iran issue and put priority attention on the Middle East.' 'The political goal of the G7 is de-escalation,' Mr. Tajani said. The government of Jordan, which has been criticized in the Arab world for playing a role in intercepting Iran's attack last weekend, issued an especially pointed plea. 'Israeli-Iranian retaliations must end,' Ayman Safadi, Jordan's foreign minister said on Friday. He urged the international community to turn its attention back to Gaza, where six months of Israel's bombardment and ground invasion have killed over 33,000 people and led to extreme hunger in parts of the territory. 'The inhumane war on Gaza must end now,' Mr. Safadi said. 'The focus of the world must remain on ending the catastrophic aggression on Gaza.' A senior American official said on Friday that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before its attack against Iran. Israel gave the administration an alert moments before its warplanes struck the Iranian embassy complex in Damascus on April 1, but the official said the latest attack was expected given all the warnings Israel had issued during the week. 'We were not surprised,' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters. Publicly, Biden administration officials were tight-lipped about Friday's strike, refusing to comment at all about it. Administration officials were keeping quiet to avoid getting the United States pulled into the conflict between Iran and Israel, the official said. Speaking to reporters in Capri, Italy, at a meeting of foreign ministers from Group of 7 nations, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken declined to address the strike, saying only that 'the United States was not involved in any offensive operations.' He added that the G7 was urging all parties to de-escalate.

Initial reaction in both Israel and Iran was muted, which analysts said was a sign that the rivals were seeking to lower the temperature of their conflict. World leaders, who for nearly a week have urged Israel and Iran to avoid starting a broader war in the region, called for both sides to de-escalate tensions on Friday.\nThe Israeli military declined to comment on the strike. A senior U.S. official said that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before the attack. All the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\nThe explosions came less than a week after Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel — nearly all of which were shot down — in response to an April 1 strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed seven Iranian officials. That attack brought the decades-long shadow war between Israel and Iran — waged on land, at sea, in air and in cyberspace — more clearly into the open.\nA Western official and two Iranian officials said that Israel used both missiles fired from warplanes and drones in the strike, suggesting that the attack included more advanced firepower than initial reports indicated. Iranian officials initially told The New York Times that the attack had been carried out only by small drones, possibly launched from inside Iran, and that radar systems had not detected unidentified aircraft entering Iranian airspace. They said that a separate group of small drones was shot down in the region of Tabriz, roughly 500 miles north of Isfahan.\nIn public, Iranian officials sought to downplay the strike. Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi, the commander in chief of Iran's army, said explosions heard early Friday in Isfahan 'were from our air defense firing at a suspicious object,' and that there had been 'no damage.' Iranian news agencies appeared keen to show that things were 'back to normal' in the city.\nPresident Ebrahim Raisi of Iran had warned that 'the tiniest act of aggression' on his country's soil would draw a response. But in the hours after Israel's strike, there have been no public calls for retribution by Iranian officials. One lawmaker, Seyed Nezamedin Mousavi, called the strike 'ridiculous,' saying it showed Israel 'is content with these ineffective actions.'\nIsfahan is one of Iran's most famous and historic cities. The area also hosts a number of Iranian military sites. Iranian media reported that nuclear facilities in Isfahan had not been hit.\nIsraeli leaders came close to ordering widespread strikes in Iran on the night Iran attacked, officials said, but the war cabinet postponed a decision. Mr. Biden and other world leaders urged Israel for days not to retaliate in a way that would inflame a wider Middle East war while it fights Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both allies of Iran.\nApril 19, 2024, 8:07 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 8:07 p.m. ET Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, who is in New York attending U.N. meetings, told Iran's state news agency that the small quadcopter targeting a military base in Isfahan did not have casualties or damage.

Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The Israeli attack on an Iranian air base in Isfahan hit a crucial part of an air defense system, a New York Times analysis of satellite imagery found.\nImages showed that the precision attack at the 8th Shekari Air Base damaged or destroyed the 'flap-lid' radar, which is used in S-300 air defense systems to track incoming targets.\nThe Times used several satellite images in its analysis; the location of the damaged area was first pointed out on the social media platform X by Aurora Intel, and the findings have also been confirmed by a former U.S. government imagery analyst, Chris Biggers.\nThe radar is typically surrounded by several vehicles, including four trucks carrying missiles. Before the strike, the missiles were seen positioned next to the radar. After the strike, they had been moved and did not appear visibly damaged. It was not clear why the missiles had been moved. However, the fact that they appear undamaged indicated that the attack had a very precise target, according to Mr. Biggers.\nAn air defense system at the air base in Isfahan in October 2021.

Credit... -/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images A group of left-leaning House Democrats is urging its colleagues to oppose the $26 billion aid package for Israel, hoping to maximize the number of 'no' votes from the party and send a warning to President Biden about the depth of his political coalition's discontent over his support for Israel's tactics in Gaza.\nFraming the upcoming vote as a make-or-break moral choice akin to Congress's votes to authorize and fund the Iraq war, progressive leaders in the House are working to muster a sizable bloc of Democratic opposition to the aid measure, which is expected to pass on Saturday and become law in the coming days.\n'In the wake of those votes, people came around much, much later and said, ‘We shouldn't have allowed that to go forward,'' Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington and the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said of the decades-ago debate over Iraq. 'And I think that this is that moment.'\nRepresentative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, called it a 'defining vote,' adding, 'We're either going to participate in the carnage, or we're not.'\nThere is little doubt that the bill, which would send roughly $13 billion in military assistance to Israel as it continues its offensive in Gaza, will pass the House, along with money for Ukraine, Taiwan and other American allies.\nBut progressive Democrats estimated that 40 to 60 members of their party may oppose it on the House floor on Saturday. That would be a striking signal from Congress, where ironclad bipartisan backing for Israel has long been the norm. And it would highlight the fraught divisions the war in Gaza has sown within the Democratic Party, even as more Democrats including Mr. Biden have begun to criticize Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's approach to the conflict and urge him to better protect civilians.\nThe legislation would allocate $5 billion to Israel's defense capabilities and $9 billion for 'worldwide humanitarian aid,' including for civilians in Gaza. But it would not place further conditions on how Israel could use American military aid, nor block future arms transfers from the United States as an increasing number of Democrats have sought to do.\nDemocrats who are leading the push against the Israel aid bill said they strongly supported the Jewish state and its right to defend itself, and would vote in favor of sending military aid that supports Israel's defense capabilities, such as by replenishing the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Iron Beam defense systems. They also denounced the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas that prompted the war, and said the hostages taken by Hamas must be released.\nBut they argued that approving more offensive weaponry without conditions was an untenable moral and political position that would amount to an endorsement of Mr. Netanyahu's prosecution of the war, including his intention to invade Rafah over the objections of the Biden administration. More than 33,000 people in Gaza have been killed since the start of the conflict, according to the health ministry there, and the population is facing a hunger crisis.\n'I understand the need for defensive weapons for Israel, particularly in light of the attack by Iran,' said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, who ran his first campaign on an antiwar platform and helped lead efforts to end U.S. participation in the war in Yemen. 'But there is no justification to provide bombs and weapons to Netanyahu to continue the war in Gaza that is killing thousands of innocent Palestinian women and children.'\nSaturday's vote will recall a similar situation from 2007, when the speaker at the time, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, split a piece of spending legislation to allow Democrats to register their opposition to funding the Iraq war while backing a domestic funding bill. Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, similarly divided the foreign aid package to be considered on Saturday in order to get each element across the finish line in the face of distinct coalitions of resistance to different pieces of the bill.\nIn a critical test vote on Friday, the House agreed, 316 to 94, to bring up the package, with 39 Democrats — mostly progressives — joining 55 Republicans in opposition.\n'This is a moment for members of Congress who support a safe and secure Israel to send a message that giving Netanyahu more offensive weapons is not a path for peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians,' Representative Becca Balint, Democrat of Vermont and the first Jewish member of Congress to call for a cease-fire, said in an interview. 'To give Netanyahu more offensive weapons at this stage, I believe, is to condone the destruction of Gaza that we've seen in the last six months. And it's also a green light for an invasion of Rafah.'\nRepresentative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat who led the opposition to funding for the Iraq war in 2007, said the conversations among Democrats in Congress opposing continued U.S. backing for the war in Gaza were 'not unlike' those that took place 17 years ago.\n'We may well be casting the vote on whether a much wider war takes place, and whether American weapons go that result in the death of thousands of innocent people,' Mr. Doggett said.\nThe Democrats who oppose the aid package for Israel represent a minority of their caucus. But they see a 'no' vote as part of a strategy to pressure Mr. Biden to condition aid and halt future offensive weapons transfers. Through many meetings, text chains and conversations with the administration, they have worked to shift the president's approach to Israel, while underscoring the electoral risks Mr. Biden faces among voters who helped power him to the White House in 2020 and are now furious over his handling of the war.\n'The only way to get a course correction is for a sizable number within the Democratic caucus to say it must shift,' Ms. Balint said.\nRepresentative Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat who has been pressing Mr. Biden to withhold offensive weapons from Israel, said a big 'no' vote would strengthen the president's hand to do so.\n'It helps the administration to have some number of Democrats express ourselves in this way,' he said.\nRepresentative Greg Casar, Democrat of Texas, said he hoped a substantial number of Democrats opposing the bill would give the Biden administration greater leverage to influence the Israeli government's approach to the war.\n'I hope this vote will show the world that there is a really significant segment of the United States that doesn't want to see expanded and widening wars,' he said.\nAn Israeli air force F-15 warplane landing at an air base in central Israel on Monday. Credit... Ohad Zwigenberg/Associated Press Israeli warplanes fired missiles on Iran during a retaliatory strike early Friday morning, one Western official and two Iranian officials said, suggesting that the attack included more advanced firepower than initial reports indicated.\nIt was not immediately clear the types of missiles used, from where they were fired, whether any were intercepted by Iran's defenses or where they landed.\nThe Western official and the Iranian officials requested anonymity to discuss classified information.\nPreviously, Iranian officials said Friday's attack on a military base in central Iran was conducted by small aerial drones, most likely launched from inside Iranian territory. A separate group of small drones, they said soon after the attack, was shot down in the region of Tabriz, roughly 500 miles north of Isfahan.\nIsrael has not publicly claimed responsibility for Friday's attack and would not comment on the use of planes or missiles.\nIsrael's strike came in response to an Iranian attack last weekend in which Iran fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. A majority of the weapons used in that salvo were fired from Iranian territory and intercepted by Israel and its allies before causing any damage.\nBy contrast, the Iranian officials said, Iran's military did not detect anything entering Iran's airspace on Friday, including drones, missiles and aircraft. Iran's state news agency IRNA reported that no missile attacks occurred and that Iran's air defense system was not activated.\nIran's decision to launch its strike primarily from its own soil last week was perceived by Israel as an escalation in the countries' long-simmering shadow war. The Iranians believe the large salvo is helping with deterrence. Throughout the yearslong conflict, the two countries have traded clandestine attacks, including targeted assassinations, cyberattacks and conventional strikes conducted from and within third countries.\nIran's attack last week was itself prompted by an Israeli strike on April 1, in which Israeli aircraft killed several Iranian armed forces commanders in Syria.\nBy using drones seemingly launched from inside Iran's territory rather than its own, Israel hinted at a willingness to turn down the temperature on the conflict while also demonstrating an ability to conduct attacks that Iran could not detect.\nOne Iranian official, a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, said that even though the strike did little damage, the likelihood that drones were fired from under Iran's nose sent a message about Israel's capabilities.\nA guided missile fired from an undetected warplane, even if it landed outside Iranian territory, would most likely deliver a similar threat.\nOfficials from both countries remained largely quiet about Friday's attack, a gesture that appeared aimed at de-escalating a conflict some fear could spiral into a broader regional war. Israel's silence on the attack, an Iranian official said, would allow Tehran to treat the strike as it had comparable previous attacks and not prompt an immediate response.\nMahdi Mohammadi, a senior adviser to Iran's Parliament speaker, said that Israel's limited attack on Iran showed that Iran had achieved its goal of deterrence. Israel's refusal to openly claim responsibility, he said, amounts to a victory for Iran.\nIsrael's attack, he said on the messaging app Telegram, was meant to show that it had the 'capability to access Iran but in practice it also showed that it has accepted that it should not repeat its miscalculation.'\nApril 19, 2024, 2:43 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 2:43 p.m. ET The White House maintained public silence about the Israeli strike on Iran. 'I'm not going to speak or speculate about any of the reports that are out there,' Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said at her daily briefing. John Kirby, the national security spokesman who typically speaks on foreign policy issues, did not join the briefing.\nApril 19, 2024, 2:48 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 2:48 p.m. ET Jean-Pierre did repeat the president's standard position urging against widening the war: 'We do not want to see this conflict escalate. We continue to consult with our allies and partners, including in the region, to reduce further risk of escalation in the region.'\nCredit...

Daily life appeared to return to normal in Isfahan on Friday, according to Iranian state news media and a resident who was interviewed, hours after Israel's attack on a nearby military base continued the cycle of strikes and counterstrikes between the two countries.\nBut tensions from the overnight attack reverberated through the city, and some residents described the threat of full-fledged war as crippling — despite analysts' assessment that both nations were trying to avoid further escalation.\nMehrdad, 43, an engineer from Isfahan, said the latest retaliation left him and his pregnant wife feeling stressed and unwell. He asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution.\n'The future of this country concerns me,' he said. 'I believe nothing good is expected.'\nThough he said that the city had returned 'back to its normal' and reactions from officials were muted — which he believed was to help make people feel at ease — many residents remain scared after a stressful night of explosions.\nFor the first six months of the war between Israel and Hamas, Iran's involvement in fighting had been limited to its proxies, including the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and the Yemeni Houthi militia. But after Iran's first direct strike on Israel last weekend, Mehrdad said, 'things are coming to the surface.'\nHe hoped that diplomatic mediation would put an end to the threat of war, and he worried that the county's infrastructure would be 'ruined' by further Israeli attacks.\n'Our economic situation is awful. We have 50 percent annual inflation,' he said. 'Now guess what would happen if the war materialized. What would happen to our living conditions in this country?'\nMahsa, 34, an accountant from Isfahan who also asked that her last name not be used for fear of retribution, described a tense atmosphere of fear and instability. The economy is often the main topic of conversation when people gather, she said, and many are worried about the consequences of a wider war.\n'When Iran attacked, we were all worried and we really didn't know what to expect,' she said, describing the cycle of retaliation between Israel and Iran as a 'show game.'\n'Of course, after this Israeli attack, the direction of the game will be determined,' she added. 'Either a full-scale war, or the end of this line, or just threats.'\nThe distress is crushing. Mahsa said her mental health had deteriorated, describing an instance last week when she broke down sobbing in the middle of the street for seemingly no reason while on a run. Dreams seem 'more impossible to achieve, day by day,' she said.\n'We don't have much mental energy left,' she added.\nA correction was made on : An earlier version of this article misstated the gender of Mahsa, an accountant from Isfahan, Iran.

Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times For decades, Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war across the Middle East, trading attacks by land, sea, air and in cyberspace. A recent round of strikes — mainly an aerial barrage by Iran against Israel last weekend — has brought the conflict more clearly into the open and raised fears of a broader war.\nA retaliatory Israeli strike on an Iranian air base on Friday, however, appeared limited in scope, and analysts said it suggested an effort to pull back from the dangerous cycle and potentially move the war back into the shadows.\nHere is a recent history of the conflict:\nAugust 2019: An Israeli airstrike killed two Iranian-trained militants in Syria, a drone set off a blast near a Hezbollah office in Lebanon and an airstrike in Qaim, Iraq, killed a commander of an Iran-backed Iraqi militia. Israel accused Iran at the time of trying to establish an overland arms-supply line through Iraq and northern Syria to Lebanon, and analysts said the strikes were aimed at stopping Iran and signaling to its proxies that Israel would not tolerate a fleet of smart missiles on its borders.\nAugust 2019: An Israeli airstrike killed two Iranian-trained militants in Syria, a drone set off a blast near a Hezbollah office in Lebanon and an airstrike in Qaim, Iraq, killed a commander of an Iran-backed Iraqi militia.

A senior adviser to the Revolutionary Guards, General Mousavi was described as having been a close associate of General Suleimani and was said to have helped oversee the shipment of arms to Hezbollah. Israel, adopting its customary stance, declined to comment directly on whether it was behind General Mousavi's death.\nJanuary 2024: An explosion in a suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, killed Saleh al-Arouri, a Hamas leader, along with two commanders from that group's armed wing, the first assassination of a top Hamas official outside the West Bank and Gaza in recent years.

Israel said for days it would respond, before a strike on Friday hit a military air base near the central Iranian city of Isfahan.\nThis satellite image from Planet Labs PBC shows damage on the roof of an Iranian military workshop, center, after a drone attack in Isfahan, Iran, on Feb. 2. Credit... Planet Labs PBC Iranian officials said that the Israeli strike on Friday morning was carried out by small exploding drones, a tactic that would follow a well-established pattern in Israeli attacks on Iranian military targets.\nAs Israel has targeted Iranian defense and military officials and infrastructure, small drones — specifically ones known as quadcopters — have been a signature of those operations. Quadcopter drones, so named because they have four rotors, have a short flight range and can explode on impact.\nThe drones might have been launched from inside Iran, whose radar systems had not detected unidentified aircraft entering Iranian airspace, Iranian officials said. If the drones were launched within the country, it demonstrates once again Israel's ability to mount clandestine operations in Iranian territory.\nIsrael's military has not commented on Friday's strike. Though it rarely claims responsibility publicly for attacks against Iranian targets, several attacks in recent years have used drones:\nAugust 2019: Israel sent an exploding drone into the heart of a Hezbollah-dominated neighborhood in Beirut, Lebanon, to destroy what Israeli officials described as machinery used in the production of precision missiles.\nJune 2021: A quadcopter exploded outside Tehran at one of Iran's main manufacturing centers for centrifuges, which purify uranium and are used at the country's two major uranium enrichment facilities. Western officials have closely watched activity at those facilities for signs that Iran could be moving toward producing a nuclear weapon. Iran claimed that there had been no damage to the site outside Tehran, but satellite images showed evidence of significant damage.\nFebruary 2022: Six quadcopters exploded at Kermanshah, Iran's main manufacturing and storage plant for military drones.\nMay 2022: A strike targeted the highly sensitive Parchin military site outside Tehran, where Iran develops missile, nuclear and drone technology. Quadcopter drones exploded into a building, killing an engineer and injuring another person, Iranians with knowledge of the attack said at the time.\nJanuary 2023: A drone attack on an Iranian military facility in January 2023 caused a large explosion in the center of Isfahan, the city near the air base that was struck on Friday. At the time, Iran made no effort to hide the fact that an attack had happened, but said it had done little damage. Iranian state media reported that drones had targeted an ammunition manufacturing plant but had been shot down by a surface-to-air defense system.\nJanuary 2023: A drone attack on an Iranian military facility in January 2023 caused a large explosion in the center of Isfahan, the city near the air base that was struck on Friday.

Blinken at a news conference in Capri, Italy, on Friday. Credit... Gregorio Borgia/Associated Press Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Friday that the United States 'has not been involved in any offensive operations' in Iran when asked about Israel's strike on the country on Friday, but he declined to comment further.\nMr. Blinken spoke on the last day of a meeting of Group of 7 ministers in Capri, Italy, where the agenda was dominated by the conflict in the Middle East, including the exchanges of strikes in the past week between Israel and Iran. In remarks to reporters before departing the island, Mr. Blinken said the G7 was unified in urging de-escalation between Iran and Israel to avoid a wider war.\nBut Mr. Blinken would not even directly confirm the Israeli strike, which appeared to be the country's first military response to Iran's attack last weekend, referring instead to 'reported events,' and he would not say whether the United States had been notified in advance of the Israeli action. Shortly before he spoke, Italy's foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, told reporters that the United States had been 'informed at the last minute' of the Israeli strike.\n'But there was no involvement on the part of the United States,' Mr. Tajani said. 'It was simply information which was provided,' adding that he believed the G7's collective efforts deserved credit for 'the small scale of the event.'\nMr. Tajani did not say how he knew the United States had not been notified in advance, but he had recently come from a meeting with Mr. Blinken and other G7 ministers. A senior American official said on Friday that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before its attack on Iran.\nThe G7 weighed in collectively in a statement concluding the three-day meeting, urging countries to prevent further escalation 'in light of reports of strikes' on Friday. The G7 includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and the European Union.\nThe statement also said that the member nations 'condemn in the strongest terms Iran's direct and unprecedented attack' on Israel.\n'Israel and its people have our full solidarity and support and we reaffirm our commitment toward Israel's security,' it added.\nThe G7 also issued a new warning to Tehran, demanding that 'Iran and its affiliated groups cease their attacks' throughout the Middle East and saying that 'we stand ready to adopt further sanctions or take other measures.'\nMr. Blinken said of Iran that 'degrading its missile and drone capabilities' was a key G7 goal.\nMr. Blinken also addressed the ongoing conflict in Gaza, pointing a finger at Hamas for the failure so far to reach a cease-fire deal that would include the release of Israeli prisoners.\n'The only thing standing behind the Gaza people and a cease-fire is Hamas,' he said.\nBut he also addressed a major friction point with Israel, warning against what Israel says is its planned attack on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have sought shelter from fighting elsewhere in the enclave. Israel has said an invasion of Rafah is necessary to eliminate Hamas battalions in the city.\n'We cannot support a major military operation in Rafah,' Mr. Blinken said. Mr. Blinken said that protecting and caring for civilians amid such an operation was 'a monumental task for which we have yet to see a plan.'\nAsked about the U.S. veto on Thursday of a United Nations Security Council resolution to recognize a Palestinian state, Mr. Blinken said that while the United States supports the creation of such a state, doing so requires negotiations and that the proposed resolution 'will have no effect on actually moving things forward and achieving a Palestinian state.'\nHe added: 'You can put something down on a piece of paper and wave it around. It has no effect. What does and can have an effect is actual diplomacy.'\nMr. Blinken also noted that, under U.S. law passed by Congress, U.N. acceptance of a Palestinian member state would require 'cutting off all of our funding for the United Nations.'\nApril 19, 2024, 9:49 a.m. ET April 19, 2024, 9:49 a.m. ET Cassandra Vinograd\nCassandra Vinograd Reporting from Jerusalem The Iranian news media appear keen to show that things are 'back to normal' in Isfahan.

He urged the international community to turn its attention back to Gaza, where six months of Israel's bombardment and ground invasion have killed over 33,000 people and led to extreme hunger in parts of the territory.\n'The inhumane war on Gaza must end now,' Mr. Safadi said. 'The focus of the world must remain on ending the catastrophic aggression on Gaza.'\nA senior American official said on Friday that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before its attack against Iran.\nIsrael gave the administration an alert moments before its warplanes struck the Iranian embassy complex in Damascus on April 1, but the official said the latest attack was expected given all the warnings Israel had issued during the week.\n'We were not surprised,' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters.\nPublicly, Biden administration officials were tight-lipped about Friday's strike, refusing to comment at all about it. Administration officials were keeping quiet to avoid getting the United States pulled into the conflict between Iran and Israel, the official said.\nSpeaking to reporters in Capri, Italy, at a meeting of foreign ministers from Group of 7 nations, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken declined to address the strike, saying only that 'the United States was not involved in any offensive operations.'

            "summary": "Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index Prosecutors in the first criminal trial of an American president began laying out their case for a jury of 12 New Yorkers on Monday, saying Donald J. Trump engaged in a conspiracy to cover up a sex scandal in order to get elected president in 2016. The first witness called was the tabloid publisher David Pecker, whom prosecutors described as one member of a three-man plot to conceal damaging stories — including a porn star's account of a sexual tryst — as Mr. Trump mounted his bid for the presidency. Mr. Pecker was on the stand for only a few minutes in the afternoon before court adjourned for the day. He described how his publication, The National Enquirer, paid for stories, a practice he called 'checkbook journalism.' He is expected to return to the stand on Tuesday. Matthew Colangelo, one of the prosecutors for the Manhattan district attorney's office, told the jury in his opening statement that the case was about 'a criminal conspiracy and a coverup,' describing how Mr. Trump, his longtime counsel Michael D. Cohen, and Mr. Pecker engaged in a strategy to 'catch and kill' negative stories. The lead lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, insisted in his opening statement that the former president had done nothing wrong. 'President Trump is innocent,' he told the jury. 'President Trump did not commit any crimes.' The case centers on a $130,000 hush-money payment that Mr. Cohen made to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, to buy her silence as the 2016 campaign was winding down. Prosecutors say he was reimbursed by Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump falsified business records to conceal his conduct. Mr. Colangelo said the payment to Ms. Daniels came on the heels of another scandal — the 'Access Hollywood' tape, on which Mr. Trump bragged about groping women. Ms. Daniels's account, he said, 'could have been devastating to his campaign.' He added, 'With pressure mounting and Election Day fast approaching, Donald Trump agreed to the payoff and directed Cohen to proceed.' Mr. Cohen, who was an executive vice president at the Trump Organization and counsel to Mr. Trump, and Mr. Pecker are expected to be central witnesses. Mr. Blanche attacked Mr. Cohen's credibility, saying that his livelihood hinges on attacking the former president, and insisted that prosecutors were attempting to present perfectly legal activities, such as entering into nondisclosure agreements, in a negative light. 'I have a spoiler alert: There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,' Mr. Blanche said. 'It's called democracy.' He continued: 'They put something sinister on this idea as if it were a crime. You'll learn it's not.' Here's what else to know about the trial: The Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump was unveiled a year ago by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and if convicted could face up to four years in prison. Those are felonies because prosecutors say Mr. Trump sought to conceal another crime. On Monday, they strongly emphasized a violation of state election law — conspiracy to promote election — that is not one of the actual charges, but they say is baked into the overall crime.\nThe case is the former president's first criminal trial, although he has been indicted three other times in three other cities. With those other cases tied up in appeals and other delays, the Manhattan case may be the only one he faces before the 2024 presidential election. The trial is expected to last six weeks.\nBefore opening statements, the judge overseeing the case delivered a crucial ruling that determined what prosecutors can question Mr. Trump about should he decide to take the stand in his own defense. The ruling, a significant victory for prosecutors that might prompt Mr. Trump to decide not to testify, allows them to question him about several recent losses he suffered in unrelated civil trials, including a fraud case this year in which the former president was found liable for conspiring to manipulate his net worth and was penalized $454 million.\nThe jury was drawn from a pool of residents of Manhattan, where Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular; during jury selection, dozens of prospective jurors were excused because they said they could not be impartial. But the jurors who were selected each pledged to decide the case based only on the facts.

Matthew Colangelo, a prosecutor, said there would be 'only one conclusion: Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.' Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times The Manhattan district attorney's office and lawyers for Donald J. Trump presented opening statements to jurors on Monday, with prosecutors accusing the former president of entering a criminal conspiracy while the defense sought to discredit two key witnesses. A prosecutor, Matthew Colangelo, began by telling jurors that Mr. Trump had conspired with his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, and the publisher of The National Enquirer, David Pecker, to conceal damaging stories during his 2016 campaign. 'This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover-up,' Mr. Colangelo said, telling a story about a hush-money payment to a porn star and insisting that the former president was ultimately responsible. In the end, Mr. Colangelo said, there would be 'only one conclusion: Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.' Immediately after Mr. Colangelo's presentation, Mr. Trump's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, directly disagreed, insisting that the jury acquit the former president. Mr. Trump, he said, had engaged in actions that were legal and normal. 'President Trump did not commit any crimes,' Mr. Blanche told the jury, using the former president's preferred form of address. The lawyer told jurors that Mr. Trump had earned the right to be referred to as 'president' and reminded them that he was the presumptive Republican nominee. Mr. Blanche argued that there was nothing illegal about nondisclosure agreements, which he said companies, the wealthy and the famous all use frequently. And, he said, prosecutors were wrong to suggest something criminal about Mr. Trump's efforts to win the White House. 'I have a spoiler alert: There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,' Mr. Blanche said. 'It's called democracy.' Mr. Blanche asserted that Mr. Cohen, a key prosecution witness, was paid for legal services, and he attempted to undermine Mr. Cohen's credibility. Mr. Blanche called Mr. Cohen a 'criminal' who 'can't be trusted' and suggested that he was testifying only because he didn't get a job in the Trump administration. He also took aim at Stormy Daniels, the former porn star who claimed she had sex with Mr. Trump, characterizing her as an opportunist who had used a brief encounter with Mr. Trump related to his reality show, 'The Apprentice,' to make huge sums of money. He added that Ms. Daniels was 'biased' against the former president and made a living off her story about the sexual encounter. Mr. Blanche also sought to minimize the charges, saying the records at the heart of the case were just '34 pieces of paper' that the former president had nothing to do with. Mr. Trump is accused of falsifying business records — which is a felony if prosecutors can show the records were altered with an intent to commit or conceal a second crime. A year ago, when the former president was formally charged with 34 felonies, the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, told reporters that he did not have to specify what the second crime was, and listed three options. During opening statements, Mr. Colangelo made it clear he believed that the strongest case relied on one of those options: convincing jurors that Mr. Trump concealed the violation of a state law that forbids 'conspiracy to promote or prevent an election.'

The New York state court system has just agreed to publish a transcript of each day's proceeding by the end of the following day on its website. You can find the daily transcripts here. April 22, 2024, 1:07 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:07 p.m. ET Trump's motorcade left the courthouse just after 1:05 p.m., wrapping up the trial's first day of testimony. The view was blocked by an N.Y.P.D. dump truck, to many reporters' great frustration. Inside Collect Pond Park, across from the courthouse, a lone pro-Trump protester's 'Trump for President '24' banner flaps meekly in the light breeze. April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse The charges against Trump, which accuse him of falsifying records, are felonies because prosecutors say he sought to conceal another crime. Prosecutors had said before the trial that they had a menu of three crimes to choose from. The one they emphasized most strongly today is a violation of state election law: 'conspiracy to promote election.' It's not one of the actual charges, but they say it was baked into the overall crime. April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse And its worth emphasizing that when the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, was first asked about this, at a news conference directly after Trump was formally charged, he said that prosecutors did not have to specify which crime they were alleging Trump concealed. But today, Colangelo took the opposite tack: hitting the word 'conspiracy' again and again. April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET With the trial now underway, here's the People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump by the numbers: The case was born as 'Investigation No. 2018-00403803 – Investigation Into the Business Affairs of John Doe.' That's how the Manhattan district attorney's office identified the six-year inquiry that led to today's proceedings, with the number and name appearing on subpoenas and the correspondence case. Arrest No. M23613757 was given to Mr. Trump when he surrendered last year on April 4. And when the former president was arraigned later that day, his indictment was given a Docket Number, IND-71543-23, which the court system uses to track the case.

Nate Schweber for The New York Times Andrew Giuliani, the son of Donald J. Trump's former lawyer and a regular strutting presence on the periphery of the courthouse where the former president is on trial, posed for photos inside Collect Pond Park. Grinning and wearing a campaign jacket, Mr. Giuliani, who has made a career as a right-wing media figure, hugged supporters of Mr. Trump on Monday. From one, he borrowed a flag with Mr. Trump's face that promotes him for president in 2024. 'Two-thousand twenty-four years in prison!' taunted Ricky Caballero, 56, from Brooklyn. 'He owes your dad money. Why you out here supporting him?' Mr. Caballero wore a tank top with a Puerto Rican flag. He said that was his heritage, and that he remembers watching Mr. Trump lob paper towels at survivors of Hurricane Maria in 2017. Mr. Caballero said he was still furious. Mr. Giuliani circulated like a celebrity among Mr. Trump's supporters and ignored Mr. Caballero. It was one of a number of loud exchanges between supporters and detractors of Mr. Trump that were noticeably monitored by the police. There were no police in the park on Friday, when a man amid a mental health crisis burned himself to death in an anti-government protest. On Monday, there were six community affairs officers and six regular uniformed officers watching closely for trouble. At one point, the sound of the national anthem wafted through the park, courtesy of the flute-playing activist Marc Crawford Leavitt. 'I'm just playing and no one can argue with my playing patriotic songs,' he said, a sign decrying Trump as a liar hanging around his neck. Anusha Bayya contributed reporting.

April 22, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET Jesse McKinley Reporting from the courthouse Pecker says in his experience, the only thing that's important 'is the cover' of a magazine. David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, was described as a master of the 'catch-and-kill' technique by people who have worked for him. Credit... Mary Altaffer/Associated Press 'Catch-and-kill' is a term coined by old-time tabloid editors for buying the exclusive rights to stories, or 'catching' them, for the specific purpose of ensuring the information never becomes public. That's the 'killing' part. Why would anyone want to spend money on a story that it never intends to publish? In the world of tabloid journalism, where ethical lines are blurry, deciding what to publish and why is often a calculus that covers favors doled out and chits called in. David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, who also oversaw other tabloids such as Star and lifestyle publications such as Men's Fitness, was a master of the technique, according to people who have worked for him. In 2003, Mr. Pecker's company, American Media Inc., bought several muscle magazines founded by a mentor of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilding legend and movie star. When Mr. Schwarzenegger, who was often featured in those magazines, jumped into the recall election to replace California's governor, Mr. Pecker ordered his staff to buy up negative stories about him in order to protect his investment, former employees said. Staff members called it 'the David Pecker Project.' American Media paid $20,000 to a former mistress of Mr. Schwarzenegger so that she would not speak about their affair — though news of it had previously been published. The company paid another $1,000 to her friend and $2,000 to a man who had a video of Mr. Schwarzenegger dancing lewdly in Rio de Janeiro 20 years earlier. Mr. Schwarzenegger was elected governor. Mr. Pecker's publications made deals with other celebrities as well, though not always for money. He traded away dirt about the golfer Tiger Woods in exchange for an exclusive interview in Men's Fitness in 2007, according to people with knowledge of that episode. And, according to the prosecutors in the Manhattan trial of Donald J. Trump, Mr. Pecker employed 'catch-and-kill' tactics in the 2016 presidential election, paying a doorman and a Playboy model to suppress negative stories about Mr. Trump and boost the candidacy of his longtime associate.  April 22, 2024, 12:11 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:11 p.m. ET Kate Christobek Reporting from the courthouse Justice Merchan has shown so far that he is eager to keep this trial on schedule. Court will be adjourned for the day in less than a half an hour, but yet the judge has chosen to start the first witness. He seems serious about keeping his word to the jurors that the trial will last six weeks. April 22, 2024, 12:08 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:08 p.m. ET Alan Feuer Providing analysis of Trump cases What will be interesting about Pecker's testimony, if it goes as opening statements suggested it would, is that he won't really be describing Trump's involvement in any actual criminal activity. Rather, he will serve as a tour guide to the seamy way in which Trump used The National Enquirer to his political advantage — a storytelling point on the way to alleged criminal activity. April 22, 2024, 12:10 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:10 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse And yet, prosecutors have framed Pecker's involvement here as part of a 'conspiracy.' This could be a risk for them — conspiracy is not one of the charged crimes. And this jury has at least two lawyers. David Pecker's publication, The National Enquirer, was a repository for as many secrets as it published. Credit... Marion Curtis/Associated Press The first witness in Donald J. Trump's criminal is David Pecker, who was the publisher of The National Enquirer, and had traded favors with Mr. Trump since the 1990s. Mr. Pecker, who was sometimes referred to as the 'tabloid king,' had long used his publications to curry favor with Mr. Trump and other celebrities, in exchange for tips or for business reasons. Staff members called Mr. Trump, like other favored stars who were off limits, an 'F.O.P.' — 'Friend of Pecker.' Mr. Trump and Mr. Pecker, along with Mr. Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen, hatched a plan in August 2015 to boost his upstart presidential campaign, prosecutors say. The former Trump allies are each expected to take a turn on the witness stand, giving testimony that could help make him the first president convicted of a felony. Prosecutors for Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, will try to show that the hush money payment to a porn star at the center of the trial was part of a larger effort to suppress negative news about Mr. Trump to sway the election. That scheme, they will contend, includes two other deals, both involving Mr. Pecker. Mr. Trump had announced his presidential campaign in June 2015. The plan the men laid out two months later was simple, according to court documents, interviews with people involved in the events or familiar with them, private communications and other records. Mr. Pecker would use The Enquirer to publish positive stories about Mr. Trump's campaign and negative stories about his rivals. He would alert Mr. Trump, through Mr. Cohen, when The Enquirer learned of stories that might threaten Mr. Trump. The Enquirer could buy the rights to those stories in order to suppress them, a practice known in the tabloid world as 'catch and kill.' In late 2015, Mr. Pecker's company paid $30,000 to suppress a claim by a former doorman at a Trump building who said he had heard Mr. Trump fathered a child out of wedlock — a rumor that was apparently untrue. Then in August 2016, The Enquirer's parent company paid $150,000 to a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, to keep her account of an affair with Mr. Trump quiet. Two months later, Mr. Pecker and The Enquirer's editor helped Mr. Cohen negotiate a $130,000 hush-money payment with Stormy Daniels, the former porn star who also said she had sex with Mr. Trump. He has denied both women's claims. Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance crimes in 2018. The Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., made a deal that year to avoid federal prosecution, acknowledging that it had illegally tried to influence the election.

Trump has assembled a team of defense lawyers with extensive experience representing people charged with white-collar crimes to defend him against the charges filed by the Manhattan district attorney's office. Some have worked for Mr. Trump for years. Others are more recent additions, but are involved in the former president's broader legal defense, also representing him in other criminal cases. Here's a look at Mr. Trump's defense team: Mr. Blanche started representing Mr. Trump last year, leaving a prestigious position as a partner at Wall Street's oldest law firm to take him on as a client. He is also representing Mr. Trump in his federal classified documents case in Florida and his federal election interference case in Washington. Mr. Blanche has also represented Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, as well as Boris Epshteyn, an adviser to Mr. Trump. Before turning to private practice, Mr. Blanche was a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where he supervised violent-crime cases. Ms. Necheles has been a lawyer for Mr. Trump since 2021 and represented the Trump Organization during its criminal tax fraud trial in Manhattan. The business was convicted of 17 felonies and ordered by Justice Juan M. Merchan to pay the maximum penalty of $1.6 million. Ms. Necheles previously represented defendants in major organized-crime and public-corruption cases, including Venero Mangano, the Genovese crime family underboss who was known as Benny Eggs. Mr. Bove, the newest addition to Mr. Trump's legal team, is a legal partner to Mr. Blanche. He is a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York who turned to private practice and now represents defendants charged with white-collar crimes. Mr. Stern is a law partner to Ms. Necheles and also defended the Trump Organization in its criminal tax-fraud trial. He has previous experience representing clients charged with bribery, fraud and conspiracy.  Justice Juan M. Merchan handed prosecutors a legal cudgel that could dissuade Donald J. Trump from testifying. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times The judge in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial ruled on Monday morning that prosecutors could ask the former president about a range of previous cases that he has lost, as well as past violations of gag orders, in the event that he decides to testify in his defense. Among other cases, the ruling by the judge, Juan M. Merchan, would allow prosecutors to question Mr. Trump about the civil fraud case brought by the New York attorney general, Letitia James, in which the former president was found to have inflated his net worth to obtain favorable loans. That case resulted in a $454 million judgment against Mr. Trump. Justice Merchan will also allow the Manhattan district attorney's office — which brought the case against Mr. Trump — to question him about civil cases brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. Those cases found that Mr. Trump was liable for sexually abusing and defaming Ms. Carroll in the first instance and for defamation in the second. (Justice Merchan did not mention the sexual abuse finding, only the defamation, in his ruling regarding the Carroll cases on Monday.) Justice Merchan will also let prosecutors ask about Mr. Trump's attack on a law clerk in a civil fraud case, in violation of a gag order, as well as a 2018 decision that led to the dissolution of the Donald J. Trump Foundation to resolve a case brought by the New York attorney general at the time, Barbara Underwood, over financial irregularities. The former president suggested in early April that he would testify in the criminal trial, saying that prosecutors 'have no case.' That said, Mr. Trump has promised to testify in previous cases only to back out, and Justice Merchan's decision could change his thinking on such a maneuver. Justice Merchan said that, in the event that Mr. Trump did testify, he would give jurors 'careful and specific' instructions about the scope of prosecutors' queries, adding that he had 'greatly curtailed' what specifics could be the target of questions. However, Justice Merchan warned Mr. Trump that his ruling was 'a shield and not a sword' and that the former president's testimony could open 'the door to questioning that has otherwise been excluded.' Mr. Trump is being tried on charges that he falsified business records to cover up a hush-money payment to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. He has denied the charges. Susan Hoffinger and Joshua Steinglass are among the experienced team that the Manhattan district attorney has put together to prosecute Donald J. Trump. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has assembled an accomplished team to take on perhaps the most high-profile case in his office's history: the first criminal trial against former President Donald J. Trump. The group includes veteran prosecutors and former white-collar criminal defense lawyers who have extensive experience going up against Mr. Trump. Here's a look at the prosecution team: Mr. Steinglass, who has served as an assistant district attorney since 1998, is a recent addition to this case; in 2022 he helped lead the team that secured a conviction against the Trump Organization for conspiracy, criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records. He typically prosecutes significant violent crimes, such as a violent brawl on the Upper East Side that led to the conviction of two Proud Boy extremists in 2019. After starting her career at the Manhattan district attorney's office, Ms. Hoffinger founded her own firm and spent 20 years as a defense lawyer focusing on white-collar criminal defense. She rejoined the district attorney's office in 2022 and worked with Mr. Steinglass to obtain the conviction of the Trump Organization in its criminal tax fraud trial. A prosecutor for 28 years, Mr. Conroy previously led the Manhattan district attorney's office's major economic crimes unit, where he was involved in the prosecution of the bankrupt law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf and supervised investigations into multinational financial institutions for falsification of business records. Mr. Conroy is the longest serving member of this trial team. Mr. Colangelo joined the district attorney's office in 2022 after serving for two years as a senior official at the U.S. Department of Justice. He previously worked for the New York attorney general's office, where he oversaw the investigation into the Trump Foundation, which led to its dissolution. He was also, for a time, one of the lead lawyers on the civil fraud inquiry into Mr. Trump.

Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times The Manhattan criminal trial of Donald J. Trump will be closely followed around the world. But you will not be able to watch the proceedings on TV. There will be no video feed aired live from the courtroom. Nor will there be an audio feed, as some federal courts allow. New York courts generally do not permit video to be broadcast from courtrooms, although a feed is being transmitted into an overflow room for the reporters covering the trial. And cameras will be stationed in the hallway outside the courtroom to capture Mr. Trump's remarks as he enters and leaves. Shortly after court adjourned on Monday, the state's chief administrative judge, Joseph A. Zayas, issued a statement saying that transcripts of each day of the trial would be published online by the end of the following day on the court system's website. Judge Zayas was responding to a request for public transcripts filed last week by a New York lawyer, Jim Walden, on behalf of a civic group and a news website. 'With current law restricting the broadcasting of trial proceedings and courtroom space for public spectators very limited, the release of the daily transcripts on the court system's website is the best way to provide the public a direct view of the proceedings in this historic trial,' Judge Zayas wrote in his statement. Court will be in session, for the most part, every weekday except Wednesdays, from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., until the trial ends. The weeklong jury selection process was a pressure cooker for many of the nearly 300 Manhattan residents who were summoned to be interviewed. Credit... Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times Follow our live coverage of Trump's hush money trial in Manhattan. The two Manhattan residents were led into the courtroom to fulfill a foundational civic duty: to be interviewed as prospective jurors. But in the room when they arrived was a defendant, Donald J. Trump, unlike any in American history. Both would-be jurors, a man and a woman, were eventually excused. But the experience thrust them into the spotlight in a way they never had imagined. One was challenged by Mr. Trump's lawyers over his past social media posts relating to the former president. The other has a medical practice that she could not shut for six weeks while serving on the jury. While they were not chosen as jurors, their experiences illustrate the intensity of the attention focused on Mr. Trump's trial — and on the first jury to ever weigh the fate of a former United States president in a criminal proceeding. Both contacted The New York Times only after they were excused from serving. Though the court's rules protecting prospective jurors' identities end when they are dismissed from serving, The Times is withholding their names and most identifying characteristics about them. Like the other prospective jurors who were considered, both included detailed personal information on the juror questionnaires they filled out, including where they work. They were made to answer those questions by speaking into a microphone in open court; soon, both were blindsided as details of their lives ricocheted around the internet. They said they were frustrated that so much attention was devoted to prospective jurors and ascertaining information about them. While they later learned that the judge in the case, Justice Juan M. Merchan, had ordered the redaction of some of the information jurors were ordered to reveal publicly, they felt that he had acted too late. As with many things connected to the trial, the rhythms and even some of the parameters are being written in real time. Their experiences mirrored some that other prospective jurors who were dismissed have described. One, a man who gave his name as Mark to NBC News, said he had 'satirized Mr. Trump often in my artwork,' and because of that, he had expected not to be chosen. A woman who gave her name as Kara, who said the nature of her job made serving extremely difficult, told NBC News that she realized the gravity of serving on any criminal jury, but particularly this one. Seeing Mr. Trump in person, she said, was 'very jarring.' He was, she realized, just 'another guy.' One of the prospective jurors who spoke with The Times, the man, did not immediately realize what case he was involved in when he was led into the courtroom on the 15th floor of the Manhattan criminal courthouse. The woman had a sense a week earlier, having read a news story about the trial beginning the week she was supposed to respond to a juror summons. The man, sitting a few rows behind the prosecutors' table when the two were part of the first panel of 96 prospective jurors brought into the courtroom Monday afternoon, felt a sense of calm about five minutes into being there. Trump was simply a defendant, he thought. It was a business-records trial. Prosecutors were on one side, the defense lawyers on the other. The woman was struck by the fact that Mr. Trump stood and waved to prospective jurors, she said, as he and his lawyers were introduced to the group. It felt more to her like the behavior of a campaigning candidate than of a criminal defendant. (Mr. Trump, of course, is both.) Both were put off by efforts by Mr. Trump's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, to assess prospective jurors' views of Mr. Trump. The man said Mr. Blanche seemed 'folksy' in a way he found disingenuous, while the woman was sharper, describing a 'witch hunt' to root out people sympathetic to Democrats on the panel — a phrase Mr. Trump uses often to criticize the various prosecutors investigating his conduct. The man in particular was frustrated that he was asked about past social media posts in which he had been critical of Mr. Trump, which Mr. Blanche's team raised and which Justice Merchan ultimately agreed meant the man should be excused. The man believed he could have been fair and resented the implication that he could not have been. Both he and the woman, who said they believed in the system of jury service, noted that they had begun the day taking sworn oaths vowing to render a fair and impartial judgment on the evidence. The man believed his own views — especially views from years ago — had no bearing on his ability to judge the evidence. If anything, he said, he would have been hyper-conscious in doing so. Both had realized the magnitude of what serving on that jury would mean. But they were also conscious of the threats and blowback that could come with weighing evidence against Mr. Trump — particularly with their personal details traceable in public. And both had concerns about being chosen because of that; the man in particular said his spouse had been worried. Both would have valued being part of the historic trial. But both also had a sense of relief that they were not picked.  Former President Donald J. Trump is accused of 34 felonies, but a conviction is no sure thing. Credit... Pool photo by Curtis Means In the official record, the case is known as the People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump, and, for now, the people have the stronger hand: They have insider witnesses, a favorable jury pool and a lurid set of facts about a presidential candidate, a payoff and a porn star. On Monday, the prosecutors will formally introduce the case to 12 all-important jurors, embarking on the first prosecution of an American president. The trial, which could brand Mr. Trump a felon as he mounts another White House run, will reverberate throughout the nation and test the durability of the justice system that Mr. Trump is attacking in a way that no other defendant would be allowed to do. Though the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has assembled a mountain of evidence, a conviction is hardly assured. Over the next six weeks, Mr. Trump's lawyers will seize on three apparent weak points: a key witness's credibility, a president's culpability and the case's legal complexity. Prosecutors will seek to maneuver around those vulnerabilities, dazzling the jury with a tale that mixes politics and sex, as they confront a shrewd defendant with a decades-long track record of skirting legal consequences. They will also seek to bolster the credibility of that key witness, Michael D. Cohen, a former fixer to Mr. Trump who previously pleaded guilty to federal crimes for paying the porn star, Stormy Daniels. Daniel J. Horwitz, a veteran defense lawyer who previously worked in the Manhattan district attorney's office prosecuting white-collar cases, said prosecutors can be expected to corroborate Mr. Cohen's story wherever possible. 'The prosecution has layers upon layers of evidence to back up what Michael Cohen says,' Mr. Horwitz said. Despite its tawdry particulars, District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg has cast the case as one of election interference. Credit... Pool photo by Mary Altaffer Both sides will lay out their cases in opening statements on Monday, offering dueling interpretations of the evidence some six years after the payoff to Ms. Daniels entered the public consciousness and briefly imperiled Mr. Trump's presidency. But in previewing the case for prospective jurors last week, Manhattan prosecutors emphasized neither the payoff that secured Ms. Daniels's silence, nor the sex scandal that was buried in the process. One prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, instead distilled the trial's stakes to a fundamental question: 'This case is about the rule of law and whether or not Donald Trump broke it.' Mr. Steinglass's boss, Mr. Bragg, has offered a loftier interpretation, casting Mr. Trump's actions as election interference. Although Mr. Trump's lawyers might claim he was merely trying to hide embarrassing stories from his family, Mr. Bragg says Mr. Trump orchestrated a scheme to conceal simmering sex scandals from voters as they headed to the polls in 2016. All told, his allies struck three hush-money deals, paying off people who had stories to tell — stories that could have derailed Mr. Trump's candidacy. Mr. Bragg's prosecutors will seek to turn that 2016 campaign strategy against him: The tactics that helped propel Mr. Trump to victory will be admitted as evidence and reconsidered far beyond the courtroom. Aides and friends who lied on Mr. Trump's behalf will take the witness stand to testify against him. They include: David Pecker, the tabloid publisher who bought and buried damaging stories about Mr. Trump; Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman who tried to spin reporters; and Mr. Cohen, the fixer who paid Ms. Daniels. Mr. Pecker, who ran the company that owned The National Enquirer, is set to go first, and is expected to recount for the jury several conversations with Mr. Trump about the hush money, according to a person familiar with the plan. Stormy Daniels was paid $130,000 to bury her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Credit... Jeenah Moon for The New York Times Mr. Trump faces 34 felony counts, and up to four years behind bars, but more than just his freedom is at stake. If convicted, he might lose the right to vote, including to cast a ballot for himself. If he were to win back the White House, he would be the first convicted criminal to serve as commander in chief. And the question of how he might serve a prison sentence, should it come to that if he does not receive probation, could throw the country into turmoil. America has grown accustomed to seeing Mr. Trump smash through its customs and is now witnessing a phenomenon that is a first in the 248 years of its history. Presidents have been impeached, driven from office and rejected at the polls. Mr. Trump is about to be the first to have his fate decided not just by voters, but by 12 citizens in a jury box. And they all hail from Manhattan, the borough that made Mr. Trump famous, and where he is now deeply unpopular. A favorable jury pool, legal experts say, has given Mr. Bragg a leg up at the trial. Yet the jury, which was made final on Friday and includes six alternates, is no rubber stamp: It includes at least two people who have expressed some affection for the former president, and it takes only one skeptical member to force a mistrial, an outcome that Mr. Trump would celebrate as a win. The stakes are high for Mr. Bragg as well. He is betting his career and his legacy on a prosecution he inherited, rejected and then transformed. When he took office in 2022, he declined to bring a financial fraud case against Mr. Trump that his predecessor had prepared, prompting an uproar when two prosecutors resigned in protest. But Mr. Bragg continued to investigate and soon revisited the hush-money deal — an episode that had become known internally as 'the zombie case,' because it kept coming back to life. Little more than a year after taking office, Mr. Bragg indicted the former president. Three other indictments followed in three other cities, but with those cases mired in delay, Mr. Bragg's trial may now be the only one that Mr. Trump will face before Election Day. The Manhattan case comprises the three hush-money deals: with Ms. Daniels, with a former Playboy model and with a onetime doorman who told a tale of Mr. Trump fathering a child out of wedlock. Mr. Pecker and his tabloid bought the silence of the doorman, whose story turned out to be false. They also bought the rights to the story told by the model, Karen McDougal, and then never wrote it, a practice known as 'catch and kill.' David Pecker, the chief executive of American Media, had a cooperative relationship with Mr. Trump for years. Credit... Marion Curtis/Associated Press Then there was Ms. Daniels, who was interested in selling her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Mr. Pecker drew the line there: Her price was too high. Instead, he and a top editor alerted Mr. Cohen, who soon paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 not to tell her story about a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump a decade earlier. Mr. Cohen has said he acted at Mr. Trump's direction, but the former president is not charged over the payment itself. Instead, he stands accused of covering up the transaction by disguising reimbursements to Mr. Cohen. In internal records, Mr. Trump's company marked those payments as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet no such expenses existed, prosecutors say, and the retainer agreement was fictional. Mr. Trump is accused of engineering — or, at least, approving — the coverup. His company, prosecutors argue, produced 34 false records that underpin the counts against him: 11 checks, 11 monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted and 12 entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust. Mr. Trump signed several of the checks in the White House, as prosecutors will surely point out at the trial. But directly linking Mr. Trump to the plot to falsify those records is another matter altogether. His lawyers will be likely to argue that he was oblivious, and that Mr. Cohen handled the specifics. Mr. Cohen hashed out the reimbursement plan with Mr. Trump's chief financial officer, Allen H. Weisselberg, who is serving jail time for perjury and will not testify, records show. The lack of a firsthand witness to confirm Mr. Cohen's account is a potential flaw in the case, but it may not be fatal. Prosecutors plan to introduce a document containing Mr. Weisselberg's handwritten notes about the reimbursements — a key piece of evidence demonstrating that Mr. Cohen did not act alone. And under the law, the prosecutors need not prove that Mr. Trump personally falsified the records. Already during the trial's first week, Mr. Steinglass laid the groundwork with a simple analogy: He asked prospective jurors whether they could accept that, if a husband hired a hit man to murder his wife, the husband was just as guilty as the man who pulled the trigger. 'Can you all follow the same kind of logic in this case?' Mr. Steinglass asked the prospective jurors. Many said they could. Mr. Cohen is expected to offer the closest thing this case has to a smoking gun: He is likely to say that, in early 2017, he and Mr. Trump discussed the repayment scheme in the Oval Office. If Mr. Trump testifies in his own defense, that could pit Mr. Cohen's word against Mr. Trump's — a he-said, he-said story, with two questionable narrators. Whether or not Mr. Trump takes the stand, the trial could become a referendum on Mr. Cohen's credibility, with the verdict possibly hinging on a convincing performance. In 2018, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to a variety of federal crimes, admitting to participating in the hush-money deals with Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal and lying to Congress about plans for a Trump business deal in Russia. Mr. Trump's lawyers will seek to emphasize Mr. Cohen's checkered past at every turn. And, on cross-examination, Mr. Trump's lawyers are likely to portray Mr. Cohen as a serial liar with a grudge against his former boss. Michael D. Cohen, a former fixer to Mr. Trump and a conduit for the hush money, will be a crucial witness. Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times Susan Necheles, one of Mr. Trump's lawyers, began that campaign during jury selection. She referenced Mr. Cohen's 2022 book 'Revenge,' questioning the credibility of 'someone who says that they want revenge against President Trump.' Yet the prosecution is expected to note that Mr. Cohen told many of his lies for Mr. Trump. And prosecutors will offer evidence corroborating the broad strokes of Mr. Cohen's story, which could persuade jurors when they are weighing his testimony about the crucial Oval Office meeting. Mr. Trump's White House executive assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, who has been identified as a potential witness, could confirm that Mr. Cohen did indeed meet with Mr. Trump, even if she cannot confirm what they discussed. Mr. Pecker can support at least some of Mr. Cohen's testimony about Mr. Trump's involvement in the hush-money deals. And a recording Mr. Cohen made of a call he had with Mr. Trump will capture the former president discussing the deal with Ms. McDougal. 'The prosecution's argument is that you can trust Michael Cohen beyond a reasonable doubt as to their isolated conversation,' said Mr. Horwitz, the former prosecutor. He called the approach 'Prosecuting 101.' William K.

Trump engaged in a conspiracy to cover up a sex scandal in order to get elected president in 2016.\nThe first witness called was the tabloid publisher David Pecker, whom prosecutors described as one member of a three-man plot to conceal damaging stories — including a porn star's account of a sexual tryst — as Mr. Trump mounted his bid for the presidency.\nMr. Pecker was on the stand for only a few minutes in the afternoon before court adjourned for the day. He described how his publication, The National Enquirer, paid for stories, a practice he called 'checkbook journalism.' He is expected to return to the stand on Tuesday.\nMatthew Colangelo, one of the prosecutors for the Manhattan district attorney's office, told the jury in his opening statement that the case was about 'a criminal conspiracy and a coverup,' describing how Mr. Trump, his longtime counsel Michael D. Cohen, and Mr. Pecker engaged in a strategy to 'catch and kill' negative stories.\nThe lead lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, insisted in his opening statement that the former president had done nothing wrong. 'President Trump is innocent,' he told the jury. 'President Trump did not commit any crimes.'\nThe case centers on a $130,000 hush-money payment that Mr. Cohen made to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, to buy her silence as the 2016 campaign was winding down. Prosecutors say he was reimbursed by Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump falsified business records to conceal his conduct.\nMr. Colangelo said the payment to Ms. Daniels came on the heels of another scandal — the 'Access Hollywood' tape, on which Mr. Trump bragged about groping women. Ms. Daniels's account, he said, 'could have been devastating to his campaign.'\nHe added, 'With pressure mounting and Election Day fast approaching, Donald Trump agreed to the payoff and directed Cohen to proceed.'\nMr. Cohen, who was an executive vice president at the Trump Organization and counsel to Mr. Trump, and Mr. Pecker are expected to be central witnesses.\nMr. Blanche attacked Mr. Cohen's credibility, saying that his livelihood hinges on attacking the former president, and insisted that prosecutors were attempting to present perfectly legal activities, such as entering into nondisclosure agreements, in a negative light.\n'I have a spoiler alert: There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,' Mr. Blanche said. 'It's called democracy.'\nHe continued: 'They put something sinister on this idea as if it were a crime. You'll learn it's not.'\nHere's what else to know about the trial:\nThe Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump was unveiled a year ago by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and if convicted could face up to four years in prison. Those are felonies because prosecutors say Mr. Trump sought to conceal another crime. On Monday, they strongly emphasized a violation of state election law — conspiracy to promote election — that is not one of the actual charges, but they say is baked into the overall crime.\nThe case is the former president's first criminal trial, although he has been indicted three other times in three other cities. With those other cases tied up in appeals and other delays, the Manhattan case may be the only one he faces before the 2024 presidential election. The trial is expected to last six weeks.\nBefore opening statements, the judge overseeing the case delivered a crucial ruling that determined what prosecutors can question Mr. Trump about should he decide to take the stand in his own defense. The ruling, a significant victory for prosecutors that might prompt Mr. Trump to decide not to testify, allows them to question him about several recent losses he suffered in unrelated civil trials, including a fraud case this year in which the former president was found liable for conspiring to manipulate his net worth and was penalized $454 million.\nThe jury was drawn from a pool of residents of Manhattan, where Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular; during jury selection, dozens of prospective jurors were excused because they said they could not be impartial. But the jurors who were selected each pledged to decide the case based only on the facts. Read more about them.\nThe case will receive vast media attention, but the proceedings won't be shown on television.\nMatthew Colangelo, a prosecutor, said there would be 'only one conclusion: Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.' Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times The Manhattan district attorney's office and lawyers for Donald J. Trump presented opening statements to jurors on Monday, with prosecutors accusing the former president of entering a criminal conspiracy while the defense sought to discredit two key witnesses.\nA prosecutor, Matthew Colangelo, began by telling jurors that Mr. Trump had conspired with his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, and the publisher of The National Enquirer, David Pecker, to conceal damaging stories during his 2016 campaign.\n'This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover-up,' Mr. Colangelo said, telling a story about a hush-money payment to a porn star and insisting that the former president was ultimately responsible.\nIn the end, Mr. Colangelo said, there would be 'only one conclusion: Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.'\nImmediately after Mr. Colangelo's presentation, Mr. Trump's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, directly disagreed, insisting that the jury acquit the former president. Mr. Trump, he said, had engaged in actions that were legal and normal.\n'President Trump did not commit any crimes,' Mr. Blanche told the jury, using the former president's preferred form of address. The lawyer told jurors that Mr. Trump had earned the right to be referred to as 'president' and reminded them that he was the presumptive Republican nominee.\nMr. Blanche argued that there was nothing illegal about nondisclosure agreements, which he said companies, the wealthy and the famous all use frequently. And, he said, prosecutors were wrong to suggest something criminal about Mr. Trump's efforts to win the White House.\n'I have a spoiler alert: There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,' Mr. Blanche said. 'It's called democracy.'\nMr. Blanche asserted that Mr. Cohen, a key prosecution witness, was paid for legal services, and he attempted to undermine Mr. Cohen's credibility. Mr. Blanche called Mr. Cohen a 'criminal' who 'can't be trusted' and suggested that he was testifying only because he didn't get a job in the Trump administration.\nHe also took aim at Stormy Daniels, the former porn star who claimed she had sex with Mr. Trump, characterizing her as an opportunist who had used a brief encounter with Mr. Trump related to his reality show, 'The Apprentice,' to make huge sums of money.\nHe added that Ms. Daniels was 'biased' against the former president and made a living off her story about the sexual encounter.\nMr. Blanche also sought to minimize the charges, saying the records at the heart of the case were just '34 pieces of paper' that the former president had nothing to do with.\nMr. Trump is accused of falsifying business records — which is a felony if prosecutors can show the records were altered with an intent to commit or conceal a second crime.\nA year ago, when the former president was formally charged with 34 felonies, the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, told reporters that he did not have to specify what the second crime was, and listed three options. During opening statements, Mr. Colangelo made it clear he believed that the strongest case relied on one of those options: convincing jurors that Mr. Trump concealed the violation of a state law that forbids 'conspiracy to promote or prevent an election.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 1:37 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:37 p.m. ET Alan Feuer\nAlan Feuer Providing analysis of Trump cases There's some good news for people who want to follow the Trump trial in detail, but can't make it to the courthouse.

Credit... Mary Altaffer/Associated Press 'Catch-and-kill' is a term coined by old-time tabloid editors for buying the exclusive rights to stories, or 'catching' them, for the specific purpose of ensuring the information never becomes public. That's the 'killing' part.\nWhy would anyone want to spend money on a story that it never intends to publish? In the world of tabloid journalism, where ethical lines are blurry, deciding what to publish and why is often a calculus that covers favors doled out and chits called in.\nDavid Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, who also oversaw other tabloids such as Star and lifestyle publications such as Men's Fitness, was a master of the technique, according to people who have worked for him.\nIn 2003, Mr. Pecker's company, American Media Inc., bought several muscle magazines founded by a mentor of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilding legend and movie star. When Mr. Schwarzenegger, who was often featured in those magazines, jumped into the recall election to replace California's governor, Mr. Pecker ordered his staff to buy up negative stories about him in order to protect his investment, former employees said.\nStaff members called it 'the David Pecker Project.' American Media paid $20,000 to a former mistress of Mr. Schwarzenegger so that she would not speak about their affair — though news of it had previously been published. The company paid another $1,000 to her friend and $2,000 to a man who had a video of Mr. Schwarzenegger dancing lewdly in Rio de Janeiro 20 years earlier. Mr. Schwarzenegger was elected governor.\nMr. Pecker's publications made deals with other celebrities as well, though not always for money. He traded away dirt about the golfer Tiger Woods in exchange for an exclusive interview in Men's Fitness in 2007, according to people with knowledge of that episode.\nAnd, according to the prosecutors in the Manhattan trial of Donald J. Trump, Mr. Pecker employed 'catch-and-kill' tactics in the 2016 presidential election, paying a doorman and a Playboy model to suppress negative stories about Mr. Trump and boost the candidacy of his longtime associate.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 12:11 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:11 p.m. ET Kate Christobek\nKate Christobek Reporting from the courthouse Justice Merchan has shown so far that he is eager to keep this trial on schedule.

This could be a risk for them — conspiracy is not one of the charged crimes. And this jury has at least two lawyers.\nDavid Pecker's publication, The National Enquirer, was a repository for as many secrets as it published. Credit... Marion Curtis/Associated Press The first witness in Donald J. Trump's criminal is David Pecker, who was the publisher of The National Enquirer, and had traded favors with Mr. Trump since the 1990s.\nMr. Pecker, who was sometimes referred to as the 'tabloid king,' had long used his publications to curry favor with Mr. Trump and other celebrities, in exchange for tips or for business reasons. Staff members called Mr. Trump, like other favored stars who were off limits, an 'F.O.P.' — 'Friend of Pecker.'\nMr. Trump and Mr. Pecker, along with Mr. Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen, hatched a plan in August 2015 to boost his upstart presidential campaign, prosecutors say. The former Trump allies are each expected to take a turn on the witness stand, giving testimony that could help make him the first president convicted of a felony.\nProsecutors for Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, will try to show that the hush money payment to a porn star at the center of the trial was part of a larger effort to suppress negative news about Mr. Trump to sway the election. That scheme, they will contend, includes two other deals, both involving Mr. Pecker.\nMr. Trump had announced his presidential campaign in June 2015. The plan the men laid out two months later was simple, according to court documents, interviews with people involved in the events or familiar with them, private communications and other records.\nMr. Pecker would use The Enquirer to publish positive stories about Mr. Trump's campaign and negative stories about his rivals. He would alert Mr. Trump, through Mr. Cohen, when The Enquirer learned of stories that might threaten Mr. Trump. The Enquirer could buy the rights to those stories in order to suppress them, a practice known in the tabloid world as 'catch and kill.'\nIn late 2015, Mr. Pecker's company paid $30,000 to suppress a claim by a former doorman at a Trump building who said he had heard Mr. Trump fathered a child out of wedlock — a rumor that was apparently untrue. Then in August 2016, The Enquirer's parent company paid $150,000 to a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, to keep her account of an affair with Mr. Trump quiet. Two months later, Mr. Pecker and The Enquirer's editor helped Mr. Cohen negotiate a $130,000 hush-money payment with Stormy Daniels, the former porn star who also said she had sex with Mr. Trump. He has denied both women's claims.\nMr. Cohen pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance crimes in 2018.\nThe Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., made a deal that year to avoid federal prosecution, acknowledging that it had illegally tried to influence the election.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 12:07 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:07 p.m. ET Maggie Haberman\nMaggie Haberman Reporting from the courthouse Merchan stops testimony, says he realizes jurors weren't given writing materials to take notes.

Some have worked for Mr. Trump for years. Others are more recent additions, but are involved in the former president's broader legal defense, also representing him in other criminal cases.\nHere's a look at Mr. Trump's defense team:\nMr. Blanche started representing Mr. Trump last year, leaving a prestigious position as a partner at Wall Street's oldest law firm to take him on as a client. He is also representing Mr. Trump in his federal classified documents case in Florida and his federal election interference case in Washington.\nMr. Blanche has also represented Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, as well as Boris Epshteyn, an adviser to Mr. Trump. Before turning to private practice, Mr. Blanche was a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where he supervised violent-crime cases.\nMs. Necheles has been a lawyer for Mr. Trump since 2021 and represented the Trump Organization during its criminal tax fraud trial in Manhattan. The business was convicted of 17 felonies and ordered by Justice Juan M. Merchan to pay the maximum penalty of $1.6 million.\nMs. Necheles previously represented defendants in major organized-crime and public-corruption cases, including Venero Mangano, the Genovese crime family underboss who was known as Benny Eggs.\nMr. Bove, the newest addition to Mr. Trump's legal team, is a legal partner to Mr. Blanche. He is a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York who turned to private practice and now represents defendants charged with white-collar crimes.\nMr. Stern is a law partner to Ms. Necheles and also defended the Trump Organization in its criminal tax-fraud trial.

Trump's criminal trial ruled on Monday morning that prosecutors could ask the former president about a range of previous cases that he has lost, as well as past violations of gag orders, in the event that he decides to testify in his defense.\nAmong other cases, the ruling by the judge, Juan M. Merchan, would allow prosecutors to question Mr. Trump about the civil fraud case brought by the New York attorney general, Letitia James, in which the former president was found to have inflated his net worth to obtain favorable loans. That case resulted in a $454 million judgment against Mr. Trump.\nJustice Merchan will also allow the Manhattan district attorney's office — which brought the case against Mr. Trump — to question him about civil cases brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. Those cases found that Mr. Trump was liable for sexually abusing and defaming Ms. Carroll in the first instance and for defamation in the second. (Justice Merchan did not mention the sexual abuse finding, only the defamation, in his ruling regarding the Carroll cases on Monday.)\nJustice Merchan will also let prosecutors ask about Mr. Trump's attack on a law clerk in a civil fraud case, in violation of a gag order, as well as a 2018 decision that led to the dissolution of the Donald J. Trump Foundation to resolve a case brought by the New York attorney general at the time, Barbara Underwood, over financial irregularities.\nThe former president suggested in early April that he would testify in the criminal trial, saying that prosecutors 'have no case.' That said, Mr. Trump has promised to testify in previous cases only to back out, and Justice Merchan's decision could change his thinking on such a maneuver.\nJustice Merchan said that, in the event that Mr. Trump did testify, he would give jurors 'careful and specific' instructions about the scope of prosecutors' queries, adding that he had 'greatly curtailed' what specifics could be the target of questions.\nHowever, Justice Merchan warned Mr. Trump that his ruling was 'a shield and not a sword' and that the former president's testimony could open 'the door to questioning that has otherwise been excluded.'\nMr. Trump is being tried on charges that he falsified business records to cover up a hush-money payment to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election.

Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has assembled an accomplished team to take on perhaps the most high-profile case in his office's history: the first criminal trial against former President Donald J. Trump. The group includes veteran prosecutors and former white-collar criminal defense lawyers who have extensive experience going up against Mr. Trump.\nHere's a look at the prosecution team:\nMr. Steinglass, who has served as an assistant district attorney since 1998, is a recent addition to this case; in 2022 he helped lead the team that secured a conviction against the Trump Organization for conspiracy, criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records. He typically prosecutes significant violent crimes, such as a violent brawl on the Upper East Side that led to the conviction of two Proud Boy extremists in 2019.\nAfter starting her career at the Manhattan district attorney's office, Ms. Hoffinger founded her own firm and spent 20 years as a defense lawyer focusing on white-collar criminal defense. She rejoined the district attorney's office in 2022 and worked with Mr. Steinglass to obtain the conviction of the Trump Organization in its criminal tax fraud trial.\nA prosecutor for 28 years, Mr. Conroy previously led the Manhattan district attorney's office's major economic crimes unit, where he was involved in the prosecution of the bankrupt law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf and supervised investigations into multinational financial institutions for falsification of business records. Mr. Conroy is the longest serving member of this trial team.\nMr. Colangelo joined the district attorney's office in 2022 after serving for two years as a senior official at the U.S. Department of Justice. He previously worked for the New York attorney general's office, where he oversaw the investigation into the Trump Foundation, which led to its dissolution. He was also, for a time, one of the lead lawyers on the civil fraud inquiry into Mr. Trump.\nBefore joining Mr. Bragg's major economic crimes unit in 2022, Ms. Mangold clerked for a U.S. District Court judge in New Jersey and worked in private practice for over 10 years. As a partner at the law firm Kobre & Kim, Ms. Mangold focused on criminal and regulatory investigations related to financial misconduct.\nMs. Ellis joined the Manhattan district attorney's office in 2018 after working as an associate at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton.

The two Manhattan residents were led into the courtroom to fulfill a foundational civic duty: to be interviewed as prospective jurors.\nBut in the room when they arrived was a defendant, Donald J. Trump, unlike any in American history.\nBoth would-be jurors, a man and a woman, were eventually excused. But the experience thrust them into the spotlight in a way they never had imagined.\nOne was challenged by Mr. Trump's lawyers over his past social media posts relating to the former president. The other has a medical practice that she could not shut for six weeks while serving on the jury.\nWhile they were not chosen as jurors, their experiences illustrate the intensity of the attention focused on Mr. Trump's trial — and on the first jury to ever weigh the fate of a former United States president in a criminal proceeding.\nBoth contacted The New York Times only after they were excused from serving. Though the court's rules protecting prospective jurors' identities end when they are dismissed from serving, The Times is withholding their names and most identifying characteristics about them.\nLike the other prospective jurors who were considered, both included detailed personal information on the juror questionnaires they filled out, including where they work.\nThey were made to answer those questions by speaking into a microphone in open court; soon, both were blindsided as details of their lives ricocheted around the internet. They said they were frustrated that so much attention was devoted to prospective jurors and ascertaining information about them.\nWhile they later learned that the judge in the case, Justice Juan M. Merchan, had ordered the redaction of some of the information jurors were ordered to reveal publicly, they felt that he had acted too late. As with many things connected to the trial, the rhythms and even some of the parameters are being written in real time.\nTheir experiences mirrored some that other prospective jurors who were dismissed have described. One, a man who gave his name as Mark to NBC News, said he had 'satirized Mr. Trump often in my artwork,' and because of that, he had expected not to be chosen.\nA woman who gave her name as Kara, who said the nature of her job made serving extremely difficult, told NBC News that she realized the gravity of serving on any criminal jury, but particularly this one.\nSeeing Mr. Trump in person, she said, was 'very jarring.' He was, she realized, just 'another guy.'\nOne of the prospective jurors who spoke with The Times, the man, did not immediately realize what case he was involved in when he was led into the courtroom on the 15th floor of the Manhattan criminal courthouse. The woman had a sense a week earlier, having read a news story about the trial beginning the week she was supposed to respond to a juror summons.\nThe man, sitting a few rows behind the prosecutors' table when the two were part of the first panel of 96 prospective jurors brought into the courtroom Monday afternoon, felt a sense of calm about five minutes into being there. Trump was simply a defendant, he thought. It was a business-records trial. Prosecutors were on one side, the defense lawyers on the other.\nThe woman was struck by the fact that Mr. Trump stood and waved to prospective jurors, she said, as he and his lawyers were introduced to the group. It felt more to her like the behavior of a campaigning candidate than of a criminal defendant. (Mr. Trump, of course, is both.)\nBoth were put off by efforts by Mr. Trump's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, to assess prospective jurors' views of Mr. Trump. The man said Mr. Blanche seemed 'folksy' in a way he found disingenuous, while the woman was sharper, describing a 'witch hunt' to root out people sympathetic to Democrats on the panel — a phrase Mr. Trump uses often to criticize the various prosecutors investigating his conduct.\nThe man in particular was frustrated that he was asked about past social media posts in which he had been critical of Mr. Trump, which Mr. Blanche's team raised and which Justice Merchan ultimately agreed meant the man should be excused.\nThe man believed he could have been fair and resented the implication that he could not have been. Both he and the woman, who said they believed in the system of jury service, noted that they had begun the day taking sworn oaths vowing to render a fair and impartial judgment on the evidence. The man believed his own views — especially views from years ago — had no bearing on his ability to judge the evidence. If anything, he said, he would have been hyper-conscious in doing so.\nBoth had realized the magnitude of what serving on that jury would mean.\nBut they were also conscious of the threats and blowback that could come with weighing evidence against Mr. Trump — particularly with their personal details traceable in public. And both had concerns about being chosen because of that; the man in particular said his spouse had been worried.\nBoth would have valued being part of the historic trial. But both also had a sense of relief that they were not picked.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J. Trump is accused of 34 felonies, but a conviction is no sure thing.

Trump, and, for now, the people have the stronger hand: They have insider witnesses, a favorable jury pool and a lurid set of facts about a presidential candidate, a payoff and a porn star.\nOn Monday, the prosecutors will formally introduce the case to 12 all-important jurors, embarking on the first prosecution of an American president. The trial, which could brand Mr. Trump a felon as he mounts another White House run, will reverberate throughout the nation and test the durability of the justice system that Mr. Trump is attacking in a way that no other defendant would be allowed to do.\nThough the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has assembled a mountain of evidence, a conviction is hardly assured. Over the next six weeks, Mr. Trump's lawyers will seize on three apparent weak points: a key witness's credibility, a president's culpability and the case's legal complexity.\nProsecutors will seek to maneuver around those vulnerabilities, dazzling the jury with a tale that mixes politics and sex, as they confront a shrewd defendant with a decades-long track record of skirting legal consequences. They will also seek to bolster the credibility of that key witness, Michael D. Cohen, a former fixer to Mr. Trump who previously pleaded guilty to federal crimes for paying the porn star, Stormy Daniels.\nDaniel J. Horwitz, a veteran defense lawyer who previously worked in the Manhattan district attorney's office prosecuting white-collar cases, said prosecutors can be expected to corroborate Mr. Cohen's story wherever possible.\n'The prosecution has layers upon layers of evidence to back up what Michael Cohen says,' Mr. Horwitz said.\nDespite its tawdry particulars, District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg has cast the case as one of election interference. Credit... Pool photo by Mary Altaffer Both sides will lay out their cases in opening statements on Monday, offering dueling interpretations of the evidence some six years after the payoff to Ms. Daniels entered the public consciousness and briefly imperiled Mr. Trump's presidency.\nBut in previewing the case for prospective jurors last week, Manhattan prosecutors emphasized neither the payoff that secured Ms. Daniels's silence, nor the sex scandal that was buried in the process. One prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, instead distilled the trial's stakes to a fundamental question: 'This case is about the rule of law and whether or not Donald Trump broke it.'\nMr. Steinglass's boss, Mr. Bragg, has offered a loftier interpretation, casting Mr. Trump's actions as election interference. Although Mr. Trump's lawyers might claim he was merely trying to hide embarrassing stories from his family, Mr. Bragg says Mr. Trump orchestrated a scheme to conceal simmering sex scandals from voters as they headed to the polls in 2016. All told, his allies struck three hush-money deals, paying off people who had stories to tell — stories that could have derailed Mr. Trump's candidacy.\nthree hush-money deals, paying off people who had stories to tell — stories that could have derailed Mr. Trump's candidacy.

Aides and friends who lied on Mr. Trump's behalf will take the witness stand to testify against him.\nThey include: David Pecker, the tabloid publisher who bought and buried damaging stories about Mr. Trump; Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman who tried to spin reporters; and Mr. Cohen, the fixer who paid Ms. Daniels. Mr. Pecker, who ran the company that owned The National Enquirer, is set to go first, and is expected to recount for the jury several conversations with Mr. Trump about the hush money, according to a person familiar with the plan.\nStormy Daniels was paid $130,000 to bury her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump.

If convicted, he might lose the right to vote, including to cast a ballot for himself. If he were to win back the White House, he would be the first convicted criminal to serve as commander in chief. And the question of how he might serve a prison sentence, should it come to that if he does not receive probation, could throw the country into turmoil.\nAmerica has grown accustomed to seeing Mr. Trump smash through its customs and is now witnessing a phenomenon that is a first in the 248 years of its history. Presidents have been impeached, driven from office and rejected at the polls. Mr. Trump is about to be the first to have his fate decided not just by voters, but by 12 citizens in a jury box.\nAnd they all hail from Manhattan, the borough that made Mr. Trump famous, and where he is now deeply unpopular. A favorable jury pool, legal experts say, has given Mr. Bragg a leg up at the trial.\nYet the jury, which was made final on Friday and includes six alternates, is no rubber stamp: It includes at least two people who have expressed some affection for the former president, and it takes only one skeptical member to force a mistrial, an outcome that Mr. Trump would celebrate as a win.\nThe stakes are high for Mr. Bragg as well. He is betting his career and his legacy on a prosecution he inherited, rejected and then transformed.\nWhen he took office in 2022, he declined to bring a financial fraud case against Mr. Trump that his predecessor had prepared, prompting an uproar when two prosecutors resigned in protest.\nBut Mr. Bragg continued to investigate and soon revisited the hush-money deal — an episode that had become known internally as 'the zombie case,' because it kept coming back to life. Little more than a year after taking office, Mr. Bragg indicted the former president.\nThree other indictments followed in three other cities, but with those cases mired in delay, Mr. Bragg's trial may now be the only one that Mr. Trump will face before Election Day.\nThe Manhattan case comprises the three hush-money deals: with Ms. Daniels, with a former Playboy model and with a onetime doorman who told a tale of Mr. Trump fathering a child out of wedlock.\nMr. Pecker and his tabloid bought the silence of the doorman, whose story turned out to be false. They also bought the rights to the story told by the model, Karen McDougal, and then never wrote it, a practice known as 'catch and kill.'\nDavid Pecker, the chief executive of American Media, had a cooperative relationship with Mr. Trump for years. Credit... Marion Curtis/Associated Press Then there was Ms. Daniels, who was interested in selling her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Mr. Pecker drew the line there: Her price was too high.\nInstead, he and a top editor alerted Mr. Cohen, who soon paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 not to tell her story about a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump a decade earlier.\nMr. Cohen has said he acted at Mr. Trump's direction, but the former president is not charged over the payment itself. Instead, he stands accused of covering up the transaction by disguising reimbursements to Mr. Cohen.\nIn internal records, Mr. Trump's company marked those payments as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet no such expenses existed, prosecutors say, and the retainer agreement was fictional.\nMr. Trump is accused of engineering — or, at least, approving — the coverup. His company, prosecutors argue, produced 34 false records that underpin the counts against him: 11 checks, 11 monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted and 12 entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust.\nMr. Trump signed several of the checks in the White House, as prosecutors will surely point out at the trial.\nBut directly linking Mr. Trump to the plot to falsify those records is another matter altogether.\nHis lawyers will be likely to argue that he was oblivious, and that Mr. Cohen handled the specifics. Mr. Cohen hashed out the reimbursement plan with Mr. Trump's chief financial officer, Allen H. Weisselberg, who is serving jail time for perjury and will not testify, records show.\nThe lack of a firsthand witness to confirm Mr. Cohen's account is a potential flaw in the case, but it may not be fatal. Prosecutors plan to introduce a document containing Mr. Weisselberg's handwritten notes about the reimbursements — a key piece of evidence demonstrating that Mr. Cohen did not act alone.\nAnd under the law, the prosecutors need not prove that Mr. Trump personally falsified the records. Already during the trial's first week, Mr. Steinglass laid the groundwork with a simple analogy: He asked prospective jurors whether they could accept that, if a husband hired a hit man to murder his wife, the husband was just as guilty as the man who pulled the trigger.\n'Can you all follow the same kind of logic in this case?' Mr. Steinglass asked the prospective jurors. Many said they could.\nMr. Cohen is expected to offer the closest thing this case has to a smoking gun: He is likely to say that, in early 2017, he and Mr. Trump discussed the repayment scheme in the Oval Office.\nIf Mr. Trump testifies in his own defense, that could pit Mr. Cohen's word against Mr. Trump's — a he-said, he-said story, with two questionable narrators.\nWhether or not Mr. Trump takes the stand, the trial could become a referendum on Mr. Cohen's credibility, with the verdict possibly hinging on a convincing performance.\nIn 2018, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to a variety of federal crimes, admitting to participating in the hush-money deals with Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal and lying to Congress about plans for a Trump business deal in Russia. Mr. Trump's lawyers will seek to emphasize Mr. Cohen's checkered past at every turn.\nAnd, on cross-examination, Mr. Trump's lawyers are likely to portray Mr. Cohen as a serial liar with a grudge against his former boss.\nMichael D. Cohen, a former fixer to Mr. Trump and a conduit for the hush money, will be a crucial witness. Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times Susan Necheles, one of Mr. Trump's lawyers, began that campaign during jury selection. She referenced Mr. Cohen's 2022 book 'Revenge,' questioning the credibility of 'someone who says that they want revenge against President Trump.'\nYet the prosecution is expected to note that Mr. Cohen told many of his lies for Mr. Trump. And prosecutors will offer evidence corroborating the broad strokes of Mr. Cohen's story, which could persuade jurors when they are weighing his testimony about the crucial Oval Office meeting.\nMr. Trump's White House executive assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, who has been identified as a potential witness, could confirm that Mr. Cohen did indeed meet with Mr. Trump, even if she cannot confirm what they discussed. Mr. Pecker can support at least some of Mr. Cohen's testimony about Mr. Trump's involvement in the hush-money deals. And a recording Mr. Cohen made of a call he had with Mr. Trump will capture the former president discussing the deal with Ms. McDougal.\n'The prosecution's argument is that you can trust Michael Cohen beyond a reasonable doubt as to their isolated conversation,' said Mr. Horwitz, the former prosecutor. He called the approach 'Prosecuting 101.'\nWilliam K.
