            "excerpt": "The world's second-largest economy has set a 2024 growth target of around 5%.",
            "summary": "China's economy in the first quarter grew faster than expected, official data released Tuesday by China's National Bureau of Statistics showed.\nGross domestic product in the January to March period grew 5.3% compared to a year ago — faster than the 5.2% expansion in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 4.6% growth expected by economists polled by Reuters.\nOn a quarter-on-quarter basis, China's GDP grew 1.6% in the first quarter, compared to Reuters poll expectations of 1.4% and a revised fourth-quarter expansion of 1.2%. Beijing has set a 2024 growth target of around 5%.\nGrowth was driven in part by external demand, as export volume grew by 14% year on year, said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.\nThe strong first-quarter growth will make the government comfortable with its current policy stance, he said in a note on Tuesday.\n'With the Fed rate cut probability declining, I think the chance of rate cut by [People's Bank of China] is also diminishing,' he added.\nHe noted that the PBOC on Tuesday set the fixing rate for the Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar at 7.1028, weaker than the 7.0979 on Monday, which indicates the government may be willing to tolerate more flexibility in the exchange rate. A weak currency makes a country's exports less expensive and more desirable.\nFollowing the data release, the offshore yuan strengthened slightly, before retreating from its five-month high seen early Tuesday to trade at 7.2724 against the greenback.\nIndustrial output for March grew 4.5% year on year, missing expectations of 6%. Retail sales grew 3.1% year on year, lower than expectations of 4.6%.\nThe weaker-than-expected growth of industrial output in March is associated with the sluggish utilization rate of industrial capacity, while the slowing down of retail sales was 'unsurprising,' said Bruce Pang, chief economist and head of research for Greater China at investment management and real estate firm JLL.\n'We expect the policy push of equipment investment, as well as product renewal and replacement could continue to provide a temporary boost to domestic demand and keep the annual GDP target of around 5% achievable,' he highlighted.\nUnemployment in major cities inched down to 5.2%, snapping a three-month streak of increases.\nLast week, Morgan Stanley raised its 2024 real GDP forecast for China to 4.8%, from its previous expectation of 4.2%.\nThe world's second-largest economy saw weak export and inflation data earlier this month, with both sets of data coming in below expectations.\nReal estate remains weak China's embattled real estate sector continued to show weakness, with property investments falling 9.5% year on year in the first quarter.\nFloor space of new commercial buildings sold was 226.68 million square meters, plunging 19.4% year on year. During the first three months of the year, former property giant Evergrande was ordered to liquidate and Country Garden Holdings faced a liquidation petition.\nChina Vanke most recently said in a meeting with analysts that it faces 'operational difficulties' and 'short-term liquidity pressures.'\nThe Hang Seng Mainland Property Index has plunged 19% year-to-date, and almost 50% in the last 12 months.\nThe data showed that while the expansion in China's economy was faster than forecast, it is at an 'unbalanced' pace, Pang said.\n'Optimism will likely be tempered by muted domestic demand, which will serve as the major weak point,' he added.",

            "excerpt": "Almost a billion voters will decide whether to elect Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third term, in an election that takes place over six weeks starting Friday.",
            "summary": "Indians head to the polls on Friday in what will be the world's largest democratic election, as close to one billion voters pick their next government and decide whether to hand Prime Minister Narendra Modi a third term in office.\nThe 2024 general elections will pan out in seven phases over the next six weeks, starting April 19.\nVoters will decide who fills the seats of the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India's parliament, for the next five years. The Lok Sabha is the more powerful of the two houses of Parliament.\nWhichever party or coalition wins the majority will lead the government and pick the next prime minister. Analysts widely expect Modi's Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party to score another landslide victory in the upcoming elections.\nHere's why India's elections matter.\nIndia's meteoric rise Under Modi's rule, India's economy has scaled to new heights. It is now the world's fifth-largest economy with a GDP of $3.7 trillion and has set its sights on becoming the world's third-largest economy by 2027.\nHome to 1.4 billion people, the world's most populous country is the fastest-growing economy in the world. Its economy grew 7.2% in fiscal 2022-2023, the second-highest among the G20 countries.\nThe International Monetary Fund projects that India's economy will grow 6.8% in 2024 and 6.5% in 2025, compared with China's predicted growth of 4.6% in 2024 and 4.1% in 2025.\nThat's not all.\nIndia's stock market overtook Hong Kong's in December to become the fourth largest in the world, and is now valued at over $4 trillion.\nAnalysts expect Modi to win a third consecutive five-year term, further driving India's growth trajectory.\n'The growth story is not done. But private and foreign investments have been very subdued and exports have also declined,' Suyash Rai, deputy director and fellow at Carnegie India, told CNBC. 'So I feel that there is some weakness building up.'\nIndia has forged deeper ties with the West in the past year, and Modi's reelection could further strengthen U.S.-India relations, said Chietigj Bajpaee, senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House.\nHe said India is seen as a 'bulwark against China' as the Biden administration continues to encourage U.S. companies to move electronics and technology manufacturing operations out of China into friendlier countries, like India.\n'If there are two countries where there's the highest degree of consensus, it's China as a long-term strategic rival and India as a long-term strategic partner. That won't change,' Bajpaee said.\nKey contenders There will be 543 contested seats in the lower house, and the party or coalition that wins at least 272 votes will form the government.\nThe two main contenders are the BJP-led coalition known as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and the opposition bloc known as the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA).\nThe opposition coalition was formed last year when more than 40 opposition parties joined forces. It is led by the Indian National Congress, whose leading figure is Rahul Gandhi — the son of Rajiv Gandhi, a grandson of Indira Gandhi, and a great-grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru, who all served as prime ministers of India.\nThe Congress party, which ruled the country for most of its post-Independence era, suffered stinging defeats in the elections in 2014 and 2019.\nIn 2019, the BJP secured a total of 303 seats. Together with the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, 352 seats were clinched. The opposition Indian National Congress won 52 seats that year.\nThis time, the BJP's coalition bloc is widely expected to once again trump the opposition parties and win a historic third term thanks to the political stability in the last decade, analysts said.\n'Policy consistency and political stability are connected to each other deeply. So the expectation will be that the government that comes in will be able to maintain that,' said Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies, National University of Singapore.\n'This will be a significant year for India, and I have a feeling that whoever be the government in India, the foreign policy direction and the economic policy direction are going to remain broadly unchanged,' he told CNBC.\nModi reportedly said in March that he was confident the BJP and NDA would secure a total of 400 seats.\nChatham's Bajpaee said it's a 'foregone conclusion' that Modi's BJP will take the reins again this year, but 'what's unclear is the scale of the victory.'\n'You don't need the BJP to lose for the opposition to win. All they need to do is prove the Modi brand has weakened if they don't perform as well as last time,' he highlighted.\nVoters' concerns According to a survey conducted by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, unemployment was the top concern for 27% of the 10,000 surveyed.\nMore than half (62%) of those surveyed also said it had become more difficult to find a job in the last five years during Modi's second term.\n'You still have a large proportion of the population which is impoverished, so there are large disparities across the country,' Bajpaee said.\nRising costs is the second-biggest concern, with 23% of voters surveyed saying it was their primary concern. About 35% of respondents said their quality of life had declined in the last five years.\nAbout 13% said their biggest worry was the country's development, while 8% said corruption was their top concern.\nElection in numbers This will be India's biggest election yet, with some 968 million people registered to vote — 48% of them women, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. There will also be 18 million first-time voters, Reuters reported.\nGiven the sheer number of voters, the seven-phase election will last 44 days, from April 19 to June 1, across 554 constituencies, according to the Election Commission of India.\nThe six-week election is expected to cost more than the 2020 U.S. presidential election where $14.4 billion was spent, according to Washington-based research firm OpenSecrets.\nData from the company showed that India spent $8.6 billion on the 2019 general elections, $2.1 billion more than the 2016 U.S. presidential race.\nResults will be released on June 4.\nElectoral rules state that since there must be a polling station within two kilometers of every registered voter, there will be about a million polling stations, 5.5 million electronic voting machines, and 15 million staff and security personnel overseeing the election, data from the election commission showed.\nCharmaine Jacob, CNBC Joanna Tan, CNBC contributed.",

            "summary": "PITTSBURGH — President Joe Biden will call for tripling tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum Wednesday when he speaks to union members in battleground Pennsylvania.\nBiden, who is set to speak at the headquarters of the United Steel Workers, is in the middle of a three-day swing through the state focusing on economic issues, while his opponent, former President Donald Trump, faces jury selection in New York in his trial on charges he falsified business records to cover up an alleged affair with an adult film star.\nThe Biden administration says China is overproducing goods to export to the U.S., driving down prices and hurting the American economy because higher-quality U.S. products must compete with artificially low-priced alternatives.\nThe current average tariff on steel and aluminum from China is 7.5%, and Biden is calling on the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative — the federal agency charged with developing U.S. trade policy — to triple the tariff rate.\nBiden is also directing his administration to work with Mexico to prevent China's evasion of tariffs on steel and aluminum that's imported from Mexico into the U.S. The trade representative's office is also launching an investigation into China's trade practices in the shipbuilding, maritime and logistics sectors.\nStill, critics argue increased tariffs would backfire and raise consumer prices and inflation. China has denied the overcapacity accusation as 'groundless,' and it accuses the U.S. of trying to prevent global competition.\n'If taken, these actions will not increase inflation,' a senior administration official said. 'But they will protect American jobs and the steel industry.'\nBiden has been ramping up his economic rhetoric against China. So has Trump, who has said he'd consider a 60% tariff on all Chinese imports.\nDuring his administration, Trump imposed new tariffs on imports of washing machines, solar panels, steel, aluminum and billions of dollars' worth of goods from China. The new levies amounted to a tax increase of $80 billion a year, according to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit tax policy group. Biden has kept most of Trump's China tariffs.\nThe push comes amid the White House's controversial opposition to a buyout of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel. Shareholders just approved the potential deal, but it faces stiff backlash from union members and Biden, who has redoubled his efforts to ally himself with unions after he joined a picket line with the United Auto Workers last year and won the endorsement of the United Steel Workers.\nWith polls showing Biden trailing Trump significantly when it comes to voters' perception of who would better handle the economy, the White House is touting that nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs have been created during the Biden administration and that construction employment is at a record high.\nSome see the crackdown on China as an acknowledgment that the Biden administration needs to do more to show it's taking the reins of an unpopular economy.\n'It has nothing to do with elections,' a senior administration official said. 'I think it has to do with the fact that we're actually acting from a place of self-confidence and strength because our economy is growing and manufacturing is rebounding.'\nBut John Basalyga, a developer in Scranton who adamantly backs Trump, blames the Biden administration for the rising costs of doing business.\nBiden 'says his policies are helping middle America,' he said. 'Just walk around and ask the real people of this country and they'll tell you the exact opposite.'\nThe White House hopes the push for higher tariffs on China will resonate with blue-collar voters in Biden's native Pennsylvania. Joe Padavan, a retired steelworker from Wilkes-Barre, said Biden has stood up for union members and stood up to China — and he doesn't blame him for high inflation or rising prices.\n'The problem today is corporate greed more than anything,' Padavan said. 'So hopefully by putting on some tariffs, it's going to bring some of our people here. Why pay the tariffs when you could build it here?'\nGabe Gutierrez Bianca Seward",

            "excerpt": "NBC News' latest national poll shows Biden's numbers inching up as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., inflation and abortion all scramble the 2024 contest.",
            "summary": "The share of voters who say they have high interest in the 2024 election has hit a nearly 20-year low at this point in a presidential race, according to the latest national NBC News poll, with majorities holding negative views of both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\nThe poll also shows Biden trimming Trump's previous lead to just 2 points in a head-to-head contest, an improvement within the margin of error compared to the previous survey, as the president bests Trump on the issues of abortion and uniting the country, while the former Republican president is ahead on competency and dealing with inflation.\nAnd it finds inflation and immigration topping the list of most important issues facing the country, as just one-third of voters give Biden credit for an improving economy.\nBut what also stands out in the survey is how the low voter interest and the independent candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. potentially scramble what's been a stable presidential contest with more than six months until Election Day. While Trump holds a 2-point edge over Biden in head to head , Biden leads Trump by 2 points in a five-way ballot test including Kennedy and other third-party candidates.\n'I don't think Biden has done much as a president. And if Trump gets elected, I just feel like it's going to be the same thing as it was before Biden got elected,' said poll respondent Devin Fletcher, 37, of Wayne, Michigan, a Democrat who said he's still voting for Biden.\n'I just don't feel like I have a candidate that I'm excited to vote for,' Fletcher added.\nAnother poll respondent from New Jersey, who declined to provide her name and voted for Biden in 2020, said she wouldn't be voting in November.\n'Our candidates are horrible. I have no interest in voting for Biden. He did nothing. And I absolutely will not vote for Trump,' this voter said.\nDemocratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies, said that 'Americans don't agree on much these days, but nothing unites the country more than voters' desire to tune this election out.'\nThe poll was conducted April 12-16, and it comes during yet another turbulent time in American politics, including the beginning of Trump's criminal trial in New York, as well as new attacks and heightened tensions in the Middle East.\nAccording to the poll, 64% of registered voters say they have a high level of interest in November's election — registering either a '9' or a 10' on a 10-point scale of interest.\nThat's lower than what the NBC News poll showed at this same point time in the 2008 (74%), 2012 (67%), 2016 (69%) and 2020 (77%) presidential contests.\nThe question dates back to the 2008 election cycle. The lowest-ever level of high election interest in the poll during a presidential cycle was in March 2012 — at 59%. But it quickly ticked up in the next survey.\nThis election cycle, high interest has been both low and relatively flat for months, according to the poll.\nMcInturff, the Republican pollster, says the high level of interest in the poll has 'always been a signal for the level of turnout' for a presidential contest.\n'It makes it very hard for us to predict turnout this far in advance of November, but every signal is turnout will be a lower percentage of eligible voters than in 2020,' he said.\nBy party, the current poll shows 70% of self-identified Republicans saying they have high interest in the upcoming election, versus 65% of Democrats who say this.\nIndependents are at 48%, while only 36% of voters ages 18 to 34 rate themselves as highly interested in the election.\n'They just aren't low interest,' McInturff said of young voters. 'They are off-the-charts low.'\nBiden trims Trump's lead The poll also finds Trump narrowly ahead of Biden by 2 points among registered voters in a head-to-head matchup, 46% to 44% — down from Trump's 5-point advantage in January, 47% to 42%.\nThat movement, within the poll's margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, is consistent with what other national polls have showed in the Trump-Biden race.\nTrump's biggest advantages are among men (53% to 37%), white voters (54% to 37%) and white voters without college degrees (65% to 25%).\nBiden's top advantages are among Black voters (71% to 13%), women (50% to 39%) and Latinos (49% to 39%).\nThe poll shows the two candidates are essentially tied among independents (Biden 36%, Trump 34%) and voters ages 18-34 (Biden 44%, Trump 43%). One of the big polling mysteries this cycle is whether young voters have defected from Biden (as the NBC News poll has shown over multiple surveys), or whether Democrats have maintained their advantage among this demographic.\nWhen the ballot is expanded to five named candidates, Biden takes a 2-point lead over Trump: Biden 39%, Trump 37%, independent Robert F. Kennedy 13%, Jill Stein 3% and Cornel West 2%.\nAgain, that result between Biden and Trump is within the poll's margin of error.\nNotably, the poll shows a greater share of Trump voters from the head-to-head matchup supporting Kennedy in the expanded ballot compared with Biden voters, different than the results of some other surveys.\n(Read more here on how Kennedy's candidacy impacts the 2024 race, according to the poll.)\n(Read more here on how Kennedy's candidacy impacts the 2024 race, according to the poll.) The president's approval rating ticks up to 42% Additionally, the poll shows 42% of registered voters approving of Biden's overall job performance — up 5 points since January's NBC News poll, which showed Biden at the lowest point of his presidency.\nFifty-six percent of voters say they disapprove of the job he has done, which is down 4 points from January.\nBiden's gains over the past few months have come from key parts of his 2020 base, especially among Democrats and Black voters. But he continues to hold low ratings among Latinos (40% approval), young voters (37%) and independents (36%).\nbase, especially among Democrats and Black voters. But he continues to hold low ratings among Latinos (40% approval), young voters (37%) and independents (36%). 'The data across this poll show that Joe Biden has begun to gain some ground in rebuilding his coalition from 2020,' said Horwitt, the Democratic pollster. 'The question is whether he can build upon this momentum and make inroads with the groups of voters that still are holding back support.'\nBut McInturff, the GOP pollster, points out that the only recent presidents who lost re-election had approval ratings higher than Biden's at this point in the election cycle: George H.W.

Biden leads on abortion and unity; Trump leads on inflation and competency The NBC News poll asked voters to determine which candidate they thought is better on several different issues and attributes.\nBiden holds a 15-point advantage over Trump on dealing with the issue of abortion, and the president is ahead by 9 points on having the ability to bring the country together — though this is down from Biden's 24-point advantage on this issue in the Sept. 2020 NBC News poll.\nTrump, meanwhile, leads on having the ability to handle a crisis (by 4 points), on having a strong record of accomplishments (by 7 points), on being competent and effective (by 11 points), on having the necessary mental and physical health to be president (by 19 points) and on dealing with inflation and the cost of living (by 22 points).\nInflation, immigration are the top 2024 issues As for inflation and the cost of living, it tops the list of issues in the poll, with 23% of voters saying they're the most important issue facing the country.\nThe other top issue concerning voters is immigration and the situation at the border (22%) — followed by threats to democracy (16%), jobs and the economy (11%), abortion (6%) and health care (6%).\nimmigration and the situation at the border (22%) — followed by threats to democracy (16%), jobs and the economy (11%), abortion (6%) and health care (6%). Additionally, 63% of voters say their family's income is falling behind the cost of living — essentially unchanged from what the poll showed in 2022 and 2023.\nAnd 53% of voters say the country's economy has not improved, versus 33% who say it has improved and Biden deserves some credit for it and another 8% who agree the economy has improved but don't give the president credit for it.\n'If I look back to when I had all three of my children in the house — we only have one child left in the house now, and we're spending more now than what we did when we had a family of five,' said poll respondent Art Fales, 45, of Florida, who says he's likely voting for Trump.\nBut on a separate question — is there an issue so important that you'll vote for or against a candidate solely on that basis? — the top issue responses are protecting democracy and constitutional rights (28%), immigration and border security (20%) and abortion (19%).\nIndeed, 30% of Democrats, 29% of young voters and 27% of women say they are single-issue voters on abortion.\n'I have a right to what I do with my body,' said poll respondent Amanda Willis, 28, from Louisiana, who said she's voting for Biden. 'And I don't believe that other people should have the ability to determine that.'\nOther poll findings With Trump's first criminal trial now underway, 50% of voters say the former president is being held to the same standard as anyone else when it comes to his multiple legal challenges. That compares with 43% who believe he's being unfairly targeted in these trials.\n52% of voters have an unfavorable view of Biden, while 53% share the same view of Trump.\nAnd Democrats and Republicans are essentially tied on congressional preference, with 47% of voters preferring Republicans control Congress and 46% wanting Democrats in charge. Republicans held a 4-point lead on this question in January.

            "summary": "Secretary of State Antony Blinken will warn China about its support for Russia's military during his visit to the country this week, according to a senior State Department official.\nBlinken is expected to convey Washington's 'deep concerns' over China's aid for Russia's defense industrial base, during his three-day visit starting Wednesday.\n'We're prepared to take steps when we believe necessary against firms that ... severely undermine security in both Ukraine and Europe,' the official told reporters ahead of Blinken's trip.\n'And I think we've demonstrated our willingness to do so regarding firms from a number of countries, not just China,' he added. 'At any rate, again, I think this will be a key issue of discussion while we're in Beijing.'\nU.S. allies in Europe are concerned about the implications of Beijing's support for Russia's war in Ukraine and 'what it means for European security in particular, and then, of course, it will be up to China to determine its next steps,' the official noted.\nThis will be Blinken's second trip to China after a high-stakes diplomatic mission to cool U.S.-China tensions in June last year.\nDuring his visit to Beijing and Shanghai, Blinken is expected to meet senior Chinese officials, including Foreign Minister Wang Yi, according to the State Department. It remains unclear whether the secretary of state will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n‘Primary contributor' When it comes to Russia's defense industrial base, China is 'the primary contributor,' Blinken said last week, following the G7 foreign ministers meeting in Italy.\n'We see China sharing machine tools, semiconductors, other dual-use items that have helped Russia rebuild the defense industrial base that sanctions and export controls had done so much to degrade,' he said.\n'Now, if China purports on the one hand to want good relations with Europe and other countries, it can't on the other hand be fueling what is the biggest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War.'\nChinese firms are playing an increasingly key role in propping up Russia's struggling economy and boosting its military capabilities, including via the trade of goods for use on the battlefield in Ukraine, according to a CNBC analysis.\nData from last year seemed to suggest Beijing was providing militarily useful equipment such as drones, helmets, vests and radios, extending a lifeline for President Vladimir Putin's war against Ukraine.\nBlinken will also 'discuss a range of bilateral, regional, and global issues,' such as the crisis in the Middle East and China's provocations in the South China Sea, the senior official said.\nBeijing claims almost the entire South China Sea as its own and has been in territorial disputes with Southeast Asian countries including the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam, among others. It has previously warned Washington not to interfere in China's territorial and maritime rights.\nOn the trade front, the two countries continue to battle for tech supremacy and just last week, China slammed a U.S. investigation into its maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries, calling the move a 'mistake on top of a mistake.'\nThe senior U.S. official said Washington was 'realistic and clear-eyed about the prospects of breakthroughs on any of these issues.'\n'But we will continue to use diplomacy to communicate our positions and policies, clear up misperceptions, and underscore that we will continue to take actions to protect our national security and economy.'",

It now sits right around 7.5%, the highest level since mid-November of last year.\nRates hit their highest level in a few decades last October, causing home sales to grind to a halt. Builders jumped to buy down rates for their customers and managed to do better than existing home sellers.\nRates then fell through mid-January to the mid-6% range and held there into February, causing a surge in home sales. But then they began rising again.\n'By mid-February, a pick-up in inflation reset expectations, putting mortgage rates back on an upward trend, and more recent data and comments from Fed Chair [Jerome] Powell have only underscored inflation concerns,' said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com. 'Sales data over the next few months is likely to reflect the impact of now-higher mortgage rates.'\nEven with rates higher, however, mortgage applications to purchase a home rose 5% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. Demand was still 10% lower than the same week one year ago, even with rates now 70 basis points higher than they were a year ago.\n'Despite these higher rates, application activity picked up, possibly as some borrowers decided to act in case rates continue to rise,' said Joel Kan, MBA's chief economist.\nThat may be short-lived, however, as affordability weakens even further. While there is more supply on the market now than there was a year ago, it is still at a very low level historically. That has caused homes to move faster as the competition increases. Anyone waiting for rates to drop significantly may be waiting for a while.\n'Recent economic data shows that the economy and job market remain strong, which is likely to keep mortgage rates at these elevated levels for the near future,' said Bob Broeksmit, MBA's president and CEO.\nDiana Olick, CNBC",

This is what matters.'\nIran launched hundreds of drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles that sought to overwhelm Israel's air defenses in the April 13 attack — the first on Israel by a foreign power since Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein launched Scud missiles at Israel in the 1991 Gulf War.\nHowever, Israeli air defenses and fighter jets, backed by the U.S., the United Kingdom and neighboring Jordan, shot down the vast majority of the incoming fire.\nSatellite images analyzed Saturday by The Associated Press showed the Iranian attack caused only minor damage at the Nevatim air base in southern Israel, including taking a chunk out of a taxiway that Israel quickly repaired.\nIran's attack came in response to a suspected Israeli strike on April 1 targeting a consular building next to the Iranian Embassy in Damascus, Syria, which killed two Guard generals and others.\n'Today, thanks to the work done by our armed forces, the Revolutionary Guard, the army, the police, each in its own way, praise be to Allah the image of the country around the world has become commendable,' added Khamenei, despite Iran facing public anger over its economy and crackdowns on dissent.\nThe Associated Press",

            "excerpt": "Powell added that until inflation shows more progress, 'We can maintain the current level of restriction for as long as needed.'",
            "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the U.S. economy, while otherwise strong, has not seen inflation come back to the central bank's goal, pointing to the further unlikelihood that interest rate cuts are in the offing anytime soon.\nSpeaking to a policy forum focused on U.S.-Canada economic relations, Powell said that while inflation continues to make its way lower, it hasn't moved quickly enough, and the current state of policy should remain intact.\n'More recent data shows solid growth and continued strength in the labor market, but also a lack of further progress so far this year on returning to our 2% inflation goal,' the Fed chief said during a panel talk.\nEchoing recent statements by central bank officials, Powell indicated the current level of policy likely will stay in place until inflation gets closer to target.\nSince July 2023, the Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate in a target range between 5.25%-5.5%, the highest in 23 years. That was the result of 11 consecutive rate hikes that began in March 2022.\n'The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence, and instead indicate that it's likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence,' he said. 'That said, we think policy is well positioned to handle the risks that we face.'\nPowell added that until inflation shows more progress, 'We can maintain the current level of restriction for as long as needed.'\nThe comments follow inflation data through the first three months of 2024 that has been higher than expected. A consumer price index reading for March, released last week, showed inflation running at a 3.5% annual rate — well off the peak around 9% in mid-2022 but drifting higher since October 2023.\nTreasury yields rose as Powell spoke. The benchmark 2-year note, which is especially sensitive to Fed rate moves, briefly topped 5%, while the benchmark 10-year yield rose 3 basis points. The S&P 500 wavered after Powell's remarks, briefly turning negative on the day before recovering.\nPowell noted the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, showed core inflation at 2.8% in February and has been little changed over the past few months.\n'We've said at the [Federal Open Market Committee] that we'll need greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards 2% before [it will be] appropriate to ease policy,' he said. 'The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it's likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence.'\nFinancial markets have had to reset their expectations for rate cuts this year. At the start of 2024, traders in the fed funds futures market were pricing in six or seven cuts this year, starting in March. As the data has progressed, the expectations have shifted to one or two reductions, assuming quarter percentage point moves, and not starting until September.\nIn their most recent update, FOMC officials in March indicated they see three cuts this year. However, several policymakers in recent days have stressed the data-dependent nature of policy and have not committed to set level of reductions.\nJeff Cox, CNBC",

            "summary": "The health of corals is intertwined with ocean temperatures because the invertebrates are extremely sensitive to heat stress. When corals are stressed, they turn white as they release symbiotic algae that live in their tissues. Bleaching is a signal that corals' health is endangered.\n'When a coral bleaches, it doesn't mean it's dead. It means it's weak and at risk of dying if conditions don't get better,' said Ana Palacio, an assistant scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies, a research institute that is based at the University of Miami in partnership with NOAA.\nCorals are critical ecosystems that support a vast array of fish and aquatic species, which help feed coastal communities and attract tourists. The economic value of reefs is estimated at $2.7 trillion per year, according to a 2020 report from the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network.\n'They protect our coastline. They offer protection from storms and hurricanes. They have a great value for our economy and safety,' Palacio said.\nCoral ecosystems are among the ecosystems scientists think are most at risk because of global warming. In 2018, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that 70% to 90% of the world's coral reefs would disappear if global average temperatures crossed a threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average.\nLast year was Earth's hottest on record. Average global temperatures approached that threshold for the first time, though scientists believe the temperatures were boosted by El Niño and that 2023 was an anomaly.\nIn Florida, as sea surface temperatures spiked, bleaching started early in the season, experts said.\n'Normally, bleaching will be observed in the Northern Hemisphere around August and September. We started to observe bleaching in July last year,' said Phanor Montoya-Maya, a marine biologist with the Coral Restoration Foundation, an organization that collects, restores and repopulates corals.\nPalacio said the region saw widespread mortality of elkhorn and staghorn corals, two species that have been the focus of restoration efforts.\n'In some locations, about 20% of those populations survived,' Palacio said of restored corals. 'We're concentrating our hope on why those corals survived and what they can tell us about resistance and how corals can be more resilient.'\nThe last global coral bleaching event happened in 2014 and lasted until 2017. More than 56% of global reef areas saw temperatures that could cause bleaching during that time period.\nBleached coral at the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, off the coast of Galveston, Texas, in the Gulf of Mexico, on Sept. 16, 2023. LM Otero / AP In an email on Monday, Manzello said that 54% of the world's coral reef areas had experienced bleaching-level heat stress in the past year and that the event was poised to become the worst bleaching event in history.\n'The percentage of reef areas experiencing bleaching-level heat stress has been increasing by roughly 1% per week,' Manzello said. 'It is likely that this event will surpass the previous peak.'\nMontoya-Maya said a bleaching alert is already in effect in Florida, even earlier than last year. He said the Coral Restoration Foundation was preparing for a busy summer responding to another bleaching event.\nThe natural pattern of El Niño has begun to dissipate and NOAA's Climate Prediction Center estimates there is a 60% chance La Niña develops this summer, which could help cool Atlantic waters and allow some corals to recover, at least temporarily.\n'This is quite heartbreaking and it's going to cause damage to a lot of reefs in the world,' Palacio said. 'I'm hoping this bleaching event is going to create some traction and people will start caring more and paying attention to what's happening with the climate.'\nEvan Bush",

How desert plants, animals and local economies adapt to the changes in an environment that's already one of the most extreme on Earth will determine the future of this symbol of resilience.\n'It's interesting to have a front row seat,' Donnelly said. 'This is the signature of climate chaos.'\nA 1-in-1,000-year storm — twice Susan Sorrells, who owns the ecotourism town of Shoshone, which is near Death Valley National Park, said the area's weather is 'always a roller coaster ride.'\nBut that has been especially true over the last couple of years. In early 2022, Death Valley, like the rest of the American Southwest, remained mired in the driest period since the year 800. During the 22-year drought, soil moisture reached an all-time low. Plants were withering, including the creosote bush, which is known to live for thousands of years, thanks to deep roots that search for water and can survive on very little.\nIts dieback during drought, then, was evidence of the weather's severity.\n'Desert shrubs are really tough and slow to die,' said Lynn Sweet, a research ecologist at the University of California Riverside. 'But at some point, there is mortality.'\nThen, in August of that year, a deluge arrived.\nIn several hours, Death Valley National Park received a record 1.7 inches of rain — about three-quarters of its typical annual total. The 1-in-1,000 year storm, as weather forecasters would later call it, washed out park roads, moved boulders and trapped cars in debris.\nAbout a year later, remnants of Hurricane Hilary, a rare Pacific hurricane, dumped 2.2 inches of rain on the park — exceeding its typical annual rainfall in one day and setting a new 24-hour record.\n'To have the worst drought in recorded history and the most precipitation in history, it's clearly climate whiplash,' Donnelly said.\nRoad crews along Highway 190, where most of the road was washed out by Tropical Storm Hilary the week before, in Death Valley on Aug. 31, 2023. Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images file The rain closed the park, as well as Highway 127, which connects it to gateway communities but had become 'a raging river,' Sorrells said.\nShe operates an ecotourism business with a 20-bed inn, hiking trails, a trading post, an RV park and the Crowbar Cafe and Saloon. For Sorrells, the situation was dire, as the highway's reconstruction was slated to last through the winter and into spring, making the area nearly impossible to access throughout its busy season.\n'We have a local joke: We make all our money from October through the end of April, and then we lose it from May through September,' she said.\nThe community rallied together and pushed state leaders to speed up the project, Sorrells said. The park partially reopened in October, and the highway in January.\nThen things took a fascinating turn.\nSpring wildflowers, which germinated in the fall, survived a warm winter, when freezing temperatures would typically knock them back down, according to Donnelly. And in February, a multiday atmospheric river storm system brought another deluge.\nThe wildflowers 'lasted long enough for the atmospheric river to recharge them with all this rain,' Donnelly said. 'Now, they're growing in a very unusual way. They're much taller than normal, much thicker-stemmed, very robust wildflowers.'\nThere was also enough water to revive Lake Manly, an ancient lakebed usually filled with dust.\nFor the first time, the National Park Service announced in February that it would allow kayakers to paddle on the lake, which was as deep as 3 feet, according to NASA.",

Its defenses against disruptive floods were severely tested in June 2022 when Guangdong was pounded by the heaviest downpours in six decades. Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated.\nSince Thursday, Guangdong has been battered by unusually heavy, sustained, and widespread rainfall, with powerful storms ushering in an earlier-than-normal start to the province's annual flooding season in May and June.\nIn Qingyuan, a relatively small city of 4 million, some residents counted their losses from the flooding. Others worried about more serious disasters in the future.\n'My rice fields are fully flooded, my fields are gone,' Huang Jingrong, 61, told Reuters.\nHuang was taking shelter under an overpass with a few other farmers from his village, alongside an assortment of personal belongings they managed to save, including a washing machine.\n'I won't be making any money this year, I will be making losses,' he told Reuters, estimating his losses at about 100,000 yuan ($13,806).\n'What can we do?

AFP - Getty Images Over the weekend, a number of waterways in Guangdong overflowed including the river near Huang's village, where floodwaters have reached the second story of houses after washing out paddy and potato fields.\nIn other parts of Qingyuan, rescuers tackled neck-high waters to extract residents including an elderly lady trapped in waist-deep water in an apartment building.\nOthers with nowhere to go remained on the upper floors of their houses, waiting for the waters to recede as friends delivered food by boat.\nBefore 2022, it rarely rained as heavily as it does now, and the floodwaters were never as high, said another Qingyuan resident, Lin Xiuzheng, who worked in online retail sales.\nWeather events in China have become more intense and unpredictable because of global warming, scientists say, with record-breaking rainfall and drought assailing the world's second-largest economy, often at the same time.\nPrecipitation records for April have already been broken in many parts of Guangdong, with the cities of Shaoguan, Zhaoqing and Jiangmen to the west and north of Guangzhou also half-submerged in flood-waters.\nSwollen Rivers No fatalities were reported, although 11 people in the province were still missing by Monday morning, state-owned Xinhua News Agency reported without giving further details.\nAcross the province, 36 houses collapsed while 48 were severely damaged, resulting in a direct economic loss of nearly 140.6 million yuan, Xinhua reported.\nTwo companies in the province told Reuters there had been no immediate impact on business or supply chains.\n'Everything's running as usual and everyone got to work,' said a person who answered the phone at Camelot PCB, a print circuit board company that supplies Tesla, and other electric vehicle makers.\nPolyrocks Chemical, a plastics company that supplies technology giants such as Apple, Huawei, and Samsung, also said its operations were not affected.\nBut many rivers remained swollen on Monday at levels above safety thresholds, with rainfall in recent days two to three times more than what is normally seen at this time of the year.\nThe intense convective weather in southern China was caused by a stronger-than-normal subtropical high, a semi-permanent high-pressure system circulating north of the equator.\nThe stronger subtropical high led to warmer temperatures that drew in more moisture-laden air from the South China Sea and even the Bay of Bengal, Chinese meteorologists said, resulting in intense precipitation.",

'Somebody has to pay for reconstruction,' said former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, a proponent of using the Russian assets to help Ukraine, in an interview Friday. 'And I think it should be Putin, not the American people.'\nThe REPO Act, which would authorize Biden to confiscate the frozen Russian assets in U.S. banks and transfer them to a special fund for Ukraine, is part of the foreign aid package that has been stalled for months in the House. More than $6 billion of the $300 billion in frozen Russian assets are sitting in U.S. banks. Most of the $300 billion are in Germany, France and Belgium.\nOn Wednesday, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson released the package which would include tens of billions of dollars in aid for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan.\n'I'm going to a allow an opportunity for every single member of the House to vote their conscience and their will on this,' Johnson told reporters, defending his decision to allow the vote to go forward Saturday.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and his government invested heavily in the euro and the dollar over the years to keep the ruble stable, planting some $300 billion worth of foreign currency reserves.\nBut in early 2022, following Putin's invasion of Ukraine, all of the Group of Seven (G7) countries including the U.S., U.K., Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan banded together and froze all of the $300 billion dollars of Russian foreign currency reserves held in banks in those countries, most of the money in Europe.\n'The Russians were surprised when, right after the war started, the Europeans took the exact same measures as the United States, freezing all of the reserves that were there and the Japanese did the same, which is why most of Russia's reserves today are frozen in western banks,' said Chris Miller a professor at the Fletcher School at Tufts University.\nThe idea to confiscate the Russian assets emerged last year and has been hotly contested by economists and foreign policy experts.\nIn a recent op-ed in the New York Times, contributing opinion writer Christopher Caldwell argued that it's a 'terrible idea' to confiscate the Russian funds because other countries might stop investing in the U.S. which could negatively affect the economy in the long run.\n'This could weaken the dollar's status as the main global reserve currency. The dollar is probably the most valuable strategic asset the United States has,' Caldwell argued.\nMcFaul, whose been lobbying for the REPO Act for months, clapped back at Caldwell's assertion and said the use of Russian assets for Ukraine would send an important message to autocratic nations around the world.\n'There are those that say, 'Well, this will hurt the dollar. It's bad for our reputation.' I have a pushback to that. I don't want criminals investing in American Treasury bonds,' McFaul said.\nOne of the diplomatic challenges would be to convince the other G7 countries to do the same. While the U.K. is on board with the idea, France and Germany have been reticent.\n'We're making good progress in how to access that funds on an agreed basis that I think we can take forward to the G7,' U.K. foreign minister David Cameron told reporters April 9.\nAmid the diplomatic maneuverings, one group in the background has been persistently applying pressure on members of Congress, the White House and G7 countries to move forward with the idea of confiscating the funds.\nmembers of Congress, the White House and G7 countries to move forward with the idea of confiscating the funds. The Renew Democracy Initiative, a Washington DC-based nonprofit organization promoting democracy and American interest overseas sent a letter Friday urging Majority Leader Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to work together to get the REPO Act passed.\n'Your leadership through legislative action will increase the likelihood that the administration does what is necessary to confiscate Putin's billions,' wrote RDI Chairman Garry Kasparov and RDI CEO Uriel Epshtein.\nIn an interview Friday, Epshtein said he believes it will take U.S. action to bring about a G7 collaboration to confiscate the funds.\n'Other G7 countries will only act to confiscate Russian assets if the U.S. leads,' said Epshtein.\nAnna Schecter Natasha Lebedeva Matt Bradley",

            "summary": "RALEIGH, N.C. — The future of diversity, equity and inclusion staff jobs in North Carolina's public university system could be at stake after a five-person committee swiftly voted to repeal a key policy Wednesday.\nThe Committee on University Governance, within the University of North Carolina Board of Governors that oversees 17 schools, voted in less than four minutes to reverse and replace a policy related to DEI. The full board of 24 members is to vote on the matter again next month, and if approved, the repeal would take effect immediately.\nIf the policy is fully repealed, the UNC system could join other major universities in dismantling their diversity offices. Among the most notable, the University of Florida in Gainesville announced in a memo last month that it was scrapping its office and shifting its funding for faculty recruitment instead.\nUniversity of North Carolina Chapel Hill in 2023. Eros Hoagland / Getty Images file In Texas, universities saw major cuts in their diversity and inclusion staff in 2024 in compliance with a state ban signed into law last year. The state higher education board in Kansas was also to address a ban on diversity initiatives in hiring staff and accepting students Wednesday.\nAt least 20 states have seen Republican bill proposals seeking to limit diversity and inclusion programs in several public institutions such as universities.\nDiversity, equity and inclusion is defined by the American Psychological Association as a framework to guide 'fair treatment and full participation of all people,' especially those belonging to minority groups. It has become a recurring point of contention for conservatives who argue DEI programs are discriminatory.\nThe proposed policy change, first reported by The News & Observer of Raleigh, would impact a diversity, equity and inclusion regulation adopted in 2019. It defines the roles of various DEI positions — such as a system office diversity and inclusion liaison and diversity officers across the university system — and the establishment of a diversity and inclusion council made up of members representing each university, according to the policy.\nUnder the policy, the officers' responsibilities include assisting the chancellor with diversity policy and programming, in addition to facilitating training for students and staff.\nBut Andrew Tripp, senior vice president for the UNC System Office's legal affairs team, said the change would reaffirm 'the university's commitment to non-discrimination and institutional neutrality.'\nThe policy that could replace the existing regulation does not include the outlined responsibilities of DEI officers and liaisons, suggesting they may be eliminated. Other inclusion efforts such as tracking the university's diversity metrics and giving reports to university boards will continue, the replacement policy said.\nUNC-Chapel Hill — the system's flagship campus and whose website says has an office for diversity and inclusion with a 12-person staff — will review the policy change and work with the university system if implemented, spokesperson Kevin Best said in an emailed statement.\n'As the Board of Governors noted, equality of opportunity in education and employment is a long-standing commitment of the University of North Carolina as a core value in service to our vibrant and growing state,' Best said. 'As part of that mission, UNC-Chapel Hill will continue to welcome people from all walks of life with a variety of experiences and perspectives who come here to learn, work and live.'\nImmediately after the vote to repeal the diversity policy with no questions or discussion, the governance committee went into closed session, according to the agenda. Closed sessions are not subject to public record, according to state statutes.\nEfforts to dissolve university diversity efforts are a 'disservice' to students and create 'controversy and volatility,' former UNC System President Tom Ross said in a joint statement with Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper after the vote. Instead, Ross, who served as president from 2011 to 2016, said universities should celebrate diversity.\n'Republican legislative and university leaders who attack diversity at our public universities are failing in their duty to protect students while threatening our ability to recruit top scientists, researchers and innovators who power our economy,' Cooper said.\nHowever, conservative-leaning advocacy group Carolina Partnership for Reform said in a statement the new policy would 'go a long way toward rooting out DEI bureaucracies.'\nThe full UNC Board of Governors is scheduled to meet May 22-23 in Raleigh. Members of the board are elected to four-year terms by the state Senate and House of Representatives, which Republicans have controlled since 2011.\nRepublican House Speaker Tim Moore said fellow Republicans have expressed interest in taking up anti-DEI legislation in the session opening next Wednesday. He recently told reporters the legislature may allow the university boards to review their diversity policies first before introducing any bills.\n'It's still at the conversation stage,' Moore said.\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Legislation that could ban TikTok in the U.S. unless it cuts ties with its Chinese parent company is on a path to quickly get to President Joe Biden's desk and be signed into law.\nThe bill, which has the backing of Biden and key members of Congress, would allow the administration to ban the popular video-sharing app nationwide if it does not divest from China-based ByteDance within one year.\nA similar bill already passed the House in a lopsided, bipartisan 352-65 vote in March. But it's been stalled in the Democratic-controlled Senate, where Commerce Chairwoman Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., had been looking to put her mark on the bill.\nNow, the House is planning to package a slightly revised TikTok bill with billions in foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, all but guaranteeing the potential TikTok ban will become law.\nUnder the strategy used by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., the House plans to pass the combined foreign aid and TikTok package Saturday night and send it to the Senate, setting up a possible vote in the upper chamber as early as next week.\nIn recent weeks, Johnson's team worked closely with the White House on the package and Biden has already said he will swiftly sign into law the broader package, which also includes other GOP national security priorities like the REPO Act and sanctions against Iran. Biden backed the original TikTok ban legislation in the House as well, though his campaign has an account on the app.\nThe fast-track process for the TikTok bill comes as leaders in both parties, as well as national security officials, warn that the popular video-sharing app is a national security threat. There are worries that the Chinese Communist Party is using TikTok to access data and spy on its American users, spread disinformation and use the app's algorithms to manipulate elections, like the one in November.\nTikTok has argued that the bill amounts to a ban that would violate the First Amendment rights of its millions of U.S. users and harm small businesses that reach customers through the app.\n'It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,' TikTok said in a statement.\nDubbed the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the House TikTok bill creates a process for the president — through the FBI and intelligence agencies — to designate certain social media applications under the control of foreign adversaries, like China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, as national security threats.\nOnce an app is deemed a risk, it would be banned from online app stores and web-hosting services unless it severed ties with entities under control of the foreign adversary. The legislation specifically cites TikTok as a target.\nThe revised TikTok language would lengthen that divestiture period to nine months, up from the original six months, and would also allow the president to grant an additional, one-time 90-day extension.\nThat change satisfied Cantwell, the Senate Commerce chair, who had slow-walked consideration of the House-passed bill. She said the change was her recommendation.\n\"It assures that divestiture will more likely happen, so we think that's an important part,\" Cantwell told reporters Thursday, adding that other tweaks would have to be put off until later.\n\"They didn't put other language and so we could look at things down the road, but for now we support what they're doing,\" she added.\nWhile there is overwhelming bipartisan backing for the TikTok bill in both chambers, a handful of lawmakers have argued that the legislation would stifle free speech. Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., introduced an amendment that would strip the TikTok language out of the package.\n\"Banning TikTok is beating the same drum as other communist countries controlling what content we are able to see,' Mace said last month. 'Let's not give the government any more power to control social media.'\n'Let's not give the government any more power to control social media.' Progressive Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., who has more than 240,000 followers on TikTok, has led the opposition to the ban on Capitol Hill.\n\"A lot of people on the Hill seem to be ignoring that an outright ban of TikTok would hurt the livelihoods of a lot of working class people, many of whom are people of color,\" Bowman told NBC News.\n\"We need to protect people's constitutional rights of free speech and privacy. We need to pass comprehensive social media safety legislation that protects people on all platforms from Big Tech overreach,\" he said. \"Let's get to work on that, right now.\"\nScott Wong Kyle Stewart Rebecca Kaplan, Frank Thorp V, Kate Santaliz and Sahil Kapur contributed.",

Though he has nibbled around the edges from time to time, Biden doesn't delve into the indictments Trump faces even, it seems, when a criminal trial is actually underway.\nAt the same time, Biden's campaign was having a field day with memes coming out of the trial, ribbing Trump for possibly having nodded off in court. It also put out a news release this week titled: 'After Stormy Abortion Ban Coverage, Trump Poll Memo Attempts to Hush Panic.'\nIt tried to capture the onslaught of rough media Trump faced after last week's Arizona Supreme Court decision that cleared the way for a near-total ban on abortion in the state, while playing off of porn star Stormy Daniels and 'hush money,' the oft-repeated shorthand for the charges he faces.\nThe campaign seemed to relish poking fun at Trump, calling him 'Sleepy Don,' turning the tables on his onetime nickname for Biden, 'Sleepy Joe.' But beyond that, the campaign, like Biden, evaded actual commentary on the charges themselves. The White House did the same. Asked whether Biden was being briefed or was watching Trump's courtroom happenings, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre shifted and laid out Biden's itinerary in Pennsylvania.\n'The president is going to Pennsylvania today, and he's going to do a three-stop tour,' she said before the event. 'He's going to focus on how he's continuing to help the American people.'\nThere is an inherent danger for Biden in getting too close to the criticism of Trump's indictments. Trump has repeatedly told his supporters that the array of court charges he faces is akin to election interference and accused Biden of persecuting him. Celebrating criminal charges against Trump could play into that narrative.\nA Biden campaign official said the recent references to Daniels were a creative way to get out a broader message about abortion. As for picking at Trump for falling asleep, the official said that's consistent with the campaign's highlighting Trump's gaffes and that, in this case, it was too good to pass up.\n'It's smart of the president to continue doing what he's doing, which is talk about his positive vision for the American people,' said Brandon Weathersby, a spokesman for American Bridge 21st Century, the key opposition research group for Biden.\nHis group, in the meantime, is rapidly responding to the trial, highlighting 'chaos' surrounding Trump.\n'With Donald Trump being in court just the last few days, we've seen a lot of chaos. He's intimidating jurors. He's getting reprimanded by the judge. He's going on rants on social media,\" Weathersby said, pointing to the split screen with Biden, who was out campaigning and laying out his platform. 'Right now he's doing the job. He looks like a president.'\nOn Tuesday, against a backdrop that read 'Tax Fairness for All Americans' Biden, 24 hours after Tax Day, laid out a tax plan he said would benefit the middle class and working-class people. It would expand the child tax credit, he said, and add a minimum tax for billionaires. At the same time, he vowed he wouldn't raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year.\nBut he was far from sparing about Trump, seeming to take joy in a string of snarky comments.\nHe bashed Trump, saying he cut taxes only for the wealthy.\n'I have to say if Trump's stock in Truth Social, his company, drops any lower, he might do better under my tax plan than his,' Biden joked to the Scranton crowd.\nHe had the supporters clapping and laughing at another point when he told a story about being confronted by someone who complained about not feeling the benefits of the economy. He was, however, setting up a joke at Trump's expense.\n'Just the other day a defeated-looking guy came up to me and asked if I could help. He was drowning in debt,' Biden said. Then he delivered the punchline: 'I said, ‘I'm sorry, Donald, but I can't help you.''\nIt was a line Biden had used in private events but hadn't said publicly before.\nBiden is to spend the next two days traversing Pennsylvania in a series of events, including in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.\nNatasha Korecki",

            "summary": "BEIRUT, Lebanon — Since Iran's unprecedented retaliatory attack against Israel was thwarted over the weekend with the help of the United States and its Middle Eastern allies, the Biden administration has crowed that the 'coalition' averted a regional war.\nAn Israeli response, however, would test the durability of an informal coalition of awkward bedfellows including Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, whose recent cooperation against Iran has the potential to be damaging on the home front, analysts say.\n'Those Arab countries are in a very critical situation,' said Oraib Al Rantawi, director of the Al Quds Center for Political Studies, a think tank based in Jordan's capital, Amman. 'There is no easy position to take for all of them, especially Jordan, which for geopolitical reasons has found itself trapped between two troublemakers — Iran and Israel.'\nAfter Iran's barrage of more than 300 missiles and drones did limited damage, as many of them were shot down by American, British, Israeli and Jordanian forces, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' on Monday that the coordinated operation was 'an extraordinary military success,' that sent 'a strong message about where Israel is in the region versus where Iran is in the region, which is increasingly isolated.'\nOnlookers and security agents stand around the debris of a missile that the Jordanian forces intercepted over Amman. Ahmad Shoura / AFP - Getty Images But there was no such boasting from America's partners in the Middle East, where even acknowledgement of the weekend's events was muted.\nOne sighting of their difficult domestic messaging came Monday, when Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told state television that the country would defend itself against any threat to its sovereignty and airspace, including from Israel.\nThose comments, echoed in foreign media interviews, were among the few public statements Jordanian officials have made about the country's role.\nIran said the salvo was retaliation for an attack on the Iranian consular building in the Syrian capital of Damascus that killed two senior commanders and five advisers from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Israel has not claimed responsibility for that attack, but it is widely believed to be responsible.\nIsrael may test Jordan's commitment in a matter of hours depending on whether and how the Jewish state decides to respond.\nAmong the three Arab states that participated in Israel's defense, Jordan is the only one that shares a border with Israel and the only one that took part in the air operation to destroy the drones.\nIn a measure of the Middle East's new realignment, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates shared with the U.S. intelligence about Iranian plans after they were briefed on them in order to safeguard their airspace, as first reported on Monday by The Wall Street Journal.\nJordan's King Abdullah speaking alongside President Biden at the White House in February. Kevin Lamarque / Reuters While the UAE normalized its diplomatic relations with Israel four years ago, Saudi Arabia was on the verge of doing so before the negotiations were derailed by Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks, which Israeli officials say claimed the lives of 1,200 people.\nBoth of the monied Gulf monarchies are 'heavily reliant on Western states,' according to Tahani Mustafa, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Belgium-based think tank. Saudi Arabia 'wants a U.S. security pact,' he said. 'Until that alliance is kind of fixed, Saudi will try to do all it can to remain in the U.S.' good books.'\nJordan's participation signaled a kind of volte-face for a state that has been unsparing in its criticism of Israel's six-month military campaign in the Gaza Strip. The country was the first to withdraw its ambassador from Israel, has repeatedly called for a cease-fire and has taken the lead on aid delivery into the besieged enclave.\nRather than signaling a newfound affection for its neighbor, Jordan's participation in the operation shows its wholesale reliance on American and Israeli diplomatic and economic support, said Rantawi of the Al Quds Center for Political Studies.\nPeople march through the streets of the Jordanian capital Amman in support of Palestinians in Gaza. Alaa Al Sukhni / Reuters Despite the fact that about half of the population are Palestinian refugees, Jordan became the second Arab country to recognize Israel in 1994. Its reliance on the wider West goes even deeper: Jordan's landscape is dotted with American, French and British military bases, and its economy is largely propped up by humanitarian and military aid.\nJordan's government also signed a 2021 defense agreement that essentially gives the American military free use of the country's land and airspace.\n'I don't think they'll have much choice than to go wherever the tide takes them,' said Mustafa, at the International Crisis Group. 'It's ultimately not up to them.'\nJordan is also eager to parry calls from right-wing Israeli lawmakers to take in more Palestinian refugees — part of a long-standing push to effectively turn Jordan into a de facto Palestinian state, she said.\nBut Jordan's participation in the American 'coalition' could still stand in the way of the government's desire to close the yawning gap between public policy and public opinion, Rantawi said, citing Jordanians' relentless criticism of Israel's war in Gaza.\nSo far, the messaging has appeared to work in all three countries. Tensions between the largely Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the UAE on the one side, and Iran, which is majority Shia, on the other, have dominated the Middle East for decades.\n'There has been a narrative going on for years that Iran is trying to destabilize Jordan,' said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a former official in the Palestinian Authority.\nThe ball is now very much in Israel's court. Were Israel to launch a tit-for-tat strike on Iran, it would risk further alienating public opinion among its hard-won Middle East partners, Omari said.\n'Things can become very messy if the Israelis try to retaliate over Jordanian airspace,' al-Omari said.\nMatt Bradley",

            "excerpt": "Lynsi Snyder is expanding the family-run California chain as far east as Tennessee. But as for the East Coast? 'I'm probably saying never.'",
            "summary": "In-N-Out isn't your typical burger joint, and it insists expanding its footprint won't change that.\nFor nearly eight decades, the West Coast restaurant chain has remained a private, family-owned company that has cultivated fiercely loyal customers and a quirky identity despite being located in just a handful of states. But recently it's been on a growing spree that will soon extend as far east as Tennessee.\nSince Lynsi Snyder took over as the California-based company's president in 2010, its size has nearly doubled, from 230 stores in four states to 402 in eight. In-N-Out Burger is opening in Washington, its ninth state, with New Mexico and Tennessee to follow.\nSnyder said she's still cautious about expanding too far or too fast and remains focused on keeping prices lower than competitors'. Even before taking the reins, she said she 'felt such an obligation to look out for our customer. When everyone else was taking these jumps, we weren't.'\nLynsi Snyder, the president of In-N-Out Burger, with employees at a Redding, Calif., location in 2019. Mike Chapman / USA Today Network That could be an advantage as the burger wars adapt to an economy still fitfully coming down from a historic run-up of inflation.\nSome major fast-food franchises saw underwhelming sales late last year as many diners veered away from drive-thrus to seek better value in grocery aisles. In February, Wendy's hastened to 'clarify' its plan to roll out 'dynamic pricing' after customers complained it would mean pricier burgers and fries during busier times.\nAt In-N-Out, a Double Double — two beef patties with two slices of cheese — sells for anywhere from $5.90 to $6.05 in California, the company said.\nUnlike In-N-Out, bigger fast-food rivals are franchised, allowing individual store operators to set their own prices, which can often run higher for similarly sized sandwiches. When NBC News recently placed online pickup orders at the closest McDonald's, Wendy's and Burger King locations to the same central Los Angeles address, a Big Mac cost $6.59, a Dave's Single $6.29, and a Whopper $6.49, respectively.\nIn-N-Out still uses many of the same wholesalers Snyder's grandfather used in the 1940s and '50s, she said. It's one reason the company has expanded so deliberately; moving into a new region can require striking up new relationships with untested vendors, which risks compromising on quality, price or both.\nThe company isn't bucking industry trends with its growth plans. Major quick-service restaurants are also expanding, with McDonald's, the Chicago sandwich chain Portillo's and others chasing sales growth by shifting their geographical footprints. But while some larger brands are targeting the Sun Belt, where the populations of several states and cities have swelled since the pandemic, Snyder said In-N-Out is keeping its center of gravity on the West Coast.\nThat could pose some business challenges, especially in California, where restaurant operators say a new minimum wage for fast-food workers makes it harder to keep menu items affordable. The requirements, which took effect this month, mean companies with at least 60 national locations must pay workers at least $20 an hour. Some have responded by slashing their workforces in the state and warning they'll pass higher labor costs to diners.\nIn-N-Out, however, was already paying associates about $20 to $21 an hour. Since the mandated hike, the company said it has increased that range to $23 to $24.\n'We want them to go the extra mile to take care of our customers, so we want to pay them well,' Snyder said. 'I'm going to take care of them.'\nIn-N-Out Burger, founded in 1948, has been a fast-food mainstay in Los Angeles for decades. Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Still, In-N-Out Burger joined a restaurant industry coalition that opposed the California pay law. The company contributed over $12.8 million to Save Local Restaurants, a group that sought to overturn the fast-food minimum wage, according to disclosures the company filed with state authorities. That effort was mooted, though, after the restaurant industry brokered a deal with labor leaders last fall, clearing the way for the pay hike to take effect.\nSnyder declined to comment on the campaign against the wage law. A spokesperson for the company said: 'In-N-Out Burger takes pride in offering all associates competitive salaries and wages, bonuses for managers and consideration for promotion from within the organization for qualified associates.'\nSnyder's grandparents founded In-N-Out Burger in 1948 as a tiny stand with a pioneering drive-thru speaker system on what were then the rural outskirts of Los Angeles. The company expanded regionally in the decades that followed, but by the time Lynsi was 17, a series of family tragedies had left In-N-Out without a Snyder at the helm. She started at the company by working the register at a new location in Redding, California, and ascended through various departments — including meat and merchandising — before taking control a decade later.\n'There's a stigma that can come with being the owner's kid,' Snyder said. 'I think that wanting to be respected, doing it the right way and not having this special treatment is where my mind was.'\nShe credits that experience with helping her gain confidence to do things her way — like proudly displaying Bible verses on In-N-Out packaging, or passing up certain tech trends. She has said 'no to mobile ordering,' for instance, 'because that greatly impacts the customer service experience.'\n'There's a lot of things that could be cheaper, easier, but that's not the system we go through,' Snyder explained.\nShe expects the company to stay private, adding that she's turned down many would-be buyers. Franchising? Also not going to happen. Snyder said she wants the family legacy to continue, especially now that her eldest son has jumped into the business.\n'Just seeing him in his uniform, it's hard to not be a little bit emotional and wish that my dad or my uncle could see him,' she said.\nAnd despite the eastward expansion plans, she said hungry New Yorkers shouldn't hold out for an In-N-Out in Times Square.\nAsked whether the East Coast is on the table, Snyder said, 'As long as I'm around, I'm probably saying never.'\nSavannah Sellers",

            "excerpt": "Jewish voters could play a major role in the big battleground state this fall. Before that, there's a key primary approaching Tuesday in Pittsburgh.",
            "summary": "PITTSBURGH — In the heart of one of America's most prominent historically Jewish neighborhoods, Dan and Baila Cohen keep the front entrance of their 70-year-old Judaica store locked during business hours.\nIt's not how they'd prefer it. But in light of Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack in Israel, Israel's ongoing military campaign in Gaza and tensions at home, they said, the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh told them they needed to be vigilant about who enters their business.\n'That's the reality of the world,' Dan Cohen said.\nIt's not the first time they've had to take additional safety precautions. The couple completed their purchase of Pinsker's Books and Judaica in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood in 2018 just days after a white supremacist gunned down 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue a few blocks away in the deadliest antisemitic attack in American history. But this time feels different.\n'Oct. 27 really unified' Squirrel Hill and Pittsburgh, Baila Cohen said of the Tree of Life massacre. 'Oct. 7 … really started polarizing the community itself, because that's when we started seeing much more of the infighting and conflicts.'\nConversations with more than 30 political strategists, activists and voters outlined how that tension has put Jewish voters in an unfamiliar spot ahead of the 2024 elections: on the front lines of the fight for control of the White House and Congress. Nowhere is that more apparent than in Pennsylvania, the swing state with the largest Jewish population — about 300,000 voting-age Jews in a state President Joe Biden won by roughly 80,000 votes in 2020.\nWhat's more, the congressional district that includes Squirrel Hill features a primary Tuesday that is among the first electoral tests of sentiment on both sides of the conflict in Gaza and concerns over rising antisemitism in the U.S. Democratic Rep. Summer Lee, a 'squad'-aligned progressive critical of Israel's handling of the war and one of the first lawmakers to call for a cease-fire last year, will face Bhavini Patel, an Edgewood Borough Council member who has painted Lee's advocacy as harmful to Biden's re-election chances and out of step with her district.\n'We have communities that are hurting. The Jewish community is one of them. And there are people who are … not going to agree 100% on everything that you say,' Lee said in an interview, adding she has been 'very clear and very upfront' about her cease-fire position. 'I have condemned Hamas. We've worked with the families of hostages; we've done everything that I think is necessary to do that. And at the end of the day, we disagree.'\nA dozen Jewish voters in the district who spoke to NBC News, whether supporting Lee or Patel, almost universally said their votes in November would be driven by issues beyond Israel, saying that the Jewish electorate isn't a 'monolith' and that democracy, abortion rights and the economy weighed heavily on them.\nMost Jewish voters in Squirrel Hill — and nationally — align with the Democratic Party. A Pew Research Center survey released this month found 69% of Jews leaning Democratic, while 29% aligned Republican.\nBut Republicans aren't looking for a massive defection. GOP strategists and Republicans involved in Jewish outreach expressed confidence that Democratic divisions over Israel will help move a small but potentially significant number of Jewish voters into their camp in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona. They pointed to surveys showing President Donald Trump's improved performance among Jews in 2020, compared with his 2016 race, as evidence of a slow shift that could continue.\n'Before Oct. 7, most candidates would say this issue is so messy. … It's not necessarily something that I want to focus on in my campaign,' said Tali deGroot, political director for the liberal Jewish group J Street. 'And I would have said, ‘Absolutely, this isn't a voting issue for people we poll year after year.' And it's too soon to tell if it's going to be a voting issue. But not talking about it is not an option.'‘Playing with fire' In Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, the war and its impact at home took center stage last week at a campaign event where Lee launched her 'Jews for Summer' coalition.\nLee talked about 'how our liberation is tied together,' whether 'in western Pennsylvania or the West Bank.' She spoke about how the district still needs 'deep healing' following both the Oct. 7 attack and the killing of Jews at Tree of Life. And she framed her primary as a covert Republican effort to divide a multiethnic, cross-religious support base by using splits over Israel.\n'There are people who have to convince you that the only reason why I could believe in peace is because I actually hate some of our neighbors, not because we love each other,' said Lee, who overcame significant spending by groups aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group, when she narrowly won her first congressional primary in 2022.\nIsrael didn't have the salience it does now. Lee has accused the Israeli government of committing 'war crimes,\" called for an end to unconditional military aid to the country and joined a handful of other progressives in mid-2022, before the Israel-Hamas war, who voted against a GOP-led resolution that said Israel wasn't 'a racist or apartheid state.' She has also condemned Hamas' attack and repeatedly spoken out against antisemitism.\nOn Saturday, she joined 36 Democrats and 21 Republicans in voting against an aid package to the country, which passed overwhelmingly. She and Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., were the only Pennsylvania members to vote against it.\nHer early call for a cease-fire is now largely in step with Democratic voters, but Jewish leaders have expressed unease with how Lee and some of her allies have discussed the issue. Last month, more than 40 Pittsburgh-area rabbis wrote in a letter, after an earlier meeting with Lee, that she has 'continued to use divisive rhetoric' that the group has at times 'perceived as openly antisemitic.'\nTheir letter didn't describe that rhetoric, but it said Lee opposed House measures to condemn antisemitism and criticized her calls for an 'unconditional cease-fire from one side,' which they said 'devalues the lives and beliefs of one group.' They also called on her to return campaign contributions 'from people who have voiced virulently antisemitic sentiments.' In February, Lee canceled an appearance before the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations amid backlash over other speakers' antisemitic and homophobic remarks, which she condemned.\nKaren Hochenberg, president of a local Democratic club that has endorsed Patel, said Lee has lost considerable support in the Jewish community, including hers. While Hochenberg aligns with Lee on many issues, she and others have been 'hurt' by some of her votes and actions, and she said she wished Lee had been more vocal about the Hamas attack.\n'Many Jews now are starting to question where are we on the road map of intersectionality,' Hochenberg said. 'Jews are starting to really take a look at how comfortable we are and if we're going to send candidates to Congress who's going to be there and have the voice of the Jewish community in mind, as well.'\nJeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgher leading a new Jewish voter group, said the pushback Lee faces isn't so much about Israel but about what he called an unwillingness to meet with constituents who don't share her views.\n'She finds the individuals who agree with her already who are anti-Zionist, who are extremist or fringe of the left of politics, and she will hold them up on a pedestal while spreading things' that, Kazzaz said, make local Jews 'less safe.'\nBut overall, Lee is looking stronger in her district now than in her first run, even to some opponents. AIPAC-linked groups aren't getting involved in her primary this time. Lee has framed her campaign around efforts to counter MAGA Republicans and bring federal dollars to the district.\nJonathan Mayo, a Squirrel Hill resident co-leading the Jews for Summer coalition, told NBC News he aligns with Lee's position on Israel but emphasized that he's not a single-issue voter.\n'It is so important to speak out and show that there are members of the Squirrel Hill Jewish community who still very much support Summer Lee,' he said.\nPatel, meanwhile, is framing her challenge to Lee around who offers Biden the most support, hitting Lee for not criticizing activists and groups calling for 'uncommitted' votes against the president in Tuesday's primary.\n'It's essentially playing with fire,' Patel said in an interview, arguing it could boost Trump.\nLee allies have countered that anti-Biden GOP megadonors support Patel's campaign. An outside group boosting Patel recently disclosed that it received an $800,000 donation from right-wing billionaire Jeffrey Yass. (Patel said she 'denounces' Yass, calling any focus on him a distraction.)\nLee has said she is supporting Biden in the fall. She's endorsed by congressional Democratic leadership and by Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has become arguably the most staunchly pro-Israel Democrat in Congress. And in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, Biden shouted out Lee as someone 'who had my back.'\n'We're going to make sure that the person who's sitting in the White House is not going to be replaced,' Lee said at her event on a recent Sunday.\nSeveral attendees said they were casting anti-Biden protest votes Tuesday. But most said they would support him this fall.\nOne of them, Harry Hochheiser, said Biden 'is the only legitimate choice' against Trump. He said the divisions opened up in the Jewish community over the war have been devastating.\n'I don't think any of us enjoy these divisions,' Hochheiser, a University of Pittsburgh professor and pro-Palestinian activist voting uncommitted in the primary but backing Biden against Trump, said of tensions in the Jewish community over Israel.\n‘More salient than it has been' The fight for Jewish votes in Pittsburgh is only part of a bigger landscape. Across Pennsylvania, Republican Dave McCormick has put Israel at the forefront of his campaign against Democratic Sen. Bob Casey. Nationally, groups in both parties are preparing for what they say could be the largest investment ever made to court the Jewish vote at the presidential level.\nBiden's handling of the war is the main flashpoint. Initially, he was more deferential to Israel. But as the death toll mounted in Gaza and left-wing blowback intensified at home, he has sharpened his criticism of Israeli leadership, pushed for increased humanitarian aid and ramped-up efforts to reach a cease-fire agreement. Still, he hasn't gone as far as his critics to his left would like.\nAs for whether Republicans can pick up voters disaffected by the Democratic divide over Israel, Mark Mellman, president of Democratic Majority for Israel, said it's 'mostly noise' but cautioned 'there is a serious chance' depending how the coming months play out.\nJewish voters have 'been extraordinarily appreciative of the support that President Biden and Democratic leaders have given Israel over the course of this conflict,' he said. 'I hear from some people that is beginning to change as people perceive some change in the positions of those Democratic leaders. But look … Biden has been extraordinary.'\nA 2021 Pew Research Center survey found a wide split in partisanship among Jewish voters depending on which movement they aligned with. Orthodox Jews favored Republicans over Democrats by 75% to 20%, while 70% of Conservative Jews and 80% of Reform Jews backed Democrats.\nSam Markstein, national political director at the Republican Jewish Coalition, said much of the Jewish vote is based in states where Republicans have no shot at all, contributing to the gulf in support between Republicans and Democrats. Pointing to an Associated Press VoteCast survey after the 2020 election that found Trump improved on his 2016 performance among Jewish voters, Markstein predicts the Republican Jewish Coalition will make its 'largest investment at the top of the ticket ever' this cycle to target Jewish voters in battlegrounds.\n'That's where you're going to see the most success this year,' he said.\nSome other surveys had more positive trends for Democrats. This month's Pew survey found the share of Jewish voters who align with Democrats has increased 8 points since 2020.\nDan Siegel, who led Jewish outreach for Biden's 2020 campaign, said Jewish voters' foremost concerns are similar to those of any other voting group: the economy, health care and education.\n'I do think [Israel] may be a little bit more top of mind. But I also think at the end of the day, elections are a binary choice,' Siegel said, predicting Jewish voters 'are going to want that strong, steady hand, not an authoritarian demagogue who is unwieldy at best in a crisis.'\nTrump, who strongly favored Israel as president, has offered limited commentary on the war. Speaking last month with Israel Hayom, an Israeli newspaper, Trump said, 'You have to finish up your war. You have to get it done. We have to get to peace. We can't have this going on.'\nBiden's campaign has zoomed in on recent comments Trump has made about Jewish voters; he said on Real America's Voice that 'any Jewish person who votes for Biden does not love Israel and, frankly, should be spoken to.'\nIn a statement, Karoline Leavitt, Trump's national press secretary, slammed Democrats for caving in 'to the demands of far-left Palestinian extremists.\"\nAsked about Trump's comments on the war, Markstein said he believed Trump 'was just giving voice to the frustration of … people [who] want this to be concluded, with Israel defeating Hamas and rescuing the hostages.' On Trump's remarks about Jewish voters, Markstein said Trump 'was just trying to say in a Trumpian way … why haven't they been more vocal in their opposition to what their own leaders of their party are doing?'\nBack in Pittsburgh, Kipp Dawson, a Jewish civil rights activist backing Lee, said she would be horrified by Trump's re-election and expressed hope that Lee would be able to bring skeptical Democrats back on board with Biden this fall.\n'My sense is that things are extraordinarily in flux in this country right now,' she said. 'The big issue for November is who's going to come out to vote.'\nAt Pinsker's, the Cohens declined to say whom they'd support in next week's primary or the general election, though they said a number of Jews in Squirrel Hill were eager to back Patel.\n'The Jewish community really feels that if they don't take the stand now, [U.S. support for Israel] is not going to be assured,' Baila Cohen said. 'Everyone's very interested in getting actively involved and being part of the political scene in a way that doesn't always play out.'\nAllan Smith Emma Barnett",

            "excerpt": "Modi's supporters credit him with putting India on the global stage, while others say he has fanned a wave of Hindu nationalism and stifled basic freedoms.",
            "summary": "This week the world's biggest democratic election kicks off in India, as almost 970 million voters decide whether to give Prime Minister Narendra Modi a third term. The election will last six weeks after a campaign that has sprawled across India — and into the United States as well.\nModi's supporters credit him with putting India on the global stage and turning it into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. His critics, however, say Modi has fanned a wave of Hindu nationalism, cracked down on opponents, stifled press freedom and stoked religious tensions with Muslims and other minority groups.\nIn the weeks leading up to the election, which begins Friday, the overseas arm of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has enlisted members of the Indian diaspora in the U.S. to campaign on his behalf, either by phone calling friends and family in India or by traveling to India themselves.\nMany of the attendees at the event wore scarves of saffron, a color associated with the Hindu nationalist movement. Nathan Howard / Reuters More than 60 Modi supporters turned up to an event at the Potomac Community Center in Maryland last month, many of them wearing scarves of saffron, a color associated with Hindu nationalism.\nAt the event, leaders of the Overseas Friends of BJP listed what they saw as Modi's achievements since taking office in 2014: developments in infrastructure, pharmaceuticals, technology and education and, more recently, the inauguration of a grand Hindu temple on a contested holy site.\nAttendees were urged to use these as talking points to nudge friends and family in India to vote for Modi, and many stood ready to help.\n'Especially when they see me, that I'm from [the] United States, it carries a weight,' said Kanwaljit Soni, OFBJP's coordinator for the Sikh community, who was planning to travel to India to campaign ahead of the election, which runs from April 19 to June 1.\nIt's a familiar routine for him. During the last election, in 2019, he said, he spent three weeks in India traveling from village to village to encourage people to vote for the BJP.\n'I will be going to where my roots are in the different states,' he said.\nAware of the gargantuan task of defeating Modi, the fractured opposition has tried to consolidate into a single coalition by fielding a single candidate against the BJP. But many candidates have already switched to the BJP or backed out of the coalition.\n'It's no longer party versus party. It's a person against a person, and there is no other credible person with a national stature like Modi,' said Sanjoy Chakravorty, a professor of geography, urban studies and global studies at Temple University in Philadelphia and the author of 'The Truth About Us: The Politics of Information From Manu to Modi.'\nThe opposition has been further constrained by what it says are strong-arm tactics by Modi and his government. Dozens of opposition politicians have been jailed or are under investigation, and there were protests last month when Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of Delhi, was arrested in connection with corruption allegations that he denies.\nLast month, Modi's government froze the bank accounts of the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, in a tax dispute. The party said the move was politically motivated and hindered its ability to campaign.\nModi has said that India's democracy remains robust and that there is 'absolutely no discrimination.' His government says the Congress party fears a historic defeat and that its accounts were frozen because it failed to file tax returns for past donations.\nThe Congress party has also tried to mobilize support among Indian Americans with rallies across the U.S., arguing that India cannot afford a third Modi term.\n'Democracy is under an existential crisis in India right now and people are afraid to speak out,' said George Abraham, vice president of the Indian Overseas Congress.\nBut it is hard to compete with Modi, who experts say has built the narrative of being a 'great leader,' his face appearing everywhere in India from outdoor displays to vaccination certificates. That has extended abroad to the Indian diaspora in the U.S., which has never been more passionate about politics at home.\nModi's state visit to Washington last year drew a few hundred protesters, but thousands of South Asians also flooded the city's landmarks, either to support him or just to revel in the historic moment.\n'It's the convergence of the whole nation into a person,' Chakravorty said.\nAdapa Prasad, president of Overseas Friends of BJP, said the group aimed to reach almost 50,000 members of the Indian diaspora in the U.S., with the goal of helping Modi and the BJP secure a landslide victory.\nAnd Maryland was just the first stop.\nThe group planned to hold pre-election rallies in 20 U.S. cities, modeled after Modi's 'Chai Pe Charcha,' or 'discussions over tea' — televised programs in which he discusses various issues with citizens and top leaders.\nThere are an estimated 4.4 million people of Indian origin living in the U.S., making them the largest Asian American group, according to the Census Bureau. While many are U.S. citizens, barring them from voting in Indian elections, they may still have family links in India.\nFor those unable to travel to India, there is also the option of campaigning by phone, Prasad said.\nPeople who are 'sympathetic to BJP' will call their relatives in India and urge them to vote, he said.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a campaign rally in Mysuru, India, on Sunday. Abhishek Chinnappa / Getty Images India has a multiparty parliamentary system in which the candidate who receives the most votes in their home constituency wins. The party with the biggest share of candidates in the Legislature gets to pick the prime minister. Even though Modi's party received 37% of the votes in 2019, it won 303 out of the 543 seats.\nFlanked by almost a dozen party flags, supporters in Maryland chanted 'Victory of Mother India' and, 'This time, above 400' in Hindi, referring to the BJP's goal of securing more than 400 seats.\nCalling Modi a 'sensible leader,' Peeyush Uniyal, who is originally from the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand and now lives in Ellicott City, Maryland, said that 'especially from the development point of view, I think it becomes a no-brainer.'\nHe dismissed concerns about the rise of Hindu nationalism as 'overblown.'\nVirginia resident Upasana Dhankhar said it was her first time venturing into politics. 'It's the consistency of leadership,' said Dhankhar, a former professor of Indian history.\nShe moved to the U.S. in 2019, the same year Modi revoked the Indian Constitution's Article 370, which granted semiautonomous status to Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority region. The widely criticized move in the disputed territory was followed by the arrival of thousands of troops and a six-month communications blackout.\n'Resolving the Kashmir problem was a big thing,' Dhankhar said, mirroring an argument from a PowerPoint slide titled 'Article 370 SCRAPPED.'\nThe BJP's campaign in the U.S. was another way of revving up Modi's global fanbase, Chakravorty said.\n'The entire civilization is on the rise,' he said, 'and they want to be part of it.'\nMithil Aggarwal Megan Lebowitz",

            "excerpt": "The senator has outrun other members of her party in rural areas before. This November, she'll have to manage being on a ballot with Donald Trump.",
            "summary": "REEDSBURG, Wis. — In rural Wisconsin, dairy farmer Randy Roecker is at a breaking point — and he blames it partly on President Joe Biden, so is planning to vote for Donald Trump for a third time this November.\n'Farmers are hurting like you wouldn't believe, and I myself, I am to the point of throwing up my hands and saying I'm done,' said Roecker, who owns and operates Roecker's Rolling Acres in Loganville and cited inflation as straining his business for the last two years.\nBut while he's planning to vote on booting the Democratic president, Roecker's also planning to vote to keep his Democratic senator, Tammy Baldwin.\n'I support her all the way. I mean, no question,' Roecker said. 'And everybody I know — the farmers — everybody says that she's great for Wisconsin agriculture.'\nBaldwin is bracing for a tough re-election race against likely Republican nominee Eric Hovde, a multimillionaire and bank owner who loaned $8 million of his own money to his campaign in the first quarter of the year, according to FEC filings. But she has the advantage of incumbency, and has used it to often outperform other statewide Democrats in rural counties, even as the party as a whole has lost significant ground in rural America in recent decades.\nBaldwin is already pouring more effort into rural campaigning this year as she prepares for the challenge of sharing the ballot with one of the forces driving GOP margins in rural areas sky-high. Unlike her first two races for the Senate, in 2012 and 2018, Donald Trump will be running this November, too.\n'In Wisconsin, in rural America, I think a lot of people vote straight-ticket, either Republican or Democrat,' said Roecker, who sits on the board of directors for the National Dairy Board, Foremost Farms USA and Dairy Management Inc. 'And, you know, like I said, I don't know how many people go down through there like I do and check her separate.'\nRoecker said he didn't know much about Baldwin's Republican opponent, but Hovde's campaign said it plans to work across the state to tell voters that Baldwin is a 'rubber stamp for the Biden administration.' A new Marquette University Law School poll out Wednesday showed Baldwin running a single point ahead of Biden among likely voters and 3 points ahead of the president among registered voters. The likely voter results showed Baldwin and Hovde tied, while she had a small lead among registered voters.\n'When Tammy Baldwin's in Washington ... she's voting like a Washington Democrat,' said Ben Voelkel, senior adviser for the Hovde campaign. 'And she's not, you know, the same person that goes around and campaigns and shows up, you know, every fifth year to campaign.'\nWisconsin Democrats' rural campaign push Late last month, Baldwin sat around a kitchen table with Roecker and others from the Farmer Angel Network for a 90-minute discussion about farmers' mental health. The event was part of the senator's 'Dairyland' tour through 19 counties, none of them among Wisconsin's five most populated counties.\n'I think that there has been a real opportunity for me to be a champion for issues that I might not hear about if I only was going to the population centers of the state,' Baldwin told reporters at a stop at the New Glarus Brewing Co.\nThe 'Dairyland' tour is one example of a concerted effort by Wisconsin Democrats to court the rural voters who have increasingly rejected the party over the last few elections — as Wisconsin will again play a huge role in determining which party wins the White House and controls Congress. Ben Wikler, chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, calls rural voters 'essential to the Biden coalition' in 2024.\n'There's no path to victory without organizing in rural Wisconsin and across the country, as well as suburbs, cities and small towns and big towns,' he said. 'In a state like Wisconsin, where four of the last six presidential elections came down to 1 percentage point, you can't write anyone off or take anyone for granted.'\nWisconsin GOP Chair Brian Schimming calls the Democrats' efforts in rural Wisconsin a 'fool's errand' and says the Republican Party plans to focus on the economy as a 'constant reminder of the failure of the [Biden] administration' when making its case to rural Wisconsin voters.\n'You don't talk your way out of that,' Schimming said, speaking about the current economic situation. 'I mean, you can talk till you're blue in the face, but when people leave your talk or turn off your television ad or put down their smartphone, and then pull into a convenience store and pay, you know, a dollar and a quarter more than they're paying for gas four years ago, they get it.'\nDemocrats have an uphill battle in the state's rural areas, as their statewide victories have increasingly relied on wider margins in the state's most densely populated metro areas.\n'They have lost huge swaths of the rural/outstate vote in this state, and they are not going to get them back by running Tammy Baldwin around. They're just not,' Schimming said. 'And it's a problem endemic for the whole party out there.'\nChanging coalitions When Baldwin won a second Senate term in 2018, the 'blue wave' midterm during Trump's presidency, she increased her statewide margin by over 5 points, but she won seven fewer counties than in 2012, though she got larger margins in heavily populated counties.\n'Look, in a state like Wisconsin, a 50/50 battleground state, it is — you don't have to win every county,' Baldwin said at the campaign stop in New Glarus. 'But it is really critical that we get folks out to vote, we have the discussions and up the turnout in every community that you can.'\nSimilarly, in 2022, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers slightly increased his margin of victory from four years before but won fewer of the state's 72 counties. Democrats also narrowly lost Wisconsin's rural 3rd Congressional District after longtime Democratic Rep. Ron Kind retired, with the seat going to Republican Derrick Van Orden by just under 4 points. Republicans have also controlled both the 7th and 8th districts in northern Wisconsin since the 2012 election.\n'My county voted for Obama twice. And it was after the second Obama election that it started to shift,' said Peggy Fullmer, chair of the Democratic Party in Marquette County, about an hour north of Madison. 'You know, then all of a sudden, it's been really red ever since.'\nDemocratic organizers in rural areas are feeling the pressure.\n'It's like pulling hen's teeth to get votes for Democrats in our areas,' said Linda Wilkins, chair of the neighboring Green Lake County Democratic Party.\n'Every Democratic vote makes a difference, and we get a few more each time in these extremely difficult red areas,' Wilkins said of the work of Democratic organizers in rural Wisconsin. 'And without our votes, they wouldn't win either.'\nBut Wilkins thinks it's time for the Biden campaign to visit rural Wisconsin. 'They need to go and visit them and not just go to Milwaukee and Madison,' she said. Biden made trips to Milwaukee and Madison in recent weeks, but he visited Superior in January. First lady Jill Biden visited the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin's reservation last October.\nJoni Anderson, vice-chair of the Adams County Democratic Party and a coordinator of Democratic efforts across several rural counties, said she wishes the state party would give more support to candidates who run in rural areas.\nWikler said the state party will soon announce its largest-ever investment in state legislative races.\n'This is something that I've been really listening to — the feedback from rural county parties and rural Democrats,' Wikler said. 'We want to make sure that when somebody's the Democratic nominee, wherever they live in Wisconsin, they have the backing of our state party.\"\nFor farmers like Roecker, showing up means a lot, but it's not everything.\n'They just can't show up at the farm and do a photo op, you know what I mean?' he said, adding that farmers feel like elected officials 'don't care what's going on out here' as long as there's food in the grocery store.\n'It's a shame when farmers are on food stamps themselves and they produce food for 155 other people. And that's how broken the system is here,' Roecker said.\nSarah Dean",

            "excerpt": "Trump is taking aim at Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as several recent polls show he may have more to lose from the independent's presence on the ballot.",
            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he's confident that independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will pull more votes away from President Joe Biden than from him — a net win for the Republican's candidacy.\n'He is Crooked Joe Biden's Political Opponent, not mine,' Trump wrote on Truth Social late last month. 'I love that he is running!'\nBehind closed doors, however, Trump is less sure. A Republican who was in the room with Trump earlier this year as the former president reviewed polling said Trump was unsure of how Kennedy would impact the race, asking the other people on hand whether or not Kennedy was actually good for his candidacy.\nAnd after mostly ignoring Kennedy early in his campaign, Trump has stepped up his efforts to brand the independent candidate as left-wing and make him Biden's problem, suggesting that he and allies are concerned about Kennedy's ability to attract Republican voters. In the same post in which he called Kennedy Biden's political opponent, Trump called Kennedy 'the most Radical Left Candidate in the race, by far,' someone who was 'a big fan of the Green New Scam' and 'other economy killing disasters.'\nIn a video monologue he posted to his social media page this month, Trump described Kennedy as being to Biden's left but said Kennedy has 'got some nice things about him' and 'I happen to like him.'\n'If I were a Democrat, I'd vote for RFK Jr. every single time over Biden because he's frankly more in line with Democrats,' Trump said, adding, 'I do believe that RFK Jr. will do very well. And I do believe he's going to take a lot of votes away from crooked Joe Biden.'\nTrump's increased focus on Kennedy comes as Democrats have increased their attention on third-party contenders, standing up super PACs and other anti-spoiler efforts meant to kneecap independent challengers who could pull from Biden and reduce the vote share Trump needs to get over the top this fall. And in defiance of earlier conventional wisdom about the 2024 race, new polling shows that right now Trump might have the most to lose with Kennedy on the ballot.\nAn NBC News national poll released Sunday found that Kennedy cut deeper into Trump's support than Biden's. The survey found that 15% of voters who picked Trump in a head-to-head matchup with Biden switched to choose Kennedy in a five-way ballot test, while just 7% of those who initially selected Biden in the head-to-head switched to Kennedy when third-party candidates were added.\nThat trend meant Trump went from leading Biden by 2 percentage points in a head-to-head survey to trailing him by 2 points when the race is expanded to five named candidates, including Kennedy. The survey's margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\nRepublican voters view Kennedy much more favorably than Democrats. The poll found that 40% of self-identified Republicans viewed Kennedy favorably, while 15% held negative views of the independent candidate. For Democrats, just 16% had positive views of Kennedy, while 53% expressed a negative view of him.\nThat's in part the result of conservative media and Trump allies heaping praise on Kennedy when he was initially running in the Democratic primary against Biden, as well as prior to this election cycle as Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, railed against the medical establishment and so-called social media 'censorship.'\nA Republican who worked on a door-knocking effort in an early state for a Trump primary opponent told NBC News that Kennedy often came up as the second choice among people who said they were backing Trump.\nA changing posture Trump himself has offered kind words for Kennedy in the past. During a June 2023 interview on the Howie Carr Show, Trump described Kennedy as 'a common sense guy.' Right-wing allies like Steve Bannon, Alex Jones and Roger Stone openly pined for Trump to pick Kennedy as his running mate.\nThe vibe is different now.\nThe pro-Trump PAC MAGA Inc. this month launched a 'Radical F---ing Kennedy' website dedicated to promoting the candidate's left-wing positions. Kennedy, meanwhile, has criticized Trump from the right, hitting him for taking advice from Dr. Anthony Fauci during the pandemic and for running up the deficit. He said another Trump term 'would be bad for the country.'\n'President Trump calls me an ultra-left radical,' Kennedy posted on X in response to the MAGA Inc. website. 'I'm soooo liberal that his emissaries asked me to be his VP. I respectfully declined the offer.' (Trump's campaign has denied that Kennedy was ever approached about being the former president's running mate.)\n'I am against President Trump, and President Biden can't win,' Kennedy's post continued. 'Judging by his new website, it looks like President Trump knows who actually can beat him.'\nOn the whole, there have been public surveys showing both major party candidates suffering more as a result of Kennedy's campaign. The dynamic also may change depending on which state is being surveyed — and which states feature Kennedy on the ballot in November, a battle that is still in progress.\n'Nobody has conducted more polls than I have on Kennedy and his place in the race — and continuously I have seen him draw equally from Biden and Trump,' said Jeremy Zogby, a managing partner at John Zogby Strategies who has polled for Kennedy's campaign. 'Sometimes a point or two towards one side in a poll, and vice versa in another poll. The fact remains Kennedy has crossover appeal among those disaffected within both parties,' like the 'double haters' who dislike both Biden and Trump.\nDemocrats have long worried that Kennedy's association with his famous father and uncles will win over some liberals who are fond of the family. Plus, Kennedy for years gained acclaim as an environmental activist and an anti-corporate crusader, two causes that have him finding common ground with Democratic voters.\nLast week, Biden held an event with Kennedy family members who touted the president and warned of the danger their relative's campaign posed. And on Monday, the Democratic National Committee announced it was launching billboards in Arizona depicting Kennedy as a pro-Trump spoiler candidate.\nA strategist working on the Democrats' anti-third party effort said the data shows Kennedy is clearly taking a slice from both major party candidates, as well as a portion of voters who wouldn't be open to voting for either Trump or Biden.\n'I think the data's moved a little bit over the last month-plus,' this person said. 'But it's all on the margins, it's tough to tell whether this is RFK appealing more to Trump voters, or some Trump voters just looking for an off-ramp, or both. Ditto on the Biden end — is this just reflecting the fact that Biden's ticked up a few points?'\nOne Trump ally said the presumptive GOP nominee should hold off on hitting Kennedy for now, arguing there will be time later this fall to go after him as 'too liberal for America' if these polling trends continue.\n'The second you start attacking him or even addressing him, you start giving credibility to and you start firming up those votes,' this person said, 'At the moment, he's irrelevant. As you get close and votes start hardening in terms of who people are voting for and when and why and how, then you've got to start making moves.'\nIn a statement, Trump's campaign railed against Kennedy's environmental positions and described him as 'no independent , ' while also hitting Democrats for challenging his efforts to get on the ballot.\n,' while also hitting Democrats for challenging his efforts to get on the ballot. 'RFK Jr. is an AOC lover and opposes really any human advancement, preferring that we all live in caves by candlelight, except of course supports charging stations for your $150,000 electric car that can only drive a few miles before dying just like his presidential campaign,' said Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director.\nTony Lyons, a co-founder of the pro-Kennedy super PAC American Values 2024 and the president of Skyhorse Publishing, said there will be a 'pendulum swinging back and forth' throughout the campaign that shows Kennedy at times being better for Trump and at other times boosting Biden's candidacy.\nLyons said Kennedy will soon be promoting a 30-minute infomercial posted online that aims to hit back on the attacks he's facing from his rivals.\n'The fascinating part of it is that Trump says he's ultra left-wing,' Lyons said. 'And Biden says that he's ultra right-wing.'\nAllan Smith Alex Seitz-Wald and Vaughn Hillyard contributed.",
