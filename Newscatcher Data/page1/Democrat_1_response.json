            "excerpt": "The departure of two Democratic representatives who won suburban mayoral posts last fall evenly split the Michigan House.",
            "summary": "Michigan Democrats started 2023 with full control of state government for the first time since the 1980s. They ended the year in a political bind after two House members left to become mayors of suburbs, leaving that chamber with an even partisan split and making it impossible for Democrats to pass bills without Republican support.\nOn Tuesday, five months after their House majority evaporated, Democrats won two special elections to reclaim those seats and full control at the Michigan Capitol. The Associated Press said the Democrats Mai Xiong, a Macomb County commissioner, and Peter Herzberg, a Westland City Council member, defeated their Republican opponents.\nThe results of the special elections had never been in great doubt. Both districts, situated in the Detroit area, are liberal strongholds that Democratic candidates had carried by large margins in 2022. But the details of scheduling and running special elections meant a long, slow winter for Democratic lawmakers in Lansing while the House was evenly divided between the two parties. Michigan's governor, Gretchen Whitmer, is a Democrat, and her party has a majority in the State Senate.\nRepublicans hope the Democrats' renewed House majority is short-lived. Michigan, long a swing state, is expected to be a pivotal presidential battleground again this year. President Biden is working to rebuild a coalition that helped him win the state in 2020, but early polling has been favorable to former President Donald J. Trump. Republicans see an opening to deliver Michigan for Mr. Trump in November and to win control of the Michigan House, a goal that could be helped by newly redrawn legislative maps in the Detroit area. All 110 Michigan House seats are up for election in November, including the two seats that were contested on Tuesday.\nBefore losing their House majority last year, Michigan Democrats raced through a list of longstanding policy goals that had been stymied during decades of divided government or Republican control of the state. In the span of several months in 2023, Ms. Whitmer and legislative Democrats enacted new gun laws, codified civil rights for L.G.B.T.Q. people, solidified abortion rights and undid Republican laws that they said weakened labor unions.\nThose efforts slowed in November after one House member, Kevin Coleman, was elected mayor of Westland and another, Lori M. Stone, was elected mayor of Warren. Under Michigan law, Mr. Coleman and Ms. Stone had to resign from the Legislature when they became mayor.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Happy Friday! Today, we're looking at younger voters and other demographic groups who are generally crucial for Democratic victories in presidential elections — but who may back other candidates or sit out this year's election in greater numbers than usual. I've asked my colleague Shane Goldmacher to kick things off. — Jess Bidgood\nImage Ben Tulchin, a Democratic pollster, says he is 'raising the alarm' about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Credit... Jim Wilson/The New York Times Like many of his fellow Democrats, Ben Tulchin, a former pollster for Senator Bernie Sanders, is worried about President Biden's chances against Donald Trump this fall. And like many Democrats, he is nervous about Biden's current level of support among some core Democratic constituencies.\nBut Tulchin is warning any Democrat who will listen about one particular thing they might not have thought of: the possibility that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will wind up siphoning off two traditionally Democratic voting groups — Latinos and younger voters — this fall.\nHe's so worried that he paid for his own polling in two key battlegrounds, Arizona and Pennsylvania, which showed Kennedy drawing some of those voters away from Biden. He recently presented those findings to a consortium of Democratic groups and super PACs.\n'I'm raising the alarm,' Tulchin said in an interview.\nTulchin's concern is basically this: Latinos and younger voters, who flocked to Sanders, an independent, in the 2020 Democratic primary, were never that into Biden in the first place. Sure, they sided strongly with Biden in the general election. But, as Tulchin put it, 'they weren't enthused.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "It's a nightmare scenario for Democrats: Protesters disrupt their convention this summer; they clash with the police; chaos seems to take hold.\nIt may not be imaginary. As protests over Israel's war in Gaza continue to intensify, especially on college campuses, activists are preparing to be in Chicago this summer for the Democratic National Convention.\nImage Demonstrators faced off against National Guardsmen outside of the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Credit... Barton Silverman/The New York Times The very idea sends some Democrats right back to 1968, when their convention, also in Chicago, was overshadowed by infighting and violence between the police and antiwar protesters. Back then, many voters watching the nightly news got the impression that the party could not control its own delegates, never mind a country that was wrestling with an unpopular war.\nProtests over the Israel-Hamas war could also complicate this year's convention and the Democratic messaging for President Biden, whom Republicans have eagerly cast as too indulgent of chaos and disorder in American society. Last week, Fox News and other conservative outlets repeatedly showed demonstrations that made the country seem on the edge: Columbia University sending in the police to arrest students on campus; protesters shouting 'genocide!' at President Biden at a campaign stop; demonstrators chaining themselves to cars to block traffic, creating gridlock.\n'The whole Republican message is, ‘The world is out of control and Biden is not in command,'' said David Axelrod, the Democratic strategist and adviser to former President Barack Obama. 'They will exploit any images of disorder to abet and support it.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "When Congress convened in 2023, an empowered far-right Republican faction in the House threatened to upend Washington and President Biden's agenda.\nBut the intransigence of that bloc instead forced Republicans and Democrats into an ad hoc coalition government that is now on the verge of delivering long-delayed foreign military aid and a victory to the Democratic president.\nThe House approval on Saturday of money for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan over angry objections from the extreme right was the latest and perhaps most striking example of a bipartisan approach forged out of necessity. The coalition first sprang up last year to spare the government a catastrophic debt default, and has reassembled at key moments since then to keep federal agencies funded.\nUnable to deliver legislation on their own because of a razor-thin majority and the refusal of those on the right to give ground, House Republicans had no choice but to break with their fringe members and join with Democrats if they wanted to accomplish much of anything, including bolstering Ukraine in its war against Russia.\n'Look at what MAGA extremism has got you: nothing,' Representative James P. McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, told Republicans on the House floor as lawmakers took their first steps toward approving the aid package. 'Nothing. Not a damn thing. In fact, it has empowered Democrats. At every critical juncture in this Congress, it has been Democrats who have been the ones to stand up for our country and do the right thing for the American people.'\nThe moments of bipartisan coming-together are hardly a template for a new paradigm of governing in polarized times. The grudging G.O.P. collaboration with Democrats has only come about on truly existential, must-pass legislation — and typically only at the last minute after Republicans have exhausted all other options, making the coalition unlikely to hold on less critical bills and the social policy issues that sharply divide the two parties.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Speaker Mike Johnson's elaborate plan for pushing aid to Ukraine through the House over his own party's objections relies on an unusual strategy: He is counting on House Democrats and their leader, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, to provide the votes necessary to clear the way for it to come to the floor.\nIf Democrats were to provide those crucial votes, it would mark the second time in two years that Republican leaders have had to turn to the minority party to rescue them from their own recalcitrant right-wing colleagues in order to allow major legislation to be debated and voted on.\nGiven Republicans' tiny margin of control, Mr. Johnson will need their support on the aid itself. But before he even gets to that, he will need their votes on a procedural motion, known as a rule, to even bring the legislation to the floor — an unconventional expectation of the minority party.\nThat puts Democrats once again in a strange but strong position, wielding substantial influence over the measure, including which proposed changes, if any, are allowed to to be voted on and how the foreign aid is structured. After all, Mr. Johnson knows that if they are unsatisfied and choose to withhold their votes, the legislation risks imploding before it even comes up.\nThe dynamic also increases the likelihood that Mr. Johnson will need Democrats again — to save his precarious speakership, now under threat from two members of his party, Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky. They are enraged at his strategy for sending aid to Ukraine and every day appear to be edging closer to calling a vote to oust him from his post.\n'We're steering toward everything Chuck Schumer wants,' Mr. Massie said on Tuesday, referring to the Democratic Senate majority leader. (Without Democratic help, Mr. Johnson can afford to lose two Republicans, if all members are present and voting, meaning the legislation to send aid to Ukraine would be dead far before arrival.)\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "Here's how each member of the House voted on the foreign aid bills.",
            "summary": "Source: Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives\nThe House passed a long-stalled foreign aid package on Saturday that gives funding to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, with a majority of lawmakers backing money for American allies across the globe. The package, which now goes to the Senate, is almost certain to become law.\nThe Senate passed similar legislation in February. But in the face of distinct bases of opposition to different elements of the legislation, which threatened to tank the package as a whole, Speaker Mike Johnson advanced the foreign aid using a convoluted strategy: It split the package into three parts, each of which received its own vote, added a fourth bill with Republican priorities as a sweetener and melded it all together again once everything passed.\nThe plan, laid out in a rule that passed on Friday, was concocted to capitalize on the pools of support for each part of the $95.3 billion package, while preventing opposition to any one piece from taking down all of them.\nNote: Progressive Democrats are members of the House Progressive Caucus. Hard-right Republicans include members who were supported by the House Freedom Fund during the 2022 midterms, opposed Kevin McCarthy's election as speaker in January 2023, or voted to oust Mr. McCarthy from the speakership last October. The fund is the campaign arm of the House Freedom Caucus, a hard-right faction founded in 2015.\nA majority of Republicans voted against Ukraine aid on Saturday in a reflection of the stiff resistance within the G.O.P. to continuing to aid Ukraine against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia's invasion. The coalition that voted against the bill spanned right-wing members of the House Freedom Caucus to leadership, such as Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, the No. 3 House Republican. On Israel aid, on the other hand, most Republicans voted 'yes.'\nThirty-four right-wing Republicans also opposed aid to American allies in the Indo-Pacific, while Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, declined to take a yes-or-no position and voted 'present.' Representative Bob Good, Republican of Virginia and the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, was one of the 21 members of his party who voted against the Israel package. Echoing one of the many grievances shared by hard-right Republicans who opposed all of the aid measures, Mr. Good said his support for 'Israel's right to defend itself remains unshakeable' but that he disagreed with a measure that would add to the nation's debt.\nWhile all Democrats voted in favor of aid to Ukraine and all but Ms. Tlaib supported funding to Taiwan, 37 left-leaning Democrats defected to vote against the Israel aid bill. They said before the vote that they opposed unfettered aid to Israel that could be used in its offensive in Gaza. The opposition to the Israel aid bill represented a minority of Democrats, but reflected the deep resistance to unfettered aid and the divisions in the party on Gaza. Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, represented a notable new 'no' vote among Republicans, and other standouts included Representatives Donald S. Beyer Jr. of Virginia, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon and John Garamendi of California.\nStill, 37 'no' votes, while a break from Washington's ironclad support for the Jewish state, fell short of the opposition bloc progressives had hoped to muster. Thirty-nine Democrats had voted 'no' on Friday on the rule to allow the foreign aid package to come to the House floor, a target that progressives just missed on Saturday on the Israel bill. Fourteen of those Democrats voted on Saturday in favor of aid to Israel, while 12 Democrats who voted to allow the package on the floor on Friday then cast votes against the funding itself.\nTwenty-five Republicans voted against the fourth bill, which included measures that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the United States and that would redirect funds from seized Russian assets to help aid Ukraine. Democrats put up a big vote — 174 — in favor on this bill, which was intended to sweeten the overall package for conservatives.",

            "excerpt": "Democrats stepped in to support bringing the aid package to the floor, in a remarkable breach of custom on a key vote that paved the way for its passage.",
            "summary": "The House took a critical step on Friday toward approving a long-stalled package of aid to Ukraine, Israel and other American allies, as Democrats supplied the crucial votes to push the legislation past Republican opposition so that it could be considered on the floor.\nThe 316-94 vote cleared the way for the House to bring up the aid package, teeing up separate votes on Saturday on each of its parts. But passage of those measures, each of which enjoys bipartisan support from different coalitions, was not in doubt, making Friday's action the key indicator that the legislation will have the backing needed to prevail.\nThe rule for considering the bill — historically a straight party-line vote — passed with more Democratic than Republican support, but it also won a majority of G.O.P. votes, making it clear that despite a pocket of deep resistance from the far right, there is broad bipartisan backing for the $95.3 billion package.\nThe vote was an enormous victory in the long effort to fund to Ukraine as it battles against Russian aggression, a major priority of President Biden that has met with bitter resistance from the right. It was a triumph against the forces of isolationism within the G.O.P. and a major moment of bipartisan consensus in a Congress that for the past year has been mostly defined by its dysfunction.\nBut it came only after Speaker Mike Johnson, who put his own job on the line to push through the plan over his party's objections, was forced to turn to Democrats in a significant breach of custom in the House, further imperiling his position even as he paved the way for the legislation to be voted on and approved.\nOn the House floor, Democrats held back their votes until it was clear there was not enough Republican support for the measure to pass without their backing, and then their 'yes' votes began pouring in. Ultimately, 165 Democrats voted for the measure, more than the 149 Republicans who supported it.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Shomari Figures, a Democrat who worked in the Justice Department, will face Caroleene Dobson, a lawyer and Republican political newcomer, this November for the seat in Alabama's Second Congressional District, according to The Associated Press.\nThe two candidates won primary runoff elections on Tuesday in the district, which was redrawn after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year that the state had illegally diluted the power of Black voters.\nNow that the district has more Black voters, who historically have largely supported Democrats, political analysts see the race for it as one of the most competitive in the South. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report ranks it as a likely Democratic seat. (The district's current representative, Barry Moore, is expected to remain in Congress after winning the Republican primary in the neighboring First Congressional District.)\nThe Second District now stretches across the state, encompassing much of Mobile; Montgomery, the Alabama capital; and several counties in the Black Belt, where rich soil once fueled plantations worked by enslaved people.\nIn the Republican primary, Ms. Dobson faced Dick Brewbaker, a former state senator. Mr. Brewbaker repeatedly pointed to his experience in the State Legislature, while Ms. Dobson argued that it was time for a newer political voice in Washington.\nIn the Democratic runoff, Mr. Figures's opponent was State Representative Anthony Daniels, the House Democratic leader.\nMr. Figures's family has a long political legacy in Alabama: He is the son of Michael Figures and Vivian Davis Figures, who have both served in the State Senate, with Ms. Davis Figures winning her husband's seat after his death in 1996. Shomari Figures moved back to Alabama after working in the Justice Department and the Obama administration.\nMr. Daniels does not live in the district — a point of contention in the race, though residency is not a requirement — but grew up there. He argued that his leadership position in the State House had shown that he could deliver for Alabama residents.\nThe November elections could result in Alabama sending two Black representatives to Washington for the first time in its history if Mr. Figures were to win and if Representative Terri Sewell, the Democrat in the Sixth Congressional District, wins re-election, as analysts widely expect.",

            "summary": "A broad coalition of the Kennedy family will endorse President Biden on Thursday at a campaign rally in Philadelphia, pointedly rejecting one of their own in Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the independent candidate who many Democrats believe poses a significant threat to Mr. Biden's re-election chances.\nAmong the relatives of Mr. Kennedy expected to back Mr. Biden are his siblings Joseph, Kerry, Rory, Kathleen, Maxwell and Christopher. The Biden campaign released a list of 15 Kennedys set to appear at the rally, but it said other family members would endorse the president as well. Kerry Kennedy will introduce Mr. Biden at the rally, the campaign said, and Joe Kennedy III, Mr. Kennedy's nephew and a former Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, will do so at a second event.\nThe show of force will send the clearest signal yet that America's most storied Democratic family is deeply fearful that one of its own could tip the 2024 election to former President Donald J. Trump, and hopes to use its influence to try to stop him.\nMany family members have previously expressed strong disapproval of Mr. Kennedy's candidacy, voicing anguish about his promotion of conspiracy theories and confusion about why he is challenging a Democratic president they admire. Like many Democrats, they worry that he could help Mr. Trump win if he draws even a small number of votes away from Mr. Biden in the battleground states — contests that were decided by tens of thousands of votes in 2020.\nMr. Trump is likely to remain the main target of attacks at the Philadelphia event, but the symbolic repudiation of Mr. Kennedy will not be subtle.\n'We can say today, with no less urgency, that our rights and freedoms are once again in peril,' Kerry Kennedy is expected to say, according to excerpts from her speech shared by the Biden campaign. 'That is why we all need to come together in a campaign that should unite not only Democrats, but all Americans, including Republicans, and independents, who believe in what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "Pressed on his claims of 2020 election irregularities, the Republican candidate for Senate in Wisconsin has questioned the mental capacity of nursing home residents to vote.",
            "summary": "Eric Hovde, the Republican banking executive challenging Senator Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, may be developing a problem with older voters.\nThe bank he leads, Utah-based Sunwest, last month was named as a co-defendant in a California lawsuit that accuses a senior living facility partly owned by the bank of elder abuse, negligence and wrongful death.\nMr. Hovde's campaign called the suit meritless and said it was farcical to hold the chairman and chief executive of a bank responsible for the actions of a business that it seized in a foreclosure in 2021. Whatever its merits, the suit might have been largely irrelevant to Mr. Hovde's political campaign had he himself not boasted recently of having gained expertise in the nursing home industry as a lender to such residences.\nIn comments this month in which he suggested there had been irregularities in the 2020 election, Mr. Hovde drew on that experience to say that residents of nursing homes 'have a five-, six-month life expectancy' and that 'almost nobody in a nursing home is at a point to vote.' Those remarks were quickly condemned by Democrats in Wisconsin and by the former Milwaukee Bucks star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\nThe recent pileup of problems is an inauspicious start to a campaign that Republicans hope will help wrest control of the Senate from Democrats. Mr. Hovde is one of four affluent Republicans who are running to unseat Democratic incumbents, in Ohio, Montana, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\nEach of those states either leans heavily Republican in the upcoming presidential contest or is rated a tossup, and the loss of any one of those seats could cost Democrats control of the Senate. The deep pockets of candidates like Mr. Hovde will ease the G.O.P.'s heavy fund-raising burden as the party confronts Democrats' early financial advantage.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "House Republicans took a critical step late Thursday night toward bringing up the long-stalled foreign aid bill for Ukraine and Israel, after being forced to rely on Democratic votes to move a plan to consider it out of a key committee and onto the floor.\nThe 9-to-3 vote in the critical Rules Committee was an early step in the convoluted process the House is expected to go through over the next couple of days to approve the $95 billion aid package. It reflected the extent of far-right anger over Speaker Mike Johnson's plan to push through the legislation over the opposition of ultraconservative Republicans, and underscored how heavily the speaker will have to rely on Democrats to push it across the finish line.\nIn a spasm of anger, three far-right Republicans on the panel, which controls what legislation comes to the House floor, refused to back the rule needed to bring up the foreign aid bill, putting it on track to die in committee. But Democrats on the panel stepped in to save it in an extraordinary breach of custom.\nAll Democrats voted to advance the plan out of committee.\nThe Rules Committee has traditionally been an organ of the speaker, and legislation is typically advanced to the floor in a straight party-line vote.\nDemocrats will all but certainly have to provide the votes on the House floor to approve the rule and allow the aid package to be brought up, lending their support in an yet another unorthodox vote in the face of Republican opposition.\nThe rule is critical to Mr. Johnson's plan for pushing the foreign aid package through the House, because it would allow separate votes on aid to Israel and aid to Ukraine, which are supported by different coalitions, but then would fold them together without requiring lawmakers ever to cast an up-or-down vote on the entire bill.\nThe group of far-right lawmakers who sought to block the measure in committee won their seats on the Rules panel as part of a concession made last year by the speaker at the time, Kevin McCarthy, who had to haggle with ultraconservatives who opposed electing him to the top post and agreed to back him only after he granted them critical leverage. They refused to support the measure to bring up the foreign aid package because it would not allow a vote on severe border security provisions they have said should be prioritized over aiding Ukraine.\nThat amounted to a remarkable act of rebellion, and left Democrats to bail out the speaker and push the measure through the panel.\nMr. Johnson earlier said he expected a House vote to pass the aid package on Saturday.\n'I'd rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,' he said in an interview on Newsmax on Thursday night. 'We don't want to have boots on the ground, and we can prevent that by allowing them to hold Putin at bay.'",

            "summary": "Representative David Trone, a Democrat who apologized for using a racial slur during a recent House committee meeting, has poured nearly $42 million from his personal fortune into his Senate bid in Maryland, according to the latest federal quarter filings, putting him among the top self-funders in Senate primary history.\nMr. Trone, who founded and owns a lucrative wine and liquor retailer alongside his brother, invested $18.5 million of his own money from January to March alone, ending last month with $1 million on hand. He drew only about $216,100 from other donors in that time, according to the filings.\nMr. Trone is seeking to make up ground in his hotly contested Democratic primary against Angela Alsobrooks, the prominent executive of Prince George's County, and a slate of lesser known candidates. Now in his third term in the House of Representatives, Mr. Trone has picked up endorsements from top House Democrats. But his use of the slur has drawn criticism.\nLast month, while praising President Biden's tax proposals at a congressional budget hearing, Mr. Trone dropped a derogatory term used to caricature Black people. He later apologized, adding that he misspoke and meant to say 'bugaboo.' 'Regardless of what I meant to say, I shouldn't have used that language, and I apologize,' he said at the time.\nFive Black Democrats in the House then endorsed Ms. Alsobrooks, who is Black, though they made no mention of the slur. She ended the latest quarter with nearly $3.2 million cash on hand, according to federal filings. The primary is on May 14.\nThe winner is likely to face Larry Hogan, a popular former governor of the state who is seeking the Republican nomination, in what is expected to be a competitive general election. While Maryland has not elected a Republican senator in more than 40 years, it elected Mr. Hogan as governor twice.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states.\nBut for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West.\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks.\nThe City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis — the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing.\nThe conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them.\nAdvocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "As a progressive insurgent in her last primary campaign, Summer Lee barely eked out a victory in a Pittsburgh-area congressional race, facing fierce opposition from local Democratic leadership and an onslaught of spending from outside groups.\nTwo years later, Ms. Lee — now a congresswoman aligned with the left-wing 'Squad' in Washington — heads into Tuesday's primary contest as the dominant front-runner, backed by much of the party establishment even as her criticism of Israel has deeply angered some Jewish constituents.\n'It was just the development of Congresswoman Summer Lee,' said Mayor Ed Gainey of Pittsburgh, asked about the biggest difference between the 2022 primary contest and this one. 'No one can doubt her influence.'\nThe Democratic primary in Pennsylvania's 12th District seemed primed to become a major test of party attitudes about the Middle East, following the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack that Israeli officials say killed about 1,200 people in Israel, and the Israeli military response that has devastated Gaza.\nMs. Lee has condemned the Oct. 7 attack. But she is also one of the most vocal critics of Israel in Congress, breaking with much of her party on an array of Israel-related legislation and calling for a cease-fire nine days after the Hamas attack, a position at odds with many Democratic officials at the time.\nYet interviews with more than a dozen voters, party leaders and activists in the Pittsburgh area suggest that the once-expected ideological battle has been significantly limited.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "On a Monday in mid-March, the Wisconsin Republican Party gathered about 50 conservative activists on a Zoom call to train them in how to become poll workers, helping oversee and monitor the casting and counting of votes.\nHeavily Democratic areas of the battleground state were a key focus. 'Eau Claire, Madison, Milwaukee — that type,' Mike Hoffman, the state party's election integrity director, said as he ticked off places being targeted.\n'We're keeping a close eye on you,' he recounted telling one city clerk, according to audio recordings of the party's training sessions obtained by The New York Times.\nThe Wisconsin training sessions are a small part of an expansive operation announced on Friday by former President Donald J. Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee, which plan to dispatch more than 100,000 volunteers and lawyers to monitor and potentially challenge the electoral process in each battleground state. They will focus on every aspect of voting, including mail ballots, voting machines and post-Election Day recounts and audits.\nThe sprawling effort is rooted in Mr. Trump's persistent false claims that Democrats cheated to win the 2020 election. His allies have helped turn that belief into Republican doctrine despite the overwhelming conclusion by Democratic and G.O.P. election officials, as well as federal and state judges, that no evidence of widespread fraud exists.\n'Democrat tricks from 2020 won't work this time,' Charlie Spies, the chief counsel of the R.N.C., pledged in a statement announcing the program. 'In 2024, we're going to beat the Democrats at their own game and the R.N.C. legal team will be working tirelessly to ensure that elections officials follow the rules in administering elections.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Kennedy Jr. threatening to upend the presidential race went from an idea to a reality in one of the country's most consequential battlegrounds on Thursday, when Mr. Kennedy qualified for the ballot in Michigan.\nThe decision by the Natural Law Party to grant Mr. Kennedy its ballot line in November ensures he will be a factor in a pivotal swing state where the presidential election is expected to be incredibly close and where President Biden has already shown vulnerability with key Democratic constituencies. During Michigan's primary in February, a protest movement over Mr. Biden's support for Israel's war in Gaza drew significant support.\nMr. Kennedy, a lifelong Democrat and the scion of perhaps the nation's most famous Democratic family, is running as an independent in 2024 and polling higher in early surveys than any third-party candidate since Ross Perot, the self-funding billionaire who ran in the 1990s.\nHis independent candidacy has earned him the estrangement of his own family — who campaigned this week with Mr. Biden in Pennsylvania — and many of his previous colleagues from the environmental movement, who denounced his candidacy publicly on Friday.\nMr. Kennedy has emerged as a leading voice of vaccine skepticism, both before and after Covid-19 vaccine, and dabbled in conspiratorial theories, including about the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, his father. He had initially declared his 2024 campaign as a Democratic challenger to Mr. Biden — and was heavily featured in conservative media — until he switched last fall to run as an independent.\nBoth parties are already rushing to define Mr. Kennedy as he races to get on the ballot nationwide.\nBrian Hughes, an adviser to Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, called Mr. Kennedy 'a leftist and liberal with a history of supporting an extreme environmental agenda that rivals Joe Biden for its ability to kill American jobs.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "David H. Pryor, a liberal Democrat who won two terms as governor of Arkansas and three in the United States Senate, and who paved the way for the political rise of his young ally Bill Clinton in an era of changing racial attitudes in the South, died on Saturday at his home in Little Rock. He was 89.\nHis death was announced by his son Mark, himself a former two-term United States senator.\nMr. Pryor was eight years older than Mr. Clinton, and they didn't know each other well until they became accomplished politicians. But they had much in common. They both grew up in segregated small towns in Arkansas, raised by families of modest means and liberal outlook, who resisted pressures to scorn their Black neighbors.\nMr. Pryor's mother played the piano for services in a Black church, cooked meals for Black prisoners in a county jail and, at 56, became a missionary among the descendants of slaves in British Guiana. Mr. Clinton's maternal grandparents, who raised him, ran a small grocery store and during the harsh winters sold goods on credit to people of all races.\nAlong with another white liberal Democrat, Dale Bumpers, Mr. Pryor and Mr. Clinton courted union members and Black voters. All three won their first primary elections for governor against the same notorious segregationist, former Gov. Orval E. Faubus, who had called out the National Guard in 1957 in a futile effort to block the integration of Little Rock High School.\nMr. Pryor, center, with President-elect Bill Clinton and his fellow Arkansas senator Dale Bumpers at the Capitol in January 1993, shortly before Mr. Clinton's inauguration. Credit... Laura Patterson/CQ Roll Call, via Getty Image Attempting comebacks three times, Mr. Faubus lost Democratic primaries to Mr. Bumpers in 1970, Mr. Pryor in 1974 and Mr. Clinton in 1986. In heavily Democratic Arkansas, each man crushed his Republican opponent in the general election. Their governorships became springboards to national prominence — for Mr. Bumpers and Mr. Pryor in the Senate, and for Mr. Clinton in the White House for two terms.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "When former President Donald J. Trump goes on trial on Monday in Manhattan, President Biden and his allies are not likely to say much.\nFor Democrats, a former president facing criminal charges over covering up a sex scandal surrounding the 2016 campaign speaks for itself. The media coverage will be constant, especially if Mr. Trump takes the stand, which he has floated as a possibility. And while Mr. Trump faces up to eight weeks in court, Mr. Biden will be on the campaign trail and employing a 'Rose Garden strategy' as he governs from the White House, a contrast that the president's aides hope voters will view favorably.\nThe approach could be bolstered by the fact that Mr. Trump will be appearing in a court case involving salacious details and questionable financial maneuverings while Mr. Biden is addressing a conflict in the Middle East.\nMr. Biden and his campaign have said nothing publicly about the criminal indictments against Mr. Trump, worried about improperly influencing the cases or stoking Mr. Trump's repeated allegations — made without evidence — that Mr. Biden has engineered the charges.\nMany of the deep-pocketed outside Democratic groups supporting the Biden campaign are charting a similar path. Part of their calculation, they say, is that ads promoting Mr. Biden's record or arguing that Mr. Trump is a threat to democracy are testing better with voters than highlighting Mr. Trump's legal troubles. Another consideration is that the Manhattan case, which is being brought by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, is not easily explained in a sound bite or a 30-second ad.\n'I just don't think in the end it's the strongest argument for voters,' said Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist running a pro-Biden super PAC called Unite the Country. 'Campaigns have limited resources and you spend those resources in a way that moves the most votes.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "The state has been in turmoil since its Supreme Court upheld a near-total abortion ban dating back to the Civil War.",
            "summary": "Arizona lawmakers are preparing for a renewed attempt on Wednesday to repeal the state's 1864 abortion ban, which was upheld by the State Supreme Court last week in a ruling that exacerbated all the personal emotions and political firestorms surrounding abortion in a battleground state.\nThe court last Tuesday upheld the Civil War-era law, which bans nearly all abortions. The ruling infuriated supporters of abortion rights and presented a grave political threat to Republicans, who narrowly control both houses of the State Legislature.\nDemocrats' immediate attempts to repeal the ban failed last week. A Republican member of the House had sided with Democrats and put forward a measure to repeal it, but G.O.P. leadership adjourned, delaying any action for a week since the Legislature currently meets only on Wednesdays.\nAs a second attempt at repeal looms, both parties are scrambling to count votes and game out legislative strategies to determine whether Democrats have found enough Republican support to strike down the law.\nFormer President Donald J. Trump last week called on legislators to 'act immediately to remedy what has happened,' as Democrats slammed the ban as another sign of Republican extremism in a pivotal state in this fall's election. The ban allows only an exception to save the life of the mother. Doctors prosecuted under the law could face fines and prison terms of two to five years.\nDemocrats likely need only two or three Republicans to vote with them to repeal the law. Activists and lobbyists have jockeyed behind the scenes to sway — or hold — the handful of Republican lawmakers whose actions could determine the law's fate. A variety of procedural elements could also disrupt a repeal's chance of advancing. If the House is able to pass a repeal, it is expected to head to the Senate later on Wednesday.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "The Republican speaker, with his job on the line, said he expected Saturday evening votes on the long-stalled package of aid to Ukraine, Israel and other American allies.",
            "summary": "Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday told Republicans that the House would vote Saturday evening on his foreign aid package for Israel and Ukraine, pushing through resistance in his own party to advance a long-stalled national security spending package for U.S. allies.\nHis announcement came amid a crush of opposition from Republicans who are vehemently against sending more aid to Ukraine, and have vented for days as congressional aides race to write the legislation Mr. Johnson proposed on Monday.\nThe speaker, whose job is at risk as he defies his right flank on the measure, also announced that he would hold a separate vote on a border security bill 'that includes the core components' of House Republicans' stringent legislation passed last May that would crack down on unlawful immigration and revive severe Trump-era border restrictions. The move was a nod to ultraconservatives who have demanded that the speaker not advance aid to Ukraine without securing sweeping concessions from Democrats on immigration policy.\nThe legislative package Mr. Johnson is trying to advance roughly mirrors the $95 billion aid bill the Senate passed two months ago with aid to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and other American allies, but he has proposed breaking that package into three pieces that would be voted on individually. There would be a fourth vote on a separate measure containing other policies popular among Republicans, including conditioning Ukraine aid as a loan and a measure that could lead to a nationwide TikTok ban.\nMr. Johnson said the text of the legislative package would be released later Wednesday.\nThe multipart plan has been painstakingly structured to cobble together just enough support from Democrats and mainstream Republicans to pass over the opposition of the hard right to funding for Ukraine funding and left-wing Democrats who do not support unfettered aid for Israel. If all four pieces passed the House, they would then be folded into a single bill for the Senate to take up, in an effort to ensure that senators could not cherry-pick pieces to approve or reject.\nIts success will require everything to go right for Mr. Johnson this week to prevail.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "A high-energy crowd rallied on Sunday in Pittsburgh to support Representative Summer Lee, a left-leaning congresswoman whose primary on Tuesday is a high-profile test whether she can stave off a challenge aimed in part at her stance over the war in Gaza.\nSpeakers framed Ms. Lee's race, in Pennsylvania's 12th District, as crucial to building a movement for working people and to fighting what they cast as billionaire influence in the race.\nThe rally with several hundred supporters drew a small group of protesters who held signs outside the headquarters of the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers to criticize Ms. Lee and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's stances on the war in Israel and Gaza. Ms. Lee's primary is one of the first down-ballot electoral tests of the Israel-Gaza conflict this year.\n'To fight for common sense in the House is to often be alone. I have seen Summer walk alone,' Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. 'On Tuesday, what we must do is show her and show the world and show the people in that big white house that she is not alone.'\n'It's not about winning — it's about winning big,' she added.\nMs. Lee won a close primary in 2022 against a moderate challenger on her way to become the first Black woman to represent Pennsylvania in Congress. She has garnered broad support from Democrats this year. Even so, she has also faced pressure within her district after becoming one of the first members of Congress to call for an immediate cease-fire, just over a week after Hamas attacked Israel, and Israel responded with a military assault on Gaza.\nDuring her remarks, Ms. Lee reiterated her support for union jobs, affordable housing and a 'pro peace movement.' At one point, she told the audience that there was 'no room for people who would use our communities against each other for their own political ambitions.'\nShe framed her race as being about democracy and appeared to acknowledge the heightened focus on her Israel-Gaza stance, saying, 'You don't have a democracy if one issue determines whether or not my community has representation.'\nHer opponent, Bhavini Patel, a municipal councilwoman, has repeatedly criticized Ms. Lee's votes relating to the conflict. Ms. Patel said in an interview that on Sunday she attended a 'rally focused on the Jewish community' and decried her opponent's rally as 'bringing people here who are not from here.'\nMs. Lee and her supporters have sharply criticized the involvement of Jeff Yass, a Republican megadonor in Pennsylvania who gave significantly to Moderate PAC, a super PAC backing centrist Democrats and running ads supporting Ms. Patel. Ms. Lee and her supporters have seized on them: Her campaign distributed signs on Sunday that read 'Move, Yass! Get out of the way.' (Ms. Patel said she had denounced Mr. Yass and his support.)\nAllies of Ms. Lee also indirectly praised her Gaza stance. Mr. Jones told the crowd that Ms. Lee 'shows us that solidarity is about consistency in showing up for each other,' and that solidarity includes a spectrum of people, 'whether it's workers in Pittsburgh or the people of Palestine.'\n'Summer is somebody who knows that sometimes confrontation is confirmation that we are on the right path for victory,' he said.\nAnd when Ms. Ocasio-Cortez began to criticize AIPAC, the pro-Israel group that is backing challenges to progressive incumbents outside Pennsylvania, the audience promptly booed the group's mention.\nBackers of Ms. Lee have pointed to her diverse coalition as evidence that she can draw support from the groups that the national Democratic Party is looking to motivate, such as young people and voters of color.\nMeanwhile, a handful of critics outside the venue, several of whom said they were backing Ms. Patel, held signs that criticized Iran and cast Ms. Lee and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez as opposing Israel. The protesters said they were especially unhappy with Ms. Lee's vote last week against parts of a foreign aid package that allocated billions to Israel and imposed new sanctions on Iran.\n'We as a Jewish community are afraid, and we want her to understand that by not supporting things like Iran sanctions, it makes not just Israel but also America less safe,' said Julie Paris, a regional director for the pro-Israel group StandWithUs and Pittsburgh resident.\nBut Ms. Lee's backers vastly outnumbered Ms. Paris and her compatriots.\nWill Allison, who served as president of College Democrats at the University of Pittsburgh, said his group had endorsed Ms. Lee, the first primary endorsement he said the group had made.\n'We're very lucky to have her as a congresswoman who can bring the money back to the district and can make the system work for us as her constituents, but who can also authentically hold to her positions and take those tough votes,' he said.\nAnd when Mayor Ed Gainey of Pittsburgh took the stage and asked the crowd, 'Y'all know what time it is?' the audience emphatically shouted back: 'Summer time!'\nA correction was made on : Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated how Ms. Lee voted on some parts of the foreign aid package. She voted last week against parts of a foreign aid package that allocated billions to Israel and imposed new sanctions on Iran, but supported bills that provided aid to Ukraine and Taiwan.\nUkraine and Taiwan.

Although she was not among the girls in the pictures, she asked if something could be done to help her friends, who felt 'extremely uncomfortable' that male classmates had seen simulated nude images of them. Soon, Senator Mullet and a colleague in the State House proposed legislation to prohibit the sharing of A.I.-generated sexuality explicit depictions of real minors.\n'I hate the idea that I should have to worry about this happening again to any of my female friends, my sisters or even myself,' Ms. Mullet told state lawmakers during a hearing on the bill in January.\nThe State Legislature passed the bill without opposition. Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, signed it last month.\nStates are on the front lines of a rapidly spreading new form of peer sexual exploitation and harassment in schools. Boys across the United States have used widely available 'nudification' apps to surreptitiously concoct sexually explicit images of their female classmates and then circulated the simulated nudes via group chats on apps like Snapchat and Instagram.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "The rollout of endorsements from the Kennedys signaled the urgency the Biden campaign feels toward Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s independent bid, and its desire to discredit him.",
            "summary": "The elaborate rollout of a Kennedy family endorsement of President Biden on Thursday — talk-show interviews, a campaign event with the president, door-knocking by Kennedys across Philadelphia — was the most powerful sign yet of rising concern in the Biden camp that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s independent White House bid presents a serious threat to the president's re-election prospects.\nMembers of this prominent Democratic family, including most of Mr. Kennedy's siblings, had already signaled their support for Mr. Biden's re-election. Mr. Kennedy's estrangement from much of his family had grown increasingly apparent over the years, as he became a leading spokesman against Covid vaccines and promoted conspiratorial theories about the 1968 assassination of his father, Robert F. Kennedy.\nBut this was the first time Mr. Biden's campaign had been so aggressively involved in promoting the Kennedys' strong support for the president, making an open push to discredit any enduring Democratic credentials Robert F. Kennedy Jr. carries because of his family name.\nAfter leaving the work to outside liberal groups, the Biden campaign has now joined the effort to define Mr. Kennedy beyond the gauzy memory of his father and two uncles, who for many members of Mr. Biden's fraying coalition, including Black voters, Latinos and blue-collar workers, continue to symbolize Democratic politics in America.\nDemocratic worries about Mr. Kennedy have grown as he has turned up his attacks on the preisdent and worked to win ballot lines in critical battleground states. Michigan election officials announced on Thursday that he had secured a spot as a member of a little-known third party.\n'I can only imagine how Donald Trump's outrageous lies and behavior would horrify my father, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who proudly served as attorney general of the United States, and honored his pledge to uphold the law and protect the country,' Kerry Kennedy, one of the independent presidential candidate's siblings, said as she stood next to Mr. Biden, addressing about 150 people at a recreation center gym in Philadelphia. 'Daddy stood for equal justice, for human rights and freedom from want and fear. Just as President Biden does today.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The Senate on Wednesday dismissed the first of two articles of impeachment against Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary, voting along party lines before his trial got underway to sweep aside the charge accusing him of failing to enforce immigration laws.\nBy a vote of 51 to 48, with one senator voting 'present,' the Senate ruled that the charge was unconstitutional because it failed to meet the constitutional bar of a high crime or misdemeanor. Republicans united in opposition except for Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the lone 'present' vote, while Democrats were unanimous in favor, after arguing that a cabinet member cannot be impeached and removed merely for carrying out the policies of the administration he serves.\n'To validate this gross abuse by the House would be a grave mistake and could set a dangerous precedent for the future,' said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader.\nRepublicans, for their part, warned that the dangerous precedent was the one that Democrats set by moving to skip an impeachment trial altogether, which they argued was a shirking of the Senate's constitutional duty. They tried several times to delay the dismissal, failing on a series of party-line votes.\n'Tabling articles of impeachment would be unprecedented in the history of the Senate — it's as simple as that,' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader.\nDemocrats moved immediately to strike down the second article of impeachment against Mr. Mayorkas, alleging a breach of the public trust, thus skipping the trial altogether. A vote was expected later on Wednesday.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "After the first day of jury selection in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial saw the dismissal of dozens of potential jurors who said they could not be impartial, the first seven jurors were chosen on Tuesday as the defendant looked on.\nThe picks came after a morning session in which several more potential jurors said that they could not be unbiased, underscoring the challenges of finding a fair panel in Manhattan, a profoundly Democratic borough.\nMr. Trump, 77, is charged with falsifying nearly three dozen business records in an attempt to cover up a payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, who has said she had a brief sexual encounter with him in 2006.\nIf convicted, he could face probation or up to four years of prison time. Mr. Trump denies having been involved with Ms. Daniels, and has declared his innocence, calling the charges against him a 'witch hunt' conjured by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a Democrat.\nHere are five takeaways from Mr. Trump's second day on trial:\nThe trial is expected to last about six weeks, according to Juan M. Merchan, who is overseeing it, and court officials had warned that the selection of 12 jurors and several alternates might take two weeks.\nBut Justice Merchan, an experienced jurist known for his no-nonsense style, has kept things moving fast. Before leaving Tuesday, he swore in another 96 prospective jurors, who will return on Thursday — Wednesday is an off day for the trial — raising the possibility that a full jury will be seated this week.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Former President Donald J. Trump leaned heavily on major Republican donors in March as his campaign and the Republican Party sought to close the financial gap separating him from President Biden, new federal filings showed on Monday.\nFor much of the race, Mr. Trump has relied on small donors — in particular, those giving less than $200 online — to sustain his campaign. Most big donors steered clear.\nBut in recent weeks, as Mr. Trump finished trouncing his primary opponents and Mr. Biden and the Democrats gathered fund-raising steam, these donors have opened their checkbooks to the former president.\nIn the last two weeks of March alone, one committee backing Mr. Trump raised nearly $18 million, nearly all from six-figure contributions. Mr. Trump and the Republican Party finished the month with $93 million on hand between all their committees, his campaign has said, having raised more than $65 million in March.\nStill, Republicans are lagging behind. In the first three months of the year, Mr. Biden and the Democratic Party together raised more than $187 million, his campaign has said, including $90 million in March, ending the month with $192 million on hand.\nMr. Trump's campaign has not provided a full account of its first-quarter fund-raising. The two committees that filed on Monday reported raising nearly $90 million combined since January, but that does not include money raised directly by the campaign or the Republican National Committee.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Few British politicians have American ties as deep as those of David Lammy, who is set to become Britain's foreign secretary if the opposition Labour Party wins the coming election, as the polls suggest it will.\nA son of Guyanese immigrants who grew up poor in working-class London, he spent summers with relatives in Brooklyn and Queens, working at Con Edison, before earning a master's degree at Harvard Law School and befriending Barack Obama, for whom he canvassed in Chicago during his first presidential campaign.\nYet now, on the cusp of becoming Britain's chief diplomat, Mr. Lammy finds himself facing an uncertain, even potentially hostile, American political landscape. President Biden and the Democrats, with whom Mr. Lammy has cultivated a deep network of contacts, are fighting to hold off a resurgent Donald J. Trump.\nHaving been chosen by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, partly because of his trans-Atlantic credentials, Mr. Lammy, 51, is scrambling to build ties with Republicans and, more challengingly, with those around Mr. Trump. It's a very different American establishment from the Democratic one he knows so well.\nWould Mr. Lammy pay a visit to Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's Palm Beach estate, as David Cameron, Britain's current foreign secretary, did two weeks ago to lobby the former president on military aid to Ukraine?\n'Of course,' he said in an interview this week in Portcullis House, the parliamentary office building across the street from Big Ben. Noting that he was headed soon to New York and Washington, he said, 'I'm happy to talk to whomever the American people decide they want to run the country.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

And it would ultimately mean cobbling together just enough support from Democrats and mainstream Republicans to pass the legislation amid resistance from hard-right Republicans to Ukraine funding and among left-wing Democrats to unfettered aid for Israel.\nMr. Johnson plans to advance a legislative package that roughly mirrors the $95 billion aid bill the Senate passed two months ago with aid to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and other American allies — but broken down into three separate pieces that would each be voted on individually. There would also be a fourth vote on a separate measure containing other policies popular among Republicans, including conditioning Ukraine aid as a loan.\nThe strategy has run into a flurry of opposition from members of his own party, including one Republican, Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who on Tuesday announced that he would join a threatened bid to remove Mr. Johnson from the top post.\nRepresentative Thomas Massie on Tuesday joined Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to remove Mr. Johnson as speaker.

            "summary": "Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The Israeli military struck Iran early on Friday, according to two Israeli and three Iranian officials, in what appeared to be Israel's first military response to Iran's attack last weekend but one whose scope, at least initially, appeared to be limited. The Iranian officials said that a strike had hit a military air base near the city of Isfahan, in central Iran. Initial reaction in both Israel and Iran was muted, which analysts said was a sign that the rivals were seeking to lower the temperature of their conflict. World leaders, who for nearly a week have urged Israel and Iran to avoid starting a broader war in the region, called for both sides to de-escalate tensions on Friday. The Israeli military declined to comment on the strike. A senior U.S. official said that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before the attack. All the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The explosions came less than a week after Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel — nearly all of which were shot down — in response to an April 1 strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed seven Iranian officials. That attack brought the decades-long shadow war between Israel and Iran — waged on land, at sea, in air and in cyberspace — more clearly into the open. A Western official and two Iranian officials said that Israel used both missiles fired from warplanes and drones in the strike, suggesting that the attack included more advanced firepower than initial reports indicated. Iranian officials initially told The New York Times that the attack had been carried out only by small drones, possibly launched from inside Iran, and that radar systems had not detected unidentified aircraft entering Iranian airspace. They said that a separate group of small drones was shot down in the region of Tabriz, roughly 500 miles north of Isfahan.\nIn public, Iranian officials sought to downplay the strike. Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi, the commander in chief of Iran's army, said explosions heard early Friday in Isfahan 'were from our air defense firing at a suspicious object,' and that there had been 'no damage.' Iranian news agencies appeared keen to show that things were 'back to normal' in the city.\nPresident Ebrahim Raisi of Iran had warned that 'the tiniest act of aggression' on his country's soil would draw a response. But in the hours after Israel's strike, there have been no public calls for retribution by Iranian officials. One lawmaker, Seyed Nezamedin Mousavi, called the strike 'ridiculous,' saying it showed Israel 'is content with these ineffective actions.'\nIsfahan is one of Iran's most famous and historic cities. The area also hosts a number of Iranian military sites. Iranian media reported that nuclear facilities in Isfahan had not been hit.\nIsraeli leaders came close to ordering widespread strikes in Iran on the night Iran attacked, officials said, but the war cabinet postponed a decision. Mr. Biden and other world leaders urged Israel for days not to retaliate in a way that would inflame a wider Middle East war while it fights Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both allies of Iran. April 19, 2024, 8:07 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 8:07 p.m. ET Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, who is in New York attending U.N. meetings, told Iran's state news agency that the small quadcopter targeting a military base in Isfahan did not have casualties or damage. 'Israel is determined to portray its defeat as a victory,' Mr. Amir Abdollahian said, the most senior official to comment on the attacks and draw a link to Israel publicly. Credit... Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The Israeli attack on an Iranian air base in Isfahan hit a crucial part of an air defense system, a New York Times analysis of satellite imagery found. Images showed that the precision attack at the 8th Shekari Air Base damaged or destroyed the 'flap-lid' radar, which is used in S-300 air defense systems to track incoming targets. The Times used several satellite images in its analysis; the location of the damaged area was first pointed out on the social media platform X by Aurora Intel, and the findings have also been confirmed by a former U.S. government imagery analyst, Chris Biggers. The radar is typically surrounded by several vehicles, including four trucks carrying missiles. Before the strike, the missiles were seen positioned next to the radar. After the strike, they had been moved and did not appear visibly damaged. It was not clear why the missiles had been moved. However, the fact that they appear undamaged indicated that the attack had a very precise target, according to Mr. Biggers. An air defense system at the air base in Isfahan in October 2021.

Maxar Technologies, via Google Earth Other areas of the air base and adjacent airport also appeared to be undamaged. The precision of the strike, deep within Iran and with several sensitive sites close by, suggested Israel chose the specific and narrow target, the air defense system. According to the Missile Defense Project of the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, Iran has acquired Russian-made S-300 air defense systems to deter Israeli and other airstrikes. Some Democrats are fine sending defensive weapons to Israel, but want to see some limits on offensive weapons, which could be used against civilians in Gaza. Credit... -/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images A group of left-leaning House Democrats is urging its colleagues to oppose the $26 billion aid package for Israel, hoping to maximize the number of 'no' votes from the party and send a warning to President Biden about the depth of his political coalition's discontent over his support for Israel's tactics in Gaza. Framing the upcoming vote as a make-or-break moral choice akin to Congress's votes to authorize and fund the Iraq war, progressive leaders in the House are working to muster a sizable bloc of Democratic opposition to the aid measure, which is expected to pass on Saturday and become law in the coming days. 'In the wake of those votes, people came around much, much later and said, ‘We shouldn't have allowed that to go forward,'' Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington and the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said of the decades-ago debate over Iraq. 'And I think that this is that moment.' Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, called it a 'defining vote,' adding, 'We're either going to participate in the carnage, or we're not.' There is little doubt that the bill, which would send roughly $13 billion in military assistance to Israel as it continues its offensive in Gaza, will pass the House, along with money for Ukraine, Taiwan and other American allies. But progressive Democrats estimated that 40 to 60 members of their party may oppose it on the House floor on Saturday. That would be a striking signal from Congress, where ironclad bipartisan backing for Israel has long been the norm. And it would highlight the fraught divisions the war in Gaza has sown within the Democratic Party, even as more Democrats including Mr. Biden have begun to criticize Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's approach to the conflict and urge him to better protect civilians. The legislation would allocate $5 billion to Israel's defense capabilities and $9 billion for 'worldwide humanitarian aid,' including for civilians in Gaza. But it would not place further conditions on how Israel could use American military aid, nor block future arms transfers from the United States as an increasing number of Democrats have sought to do. Democrats who are leading the push against the Israel aid bill said they strongly supported the Jewish state and its right to defend itself, and would vote in favor of sending military aid that supports Israel's defense capabilities, such as by replenishing the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Iron Beam defense systems. They also denounced the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas that prompted the war, and said the hostages taken by Hamas must be released. But they argued that approving more offensive weaponry without conditions was an untenable moral and political position that would amount to an endorsement of Mr. Netanyahu's prosecution of the war, including his intention to invade Rafah over the objections of the Biden administration. More than 33,000 people in Gaza have been killed since the start of the conflict, according to the health ministry there, and the population is facing a hunger crisis. 'I understand the need for defensive weapons for Israel, particularly in light of the attack by Iran,' said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, who ran his first campaign on an antiwar platform and helped lead efforts to end U.S. participation in the war in Yemen. 'But there is no justification to provide bombs and weapons to Netanyahu to continue the war in Gaza that is killing thousands of innocent Palestinian women and children.' Saturday's vote will recall a similar situation from 2007, when the speaker at the time, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, split a piece of spending legislation to allow Democrats to register their opposition to funding the Iraq war while backing a domestic funding bill. Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, similarly divided the foreign aid package to be considered on Saturday in order to get each element across the finish line in the face of distinct coalitions of resistance to different pieces of the bill. In a critical test vote on Friday, the House agreed, 316 to 94, to bring up the package, with 39 Democrats — mostly progressives — joining 55 Republicans in opposition. 'This is a moment for members of Congress who support a safe and secure Israel to send a message that giving Netanyahu more offensive weapons is not a path for peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians,' Representative Becca Balint, Democrat of Vermont and the first Jewish member of Congress to call for a cease-fire, said in an interview. 'To give Netanyahu more offensive weapons at this stage, I believe, is to condone the destruction of Gaza that we've seen in the last six months. And it's also a green light for an invasion of Rafah.' Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat who led the opposition to funding for the Iraq war in 2007, said the conversations among Democrats in Congress opposing continued U.S. backing for the war in Gaza were 'not unlike' those that took place 17 years ago. 'We may well be casting the vote on whether a much wider war takes place, and whether American weapons go that result in the death of thousands of innocent people,' Mr. Doggett said. The Democrats who oppose the aid package for Israel represent a minority of their caucus. But they see a 'no' vote as part of a strategy to pressure Mr. Biden to condition aid and halt future offensive weapons transfers. Through many meetings, text chains and conversations with the administration, they have worked to shift the president's approach to Israel, while underscoring the electoral risks Mr. Biden faces among voters who helped power him to the White House in 2020 and are now furious over his handling of the war. 'The only way to get a course correction is for a sizable number within the Democratic caucus to say it must shift,' Ms. Balint said. Representative Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat who has been pressing Mr. Biden to withhold offensive weapons from Israel, said a big 'no' vote would strengthen the president's hand to do so. 'It helps the administration to have some number of Democrats express ourselves in this way,' he said. Representative Greg Casar, Democrat of Texas, said he hoped a substantial number of Democrats opposing the bill would give the Biden administration greater leverage to influence the Israeli government's approach to the war. 'I hope this vote will show the world that there is a really significant segment of the United States that doesn't want to see expanded and widening wars,' he said.

Ohad Zwigenberg/Associated Press Israeli warplanes fired missiles on Iran during a retaliatory strike early Friday morning, one Western official and two Iranian officials said, suggesting that the attack included more advanced firepower than initial reports indicated. It was not immediately clear the types of missiles used, from where they were fired, whether any were intercepted by Iran's defenses or where they landed. The Western official and the Iranian officials requested anonymity to discuss classified information. Previously, Iranian officials said Friday's attack on a military base in central Iran was conducted by small aerial drones, most likely launched from inside Iranian territory. A separate group of small drones, they said soon after the attack, was shot down in the region of Tabriz, roughly 500 miles north of Isfahan. Israel has not publicly claimed responsibility for Friday's attack and would not comment on the use of planes or missiles. Israel's strike came in response to an Iranian attack last weekend in which Iran fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. A majority of the weapons used in that salvo were fired from Iranian territory and intercepted by Israel and its allies before causing any damage. By contrast, the Iranian officials said, Iran's military did not detect anything entering Iran's airspace on Friday, including drones, missiles and aircraft. Iran's state news agency IRNA reported that no missile attacks occurred and that Iran's air defense system was not activated. Iran's decision to launch its strike primarily from its own soil last week was perceived by Israel as an escalation in the countries' long-simmering shadow war. The Iranians believe the large salvo is helping with deterrence. Throughout the yearslong conflict, the two countries have traded clandestine attacks, including targeted assassinations, cyberattacks and conventional strikes conducted from and within third countries. Iran's attack last week was itself prompted by an Israeli strike on April 1, in which Israeli aircraft killed several Iranian armed forces commanders in Syria. By using drones seemingly launched from inside Iran's territory rather than its own, Israel hinted at a willingness to turn down the temperature on the conflict while also demonstrating an ability to conduct attacks that Iran could not detect. One Iranian official, a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, said that even though the strike did little damage, the likelihood that drones were fired from under Iran's nose sent a message about Israel's capabilities. A guided missile fired from an undetected warplane, even if it landed outside Iranian territory, would most likely deliver a similar threat. Officials from both countries remained largely quiet about Friday's attack, a gesture that appeared aimed at de-escalating a conflict some fear could spiral into a broader regional war. Israel's silence on the attack, an Iranian official said, would allow Tehran to treat the strike as it had comparable previous attacks and not prompt an immediate response. Mahdi Mohammadi, a senior adviser to Iran's Parliament speaker, said that Israel's limited attack on Iran showed that Iran had achieved its goal of deterrence. Israel's refusal to openly claim responsibility, he said, amounts to a victory for Iran. Israel's attack, he said on the messaging app Telegram, was meant to show that it had the 'capability to access Iran but in practice it also showed that it has accepted that it should not repeat its miscalculation.' April 19, 2024, 2:43 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 2:43 p.m. ET The White House maintained public silence about the Israeli strike on Iran. 'I'm not going to speak or speculate about any of the reports that are out there,' Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said at her daily briefing. John Kirby, the national security spokesman who typically speaks on foreign policy issues, did not join the briefing. April 19, 2024, 2:48 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 2:48 p.m. ET Jean-Pierre did repeat the president's standard position urging against widening the war: 'We do not want to see this conflict escalate. We continue to consult with our allies and partners, including in the region, to reduce further risk of escalation in the region.' Credit... Pete Marovich for The New York Times The Israeli military struck a Syrian air defense site in southern Syria with missiles early Friday, causing material damage, though no casualties were reported, according to Syrian state news media. Syria's official news agency, SANA, provided no other details and Israel did not comment on whether it was responsible for the attack, in keeping with its usual practice. The strike happened around the same time that Israel carried out a strike on a military air base near the city of Isfahan, in central Iran. That strike came less than a week after Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel — nearly all of which were shot down — in retaliation for an April 1 attack on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed seven Iranian military officers. Friday's strike in Syria targeted a radar system in the southern province of Dara'a, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain. The Syrian military detected Israeli aircraft entering Syrian airspace, but its air defenses did not try to intercept the strikes, the Observatory said. Iranian-backed armed groups throughout Syria have been on high alert since Iran's strikes on Israel last weekend, the Observatory said. The groups obscured their positions and gave some of their leaders a week of leave. Iran is closely allied with Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia, and with the Syrian government, and both Hezbollah and Iran's Quds Force operate in Syria. For years, Iranian proxies like Hezbollah have launched strikes at northern Israel. Israel has repeatedly targeted Iran and its allies with strikes in Syria, including in Damascus, the capital, and Aleppo. Attacks across Israel's borders with Syria and Lebanon have escalated since the Oct. 7 assault by Hamas on Israel. Since the first of the year, Israel has carried out nearly three dozen attacks in Syria, destroying buildings, military headquarters and weapon and ammunition warehouses, the Observatory said. The strikes have killed 129 fighters and 12 civilians, the group said. April 19, 2024, 1:30 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 1:30 p.m. ET Jordan will not allow its airspace to be violated by either Israel or Iran, Jordan's foreign minister told his Iranian counterpart in a phone call, the official Jordanian news agency, Petra, reported. Jordan lies between the two enemies, and it played a key role in helping shoot down the barrage of missiles and drones Iran fired at Israel on Saturday. A group at the ancient Si-o-Se Pol bridge in Isfahan, Iran, in 2023. Daily life appeared to return to normal in Isfahan on Friday, according to Iranian state news media and a resident who was interviewed, hours after Israel's attack on a nearby military base continued the cycle of strikes and counterstrikes between the two countries. But tensions from the overnight attack reverberated through the city, and some residents described the threat of full-fledged war as crippling — despite analysts' assessment that both nations were trying to avoid further escalation. Mehrdad, 43, an engineer from Isfahan, said the latest retaliation left him and his pregnant wife feeling stressed and unwell. He asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution. 'The future of this country concerns me,' he said. 'I believe nothing good is expected.' Though he said that the city had returned 'back to its normal' and reactions from officials were muted — which he believed was to help make people feel at ease — many residents remain scared after a stressful night of explosions. For the first six months of the war between Israel and Hamas, Iran's involvement in fighting had been limited to its proxies, including the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and the Yemeni Houthi militia. But after Iran's first direct strike on Israel last weekend, Mehrdad said, 'things are coming to the surface.' He hoped that diplomatic mediation would put an end to the threat of war, and he worried that the county's infrastructure would be 'ruined' by further Israeli attacks. 'Our economic situation is awful. We have 50 percent annual inflation,' he said. 'Now guess what would happen if the war materialized. What would happen to our living conditions in this country?' Mahsa, 34, an accountant from Isfahan who also asked that her last name not be used for fear of retribution, described a tense atmosphere of fear and instability. The economy is often the main topic of conversation when people gather, she said, and many are worried about the consequences of a wider war. 'When Iran attacked, we were all worried and we really didn't know what to expect,' she said, describing the cycle of retaliation between Israel and Iran as a 'show game.' 'Of course, after this Israeli attack, the direction of the game will be determined,' she added. 'Either a full-scale war, or the end of this line, or just threats.' The distress is crushing. Mahsa said her mental health had deteriorated, describing an instance last week when she broke down sobbing in the middle of the street for seemingly no reason while on a run. Dreams seem 'more impossible to achieve, day by day,' she said. 'We don't have much mental energy left,' she added.

'It appears we are out of the danger zone and, because Israel's strike was limited, it has allowed both countries to back down for now,' said Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House. April 19, 2024, 11:10 a.m. ET April 19, 2024, 11:10 a.m. ET The few Iranian officials who have talked publicly about the attack have downplayed it, suggesting a bid to de-escalate. A lawmaker, Seyed Nezamedin Mousavi, called the strike \"ridiculous,' saying it showed Israel 'is content with these ineffective actions.' A former foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, dismissed it as \"fireworks.\" Mourners in Tehran carried the coffin of Brig. Gen.

Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times For decades, Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war across the Middle East, trading attacks by land, sea, air and in cyberspace. A recent round of strikes — mainly an aerial barrage by Iran against Israel last weekend — has brought the conflict more clearly into the open and raised fears of a broader war. A retaliatory Israeli strike on an Iranian air base on Friday, however, appeared limited in scope, and analysts said it suggested an effort to pull back from the dangerous cycle and potentially move the war back into the shadows. Here is a recent history of the conflict: August 2019: An Israeli airstrike killed two Iranian-trained militants in Syria, a drone set off a blast near a Hezbollah office in Lebanon and an airstrike in Qaim, Iraq, killed a commander of an Iran-backed Iraqi militia. Israel accused Iran at the time of trying to establish an overland arms-supply line through Iraq and northern Syria to Lebanon, and analysts said the strikes were aimed at stopping Iran and signaling to its proxies that Israel would not tolerate a fleet of smart missiles on its borders. January 2020: Israel greeted with satisfaction the assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of the foreign-facing arm of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, in an American drone strike in Baghdad. Iran hit back by attacking two bases in Iraq that housed American troops with a barrage of missiles, wounding about 100 U.S. military personnel. 2021-22: In July 2021, an oil tanker managed by an Israeli-owned shipping company was attacked off the coast of Oman, killing two crew members, according to the company and three Israeli officials. Two of the officials said that the attack appeared to have been carried out by Iranian drones. Iran did not explicitly claim or deny responsibility, but a state-owned television channel described the episode as a response to an Israeli strike in Syria. In November 2021, Israel killed Iran's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, and followed up with the assassination of a Revolutionary Guards commander, Col. Sayad Khodayee, in May 2022. December 2023: After Israel's bombardment of Gaza began in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led assault, Iranian-backed militias stepped up their own attacks. And late last year, Iran accused Israel of killing a high-level military figure, Brig. Gen. Sayyed Razi Mousavi, in a missile strike in Syria. A senior adviser to the Revolutionary Guards, General Mousavi was described as having been a close associate of General Suleimani and was said to have helped oversee the shipment of arms to Hezbollah. Israel, adopting its customary stance, declined to comment directly on whether it was behind General Mousavi's death. January 2024: An explosion in a suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, killed Saleh al-Arouri, a Hamas leader, along with two commanders from that group's armed wing, the first assassination of a top Hamas official outside the West Bank and Gaza in recent years. Officials from Hamas, Lebanon and the United States ascribed the blast to Israel, which did not publicly confirm involvement. Hezbollah, which receives major support from Iran, stepped up its assaults on Israel after Mr. al-Arouri's death. Israel's military hit back at Hezbollah in Lebanon, killing several of the group's commanders. March: An Israeli drone strike hit a car in southern Lebanon, killing at least one person. Israel's military said it had killed the deputy commander of Hezbollah's rocket and missile unit. Hezbollah acknowledged the death of a man, Ali Abdulhassan Naim, but did not provide further details. The same day, airstrikes killed soldiers near Aleppo, northern Syria, in what appeared to be one of the heaviest Israeli attacks in the country in years. The strikes killed 36 Syrian soldiers, seven Hezbollah fighters and a Syrian from a pro-Iran militia, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group that tracks Syria's civil war. Israel's military did not claim responsibility. But the country's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, wrote on social media, 'We will pursue Hezbollah every place it operates and we will expand the pressure and the pace of the attacks.' April: A strike on an Iranian Embassy building in Damascus on April 1 killed three top Iranian commanders and four officers. Iran blamed Israel and vowed to hit back forcefully. Two weeks later, Tehran launched a barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel, an unexpectedly large-scale attack, although nearly all the weapons were shot down by Israel and allies. Israel said for days it would respond, before a strike on Friday hit a military air base near the central Iranian city of Isfahan.

Planet Labs PBC Iranian officials said that the Israeli strike on Friday morning was carried out by small exploding drones, a tactic that would follow a well-established pattern in Israeli attacks on Iranian military targets. As Israel has targeted Iranian defense and military officials and infrastructure, small drones — specifically ones known as quadcopters — have been a signature of those operations. Quadcopter drones, so named because they have four rotors, have a short flight range and can explode on impact. The drones might have been launched from inside Iran, whose radar systems had not detected unidentified aircraft entering Iranian airspace, Iranian officials said. If the drones were launched within the country, it demonstrates once again Israel's ability to mount clandestine operations in Iranian territory. Israel's military has not commented on Friday's strike. Though it rarely claims responsibility publicly for attacks against Iranian targets, several attacks in recent years have used drones: August 2019: Israel sent an exploding drone into the heart of a Hezbollah-dominated neighborhood in Beirut, Lebanon, to destroy what Israeli officials described as machinery used in the production of precision missiles.\nJune 2021: A quadcopter exploded outside Tehran at one of Iran's main manufacturing centers for centrifuges, which purify uranium and are used at the country's two major uranium enrichment facilities. Western officials have closely watched activity at those facilities for signs that Iran could be moving toward producing a nuclear weapon. Iran claimed that there had been no damage to the site outside Tehran, but satellite images showed evidence of significant damage.\nFebruary 2022: Six quadcopters exploded at Kermanshah, Iran's main manufacturing and storage plant for military drones.\nMay 2022: A strike targeted the highly sensitive Parchin military site outside Tehran, where Iran develops missile, nuclear and drone technology. Quadcopter drones exploded into a building, killing an engineer and injuring another person, Iranians with knowledge of the attack said at the time.\nJanuary 2023: A drone attack on an Iranian military facility in January 2023 caused a large explosion in the center of Isfahan, the city near the air base that was struck on Friday. At the time, Iran made no effort to hide the fact that an attack had happened, but said it had done little damage. Iranian state media reported that drones had targeted an ammunition manufacturing plant but had been shot down by a surface-to-air defense system. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken at a news conference in Capri, Italy, on Friday. Credit... Gregorio Borgia/Associated Press Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Friday that the United States 'has not been involved in any offensive operations' in Iran when asked about Israel's strike on the country on Friday, but he declined to comment further. Mr. Blinken spoke on the last day of a meeting of Group of 7 ministers in Capri, Italy, where the agenda was dominated by the conflict in the Middle East, including the exchanges of strikes in the past week between Israel and Iran. In remarks to reporters before departing the island, Mr. Blinken said the G7 was unified in urging de-escalation between Iran and Israel to avoid a wider war. But Mr. Blinken would not even directly confirm the Israeli strike, which appeared to be the country's first military response to Iran's attack last weekend, referring instead to 'reported events,' and he would not say whether the United States had been notified in advance of the Israeli action. Shortly before he spoke, Italy's foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, told reporters that the United States had been 'informed at the last minute' of the Israeli strike. 'But there was no involvement on the part of the United States,' Mr. Tajani said. 'It was simply information which was provided,' adding that he believed the G7's collective efforts deserved credit for 'the small scale of the event.' Mr. Tajani did not say how he knew the United States had not been notified in advance, but he had recently come from a meeting with Mr. Blinken and other G7 ministers. A senior American official said on Friday that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before its attack on Iran. The G7 weighed in collectively in a statement concluding the three-day meeting, urging countries to prevent further escalation 'in light of reports of strikes' on Friday. The G7 includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and the European Union. The statement also said that the member nations 'condemn in the strongest terms Iran's direct and unprecedented attack' on Israel. 'Israel and its people have our full solidarity and support and we reaffirm our commitment toward Israel's security,' it added. The G7 also issued a new warning to Tehran, demanding that 'Iran and its affiliated groups cease their attacks' throughout the Middle East and saying that 'we stand ready to adopt further sanctions or take other measures.' Mr. Blinken said of Iran that 'degrading its missile and drone capabilities' was a key G7 goal. Mr. Blinken also addressed the ongoing conflict in Gaza, pointing a finger at Hamas for the failure so far to reach a cease-fire deal that would include the release of Israeli prisoners. 'The only thing standing behind the Gaza people and a cease-fire is Hamas,' he said. But he also addressed a major friction point with Israel, warning against what Israel says is its planned attack on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have sought shelter from fighting elsewhere in the enclave. Israel has said an invasion of Rafah is necessary to eliminate Hamas battalions in the city. 'We cannot support a major military operation in Rafah,' Mr. Blinken said. Mr. Blinken said that protecting and caring for civilians amid such an operation was 'a monumental task for which we have yet to see a plan.' Asked about the U.S. veto on Thursday of a United Nations Security Council resolution to recognize a Palestinian state, Mr. Blinken said that while the United States supports the creation of such a state, doing so requires negotiations and that the proposed resolution 'will have no effect on actually moving things forward and achieving a Palestinian state.' He added: 'You can put something down on a piece of paper and wave it around. It has no effect. What does and can have an effect is actual diplomacy.' Mr. Blinken also noted that, under U.S. law passed by Congress, U.N. acceptance of a Palestinian member state would require 'cutting off all of our funding for the United Nations.'

Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times World leaders on Friday urged Israel and Iran to de-escalate tensions after Israel struck an Iranian military base, the latest salvo in a cycle of retaliation that has raised fears of a broader war in recent weeks. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain, whose military participated in defending Israel last weekend against Iran's missile and drone attack, told reporters, 'Significant escalation is not in anyone's interests — what we want to see is calm heads prevail across the region.' Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, told reporters during a visit to China, 'It is absolutely essential that the region remains stable and that all sides refrain from further action.' Italy's foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said the Group of 7 nations — which includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States — had changed the agenda of its meeting Friday on the resort island of Capri to 'address the Iran issue and put priority attention on the Middle East.' 'The political goal of the G7 is de-escalation,' Mr. Tajani said. The government of Jordan, which has been criticized in the Arab world for playing a role in intercepting Iran's attack last weekend, issued an especially pointed plea. 'Israeli-Iranian retaliations must end,' Ayman Safadi, Jordan's foreign minister said on Friday. He urged the international community to turn its attention back to Gaza, where six months of Israel's bombardment and ground invasion have killed over 33,000 people and led to extreme hunger in parts of the territory. 'The inhumane war on Gaza must end now,' Mr. Safadi said. 'The focus of the world must remain on ending the catastrophic aggression on Gaza.' A senior American official said on Friday that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before its attack against Iran. Israel gave the administration an alert moments before its warplanes struck the Iranian embassy complex in Damascus on April 1, but the official said the latest attack was expected given all the warnings Israel had issued during the week. 'We were not surprised,' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters. Publicly, Biden administration officials were tight-lipped about Friday's strike, refusing to comment at all about it. Administration officials were keeping quiet to avoid getting the United States pulled into the conflict between Iran and Israel, the official said. Speaking to reporters in Capri, Italy, at a meeting of foreign ministers from Group of 7 nations, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken declined to address the strike, saying only that 'the United States was not involved in any offensive operations.' He added that the G7 was urging all parties to de-escalate. Antonio Tajani, Italy's foreign minister, told reporters in Capri that the United States had been 'informed at the last minute' of the Israeli strike. Michael Crowley contributed reporting from Capri, Italy.  © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe Israeli military struck Iran early on Friday, according to two Israeli and three Iranian officials, in what appeared to be Israel's first military response to Iran's attack last weekend but one whose scope, at least initially, appeared to be limited.\nThe Iranian officials said that a strike had hit a military air base near the city of Isfahan, in central Iran. Initial reaction in both Israel and Iran was muted, which analysts said was a sign that the rivals were seeking to lower the temperature of their conflict. World leaders, who for nearly a week have urged Israel and Iran to avoid starting a broader war in the region, called for both sides to de-escalate tensions on Friday.\nThe Israeli military declined to comment on the strike. A senior U.S. official said that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before the attack. All the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\nThe explosions came less than a week after Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel — nearly all of which were shot down — in response to an April 1 strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed seven Iranian officials. That attack brought the decades-long shadow war between Israel and Iran — waged on land, at sea, in air and in cyberspace — more clearly into the open.\nA Western official and two Iranian officials said that Israel used both missiles fired from warplanes and drones in the strike, suggesting that the attack included more advanced firepower than initial reports indicated. Iranian officials initially told The New York Times that the attack had been carried out only by small drones, possibly launched from inside Iran, and that radar systems had not detected unidentified aircraft entering Iranian airspace. They said that a separate group of small drones was shot down in the region of Tabriz, roughly 500 miles north of Isfahan.\nIn public, Iranian officials sought to downplay the strike. Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi, the commander in chief of Iran's army, said explosions heard early Friday in Isfahan 'were from our air defense firing at a suspicious object,' and that there had been 'no damage.' Iranian news agencies appeared keen to show that things were 'back to normal' in the city.\nPresident Ebrahim Raisi of Iran had warned that 'the tiniest act of aggression' on his country's soil would draw a response. But in the hours after Israel's strike, there have been no public calls for retribution by Iranian officials. One lawmaker, Seyed Nezamedin Mousavi, called the strike 'ridiculous,' saying it showed Israel 'is content with these ineffective actions.'\nIsfahan is one of Iran's most famous and historic cities. The area also hosts a number of Iranian military sites. Iranian media reported that nuclear facilities in Isfahan had not been hit.\nIsraeli leaders came close to ordering widespread strikes in Iran on the night Iran attacked, officials said, but the war cabinet postponed a decision. Mr. Biden and other world leaders urged Israel for days not to retaliate in a way that would inflame a wider Middle East war while it fights Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both allies of Iran.\nApril 19, 2024, 8:07 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 8:07 p.m. ET Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, who is in New York attending U.N. meetings, told Iran's state news agency that the small quadcopter targeting a military base in Isfahan did not have casualties or damage. 'Israel is determined to portray its defeat as a victory,' Mr. Amir Abdollahian said, the most senior official to comment on the attacks and draw a link to Israel publicly.\nCredit... Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The Israeli attack on an Iranian air base in Isfahan hit a crucial part of an air defense system, a New York Times analysis of satellite imagery found.\nImages showed that the precision attack at the 8th Shekari Air Base damaged or destroyed the 'flap-lid' radar, which is used in S-300 air defense systems to track incoming targets.\nThe Times used several satellite images in its analysis; the location of the damaged area was first pointed out on the social media platform X by Aurora Intel, and the findings have also been confirmed by a former U.S. government imagery analyst, Chris Biggers.\nThe radar is typically surrounded by several vehicles, including four trucks carrying missiles. Before the strike, the missiles were seen positioned next to the radar. After the strike, they had been moved and did not appear visibly damaged. It was not clear why the missiles had been moved. However, the fact that they appear undamaged indicated that the attack had a very precise target, according to Mr. Biggers.\nAn air defense system at the air base in Isfahan in October 2021.

Maxar Technologies, via Google Earth Other areas of the air base and adjacent airport also appeared to be undamaged. The precision of the strike, deep within Iran and with several sensitive sites close by, suggested Israel chose the specific and narrow target, the air defense system.\nAccording to the Missile Defense Project of the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, Iran has acquired Russian-made S-300 air defense systems to deter Israeli and other airstrikes.\nSome Democrats are fine sending defensive weapons to Israel, but want to see some limits on offensive weapons, which could be used against civilians in Gaza. Credit... -/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images A group of left-leaning House Democrats is urging its colleagues to oppose the $26 billion aid package for Israel, hoping to maximize the number of 'no' votes from the party and send a warning to President Biden about the depth of his political coalition's discontent over his support for Israel's tactics in Gaza.\nFraming the upcoming vote as a make-or-break moral choice akin to Congress's votes to authorize and fund the Iraq war, progressive leaders in the House are working to muster a sizable bloc of Democratic opposition to the aid measure, which is expected to pass on Saturday and become law in the coming days.\n'In the wake of those votes, people came around much, much later and said, ‘We shouldn't have allowed that to go forward,'' Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington and the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said of the decades-ago debate over Iraq. 'And I think that this is that moment.'\nRepresentative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, called it a 'defining vote,' adding, 'We're either going to participate in the carnage, or we're not.'\nThere is little doubt that the bill, which would send roughly $13 billion in military assistance to Israel as it continues its offensive in Gaza, will pass the House, along with money for Ukraine, Taiwan and other American allies.\nBut progressive Democrats estimated that 40 to 60 members of their party may oppose it on the House floor on Saturday. That would be a striking signal from Congress, where ironclad bipartisan backing for Israel has long been the norm. And it would highlight the fraught divisions the war in Gaza has sown within the Democratic Party, even as more Democrats including Mr. Biden have begun to criticize Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's approach to the conflict and urge him to better protect civilians.\nThe legislation would allocate $5 billion to Israel's defense capabilities and $9 billion for 'worldwide humanitarian aid,' including for civilians in Gaza. But it would not place further conditions on how Israel could use American military aid, nor block future arms transfers from the United States as an increasing number of Democrats have sought to do.\nDemocrats who are leading the push against the Israel aid bill said they strongly supported the Jewish state and its right to defend itself, and would vote in favor of sending military aid that supports Israel's defense capabilities, such as by replenishing the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Iron Beam defense systems. They also denounced the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas that prompted the war, and said the hostages taken by Hamas must be released.\nBut they argued that approving more offensive weaponry without conditions was an untenable moral and political position that would amount to an endorsement of Mr. Netanyahu's prosecution of the war, including his intention to invade Rafah over the objections of the Biden administration. More than 33,000 people in Gaza have been killed since the start of the conflict, according to the health ministry there, and the population is facing a hunger crisis.\n'I understand the need for defensive weapons for Israel, particularly in light of the attack by Iran,' said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, who ran his first campaign on an antiwar platform and helped lead efforts to end U.S. participation in the war in Yemen. 'But there is no justification to provide bombs and weapons to Netanyahu to continue the war in Gaza that is killing thousands of innocent Palestinian women and children.'\nSaturday's vote will recall a similar situation from 2007, when the speaker at the time, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, split a piece of spending legislation to allow Democrats to register their opposition to funding the Iraq war while backing a domestic funding bill. Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, similarly divided the foreign aid package to be considered on Saturday in order to get each element across the finish line in the face of distinct coalitions of resistance to different pieces of the bill.\nIn a critical test vote on Friday, the House agreed, 316 to 94, to bring up the package, with 39 Democrats — mostly progressives — joining 55 Republicans in opposition.\n'This is a moment for members of Congress who support a safe and secure Israel to send a message that giving Netanyahu more offensive weapons is not a path for peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians,' Representative Becca Balint, Democrat of Vermont and the first Jewish member of Congress to call for a cease-fire, said in an interview. 'To give Netanyahu more offensive weapons at this stage, I believe, is to condone the destruction of Gaza that we've seen in the last six months. And it's also a green light for an invasion of Rafah.'\nRepresentative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat who led the opposition to funding for the Iraq war in 2007, said the conversations among Democrats in Congress opposing continued U.S. backing for the war in Gaza were 'not unlike' those that took place 17 years ago.\n'We may well be casting the vote on whether a much wider war takes place, and whether American weapons go that result in the death of thousands of innocent people,' Mr. Doggett said.\nThe Democrats who oppose the aid package for Israel represent a minority of their caucus. But they see a 'no' vote as part of a strategy to pressure Mr. Biden to condition aid and halt future offensive weapons transfers. Through many meetings, text chains and conversations with the administration, they have worked to shift the president's approach to Israel, while underscoring the electoral risks Mr. Biden faces among voters who helped power him to the White House in 2020 and are now furious over his handling of the war.\n'The only way to get a course correction is for a sizable number within the Democratic caucus to say it must shift,' Ms. Balint said.\nRepresentative Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat who has been pressing Mr. Biden to withhold offensive weapons from Israel, said a big 'no' vote would strengthen the president's hand to do so.\n'It helps the administration to have some number of Democrats express ourselves in this way,' he said.\nRepresentative Greg Casar, Democrat of Texas, said he hoped a substantial number of Democrats opposing the bill would give the Biden administration greater leverage to influence the Israeli government's approach to the war.\n'I hope this vote will show the world that there is a really significant segment of the United States that doesn't want to see expanded and widening wars,' he said.\nAn Israeli air force F-15 warplane landing at an air base in central Israel on Monday.

Ohad Zwigenberg/Associated Press Israeli warplanes fired missiles on Iran during a retaliatory strike early Friday morning, one Western official and two Iranian officials said, suggesting that the attack included more advanced firepower than initial reports indicated.\nIt was not immediately clear the types of missiles used, from where they were fired, whether any were intercepted by Iran's defenses or where they landed.\nThe Western official and the Iranian officials requested anonymity to discuss classified information.\nPreviously, Iranian officials said Friday's attack on a military base in central Iran was conducted by small aerial drones, most likely launched from inside Iranian territory. A separate group of small drones, they said soon after the attack, was shot down in the region of Tabriz, roughly 500 miles north of Isfahan.\nIsrael has not publicly claimed responsibility for Friday's attack and would not comment on the use of planes or missiles.\nIsrael's strike came in response to an Iranian attack last weekend in which Iran fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. A majority of the weapons used in that salvo were fired from Iranian territory and intercepted by Israel and its allies before causing any damage.\nBy contrast, the Iranian officials said, Iran's military did not detect anything entering Iran's airspace on Friday, including drones, missiles and aircraft. Iran's state news agency IRNA reported that no missile attacks occurred and that Iran's air defense system was not activated.\nIran's decision to launch its strike primarily from its own soil last week was perceived by Israel as an escalation in the countries' long-simmering shadow war. The Iranians believe the large salvo is helping with deterrence. Throughout the yearslong conflict, the two countries have traded clandestine attacks, including targeted assassinations, cyberattacks and conventional strikes conducted from and within third countries.\nIran's attack last week was itself prompted by an Israeli strike on April 1, in which Israeli aircraft killed several Iranian armed forces commanders in Syria.\nBy using drones seemingly launched from inside Iran's territory rather than its own, Israel hinted at a willingness to turn down the temperature on the conflict while also demonstrating an ability to conduct attacks that Iran could not detect.\nOne Iranian official, a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, said that even though the strike did little damage, the likelihood that drones were fired from under Iran's nose sent a message about Israel's capabilities.\nA guided missile fired from an undetected warplane, even if it landed outside Iranian territory, would most likely deliver a similar threat.\nOfficials from both countries remained largely quiet about Friday's attack, a gesture that appeared aimed at de-escalating a conflict some fear could spiral into a broader regional war. Israel's silence on the attack, an Iranian official said, would allow Tehran to treat the strike as it had comparable previous attacks and not prompt an immediate response.\nMahdi Mohammadi, a senior adviser to Iran's Parliament speaker, said that Israel's limited attack on Iran showed that Iran had achieved its goal of deterrence. Israel's refusal to openly claim responsibility, he said, amounts to a victory for Iran.\nIsrael's attack, he said on the messaging app Telegram, was meant to show that it had the 'capability to access Iran but in practice it also showed that it has accepted that it should not repeat its miscalculation.'\nApril 19, 2024, 2:43 p.m. ET April 19, 2024, 2:43 p.m. ET The White House maintained public silence about the Israeli strike on Iran. 'I'm not going to speak or speculate about any of the reports that are out there,' Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said at her daily briefing.

But after Iran's first direct strike on Israel last weekend, Mehrdad said, 'things are coming to the surface.'\nHe hoped that diplomatic mediation would put an end to the threat of war, and he worried that the county's infrastructure would be 'ruined' by further Israeli attacks.\n'Our economic situation is awful.

A recent round of strikes — mainly an aerial barrage by Iran against Israel last weekend — has brought the conflict more clearly into the open and raised fears of a broader war.\nA retaliatory Israeli strike on an Iranian air base on Friday, however, appeared limited in scope, and analysts said it suggested an effort to pull back from the dangerous cycle and potentially move the war back into the shadows.\nHere is a recent history of the conflict:\nAugust 2019: An Israeli airstrike killed two Iranian-trained militants in Syria, a drone set off a blast near a Hezbollah office in Lebanon and an airstrike in Qaim, Iraq, killed a commander of an Iran-backed Iraqi militia. Israel accused Iran at the time of trying to establish an overland arms-supply line through Iraq and northern Syria to Lebanon, and analysts said the strikes were aimed at stopping Iran and signaling to its proxies that Israel would not tolerate a fleet of smart missiles on its borders.\nAugust 2019: An Israeli airstrike killed two Iranian-trained militants in Syria, a drone set off a blast near a Hezbollah office in Lebanon and an airstrike in Qaim, Iraq, killed a commander of an Iran-backed Iraqi militia.

Iran hit back by attacking two bases in Iraq that housed American troops with a barrage of missiles, wounding about 100 U.S. military personnel.\n2021-22: In July 2021, an oil tanker managed by an Israeli-owned shipping company was attacked off the coast of Oman, killing two crew members, according to the company and three Israeli officials.

Iran did not explicitly claim or deny responsibility, but a state-owned television channel described the episode as a response to an Israeli strike in Syria.\nIn November 2021, Israel killed Iran's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, and followed up with the assassination of a Revolutionary Guards commander, Col. Sayad Khodayee, in May 2022.\nDecember 2023: After Israel's bombardment of Gaza began in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led assault, Iranian-backed militias stepped up their own attacks. And late last year, Iran accused Israel of killing a high-level military figure, Brig. Gen. Sayyed Razi Mousavi, in a missile strike in Syria.\nDecember 2023: After Israel's bombardment of Gaza began in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led assault, Iranian-backed militias stepped up their own attacks. And late last year, Iran accused Israel of killing a high-level military figure, Brig. Gen. Sayyed Razi Mousavi, in a missile strike in Syria. A senior adviser to the Revolutionary Guards, General Mousavi was described as having been a close associate of General Suleimani and was said to have helped oversee the shipment of arms to Hezbollah. Israel, adopting its customary stance, declined to comment directly on whether it was behind General Mousavi's death.\nJanuary 2024: An explosion in a suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, killed Saleh al-Arouri, a Hamas leader, along with two commanders from that group's armed wing, the first assassination of a top Hamas official outside the West Bank and Gaza in recent years. Officials from Hamas, Lebanon and the United States ascribed the blast to Israel, which did not publicly confirm involvement.\nJanuary 2024: An explosion in a suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, killed Saleh al-Arouri, a Hamas leader, along with two commanders from that group's armed wing, the first assassination of a top Hamas official outside the West Bank and Gaza in recent years. Officials from Hamas, Lebanon and the United States ascribed the blast to Israel, which did not publicly confirm involvement. Hezbollah, which receives major support from Iran, stepped up its assaults on Israel after Mr. al-Arouri's death. Israel's military hit back at Hezbollah in Lebanon, killing several of the group's commanders.\nMarch: An Israeli drone strike hit a car in southern Lebanon, killing at least one person. Israel's military said it had killed the deputy commander of Hezbollah's rocket and missile unit. Hezbollah acknowledged the death of a man, Ali Abdulhassan Naim, but did not provide further details.\nMarch: An Israeli drone strike hit a car in southern Lebanon, killing at least one person.

The same day, airstrikes killed soldiers near Aleppo, northern Syria, in what appeared to be one of the heaviest Israeli attacks in the country in years. The strikes killed 36 Syrian soldiers, seven Hezbollah fighters and a Syrian from a pro-Iran militia, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group that tracks Syria's civil war.\nIsrael's military did not claim responsibility. But the country's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, wrote on social media, 'We will pursue Hezbollah every place it operates and we will expand the pressure and the pace of the attacks.'\nApril: A strike on an Iranian Embassy building in Damascus on April 1 killed three top Iranian commanders and four officers. Iran blamed Israel and vowed to hit back forcefully.\nApril: A strike on an Iranian Embassy building in Damascus on April 1 killed three top Iranian commanders and four officers. Iran blamed Israel and vowed to hit back forcefully. Two weeks later, Tehran launched a barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel, an unexpectedly large-scale attack, although nearly all the weapons were shot down by Israel and allies. Israel said for days it would respond, before a strike on Friday hit a military air base near the central Iranian city of Isfahan.\nThis satellite image from Planet Labs PBC shows damage on the roof of an Iranian military workshop, center, after a drone attack in Isfahan, Iran, on Feb. 2. Credit... Planet Labs PBC Iranian officials said that the Israeli strike on Friday morning was carried out by small exploding drones, a tactic that would follow a well-established pattern in Israeli attacks on Iranian military targets.\nAs Israel has targeted Iranian defense and military officials and infrastructure, small drones — specifically ones known as quadcopters — have been a signature of those operations. Quadcopter drones, so named because they have four rotors, have a short flight range and can explode on impact.\nThe drones might have been launched from inside Iran, whose radar systems had not detected unidentified aircraft entering Iranian airspace, Iranian officials said. If the drones were launched within the country, it demonstrates once again Israel's ability to mount clandestine operations in Iranian territory.\nIsrael's military has not commented on Friday's strike. Though it rarely claims responsibility publicly for attacks against Iranian targets, several attacks in recent years have used drones:\nAugust 2019: Israel sent an exploding drone into the heart of a Hezbollah-dominated neighborhood in Beirut, Lebanon, to destroy what Israeli officials described as machinery used in the production of precision missiles.\nJune 2021: A quadcopter exploded outside Tehran at one of Iran's main manufacturing centers for centrifuges, which purify uranium and are used at the country's two major uranium enrichment facilities. Western officials have closely watched activity at those facilities for signs that Iran could be moving toward producing a nuclear weapon. Iran claimed that there had been no damage to the site outside Tehran, but satellite images showed evidence of significant damage.\nFebruary 2022: Six quadcopters exploded at Kermanshah, Iran's main manufacturing and storage plant for military drones.\nMay 2022: A strike targeted the highly sensitive Parchin military site outside Tehran, where Iran develops missile, nuclear and drone technology. Quadcopter drones exploded into a building, killing an engineer and injuring another person, Iranians with knowledge of the attack said at the time.\nJanuary 2023: A drone attack on an Iranian military facility in January 2023 caused a large explosion in the center of Isfahan, the city near the air base that was struck on Friday. At the time, Iran made no effort to hide the fact that an attack had happened, but said it had done little damage. Iranian state media reported that drones had targeted an ammunition manufacturing plant but had been shot down by a surface-to-air defense system.\nJanuary 2023: A drone attack on an Iranian military facility in January 2023 caused a large explosion in the center of Isfahan, the city near the air base that was struck on Friday.

Blinken at a news conference in Capri, Italy, on Friday. Credit... Gregorio Borgia/Associated Press Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Friday that the United States 'has not been involved in any offensive operations' in Iran when asked about Israel's strike on the country on Friday, but he declined to comment further.\nMr. Blinken spoke on the last day of a meeting of Group of 7 ministers in Capri, Italy, where the agenda was dominated by the conflict in the Middle East, including the exchanges of strikes in the past week between Israel and Iran. In remarks to reporters before departing the island, Mr. Blinken said the G7 was unified in urging de-escalation between Iran and Israel to avoid a wider war.\nBut Mr. Blinken would not even directly confirm the Israeli strike, which appeared to be the country's first military response to Iran's attack last weekend, referring instead to 'reported events,' and he would not say whether the United States had been notified in advance of the Israeli action. Shortly before he spoke, Italy's foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, told reporters that the United States had been 'informed at the last minute' of the Israeli strike.\n'But there was no involvement on the part of the United States,' Mr. Tajani said. 'It was simply information which was provided,' adding that he believed the G7's collective efforts deserved credit for 'the small scale of the event.'\nMr. Tajani did not say how he knew the United States had not been notified in advance, but he had recently come from a meeting with Mr. Blinken and other G7 ministers. A senior American official said on Friday that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before its attack on Iran.\nThe G7 weighed in collectively in a statement concluding the three-day meeting, urging countries to prevent further escalation 'in light of reports of strikes' on Friday. The G7 includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and the European Union.\nThe statement also said that the member nations 'condemn in the strongest terms Iran's direct and unprecedented attack' on Israel.\n'Israel and its people have our full solidarity and support and we reaffirm our commitment toward Israel's security,' it added.\nThe G7 also issued a new warning to Tehran, demanding that 'Iran and its affiliated groups cease their attacks' throughout the Middle East and saying that 'we stand ready to adopt further sanctions or take other measures.'\nMr. Blinken said of Iran that 'degrading its missile and drone capabilities' was a key G7 goal.\nMr. Blinken also addressed the ongoing conflict in Gaza, pointing a finger at Hamas for the failure so far to reach a cease-fire deal that would include the release of Israeli prisoners.\n'The only thing standing behind the Gaza people and a cease-fire is Hamas,' he said.\nBut he also addressed a major friction point with Israel, warning against what Israel says is its planned attack on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have sought shelter from fighting elsewhere in the enclave. Israel has said an invasion of Rafah is necessary to eliminate Hamas battalions in the city.\n'We cannot support a major military operation in Rafah,' Mr. Blinken said. Mr. Blinken said that protecting and caring for civilians amid such an operation was 'a monumental task for which we have yet to see a plan.'\nAsked about the U.S. veto on Thursday of a United Nations Security Council resolution to recognize a Palestinian state, Mr. Blinken said that while the United States supports the creation of such a state, doing so requires negotiations and that the proposed resolution 'will have no effect on actually moving things forward and achieving a Palestinian state.'\nHe added: 'You can put something down on a piece of paper and wave it around. It has no effect. What does and can have an effect is actual diplomacy.'\nMr. Blinken also noted that, under U.S. law passed by Congress, U.N. acceptance of a Palestinian member state would require 'cutting off all of our funding for the United Nations.'\nApril 19, 2024, 9:49 a.m. ET April 19, 2024, 9:49 a.m. ET Cassandra Vinograd\nCassandra Vinograd Reporting from Jerusalem The Iranian news media appear keen to show that things are 'back to normal' in Isfahan. The official news agency, IRNA, published a gallery of photos — people strolling, shoppers at a market, a child with a soccer ball — that it said showed 'normal life' in the city today. Flights at the Isfahan airport, which had been suspended for a few hours, have resumed, it said.\nApril 19, 2024, 9:39 a.m. ET April 19, 2024, 9:39 a.m. ET S&P Global Ratings downgraded Israel's credit rating on Thursday evening, citing the confrontation with Iran. It lowered Israel's rating to A+ from AA-. That's still a high rating on a scale that runs from triple-A down to D.\nApril 19, 2024, 9:19 a.m. ET April 19, 2024, 9:19 a.m. ET Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi, the commander in chief of Iran's army, said explosions heard early Friday in Isfahan 'were from our air defense firing at a suspicious object. There has been no damage from the incident.' He said that experts were investigating the episode.\nAn anti-Israeli gathering after Friday Prayer in Tehran. Credit... Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times World leaders on Friday urged Israel and Iran to de-escalate tensions after Israel struck an Iranian military base, the latest salvo in a cycle of retaliation that has raised fears of a broader war in recent weeks.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain, whose military participated in defending Israel last weekend against Iran's missile and drone attack, told reporters, 'Significant escalation is not in anyone's interests — what we want to see is calm heads prevail across the region.'\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, told reporters during a visit to China, 'It is absolutely essential that the region remains stable and that all sides refrain from further action.'\nItaly's foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said the Group of 7 nations — which includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States — had changed the agenda of its meeting Friday on the resort island of Capri to 'address the Iran issue and put priority attention on the Middle East.'\n'The political goal of the G7 is de-escalation,' Mr. Tajani said.\nThe government of Jordan, which has been criticized in the Arab world for playing a role in intercepting Iran's attack last weekend, issued an especially pointed plea.\n'Israeli-Iranian retaliations must end,' Ayman Safadi, Jordan's foreign minister said on Friday. He urged the international community to turn its attention back to Gaza, where six months of Israel's bombardment and ground invasion have killed over 33,000 people and led to extreme hunger in parts of the territory.\n'The inhumane war on Gaza must end now,' Mr. Safadi said. 'The focus of the world must remain on ending the catastrophic aggression on Gaza.'\nA senior American official said on Friday that Israel had notified the United States through multiple channels shortly before its attack against Iran.\nIsrael gave the administration an alert moments before its warplanes struck the Iranian embassy complex in Damascus on April 1, but the official said the latest attack was expected given all the warnings Israel had issued during the week.\n'We were not surprised,' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters.\nPublicly, Biden administration officials were tight-lipped about Friday's strike, refusing to comment at all about it. Administration officials were keeping quiet to avoid getting the United States pulled into the conflict between Iran and Israel, the official said.\nSpeaking to reporters in Capri, Italy, at a meeting of foreign ministers from Group of 7 nations, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken declined to address the strike, saying only that 'the United States was not involved in any offensive operations.' He added that the G7 was urging all parties to de-escalate.\nAntonio Tajani, Italy's foreign minister, told reporters in Capri that the United States had been 'informed at the last minute' of the Israeli strike.\nMichael Crowley contributed reporting from Capri, Italy.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",

            "excerpt": "After months of delay at the hands of a bloc of ultraconservative Republicans, the package drew overwhelming bipartisan support, reflecting broad consensus.",
            "summary": "The House voted resoundingly on Saturday to approve $95 billion in foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, as Speaker Mike Johnson put his job on the line to advance the long-stalled aid package by marshaling support from mainstream Republicans and Democrats.\nIn four back-to-back votes, overwhelming bipartisan coalitions of lawmakers approved fresh rounds of funding for the three U.S. allies, as well as another bill meant to sweeten the deal for conservatives that could result in a nationwide ban of TikTok.\nThe scene on the House floor reflected both the broad support in Congress for continuing to help the Ukrainian military beat back Russia, and the extraordinary political risk taken by Mr. Johnson to defy the anti-interventionist wing of his party who had sought to thwart the measure. Minutes before the vote on assistance for Kyiv, Democrats began to wave small Ukrainian flags on the House floor, as hard-right Republicans jeered.\nThe legislation includes $60 billion for Kyiv; $26 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza; and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific region. It would direct the president to seek repayment from the Ukrainian government of $10 billion in economic assistance, a concept supported by former President Donald J. Trump, who had pushed for any aid to Kyiv to be in the form of a loan. But it also would allow the president to forgive those loans starting in 2026.\nIt also contained a measure to help pave the way to selling off frozen Russian sovereign assets to help fund the Ukrainian war effort, and a new round of sanctions on Iran. The Senate is expected to pass the legislation as early as Tuesday and send it to President Biden's desk, capping its tortured journey through Congress.\n'Our adversaries are working together to undermine our Western values and demean our democracy,' Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said Saturday as the House debated the measure. 'We cannot be afraid at this moment. We have to do what's right. Evil is on the march. History is calling and now is the time to act.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Ellen Ash Peters, a legal trailblazer who was the first woman on the faculty of Yale Law School and the first female chief justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court, and who wrote a landmark civil rights decision in 1996 desegregating public schools in Hartford, died on Wednesday at her home in West Hartford. She was 94.\nHer death was confirmed by her son James Peters.\nJustice Peters was a law-school professor until she was 48. She graduated first in her Yale Law School class in 1954 and, after clerking for a federal judge, returned to Yale as an assistant professor in 1956. She was made a full professor eight years later. In 1978, she was appointed an associate justice on Connecticut's highest court.\n'I think a fair number of my colleagues expected me to teach for a few years and then disappear and have babies,' she told The New York Times that year. 'I'm not sure when I knew that was nonsense.'\nBoth her father and a grandfather had been lawyers in Germany, and after her parents fled with their family to New York in 1939 to escape Nazi persecution, her father encouraged her pursuit of the law. It was an era when very few women were lawyers, but, she said in 1978, it 'never occurred to me to be anything else.'\nJustice Peters's field was contract and commercial law, about which she wrote articles and a textbook. But when Gov. Ella T. Grasso of Connecticut, a Democrat, bypassed judges in the state court system to name her to the highest court, it caused a stir because she had no trial experience. She said she would take a crash course in criminal procedure from a Yale Law School colleague.\nShe quickly got up to speed. Six years later, when Gov. William A. O'Neill, also a Democrat, nominated her for chief justice, the justice she would replace, John A. Speziale, said, 'Her crisp, clear, concise, but also erudite opinions have already made an indelible mark on this court.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Tuesday announced a new partnership with more than a dozen state attorneys general to investigate consumer complaints against airlines.\nThe partnership sets up a process for state attorney general's offices to review complaints from travelers and then pass the baton to the federal Transportation Department, which could take enforcement action against airlines.\n'The support that's being offered by state attorney general's offices means that our capacity to protect airline passengers is expanding,' Mr. Buttigieg said at Denver International Airport, where he appeared with Colorado's attorney general, Phil Weiser, a Democrat who is among those joining the partnership.\nThe federal-state initiative is Mr. Buttigieg's latest step aimed at improving protections for air travelers and ensuring that airlines are held accountable when they err. The Transportation Department has issued more than $164 million in penalties against airlines during his tenure, according to the agency. Mr. Buttigieg has also pressed airlines to seat children with their parents for free and to improve the services they offer to travelers who experience lengthy delays or cancellations.\nThe Transportation Department said attorneys general from 15 states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin — had signed agreements to be part of the partnership.\nThe attorneys general from the District of Columbia, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands also have joined, the department said, bringing the total number involved to 18. Of those, 16 are Democrats and two are Republicans.\nUnder federal law, states are generally barred from enforcing their own consumer protection laws against airlines. State attorneys general have pushed for federal legislation that would empower them to take action against airlines, just as they can against companies in other industries.\nThe new partnership does not grant them that power. Instead, their offices would investigate complaints from travelers, and if they determine that federal consumer protection rules may have been violated, they could refer the matter to the Transportation Department under a fast-track process. The federal agency would then review the complaint and could take enforcement action.\n'The ideal world would be one where states are given formal authority to enforce consumer protection law alongside the Department of Transportation,' Mr. Weiser said. 'Congress has failed to act on that thus far, but we are not waiting for action.'\nIn a statement, Airlines for America, a trade group representing the country's largest air carriers, said it regularly worked with the Transportation Department and state attorneys general to improve the flying experience for travelers.\n'We appreciate the role of state attorneys general and their work on behalf of consumers,' the group said, adding that it looked forward to continuing to work with them.",

A majority of Democratic and Republicans lawmakers voted to advance the bills past a procedural hurdle, setting up the legislation to pass the House tomorrow.\nThe measures, which are all expected to pass in the House with bipartisan support, provide $60.8 billion in aid to Ukraine, $26.4 billion for Israel and aid for Palestinians, and $8 billion for Taiwan and other allies.\nIn order to steer around opposition from members of his own party, Speaker Mike Johnson broke down the package into three pieces, adding a fourth bill to sweeten the deal for conservatives. That bill would require TikTok's Chinese owners to sell it within nine months, otherwise the app could be banned.\nAfter the House, the measures head to the Senate, which has already approved a similar package, and then to President Biden, who has vowed to sign them. Final approval would be an enormous victory in the long effort to fund Ukraine, and a defeat for the voices of isolationism in the Republican Party.",

Kathy Hochul said that the attack was expected to slow down the process on the legislative side, adding that it would force the state to dust off computer systems from the early '90s.\n'We have to go back to the more antiquated system we had in place from 1994,' Ms. Hochul said in an interview with Brian Lehrer on WNYC. She said it was too soon to determine whether the attack had been politically motivated, adding that the state's cybersecurity team was scrutinizing it.\nBut representatives for the State Legislature seemed less concerned that the attack would be disruptive, stressing that staff were continuing to work regularly with both houses even as they sought to resolve the issue.\n'Nothing is delayed,' said Mike Whyland, a spokesman for the Democratic majority in the State Assembly.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Monday marked another key moment in the criminal trial of Donald J. Trump: opening statements, during which the former president listened quietly to the prosecution's allegations of crimes, and the defense's counterargument that he was a simple man, wrongly accused.\nThe jury that will decide Mr. Trump's case concentrated intently on the statements, which began the presentation of what will be weeks of testimony and other evidence, all in a tense courtroom in Lower Manhattan.\nThe presumptive Republican presidential nominee once more, Mr. Trump, 77, is charged with falsifying 34 business records in an attempt to cover up a payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, in the days before the 2016 election. Ms. Daniels, who may testify, says that she and Mr. Trump had a sexual encounter in 2006, a claim the former president denies.\nMr. Trump has also denied the 34 felony charges, calling them orchestrated by Democrats; if convicted, the former president could face probation or up to four years in prison.\nHere are five takeaways from Mr. Trump's fifth day on trial:\nThe charges faced by Mr. Trump may sound bland — 'falsifying business records' doesn't really set the heart racing — but the prosecution made clear on Monday that it plans on painting a much broader picture.\nMatthew Colangelo, a prosecutor, laid out in his opening statement a tale that touched on tabloid journalism, tawdry affairs and covertly recorded phone calls. Jurors will likely be told about events inside fancy hotel rooms, Trump Tower and even the Oval Office. And the stakes? The presidency.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Denny Walsh, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter who was a consummate nuisance to mobsters, corrupt politicians and his editors, especially at The New York Times, which fired him, died on March 29 at his home in Antelope, Calif., a suburb of Sacramento. He was 88.\nHis daughter, Colleen Bartow, confirmed the death. She said he had been suffering from several respiratory ailments.\nMr. Walsh began his career in 1961 at The St. Louis Globe-Democrat, where he hot-dogged around the newsroom smoking cigars and used the floor as his ashtray.\n'Walsh had the tenacity of a pit bull and seemed to be developing some of the facial features of the breed,' Pat Buchanan, the conservative commentator who was then an editorial writer at the paper, wrote in his autobiography, 'Right from the Beginning' (1988). 'His laugh was loud and uncontrolled and bordered on the malicious.'\nMr. Buchanan added, 'When Walsh sank his teeth into a politician, he usually did serious damage, and he was always reluctant to let go.'\nInvestigative reporters are an idiosyncratic breed of journalist. Typically fearless, they are often a source of angina to their editors. Mr. Walsh was no exception. He liked to boast that he was sued multiple times for libel but had never lost a case. He was often at loggerheads with his bosses.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

She is less than a mile from leaving Alabama to seek abortion services, but it's too late: The next thing she knows, she is being handed a pregnancy test and is handcuffed.\nThe encounter is depicted in an unvarnished new television ad called 'Fugitive.' The Campaign for Democracy, a political action committee created by Gov. Gavin Newsom, Democrat of California, produced the ad.\nIt will appear on Monday in Alabama, where Republicans have called for prosecuting women who travel elsewhere for an abortion. The state's abortion ban, one of the nation's strictest, outlaws the procedure at all stages of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape and incest.\n'Trump Republicans want to criminalize young Alabama women who travel for reproductive care,' the ad's narrator says.\nThe ad then shows the patrolman approaching the vehicle: 'Miss, I'm going to need you to step out of the vehicle,' he says, tapping the kit on the driver's side door, 'take a pregnancy test.'\nThe ad is scheduled to run on broadcast and cable television, along with digital platforms like YouTube, for two weeks, according to the PAC.

'We hope that they do so in a way that does as little to escalate this as possible.'\nThe British were not alone in urging Israeli restraint after Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel over the weekend. The leaders of the U.S., Germany and other nations denounced Tehran's attack but pressed Netanyahu to avoid taking any action that could spur a wider war.\nA spokesman for the State Department said today that the U.S. was pushing for a 'unified diplomatic response' to the Iranian attack. But the spokesman added, 'These decisions are for Israel to make as a sovereign, democratic country.'\nIsrael has considered a range of options, including a direct strike on Iran and a strike on an Iranian target elsewhere, such as an Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps base. Israeli officials said they had also considered a cyberattack or assassinations. Iranian leaders have warned that the country will react forcefully to any Israeli strike.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Ms. Lee's primary is one of the first down-ballot electoral tests of the Israel-Gaza conflict this year.\n'To fight for common sense in the House is to often be alone. I have seen Summer walk alone,' Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. 'On Tuesday, what we must do is show her and show the world and show the people in that big white house that she is not alone.'\n'It's not about winning — it's about winning big,' she added.\nMs. Lee won a close primary in 2022 against a moderate challenger on her way to become the first Black woman to represent Pennsylvania in Congress. She has garnered broad support from Democrats this year. Even so, she has also faced pressure within her district after becoming one of the first members of Congress to call for an immediate cease-fire, just over a week after Hamas attacked Israel, and Israel responded with a military assault on Gaza.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Yet to many politicians, these precautions against espionage now feel like something of a farce.\nBecause seated alongside them in those classified meetings are members of the Alternative for Germany, the far-right party known by its German abbreviation, AfD.\nIn the past few months alone, a leading AfD politician was accused of taking money from pro-Kremlin strategists. One of the party's parliamentary aides was exposed as having links to a Russian intelligence operative. And some of its state lawmakers flew to Moscow to observe Russia's stage-managed elections.\n'To know with certainty that sitting there, while these sensitive issues are discussed, are lawmakers with proven connections to Moscow — it doesn't just make me uncomfortable. It worries me,' said Erhard Grundl, a Green party member of the Parliament's foreign affairs committee.\nThe AfD called such comments 'baseless.'\nWhile some of the accusations against the AfD may be attempts at point-scoring by political rivals, the security concerns are real. As evidence of the party's links to Moscow accumulate, suspicions are being expressed across the spectrum of mainstream German politics.\n'The AfD keeps acting like the long arm of the terrorist state Russia,' Roderich Kiesewetter, the deputy head of the Parliament's intelligence committee and a member of the center-right Christian Democrats, wrote on social media.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "Senator Mark Warner, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said the United States was more susceptible to Russian influence operations than it was during the 2020 elections.",
            "summary": "The threat against U.S. elections by Russia and other foreign powers is far greater today than it was in 2020, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said on Tuesday.\nSenator Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who leads the committee, said the danger had grown for multiple reasons: Adversarial countries have become more adept at spreading disinformation, Americans are more vulnerable to propaganda, communication between the government and social media companies has become more difficult and artificial intelligence is giving foreign powers new abilities.\nThe Intelligence Committee was set to hold a hearing on election threats on Wednesday, but it was postponed on Tuesday to allow the Senate to consider of the articles of impeachment against Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary. Mr. Warner said he hoped to reschedule the hearing quickly.\nA bipartisan report by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the final volume of which was released in 2020, chronicled extensive efforts by Russians to influence American politics in 2016. Since then, Russia has only honed its ability to shape debates in Europe and the United States, while people everywhere have become more vulnerable, Mr. Warner said.\nFor a time, Americans and Europeans were becoming more aware of disinformation or influence operations by Russia or other foreign powers. But today, conspiracy theories seem to be gaining more traction.\n'With polarization in this country, and the lack of faith in institutions, people will believe anything or not believe things that come from what used to be viewed as trusted sources of information,' Mr. Warner said. 'So there's a much greater willingness to accept conspiracy theories.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "The law lapsed only briefly after a late-night deal that allowed votes on privacy advocates' proposed changes, all of which were defeated.",
            "summary": "The Senate early on Saturday approved an extension of a warrantless surveillance law, moving to renew it shortly after it had expired and sending President Biden legislation that national security officials say is crucial to fighting terrorism but that privacy advocates decry as a threat to Americans' rights.\nThe law, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, had appeared all but certain to lapse over the weekend, with senators unable for most of Friday to reach a deal on whether to consider changes opposed by national security officials and hawks.\nBut after hours of negotiation, the Senate abruptly reconvened late on Friday for a flurry of votes in which those proposed revisions were rejected, one by one, and early on Saturday the bill, which extends Section 702 for two years, won approval, 60 to 34.\n'We have good news for America's national security,' Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic majority leader, said as he stood during the late-night session to announce the agreement to complete work on the bill. 'Allowing FISA to expire would have been dangerous.'\nIn a statement, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland praised the bill's passage, calling Section 702 'indispensable to the Justice Department's work to protect the American people from terrorist, nation-state, cyber and other threats.'\nAhead of final passage, the Senate rapidly voted down a series of amendments proposed by privacy-minded lawmakers. Approving any of them would have sent the bill back to the House, allowing the statute to lapse for a more significant period.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab New York City courtroom as Mr. Trump looked on.\nBefore jury selection began, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, rejected another effort to force his recusal by the defense, which cited several issues, including his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant.\nHe also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost.\nBut Mr. Trump's lawyers did persuade Justice Merchan that mentioning sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump was recorded bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial.\nEntering the courtroom Monday, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here,' but he looked less enthusiastic in front of Justice Merchan. He quietly slouched and scowled — and at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep.\nBy afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into the courtroom. Some quickly left: When the judge asked the first group of 96 if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused.\nThe remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.",

            "summary": "Dr. Joel Breman, a specialist in infectious diseases who was a member of the original team that helped combat the Ebola virus in 1976, died on April 6 at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 87.\nHis death was confirmed by his son, Matthew, who did not specify a cause.\n'We were scared out of our wits,' Dr. Breman, recollecting his pioneer mission, told a National Institutes of Health newsletter in 2014, as a new and even deadlier Ebola outbreak raged that year.\nNearly 40 years earlier, his team of five had just landed in the interior of what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, at a remote Roman Catholic mission hospital. They were up against a viral infection that had no name, whose origin was unknown, and that was accompanied by high fever and bleeding that led to a painful and quick death.\nDr. Breman, dispatched by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had only what he described to the N.I.H. as 'the most basic protective equipment' against the disease, in contrast to the full-body spacesuit-like gear that was standard in the later outbreak. He and others on the team, laboring in intense heat and bitten by sand flies, 'developed rashes and didn't know if we would catch the virus too,' he said.\nBut he calmly began deploying the techniques he had honed on earlier missions to Africa, on anti-smallpox initiatives in Guinea and Burkina Faso. He interviewed patients and witnesses, traveling from village to village and going from house to house. He and his colleagues, he recalled, soon determined that the infection was 'spread by close contact with infected body fluids,' and that it had been propagated at a rural hospital that was using unsterilized needles.\nOver a long career, much of it spent at the Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and the National Institutes for Health, Dr. Breman worked to stamp out deadly tropical diseases like smallpox, malaria and Guinea worm. But that initial Ebola outbreak, he told an interviewer in 2009, 'was the scariest epidemic of my entire medical career and possibly of the last century.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Kennedy Jr. announced Thursday that he had secured a spot on the ballot in Michigan, one of the swing states likely to decide the election.\nThe Natural Law Party, which has ballot access in Michigan, nominated Mr. Kennedy and his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, for president and vice president. A spokeswoman for the Michigan secretary of state's office confirmed that this meant Mr. Kennedy would be on the ballot in November.\nMr. Kennedy is seeking ballot access in all 50 states through a mixture of independent petitions and third-party nominations. In some states, he has filed to create his own party. At the same time, Democratic allies of Mr. Biden are working to challenge his access to the ballot.\nIn a statement released by Mr. Kennedy's campaign, Doug Dern, the chairman of the Natural Law Party, called him 'the most qualified candidate in the modern-day history of America.'\nMr. Kennedy, an environmental lawyer known for his antivaccine activism, has spread misinformation about the risks of vaccinations and about other subjects. He also drew attention recently for suggesting that Mr. Biden might pose a greater threat to democracy than former President Donald J. Trump, who tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, a claim that democracy experts called absurd.\nWhile Mr. Kennedy is generally polling in single digits nationally, Mr. Biden's campaign is worried that he could draw enough support in battleground states like Michigan to tip a close election to Mr. Trump.\nMr. Kennedy's relatives are worried about that, too — as evidenced by their show of force for Mr. Biden on Thursday, when a group of them appeared alongside him at a campaign event in Pennsylvania.",

Ms. Omar, who is on the committee that held the hearing, was one of several Democrats who questioned Ms. Shafik about her actions toward Palestinian and Muslim students.\nMs. Hirsi, 21, said on social media that she was an organizer with Columbia University Apartheid Divest, the student coalition that has been pushing the university to cut ties with companies that support Israel. Such divestment is the key demand of protesters in the encampment. She is also involved with the Columbia chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, one of two student groups that was suspended in November for holding unauthorized protests.\n'I have never been reprimanded or received any disciplinary warnings,' she wrote. 'I just received notice that I am 1 of 3 students suspended for standing in solidarity with Palestinians facing a genocide.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "This year is the 30th anniversary of South Africa's first democratic elections, but millions of people continue to suffer from economic challenges similar to those during apartheid.\nMost Black South Africans do not earn enough to meet their basic needs. Inequality and unemployment have increased, basic services like water and electricity are unreliable, racial disparities remain wide and political corruption has left many fed up with the country's democracy.\nAll this has placed the African National Congress, the liberation party that has governed since the start of South Africa's democracy, under more pressure than ever before as it enters an election on May 29. In the six previous national elections, the party comfortably won an absolute majority in Parliament, allowing it to govern as it wished. Now, though, the party faces a real threat of losing that majority for the first time.\nThis has forced the A.N.C. to get serious about pushing new solutions to the many problems that afflict the country. The party has also had to work hard to heal its internal divisions and address corruption among its ranks.\nAs one of the most developed economies and stable democracies in Africa, South Africa has enthusiastically embraced its role as a gateway to the continent for nations around the globe. But the grim economic conditions have brought fears of social unrest that could undermine the stability so important to the country's reputation and influence on the continent.\nVoters choose a party on their ballots, and the percentage of votes that a party gets determines how many seats it receives in the 400-member National Assembly. Members of the assembly, the more powerful of the two chambers in Parliament, then elect the president. This means that the party, or coalition of parties, with more than 50 percent of the seats chooses the nation's leader.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "A far-right party emerged on Thursday as a potential kingmaker in Croatia after the governing conservatives finished first in a bitterly contested parliamentary election but fell short of winning enough seats to form a new government.\nThe outcome of Wednesday's vote signaled a new era of messy political uncertainty in the Balkan nation, which has been dominated by one party, the Croatian Democratic Union, or HDZ, since 1991 when it declared independence from Yugoslavia.\nThe HDZ, led by the incumbent Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic, won 61 seats in the 151-member legislature, according to the near-final official tally. That was more than all its rivals, including Rivers of Justice, a left-leaning coalition formed by President Zoran Milanovic, which won 42 seats to finish second. The far-right Homeland Movement finished third with 13 seats.\nSpeaking early Thursday in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, Mr. Plenkovic said his party had 'convincingly won' but acknowledged that he would need help from rival groups to form a government and secure a third term as prime minister.\nHe later said in a post on Facebook that talks had already started with potential allies that he did not name. 'Everything is going well,' he said, and predicted that a government would formed 'soon,' putting a brave face on his party's losses.\nTihomir Cipek, a political science professor at the University of Zagreb, said the result reflected a general trend in Europe, particularly among new members of the European Union, which Croatia joined in 2013. 'The political center starts losing voters to parties to the far right and far left that are reaction to Europeanization,' he said.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "'Are these your posts?' the judge asked.\nThe slight, silver-haired woman stood at a lectern in the icy-cold courtroom on the 15th floor of the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building. She blinked under the lights as she was questioned, standing about 12 feet from the man who had inspired the social media messages nearly a decade before.\nThey were hers, she confirmed, and the judge directed her to read them aloud. It took her a moment to get to the crux of the first, which dated back to 2016.\n'Let's be civil,' she read. 'And try to protect the rights of the many at risk should we fail to stop the election of a racist, sexist, narcissist …' She interrupted herself. 'Oops. That sounds bad.'\nIt was just one of several such inquisitions this week as lawyers and the judge asked prospective jurors, who live in deeply Democratic Manhattan, to explain social media posts that were critical of him as president or as a candidate. The posts were apparently unearthed by researchers working for the legal team representing Donald J. Trump.\nProsecutors asked their own questions, but for the most part did not delve into the prospective jurors' posting histories. It was the defense team that expressed the most concern about what had happened online, an appropriate focus for lawyers representing the most online of presidents.\nMr. Trump thrived on social media. Using Twitter, a platform that began pushing itself as a breaking news source the year before the 2016 election, he created a sense for his followers that he was speaking directly to them. He also used the platform for slashing attacks on rivals, promoting his own thoughts or positions on news of the day, and to shape the perception of the campaign.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Nevada's once-sleepy Republican primary for Senate, which has been dominated by Sam Brown, a U.S. Army veteran, was jolted to life in the past week, when a deep-pocketed rival took aim at the front-runner.\nJeff Gunter, the ambassador to Iceland under former President Donald J. Trump, is unloading a $3.3 million advertising campaign with a MAGA message, according to his campaign, hoping to cut into Mr. Brown's dominant lead over the crowded field.\nA television ad from Mr. Gunter that began airing on Wednesday called Mr. Brown 'the newest creature to emerge from the swamp,' tying him to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, and deriding his primary opponent as 'Scam Brown.'\nMr. Brown, a veteran who was wounded severely in Afghanistan in 2008, consolidated party support after entering the primary last July, earned the endorsement of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and has appeared at fund-raisers around the country with prominent Republicans. He has lapped his competitors in fund-raising, pulling in $2.4 million in the most recent quarter, according to fund-raising reports.\nMr. Brown has sought to employ the Trump campaign handbook, skipping debates and focusing his attention on Senator Jacky Rosen, the Democratic incumbent, rather than on his Republican rivals.\nThat changed on Thursday, when Mr. Brown appeared to address Mr. Gunter for the first time, at a private fund-raising event in Sparks, Nev., after Mr. Gunter accused him in ads and appearances of being disingenuous and not sufficiently pro-Trump.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The presidential campaign of former President Donald J. Trump said in a letter to Republican vendors that candidates may use his name, image and likeness in campaign materials only if they send at least 5 percent of donations that they receive to Mr. Trump's campaign.\nThe move in effect imposes a tax on using the Trump brand for campaign purposes. Mr. Trump has sought to close a significant financial gap between him and President Biden, his Democratic rival. The Biden campaign and its political committees reported $192 million in cash on hand at the end of March, more than double the $93 million of Trump and the Republican Party.\nDanielle Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, said in a statement that 'it is important to protect small-dollar donors from scammers that use the president's name and likeness.'\nIn a letter this week signed by Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, who identified themselves as co-campaign managers, the campaign also said it was tightening control of campaign materials that use Mr. Trump's name, prohibiting strident language that has become common in donor appeals such as 'President Trump needs you' or 'If you support President Trump, you'll contribute now.'\nThe letter said the messaging guidelines were part of an effort 'to treat our donors with the utmost respect.' After Mr. Trump appeared in court on Monday, the campaign sent a fund-raising pitch falsely claiming in all-capital letters that Mr. Trump had 'just stormed out of Biden's kangaroo court!' Mr. Trump had not actually stormed out of the Manhattan courthouse.\nThe letter added that the campaign would punish campaign vendors if candidates whom they worked with did not comply with the new rules.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "A Boeing engineer who went public last week with safety concerns about the company's 787 Dreamliner told a Senate panel on Wednesday that he was concerned that shortcuts the company was taking would eventually lead to a crash if they continued unchecked.\nThe engineer, Sam Salehpour, testified that in an attempt to address bottlenecks, Boeing introduced production shortcuts with the potential to lead to planes breaking apart during flights. Mr. Salehpour said that the company was knowingly putting out defective planes and that he was punished by his superiors for raising his concerns.\n'I have analyzed Boeing's own data to conclude that the company is taking manufacturing shortcuts on the 787 program that could significantly reduce the airplane's safety and the life cycle,' Mr. Salehpour told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's investigations subcommittee.\n'Details that are the size of a human hair can be a matter of life and death,' Mr. Salehpour said.\nMr. Salehpour, who has been at Boeing for over a decade, said the problems resulted from changes in how sections of the Dreamliner were fastened together during the manufacturing process. Boeing has acknowledged that manufacturing changes had been made but said the durability of the airframe was not affected, and the company has continued to express confidence in the plane and its safety.\n'Extensive and rigorous testing of the fuselage and heavy maintenance checks of nearly 700 in-service airplanes to date have found zero evidence of airframe fatigue,' Boeing said in a statement issued before the hearing, adding that the company was 'fully confident in the safety and durability' of the plane.\nThe subcommittee's chairman, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said that the panel did not want Boeing to fail but added that the company needed to be held accountable.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Book bans in public schools continued to surge in the first half of this school year, according to a report released on Tuesday by PEN America, a free speech organization.\nFrom July to December 2023, PEN found that more than 4,300 books were removed from schools across 23 states — a figure that surpassed the number of bans from the entire previous academic year.\nThe rise in book bans has accelerated in recent years, driven by conservative groups and by new laws and regulations that limit what kinds of books children can access. Since the summer of 2021, PEN has tracked book removals in 42 states and found instances in both Republican- and Democratic-controlled districts.\nThe numbers likely fail to capture the full scale of book removals. PEN compiles its figures based on news reports, public records requests and publicly available data, but many removals go unreported.\nHere are some of the report's key findings.\nBook bans are not new in the United States. School and public libraries have long had procedures for addressing complaints, which were often brought by parents concerned about their children's reading material.\nBut the current wave stands out in its scope. Censorship efforts have become increasingly organized and politicized, supercharged by conservative groups like Moms for Liberty and Utah Parents United, which have pushed for legislation that regulates the content of library collections. Since PEN began tracking book bans, it has counted more than 10,000 instances of books being removed from schools. Many of the targeted titles feature L.G.B.T.Q. characters, or deal with race and racism, PEN found.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "She may not be a committee chair, but perhaps no single Republican lawmaker has done more to exert pressure on elite universities since the Israel-Gaza war began than Representative Elise Stefanik of New York.\nMs. Stefanik was already a rising star within her party, the top-ranking woman in Republican House leadership and considered a potential presidential running mate when the House Education and Workforce Committee began investigating antisemitism on college campuses. But her grilling of the presidents of Harvard, University of Pennsylvania and M.I.T. at a December hearing became a defining moment.\nMs. Stefanik pressed the leaders to say whether students would violate their universities' codes of conduct if they called for the genocide of Jews. Their dispassionate, lawyerly answers about context and free speech set off a firestorm that ultimately helped cost two of them, Claudine Gay of Harvard and Elizabeth Magill of the Penn, their jobs.\nThe exchange also helped win Ms. Stefanik widespread attention and rare plaudits from grudging liberals, who typically revile her for embracing former President Donald J. Trump and his lies about the 2020 election. On Wednesday, she was named one of Time's 100 most influential people of 2024.\nMs. Stefanik is a graduate of Harvard herself. When she first won her seat in 2014, she was the youngest woman ever elected to the House of Representatives. She beat a centrist Democrat, and in the early days of her career, she took on more moderate stances.\nThese days, she describes herself as 'ultra MAGA' and 'proud of it.'\nMs. Stefanik, 39, has said she was 'stunned' by the responses of the presidents during the last hearing. She plans to reprise that role on Wednesday, grilling the president of Columbia University, Nemat Shafik, and members of its board of trustees.\nIn an opinion piece in The New York Post before the hearing, Ms. Stefanik said antisemitism at Columbia had become 'egregious and commonplace.' She charged Dr. Shafik with failing 'to ensure Jewish students are able to attend school in a safe environment.'",

            "summary": "President Biden will kick off a three-day tour of Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state, with a speech on Tuesday that focuses on taxes and aims to contrast his policies with those of former President Donald J. Trump.\nIn Scranton, his hometown, Mr. Biden is expected to talk about the tax code in the frame of economic fairness, arguing that Mr. Trump's tax cuts benefited billionaires while his own agenda has helped working- and middle-class families.\nThe president 'will outline how Trump's tax plan is a handout to the rich and leaves the middle class holding the bag,' Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign's communications director, said during a call with reporters. 'The address will drive home a simple question: Do you think the tax code should work for rich people and for corporations or for the middle class?'\nAll of that is standard election-year fare. But the backdrop to Mr. Biden's campaign swing could not be more unusual. In an unprecedented trial, Mr. Trump is spending most of this week, and much of the coming month or two, in a Manhattan courtroom facing criminal charges. Democrats hope that the contrast of Mr. Biden campaigning and carrying out the duties of a president while Mr. Trump's lawyers plead his innocence will highlight the choice voters face in November.\nAnd Mr. Biden must also contend with the fallout from Iran's weekend attack on Israel, which raised new fears of a wider regional war in the Middle East.\nOn Tuesday, the day after Tax Day, Mr. Biden is likely to promote his plans for changes to the tax code, including expanding the child tax credit, instituting a tax credit for first-time home buyers and making permanent tax credits for those who buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "excerpt": "The senator's trial will start May 13, a week later than planned, to give defense lawyers more time to prepare.",
            "summary": "The corruption trial of Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey was pushed back a week on Friday to May 13, after defense lawyers said they needed more time to review voluminous exhibits and witness statements that prosecutors were only now turning over to them.\nThe exhibits and statements had been withheld from the defense while the parties fought over how certain testimony would be presented to jurors. That impasse had threatened to delay the trial for two months, but at a brief court hearing in Manhattan, the parties said they had resolved the dispute.\nIn seeking the extra week to prepare for trial, one defense lawyer, César de Castro, said the postponement would help to 'make up for lost time.' Prosecutors agreed to the one-week delay.\nMr. Menendez, 70, his wife Nadine Menendez, 57, and two New Jersey businessmen have been charged in a bribery conspiracy case. Prosecutors say the Menendezes accepted cash, gold and a luxury car in exchange for the senator's willingness to use his political influence to help allies in New Jersey and the governments of Egypt and Qatar.\nThe defendants, who all have pleaded not guilty, were scheduled to be tried together on May 6. But the judge, Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court, separated Ms. Menendez's case from the others after her lawyers said she had a 'serious medical condition' that would require a surgical procedure and potentially extended recovery period. She is scheduled for trial on July 8.\nKeeping a May trial date had been seen as critical for the senator. Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, has said he expected to be exonerated, leaving open the possibility he could run for re-election as an independent in November.\n'Every day that the specter of the unproven allegations are in the air as to our client is a detriment to him,' Adam Fee, one of the senator's lawyers, said at a court hearing earlier this month, adding that a delay would make it difficult for Mr. Menendez to run in a general election. 'Every day of delay is prejudicial to him,' Mr. Fee had told the judge.",

            "summary": "The House vote on Saturday to provide $61 billion in American aid to Ukraine was the clearest sign yet that at least on foreign policy, the Republican Party is not fully aligned with former President Donald J. Trump and his 'America First' movement.\nBut more Republicans voted against the aid than for it, showing just how much Mr. Trump's broad isolationism — and his movement's antipathy to Ukraine — has divided the G.O.P. in an election year.\nMr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the third time, had actually soft-pedaled his opposition to Ukraine aid in recent days as the dam began to break on the House Republican blockade. He stood by Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who assembled the complicated aid packages for Ukraine, Israel and America's Asian allies, and against threatened efforts to bring down Mr. Johnson's speakership and plunge the House back into chaos. And he stayed quiet on Saturday, declining to pressure Republicans to vote no.\nBut few issues have been more central to the former president's creed than his foreign policy isolationism, his call for Europe to raise military spending in its own backyard, and his foreign policy shift toward Vladimir V. Putin's Russia.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson after the House passed the foreign aid bills for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Credit... Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times Though he has in recent days stayed quiet, his most vociferous allies in the House, such as Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida, had led efforts to block the aid. Another pro-Trump firebrand, Representative Lauren Boebert of Colorado, jeered Democrats during the vote as they waived Ukrainian flags on the House floor.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "For weeks after the Senate passed a sprawling aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, Speaker Mike Johnson agonized over whether and how the House would take up funding legislation that would almost certainly infuriate the right wing of his party and could cost him his job.\nHe huddled with top national security officials, including William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, in the Oval Office to discuss classified intelligence. He met repeatedly with broad factions of Republicans in both swing and deep red districts, and considered their voters' attitudes toward funding Ukraine. He thought about his son, who is set to attend the U.S. Naval Academy in the fall.\nAnd finally, when his plan to work with Democrats to clear the way for aiding Ukraine met with an outpouring of venom from ultraconservatives already threatening to depose him, Mr. Johnson, an evangelical Christian, knelt and prayed for guidance.\n'I want to be on the right side of history,' Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, recalled the speaker telling him.\nMr. Johnson's decision to risk his speakership to push the $95 billion foreign aid bill through the House on Saturday was the culmination of a remarkable personal and political arc for the Louisiana Republican. It was also an improbable outcome for a man plucked from relative obscurity last fall by the hard right — which had just deposed a speaker they deemed a traitor to their agenda — to be the speaker of a deeply dysfunctional House.\nAs a rank-and-file hard-liner, Mr. Johnson had largely opposed efforts to fund Kyiv's war effort. And early in his speakership, he declared he would never allow the matter to come to a vote until his party's border demands were met.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "In the days approaching April 1, the corridors and backrooms of the New York State Capitol tend to be filled with tension and chaos, as the governor, lawmakers and staff scramble to meet the deadline to pass a state budget that is as much a policy blueprint as it is a spending plan.\nThis year was different.\nBudget talks dragged out almost three weeks past the April 1 deadline, leading some to wonder whether Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat in her first full term, had lost control of the process.\nBut by the time the budget was officially passed by the Legislature on Saturday, it was clear that Ms. Hochul had achieved her goal: a final $237 billion budget that included a checklist of her priorities. They included new resources to fight retail crime, a statewide artificial intelligence consortium, and a landmark housing deal aimed at bolstering residential construction — all without raising taxes on the wealthy.\nThe governor's long-game approach seemed to reflect lessons she has learned in reaching the three budget agreements since she took office in 2021: that a governor can lead while honoring the spirit of collaboration and that a good deal is better than a fast one.\nAfter Ms. Hochul announced on Monday that leaders had reached agreement on a budget framework, she continued to negotiate over the next few days, most notably persuading state lawmakers to use the budget to extend mayoral control of New York City schools for two more years.\nThe final budget contains $2.4 billion to support migrant services in New York City, an increase of half a billion dollars over last year's funding that should cover case management, medical expenses and legal resources. It also includes a substantial new tax break for developers, expanded tenant protections and new enforcement powers for localities to crack down on unlicensed cannabis shops.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Speaker Mike Johnson's push to advance an aid package for Ukraine in the face of vehement opposition from his own party was never going to be easy.\nBut it has been made even more politically perilous by a pair of concessions to the far right that he inherited from his predecessor: allowing a single lawmaker to call a snap vote to oust the speaker, and giving ultraconservatives a bloc of seats on a crucial panel that controls what legislation can make it to the House floor.\nBoth of those concessions, agreed to by former Speaker Kevin McCarthy more than a year ago, are now tormenting Mr. Johnson as he tries to push through a $95 billion aid bill for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. They have hemmed him in to having to rely heavily on Democrats — not only to clear the way for the legislation and drag it across the finish line, but potentially to save his job.\nMr. Johnson's predicament was on vivid display on the House floor on Thursday as a group of ultraconservatives huddled around him in a heated back and forth. One after another, they urged the speaker to tie the foreign aid package to stringent anti-immigration measures, but Mr. Johnson pushed back, replying that he would not have enough Republican support to advance such a measure, according to people involved in the private conversation.\nMinutes after the clash, some hard-right lawmakers who previously resisted joining the G.O.P. push to oust him began to sound more open to the idea.\n'My hope was that the motion to vacate would be an elixir that only required one dose for effectiveness,' said Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, who led the ouster of Mr. McCarthy. 'But sometimes there are some therapies that require more than one dose. And I hope that's not the case with the motion to vacate, but we'll administer the elixir as many times as is necessary to save the country.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "In the 1970s, leaders at the Japanese American Citizens League, one of the oldest and largest Asian American civil rights organizations, felt the prospect of reparations for their wartime incarceration was out of reach.\nMany Americans knew little about how the government had imprisoned more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent, most of whom were American citizens, during World War II. Large civil rights organizations were preoccupied with the broader fight for gender and racial equality, and even other Asian American groups were reluctant to support reparations.\nThen came a surprising endorsement from the American Jewish Committee. It was the start of a decades-long bond between two of the country's most established Jewish and Japanese American civil rights groups — a relationship cherished by both of their communities.\nBut a new generation of Japanese Americans is now pushing to sever ties with two prominent Jewish American organizations. In a recent letter, a group of mostly young activists calling themselves Nikkei4Palestine urged the Japanese American Citizens League to take a stronger stance in support of Palestinians by calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and renouncing affiliations with Jewish groups they labeled 'Zionist.'\nIt was the latest example of how the Israel-Hamas war has roiled cultural and political institutions far beyond the Middle East, and not just among groups with direct ties to the region. While most Japanese Americans vote Democratic, an increasingly vocal generation of young activists is trying to push their parents' and grandparents' civil rights group further to the left.\nThe Nikkei4Palestine leaders wrote in late December that the American Jewish Committee and the Anti-Defamation League had promoted human rights 'while consciously omitting calls for equal and fair treatment of Palestinians' and conflating any criticism of Israeli government policies with antisemitism. They argued that Japanese Americans were being complicit with the Israeli military attacks in Gaza by standing with those organizations and not denouncing U.S. financial support for Israel.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "IN THE SHADOW OF LIBERTY: The Invisible History of Immigrant Detention in the United States , by Ana Raquel Minian\nIN THE SHADOW OF LIBERTY: The Invisible History of Immigrant Detention in the United States, by Ana Raquel Minian Completely uncontroversial statements about Donald J. Trump are vanishingly rare these days, but I think I can propose one: Trump isn't exactly known for his powers of attention. During his four years as president, it was nearly impossible for him to focus on any policy question for very long — something that even his most committed supporters would be hard-pressed to deny.\nBut amid all the mind-wandering, flip-flopping and havoc-wreaking, there happened to be one node of unwavering consistency: a fixation on borders and immigration that was remarkably tenacious. Build walls, ban Muslims, separate families — Trump has suggested he would do all that again and more if he wins in November. His language is also becoming ever more violent. He now vilifies migrants as 'animals' who are 'poisoning the blood of our country.'\nThis escalation dovetails with Trump's demonstrated predilections. He has always been drawn to the soft spots in the democratic system, to those areas that would allow him to wield the kind of absolute power he insists he is entitled to, and immigration policy is perhaps the softest target of all.\nUnlike American citizens, who are protected by constitutional rights (and have legal recourse if those rights are violated), immigrants are exceptionally vulnerable to government power. Even the right to due process is inconsistently applied to them, and sometimes denied altogether. Migrants have been locked up without explanation. They have been locked up for being 'likely to become a public charge.' They have been locked up and never accused of committing any crime at all.\nAs Ana Raquel Minian explains in a new book, 'In the Shadow of Liberty: The History of Immigration Detention in the United States,' the American government has a long record of detaining migrants in places that are, legally speaking, black sites. 'Every day in the heart of the self-described ‘greatest democracy on earth,'' Minian writes, 'people are incarcerated without charges for indefinite periods of time, under horrific conditions and without basic constitutional protections.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The night Ma Suu Kyi thought she would die of her wounds on the front lines of a forgotten war, a crescent moon hung overhead. A pendant of the Virgin Mary dangled around her neck. Maybe those augurs saved her. Or maybe, she said, it was not yet time for her to die.\n'When I joined the revolution, I knew my chances of surviving were 50-50,' Ms. Suu Kyi, 21, said of her decision to enlist as a rebel soldier, fighting to overthrow the junta that returned Myanmar to military dictatorship three years ago. 'I'm an ordinary girl, an ordinary young person. I believe in federal democracy and human rights.'\nMs. Suu Kyi said the words 'federal democracy' in English. There are no easy words for the concept in Burmese.\nSince the junta in Myanmar staged its coup in February 2021, ending a brief period of democratic reform and training its guns once again on peaceful protesters, much of the country has turned against the military. A new generation, which came of age during the civilian administration of the Nobel laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has taken to arms, joining rebels who have opposed military dictatorship for decades.\nThe world's gaze has remained focused on other conflicts on other continents — to the consternation of many in Myanmar who wonder why the chaos and death here brings little global outcry. Now, after three years of desperate resistance, the battle lines are changing fast. The rebels have overrun scores of military bases and taken over dozens of towns. The tempo of victory has quickened in recent days, and anti-junta forces now claim to control more than half of Myanmar's territory, from lowland jungles to the foothills of the Himalayas.\nMuch of the fighting's rhythm seems syncopated to that of another century: trenches dug into unrelenting mud, the slide of flip-flops down monsoon-soaked hills, the clatter of homemade AK-style assault rifles in dusty towns. The junta's multiple rocket launchers and fighter jets may bring a modern touch to the killing, as does the hovering of the resistance's battle drones. But this conflict, with its hand-to-hand combat and profusion of land mines, feels like a throwback to the kind of civil war that was documented in black and white.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "The Biden administration will give Micron up to $6.1 billion in grants to help build its semiconductor plants in New York and Idaho, the latest multibillion dollar award aimed at ramping up the nation's production of vital semiconductors.\nSenator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, announced the grant on Thursday and said the 'monumental' investment would help the company construct two new chip manufacturing plants in New York by the end of the decade, along with another plant under construction in Idaho.\nMore than a year ago, Micron announced plans to expand its manufacturing footprint in the United States. In September 2022, the company said it would build a $15 billion factory in its hometown, Boise, Idaho, the first new U.S. memory chip plant in 20 years. A month later, Micron said it would build a giant manufacturing complex near Syracuse, N.Y., pledging to start with a $20 billion project by the end of the decade and spending as much as $100 billion over the next two decades or more. The complex could eventually include up to four new manufacturing plants.\nA senior Biden administration official confirmed the award and said it would help create thousands of jobs. Company officials have said the investment is expected to create roughly 50,000 jobs, including about 9,000 direct positions at its plants.\nThe announcement is the latest award from federal officials to chipmakers in recent weeks. The funding stems from the CHIPS Act, which a bipartisan group of lawmakers passed in 2022 to re-establish the United States as leader in the production of semiconductors, the foundational components that power everything from phones and supercomputers to cars and weapons systems. Equipped with $39 billion, the Commerce Department has distributed several grants to chip manufacturers as an incentive for them to build and expand facilities in the United States.\nThe initiative is intended to strengthen the domestic supply of semiconductors. Although semiconductors were invented in America, manufacturing has largely shifted overseas. Only about 10 percent of the world's semiconductors are currently made in the United States.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "As President Biden tours Pennsylvania, his campaign will run a new ad promoting his commitment to organized labor and attacking the economic policies of former President Donald J. Trump.\nThe ad features JoJo Burgess, who is a steelworker and the mayor of Washington, Pa., a small town southwest of Pittsburgh. Mr. Biden is scheduled to speak on Wednesday at the headquarters of the United Steelworkers union in Pittsburgh, where he is expected to call on his trade representative to increase some tariffs on steel and aluminum products from China.\n'Donald Trump has shown through his history that workers mean nothing to him,' Mr. Burgess says in the ad, a minute-long spot. 'Right now, we have the most pro-American worker president in office that we've ever had in our history.'\nThe Biden campaign said it was spending in the 'mid-six figures' to push the message across television and digital platforms in Pennsylvania, separate from a $30 million ad campaign across the major battleground states. It hopes the ad will complement news media coverage of Mr. Biden's three-day Pennsylvania visit, which is set to conclude on Thursday in Philadelphia. Winning the state, where he narrowly defeated Mr. Trump in 2020, is crucial to his re-election strategy.\nThe new ad amplifies the argument that Mr. Biden is pursuing against Mr. Trump on the economy, accusing the former president of siding with billionaires over workers. In a speech laying out his tax policy on Tuesday in Scranton, his hometown, Mr. Biden laid into Mr. Trump.\n'He learned the best way to get rich is to inherit it,' Mr. Biden said of his rival.\nMr. Burgess, a Democrat, was a guest of Mr. Biden's at the president's State of the Union address in 2022. He became the first Black mayor of Washington, Pa., last year. The Biden campaign said the ad featuring Mr. Burgess would run during news programs, as well as on regional sports networks.\nThe campaign also released a shorter ad with Mr. Burgess for digital platforms. In that ad, Mr. Burgess defends Mr. Biden against attacks from Mr. Trump and other Republicans on his age and mental fitness.\n'When you meet him, this guy is as sharp as a knife,' Mr. Burgess says of the president. 'They have nothing else to attack because they can't attack the things that he is doing that are so good for this country.'",

            "summary": "Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat who as a little-known state senator mucked out stables and waited on tables in a clever populist strategy that helped to boost him into the governorship, the United States Senate and a run for the presidency, has died. He was 87.\nHis daughter Gwen Graham posted a family statement announcing his death on social media on Tuesday. It did not say where or when he died or provide a cause. Mr. Graham was disabled by a stroke in May 2020.\nThe son of a Florida state senator, Mr. Graham had gained little political traction after 13 years in the State Legislature. He seemed destined to rise no higher than his father. Then he had an idea. Besides his official duties, he resolved to work eight hours a day in hundreds of mostly entry-level jobs to bond with his constituents. He performed what he called 'Workdays' off and on for the rest of his career.\nHe was, for a day, a short-order cook, a bellhop, a social work aide, a plumber. He saw a murder victim on a night riding with cops. He was a department store Santa, a citrus packer, an office temp and applied for food stamps. He picked tomatoes under a broiling sun, filled potholes, collected garbage, cut down broken tree limbs after a storm, was a circus clown and did housewives' chores.\nVoters and the press, especially television news programs, loved it, and he limited reporters' access to show he was seeking insights into working lives, not pulling stunts. Whatever his motives, 'Workdays' became a campaign staple, enabling Mr. Graham to win two terms as governor (1979-1987), three terms in the Senate (1987-2005) and a heady but hopeless run for the White House in 2003.\nWhen he retired from the Senate after 38 years of public life, Mr. Graham, an obsessive diarist of minutiae that read like an hourly log, had itemized all his 'Workdays' experiences as well as his activities as governor, senator and presidential aspirant. The record showed that, outside his official duties, he had worked in 921 more-or-less ordinary jobs in 109 cities and five states.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Kari Lake, a top ally of Donald J. Trump who is running for a Senate seat in Arizona, called on her supporters on Sunday to arm themselves ahead of an 'intense' period leading up to the election, urging them to 'strap on a Glock,' referring to a brand of firearm.\n'The next six months is going to be intense,' Ms. Lake said during a rally in Lake Havasu City. 'We're going to strap on our seatbelt. We're going to put on our helmet — or your Kari Lake ball cap. We are going to put on the armor of God. And maybe strap on a Glock on the side of us just in case.'\nThe crowd roared its approval, and she continued, 'You can put one here,' gesturing to the side of her hip, 'and one in the back or one in the front. Whatever you guys decide. Because we're not going to be the victims of crime. We're not going to have our Second Amendment taken away. We're certainly not going to have our First Amendment taken away by these tyrants.'\nWhen asked about Ms. Lake's remarks on Tuesday, Alex Nicoll, a representative of the campaign, said that 'Kari Lake is clearly talking about the Second Amendment right for Arizonans to defend themselves.'\nIt is not the first time Ms. Lake has alluded to armed conflict with her and her supporters. Last year, she said: 'If you want to get to President Trump, you are going to have go through me, and you are going to have to go through 75 million Americans just like me. And I'm going to tell you, most of us are card-carrying members of the N.R.A.,' referring to the National Rifle Association. She added, 'That's not a threat — that's a public service announcement.'\nHer voice is just one in a rising chorus of violent, authoritarian or otherwise aggressive political rhetoric from Mr. Trump and his allies. The former president shared a video late last month featuring an image of President Biden, his Democratic rival, hogtied. He has also said that migrants are 'poisoning the blood of our country' and described his political opponents last year as 'vermin' who needed to be 'rooted out.'\nAnd Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, on Monday urged people whose routes were blocked by pro-Palestinian demonstrators to 'take matters into your own hands' and confront the offenders, endorsing the use of physical force against peaceful protesters.",

            "summary": "Myanmar's military staged a coup in 2021, strangling democratic reforms and jailing much of the country's civilian leadership. Three years on, the Southeast Asian nation is teetering on the brink of failed statehood. Insurgent groups, including pro-democracy forces and ethnic militias, are battling the junta's soldiers. Tens of thousands of people have been killed, and millions more are displaced.\nSource: Special Advisory Council for Myanmar (SAC-M)\nThe fighting, in forests and towns across Myanmar, gets little of the international attention claimed by the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. Yet a decade ago, this nation wedged between India and China was touted as a rare example of a country peacefully transitioning from military dictatorship toward democratic rule. The army putsch ended any illusion of political progress. Myanmar has returned to a military reign of terror and the fractured reality of civil war. The lawlessness that thrives in conflict areas has radiated outward, with transnational crime networks using Myanmar as a base and exporting the products of their illicit activity worldwide.\nSoldiers from 8th Battalion of the Karenni Nationalities Defense Force, an armed insurgent group, during their graduation ceremony in Karenni State in February.\nAdam Ferguson for The New York Times\nThe short answer: The military coup was met by widespread peaceful protests. Then the junta, led by Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, quickly reverted to its old playbook: jail, terrorize, kill.\nPro-democracy forces took up arms, joining with militias that for decades had been fighting for the rights of ethnic minorities.\nThe longer answer: Myanmar has been in turmoil practically since gaining independence from British rule in 1948. Some of the world's longest-running armed conflicts have simmered in the country's borderlands, where ethnic militias are seeking autonomy or simply freedom from the Myanmar military's repression.\nA brief period of political reform, with a civilian government led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate, did not make life much better for many ethnic minorities. After her political party trounced the military-linked party in Myanmar's 2020 elections, a junta grabbed full control of the country again.\nA common goal of overthrowing the junta has led to unity between pro-democracy militias and armed ethnic groups. Together, these resistance forces have claimed significant territory from the Myanmar military. On April 11, they captured a key border town from the junta's forces, their biggest victory yet.\nHundreds of pro-democracy militias, ethnic armies and local defense forces. The sheer diversity of resistance groups battling the junta makes Myanmar the most fractured country on Earth, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, which tracks 50 high-level conflicts worldwide. Complicating matters, some of the rebel groups fight one another, too.\nMore than 20 militias representing various ethnic minorities have been fighting for autonomy for decades. Some of these insurgent groups control territory in Myanmar's resource-rich periphery.\nWhen ousted politicians and democracy advocates fled arrest after the coup, they found sanctuary in these ethnic rebel-held areas and formed a shadow authority called the National Unity Government.\nTens of thousands of young people — among them doctors, actors, lawyers, teachers, models, Buddhist monks, D.J.s and engineers — escaped from the junta-held cities and formed more than 200 People's Defense Forces, pledging allegiance to the shadow government.\nOften trained by the ethnic militias, the P.D.F. is now fighting in more than 100 townships across the country.\nSource: Myanmar Peace Monitor\nSince an alliance of three ethnic armies, backed by the P.D.F., began an offensive on Oct. 27, the resistance has gained significant ground. Rebels now control much of Myanmar's border region, including a strategic trading town that was captured on April 11. A few days later, they fired rockets at the nation's top military academy. Some of the fighting is taking place within striking distance of Naypyidaw, the bunkered capital that the generals built early this century.\nThis year could be a turning point in Myanmar's war, military analysts say. With each week, the junta's forces abandon more outposts. Myanmar's military is overstretched and underprovisioned. Even at the best of times, its biggest asset has been numbers, not expertise. In February, the military brought in a draft, signaling its desperation for fresh recruits.\nResistance soldiers riding in the back of a pickup truck in southern Karenni State in January.\nAdam Ferguson for The New York Times\nThe Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project says that the war in Myanmar is the most violent of the 50 conflicts it tracks. Since the coup, at least 50,000 people have been killed there, including at least 8,000 civilians, the group says.\nNote: Data as of March 15\nSource: The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project\nMore than 26,500 people have been detained for opposing the junta, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma), a rights group.\nMyanmar's military has bombarded the country with airstrikes on over 900 days since the coup, according to the Myanmar Peace Monitor, an exile group that tracks the war. Since the rebels' October offensive, there has been a fivefold increase in aerial bombardment, according to Tom Andrews, the United Nations Special Rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar.\nBy the end of last year, more than 2.6 million people had been driven from their homes in a country of about 55 million, according to the United Nations human rights office. Nearly 600,000 of those internally displaced people fled after the fighting intensified in October. More than 18 million people are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations, which says that a million had required such aid before the coup.\nSource: Myanmar Peace Monitor\nNote: Data as of April 2\nUnited Nations investigators say that the junta's forces should be investigated for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and they cite reports of organized sexual violence, village burnings and the indiscriminate use of landmines. Such abuses predate the coup. In 2017, the military conducted what the United States says was a genocidal campaign against the Rohingya Muslim minority.\nMyanmar is an extraordinarily diverse nation whose borders were shaped by British imperialism rather than ethnic boundaries. Officially, 135 ethnic groups live in the country, and practically the only thing they agree on is that this figure is wrong.\nNote: The Karenni are also known as the Kayah, the Karen as the Kayin, the Rakhine as the Arakan, and the Ta'ang as the Palaung.\nSource: General Administration Department, Myanmar\nSome ethnic minorities have more in common with people in China, India and Thailand than with the Bamar, Myanmar's largest ethnicity. Others come from princely states that were not under the full authority of a central administration until the middle of the last century. Still others, such as over a million Rohingya, have been rendered stateless because the military refuses to recognize them as rightful inhabitants of the country.\nWhat Myanmar's ethnic minorities, particularly non-Buddhist ones, share is a long record of persecution by the military.\nMyanmar's ethnic diversity is concentrated in the foothills of the Himalayas and the forested border regions that cradle the delta and lowlands through which the Irrawaddy River flows.\nIt's both.\nIn 1948, the Union of Burma declared independence from British rule. In the Burmese language, the root of the words Burma and Myanmar are the same. In 1989, a year after the violent crushing of a pro-democracy movement, a junta renamed the country internationally as Myanmar, the name by which it is known locally. The generals argued that Myanmar was a more inclusive name, because it was not so explicitly linked to the nation's Bamar ethnic majority.\nNevertheless, the pro-democracy front, led by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, tended to refer to the country as Burma to show opposition to the military regime. Ethnic minority groups often called the country Burma when speaking English. The United States still officially calls the country Burma, but most foreign governments use Myanmar. After the 2021 coup, some exiled politicians and other pro-democracy activists who once called it Myanmar switched to Burma with an international audience.\nMost people, however, still refer to Myanmar.\nThere is no commonly accepted word for the inhabitants of the country. Some refer to the Burmese of Myanmar, which seems a usage at cross-purposes. In Myanmar, the citizens are generally referred to as Myanmar, the word serving as both a nation and a nationality.\nThree years after the coup, the center of Myanmar remains mostly under junta control, but the rest of the country is a kaleidoscopic array of competing influences, fiefs, democratic havens and drug-lord hideouts. Ethnic armed groups govern some areas. Administrators aligned with the National Unity Government have set up schools and clinics in others. No one is in charge in still other parts of the country, leaving residents lacking basic services and vulnerable to life in the margins.\nA soldier from the Pa-O National Liberation Army was treated at a secret hospital in Karenni State in January.\nAdam Ferguson for The New York Times\nThe junta forces' widespread use of landmines has made parts of Myanmar off limits. Within areas under the regime's control, more than 100,000 civil servants refuse to turn up for work as part of a long-running civil disobedience campaign. Many of Myanmar's most educated people are in exile or living in the jungles. Others are in prison.\nThe military is still the country's largest and most influential institution, and a militarized culture pervades many areas that ethnic minorities control. The question is whether the Myanmar military will jettison Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, its supreme commander, if he is judged to be an impediment to the armed forces' survival — Myanmar's history is filled with military men being pushed aside for other military men. With more and more of its soldiers dying, the military is facing an existential threat.\nIt's possible that a junta, perhaps not even the current one but a new coterie, will try to negotiate cease-fires with the many armed groups arrayed against it. But given the Myanmar military's history of turning its guns against its own people, trust will be difficult to find.\nThe future of Myanmar will likely remain fractured, with no single authority in charge. Such a splintered state is likely to breed more chaos that will not be contained by national borders. Myanmar is again the world's top opium producer, displacing Afghanistan. Some ethnic armed groups survive by churning out methamphetamine and other synthetic drugs. And the country is at the center of a cyber-scam industry that steals billions of dollars from unsuspecting people and kidnaps others to forcibly work the cons.",

            "summary": "Facing mounting pressure to strike down a near-total abortion ban revived last week by Arizona's Supreme Court, Republican state legislators are considering efforts to undermine a planned ballot measure this fall that would enshrine abortion rights in the Arizona Constitution, according to a presentation obtained by The New York Times.\nThe 1864 law that is set to take effect in the coming weeks bans nearly all abortions and mandates prison sentences of two to five years for providing abortion care. The proposed ballot measure on abortion rights, known as the Arizona Abortion Access Act, would enshrine the right to an abortion before viability, or about 24 weeks. Supporters of the measure say they have already gathered enough signatures to put the question on the ballot ahead of a July 3 filing deadline.\nRepublicans in the Legislature are under tremendous pressure to overturn, or at least amend, the 1864 ban. Former President Donald J. Trump, the national standard-bearer of the Republican Party, directly intervened on Friday, calling on Republican legislators, in a frantically worded post online, to 'act immediately' to change the law. A top Trump ally in Arizona who is running for the Senate, Kari Lake, has also called for the overturning of the 1864 law, which she had once praised.\nAbortion rights have been a winning message for Democrats since the Supreme Court, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump, overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. And even though it is an objectively unpopular aspect of his White House legacy, Mr. Trump has repeatedly bragged that he is personally responsible for overturning Roe.\nRepublicans in Arizona, however, have already resisted efforts to repeal the 160-year-old law and are bracing for the potential for another floor battle on the ban that is looming for the Legislature, which is set to convene on Wednesday. The plans that circulated among Republican legislators suggest the caucus is considering other measures that would turn attention away from the 1864 law.\nThe presentation to Republican state legislators, written by Linley Wilson, the general counsel for the Republican majority in the Arizona State Legislature, proposed several ways in which the Republican-controlled Legislature could undermine the ballot measure, known as A.A.A., by placing competing constitutional amendments on the ballot that would limit the right to abortion even if the proposed ballot measure succeeded.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The fourth bill was meant to sweeten the deal for conservatives.\nMr. Johnson structured the measures, which will be melded together into one after each piece is approved, to capture different coalitions of support without allowing opposition to any one element to sink the whole deal. Each of the aid bills for the three nations is expected to pass overwhelmingly, and the Senate is expected to take it up quickly and send the legislation to President Biden's desk, capping its tortured path to enactment.\nThe legislation includes $60 billion for Kyiv; $26 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza; and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific. It would direct the president to seek repayment from the Ukrainian government of $10 billion in economic assistance, a stipulation supported by former President Donald J. Trump, who has pushed for any aid to Ukraine to be in the form of a loan. But the legislation also would allow the president to forgive those loans starting in 2026.\nThe scene that is expected to play out on the House floor on Saturday will reflect both the broad bipartisan support in Congress for continuing to help the Ukrainian military beat back Russian forces, and the extraordinary political risk taken by Mr. Johnson to defy the anti-interventionist wing of his party who had blocked the measure for months. In the end, the speaker, himself an ultraconservative who had previously voted against funding Ukraine's war effort, circumvented his right flank and was relying on Democrats to push the measure through.\nFor months, it was uncertain whether Congress would approve another round of funding for Ukraine, even as the momentum of the war in Ukraine shifted in Russia's favor. Republicans dug in against another aid package for Kyiv unless President Biden agreed to stringent anti-immigration measures, and then refused to take up legislation that paired the aid with stiffer border enforcement provisions.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "summary": "Michael Abramowitz will be the next director of the federally funded broadcaster Voice of America, its parent, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, announced on Friday.\nMr. Abramowitz, 60, is currently the president of Freedom House, a pro-democracy nonprofit organization, a role he has held since 2017. He was previously a director at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and spent 24 years as a reporter and editor for The Washington Post.\nVoice of America, which was founded in 1942, aims to offer unbiased news to audiences around the world. Mr. Abramowitz said he is drawn to the outlet's global reach and its mission to counter propaganda and disinformation coming from authoritarian countries like China, Russia and Iran.\n'These countries are waging ferocious information warfare aimed at undermining democracies, aimed at undermining the United States, and we need to fight back,' Mr. Abramowitz said in an interview. 'I think that the V.O.A. is one very important tool for the United States government in this information war.'\nHe added that 'attacks on journalism and the attacks on journalists have really been a harbinger of democratic decline around the world, so the opportunity to push back on that is deeply meaningful and attractive to me.'\nMr. Abramowitz is expected to start the role this summer. He succeeds John Lippman, the acting director since October 2023. Voice of America has not had a permanent director since 2021.\n'Michael is an esteemed journalist and a champion for human rights, and much of his work at Freedom House has informed our own efforts to counter disinformation and authoritarianism around the world,' Amanda Bennett, the chief executive of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, said in a statement.\nVoice of America says it reaches more than 326 million people each week with news in 48 languages via digital, TV and radio outlets. It has a firewall designed to protect its editorial independence from U.S. governmental interference.\nThe organization came under attack from former President Donald J. Trump during his term. In 2020, Mr. Trump appointed Michael Pack, an ally of his aide Stephen K. Bannon, to run the U.S. Agency for Global Media. Mr. Pack was accused of trying to turn Voice of America into a mouthpiece for the Trump administration, and a federal judge ruled that Mr. Pack had violated the First Amendment rights of the outlet's journalists. A federal investigation later found that Mr. Pack had grossly mismanaged the U.S. Agency for Global Media, repeatedly abusing his power by sidelining executives he felt did not sufficiently support Mr. Trump.\nMr. Abramowitz said he was confident that there was support for Voice of America's mission 'across partisan lines.'\n'The idea that we need to push back against authoritarian propaganda, these are values that are shared by people across the political spectrum,' he said.",

            "summary": "President Biden jumped into a debate about gender and sports this week, calling for pay equity for women athletes after Caitlin Clark, the University of Iowa basketball standout, was selected first in the W.N.B.A. Draft.\nMs. Clark's salary will be far less than that of her male counterparts. Mr. Biden, writing on X on Tuesday, said that for all their accomplishments in sports, women athletes were undervalued.\n'Right now we're seeing that even if you're the best, women are not paid their fair share,' he said. 'It's time that we give our daughters the same opportunities as our sons and ensure women are paid what they deserve.'\nMr. Biden was nodding to a banner moment for women's basketball, one powered by stars like Ms. Clark, who was chosen by the W.N.B.A.'s Indiana Fever, and Paige Bueckers of the University of Connecticut and Angel Reese of L.S.U.\nBut Ms. Clark's salary will amount to $338,056 over the next four years, under the W.N.B.A.'s collective bargaining agreement. The total is a fraction of the contract of Victor Wembanyama, whom the San Antonio Spurs chose with the top pick in last year's N.B.A. Draft. His contract was for $55 million, according to Spotrac, a website that tracks salaries in sports.\nThe disparity has drawn intense scrutiny during a pivotal moment for sports, particularly in college athletics. Students have gained the opportunity to monetize their athletic success through name, image and likeness, or N.I.L. deals, that can earn top stars like Ms. Clark millions of dollars. But the overall compensation of women in sports is far outpaced by how much money male athletes make.\nThe women's national championship game, in which Ms. Clark's Iowa lost to South Carolina, earned higher ratings for the first time than the men's championship contest between UConn and Purdue.\nThe president's comments touched off a flurry of responses online, some echoing Mr. Biden's perspective about inequity and others taking a more cynical point of view. Critics used the occasion to criticize Democrats over the participation of transgender athletes in women's sports.\nMartina Navratilova, the women's tennis legend, praised Mr. Biden.\n'Exactly,' she responded on X, and she called for protecting a policy that ensures equal access for women in education. 'Which means do not mess with Title IX, thank you Mr President!'\nLast year, Jill Biden, the first lady, created a stir after L.S.U. defeated the University of Iowa, another squad led by Ms. Clark, when she suggested that both teams should be invited to the White House, which would have broken from the tradition of the president hosting just the title winners.\nMs. Reese, the L.S.U. star who was also a top selection in the W.N.B.A. Draft, panned the idea at the time.\n'If we were to lose, we would not be getting invited to the White House,' she said on a podcast.",

Trump's presidential campaign committee ended March with $45 million on hand, federal filings showed Saturday, as he tries to close the fund-raising gap with President Biden.\nBut Mr. Trump's campaign is spending much less than it was at the start of the year, which has helped it inch closer. In March, it spent just $3.7 million, the new filings show, compared with $11.4 million in January — and much less than the $29.2 million spent by Mr. Biden's campaign in March. In other words, Mr. Trump's campaign is guarding resources as it seeks to build a campaign war chest for the general election.\nThis cycle began with the announcement of former President Donald J.

Since late February, the president has cut a deficit of five percentage points to a single point, a virtual tie, according to a recent survey by The New York Times and Siena College.\nThe rivals each capitalized on splashy fund-raisers in the past month that brought in tens of millions of dollars for their respective campaigns. But Mr. Trump's haul from an April 6 event in Palm Beach, Fla., will be reflected on a future filing. His campaign reported that it and the Republican National Committee raked in more than $50.5 million from the dinner, which was held at the home of the billionaire John Paulson.\nBy the end of the 2020 cycle Biden had raised and spent more than $1 billion and Trump more than $700 million dollars.\nFigures are for the 2020 and 2024 Biden and Trump presidential campaign committees as of the last day of the month.

            "summary": "Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index Donald J. Trump's lawyers faced an uphill battle Monday with Justice Juan M. Merchan, a no-nonsense jurist. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab courtroom in New York City while Mr. Trump looked on. Mr. Trump was charged in Manhattan, a deeply Democratic county and his former home, with falsifying nearly three dozen business records in an attempt to cover up a payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, who has said she had a brief sexual encounter with him in 2006. Mr. Trump denies that encounter happened, and has declared his innocence, calling the charges politically motivated. He has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a Democrat, who also attended the first day of trial on Monday. Mr. Trump faces 34 felony counts and could face probation or up to four years of prison time. The trial, which is expected to last weeks, has a fascinating list of potential witnesses: Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer turned apostate, who made the payment; Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who says she, too, had an affair with Mr. Trump; and Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels herself may testify. Before any of that happens, a jury must be selected, a winnowing that began Monday. Here are five takeaways from Mr. Trump's first day on trial: Justice Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, has been consistent about batting back defense motions on issues including the tardy disclosure of documents by prosecutors and efforts to delay or even dismiss the case. That pattern continued on Monday, as Justice Merchan rejected a defense effort to force his recusal. The defense had cited several issues, including the fact that his daughter is a Democratic political consultant. He also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost. But Mr. Trump's lawyers convinced Justice Merchan that sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the so-called Access Hollywood tape, in which Mr. Trump was caught bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial, calling them 'complete rumors, complete gossip, completely hearsay.' Justice Merchan's decisions on Monday made it clear that the trial will resurface unsavory events in the former president's life. Those include the Access Hollywood tape and other stories that Mr. Trump sought to suppress including an alleged affair with Ms. McDougal. Justice Merchan said on Monday that both could be discussed. In a minor victory for the defense, the judge reaffirmed that the 'Access Hollywood' tape itself could not be played, but that Trump's exact words could be entered into the record. Still, most of Mr. Merchan's rulings indicated that salacious details of Mr. Trump's biography will be heard in court. Entering the courtroom, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here.' Once he was in front of Mr. Merchan, Mr. Trump looked a lot less enthusiastic. He slouched. He scowled. He scoffed. And he was quiet, not the norm for a man who built a political career with his gift for slashing attacks and vicious put-downs. In court, the former president spoke only briefly, when asked a few questions by Justice Merchan about procedural matters, and whether he understood the consequences — ejection or jail — if he interrupted proceedings. He did whisper with his lawyers. And when the prosecution played a recording of him claiming to have great respect for women, he mouthed the word 'true.' But all in all, it seems it could be an exhausting experience for Mr. Trump; at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep. It's easy to forget how long it takes to do a little in legal settings. On Monday, the morning session was dominated by maneuvering by prosecutors and the defense, even as prospective jurors waited. By lunch, they were still waiting. Jury selection could take days or weeks, and the trial itself may take two months. The Passover holiday could cause delays, Justice Merchan said, though he might make some of that up by holding hearings on court matters on Wednesdays, which was previously going to be an off day. By afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into Justice Merchan's courtroom. He warmly welcomed them, introduced the lawyers and Mr. Trump and read them a summary of the case. Justice Merchan asked if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president. Of the 96 prospective jurors in the room at that time, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused. The remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial. April 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET Trump spoke briefly to TV cameras after court adjourned for the day, repeating his longstanding claims that the trial is a 'political witch hunt' before heading to his motorcade and departing the courthouse. Video Reporter: [inaudible] the trial — [inaudible] So thank you very much. We had some amazing things happen today. As you know, my son is graduating from high school and it looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation of my son, who's worked very, very hard. He's a great student and he's very proud of the fact that he did so well. And was looking forward for years to have his graduation with his mother and father there. And it looks like the judges isn't going to allow me to escape this scam. It's a scam trial. If you read all of the legal pundits, all of the legal scholars today, there's not one that I see that said, this is a case that should be brought or tried. It's a scam. It's a political witch hunt.

'You don't think you should be here at all right now?' he asks. Blanche says that yes, they don't believe this trial should happen during campaign season. Merchan reminds him that his client is a criminal defendant and required to be in court — his request is denied. April 15, 2024, 4:39 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 4:39 p.m. ET There is still some business to attend to. Todd Blanche, Trump's lead lawyer, is asking Merchan to let Trump attend a hearing in one of his other cases next week. Steinglass, the prosecutor, pauses for a long time before answering that he isn't interested in saying yes to this. April 15, 2024, 4:42 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 4:42 p.m. ET The request by Blanche is quite interesting. Over the weekend he made the opposite request, asking the judge in the Florida classified documents case to delay a deadline he was facing because he's so busy in the New York case.

But a few have offered some further detail, such as a man who identified himself as a bookseller and said that 'no one is above the law,' including former presidents. Another prospective juror, a nurse, said that she received Trump's emails several years ago but that she 'unsubscribed.' Laura Loomer appeared outside the Manhattan courthouse on Monday. Credit... DavidAs former President Donald J. Trump's first criminal trial began inside a Manhattan courthouse on Monday, the scene outside had elements of a feisty political skirmish and a surreal circus rolled into one. The streets below the courtroom drew a mix of gawkers, activists and publicity hounds, along with a large contingent of journalists. Laura Loomer, a right-wing activist known for her aggressive tactics and closeness with Mr. Trump, led a chant of 'Donald Trump Did Nothing Wrong!' alongside Andrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and Trump lawyer. 'We're going to be here every single day talking to all you fake-news media freaks,' Ms. Loomer said through a Harvey Milk-style bullhorn in a video she posted on social media. 'And letting you know that Donald Trump did nothing wrong until you start reporting the truth.' Ms. Loomer described the case as a 'witch hunt' — a frequent assertion of Mr. Trump's — and criticized a key witness for the prosecution, Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, and the wife of the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan. Mr. Trump promptly reposted the video on Truth Social — despite a gag order that bars him from attacking witnesses in the case or Justice Merchan's family. His post, made during the lunch break, came shortly before Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month on prosecutors' request that Mr. Trump be held in contempt of court over statements they say violate the order. Performance artists also vied for attention. One, known as Crackhead Barney, stood screaming outside the gates surrounding Collect Pond Park that she had been kicked out, and demanded police officers' badge numbers. Another played the flute atop a park bench, notes drifting through the wind and his instrument glinting in the sunlight. Some anti-Trump demonstrators held handmade signs emblazoned with 'Loser' and 'Convict Trump Already,' while others tried to confront Ms. Loomer. One, Sue Scarlett Montgomery, asked reporters why they were paying attention to Ms. Loomer, a former Republican candidate for Congress who previously visited a treacherous migrant crossing in Panama as part of her anti-Muslim activism. 'They're covering me because I broke the story about this corrupt judge here,' Ms. Loomer shot back, attacking Judge Merchan's daughter, a Democratic political consultant who has also been a target of Mr. Trump. April 15, 2024, 4:15 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 4:15 p.m. ET The latest potential juror to be questioned reads The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, but is also the first person to say they are a New York Post reader. The Post was for decades Trump's favorite paper.  April 15, 2024, 4:13 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 4:13 p.m. ET Trump is holding up the jury questionnaire and squinting at it, appearing to follow along as the latest prospective juror answers the questions. April 15, 2024, 4:04 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 4:04 p.m. ET Merchan just excused a juror and then congratulated him on his child's upcoming wedding, in a brief moment of levity. 'Congratulations,' the judge said. 'Good luck.'

April 15, 2024, 3:49 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:49 p.m. ET Just a reminder: the potential jurors answering questions right now are merely those who have made it through an initial culling. They will ultimately be subjected to a more intense, more personal (and likely more political) round of questions by the defense and prosecution. April 15, 2024, 3:56 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:56 p.m. ET To prepare for that inevitability, Justice Merchan has already decided that certain topics are off-limits during jury selection: lawyers for both sides cannot ask who the prospective voters plan to vote for or have voted for in the past, their political party registration or past political contributions. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Everyone expected that picking a jury to try a polarizing figure like former President Donald J. Trump was going to be a challenge. But the experience of the first round of about 100 potential panelists gave a flavor of just how difficult the process could be: More than half told the judge that they could not hear the case against Mr. Trump fairly and were immediately excused. Justice Juan M. Merchan, who is presiding over the case, read aloud to the prospective jurors a list of people who might serve as witnesses or be mentioned during the trial, asking them whether they recognized the names. Many of those names were indeed very recognizable. Among those who could come up during the trial were Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump's former adviser, and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and one of Mr. Trump's lawyers. Several of Mr. Trump's relatives were also on the list, including his wife, Melania, his older daughter, Ivanka, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner.  April 15, 2024, 3:28 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:28 p.m. ET The first prospective juror is a young woman of color with a business degree who reads The New York Times and watches CNN. She seemed unbothered by the need to be fair and impartial and answered questions rapidly and almost nonchalantly. April 15, 2024, 3:45 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:45 p.m. ET The second prospective juror is a white creative director with glasses who lives in Midtown. Also a Times reader (thank you prospective juror). He did not answer with any surprises. When we start to get different answers to the final series of questions — which are more political and some of which concern Trump — is when we'll get something a little more interesting. April 15, 2024, 3:46 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:46 p.m. ET The third prospective juror, asked about her hobbies, said she likes to 'go to the club.' She said it in a playful voice, prompting a big laugh from reporters in the overflow room. April 15, 2024, 3:27 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:27 p.m. ET One thing that is striking: Trump has used the previous court appearances in other cases to project an image of grandeur. That is hard to do in this dingy courtroom, which smells slightly off and where he is an island amid a sea of people. April 15, 2024, 3:25 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:25 p.m. ET Prospective jurors who have not indicated that they wish to be dismissed are now being seated to answer the 42 questions that lawyers have agreed upon. They are being seated by jury identification number. April 15, 2024, 3:26 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:26 p.m. ET Trump is reading along with the juror questionnaire as the first possible juror, a young woman, ticks through her answers. April 15, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET Of the 96 possible jurors brought into the room, more than 50 raised their hands to say they couldn't be fair. They were immediately excused. April 15, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:11 p.m. ET Trump turned and stared at possible jurors as they raised their hands indicating they couldn't be fair in the case. April 15, 2024, 3:12 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:12 p.m. ET It's remarkable that more than half of the potential jurors brought in for a first round of questioning immediately said they could not hear Trump's case fairly. We knew that it would be hard to pick a jury, but a fail rate of 50 percent or higher right out of the gate is surpassingly rare.  April 15, 2024, 3:05 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 3:05 p.m. ET Among the notable names that the judge just read out as potential witnesses or people who could come up were Stephen K. Bannon, Rudy Giuliani, Melania Trump and Jared Kushner. Not all will appear as witnesses or even potentially be mentioned. But it certainly gives jurors a sense of the cast of characters.  The jury selection process in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan could take two weeks or more. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Lawyers representing the State of New York and Donald J. Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate. The potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair. The process could take two weeks or more — and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court. 'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.' The stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County — Manhattan, as most people know it — which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020. Mr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated. Prosecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28. Unlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.' Some may not be completely forthcoming. 'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said. Mr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors. 'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'     Former President Donald J. Trump smirked and scoffed during pretrial proceedings on Monday in Manhattan. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Former President Donald J. Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted Monday morning, as his lawyers and prosecutors hashed out pretrial motions before jury selection in his criminal case. Even as a judge was hearing arguments on last-minute issues in a criminal case that centers on salacious allegations and threatens to upend his bid for the presidency, Mr. Trump appeared to nod off a few times, his mouth going slack and his head drooping onto his chest. The former president's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, passed him notes for several minutes before Mr. Trump appeared to jolt awake and notice them. At other times, Mr. Trump whispered and exchanged notes with Mr. Blanche. He sat motionless while his own words from the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape — on which bragged about grabbing women's genitals — were read from a transcript by a prosecutor. At times, Mr. Trump's emotions were characteristically on display. He smirked and scoffed, and appeared frustrated when the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, did not immediately agree that he could miss court to attend the graduation of his youngest son, Barron. But when Justice Merchan warned that Mr. Trump could be ejected or thrown in jail if he disrupts the proceedings, the former president indicated that he understood. The only time Mr. Trump showed a flash of humor was when he laughed at one of his own social media posts, which attacked his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be the prosecution's central witness.  Former President Donald J. Trump's comments on the 'Access Hollywood' tape will allowed to be introduced as evidence. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times The judge in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial on Monday again refused to allow the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape to be played for jurors, but said that the comments Mr. Trump made on the tape could be introduced as evidence. On the tape, revealed in The Washington Post about a month before Mr. Trump was elected president in 2016, he is heard bragging about grabbing women's genitals, saying he could do so with abandon because 'when you're a star, they let you do it.' 'You can do anything,' Mr. Trump said on the recording. The tape rocked Mr. Trump's campaign. And prosecutors in Manhattan say it led him to agree to pay off Stormy Daniels, a porn star, who was shopping a story of a 2006 sexual encounter with the candidate. Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, paid Ms. Daniels $130,000. The payment is at the heart of the 34 felony charges against Mr. Trump, who is accused of falsifying business records to cover it up. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, had previously ruled that prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office could question witnesses about the tape, but found that it would be prejudicial to allow the actual video to the played. He reaffirmed that ruling on Monday. 'You can bring out what was said in the tape,' Justice Merchan said, adding that he didn't want jurors 'to hear Mr. Trump's voice and his gestures' in the tape. In a victory for the defense, the judge also ruled that the prosecution could not introduce evidence about sexual assault allegations against Mr. Trump that surfaced in the aftermath of the tape becoming public, calling them 'complete hearsay.' However, Justice Merchan said that prosecutors could introduce emails that followed the tape's disclosure, showing frantic efforts by Trump advisers to contain the fallout. The correspondence, he said, 'bolsters the people's claim that this was a crucial event.' Todd Blanche, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, had called on Justice Merchan to reconsider admitting 'this extremely salacious evidence,' which he described as 'very prejudicial.' Mr. Trump, who is again the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has denied any wrongdoing and has cast the case against him as politically motivated. Justice Juan M. Merchan has already reprimanded Donald J. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Inside a dreary Lower Manhattan courtroom on a recent Wednesday, Justice Juan M. Merchan convened a special session for people with mental health troubles who had landed in legal jeopardy. He calmly counseled them, praised any signs of progress and shook the hand of one man who, thanks to medication, had turned his life around. But a different type of criminal defendant is now testing the judge's equanimity: Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump's trial on charges that he covered up a sex scandal before and after the 2016 presidential election will bring a maelstrom that no other judge in New York's vast judiciary has ever experienced. Known as a no-nonsense, drama-averse jurist, Justice Merchan, 61, has already reprimanded Mr. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous and issued a gag order intended to protect prosecutors, witnesses and his own family from Mr. Trump's vitriol — and yet the former president has continued to post articles with pictures of the judge's daughter, a political consultant who has worked with Democratic candidates. Although Justice Merchan is a registered Democrat, records show he was previously a Republican, and people who know him described the judge as a moderate, law-and-order former prosecutor. Two people close to Justice Merchan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the judge had privately expressed pain over the attacks on his daughter, but the people said that those attacks won't compromise his ability to oversee the case. Other people who know the judge said that he will cast aside Mr. Trump's drama — and exert control over the trial. 'It is Judge Merchan's show,' said Jill Konviser, a retired judge who has known Justice Merchan for more than 15 years. She added: 'He will do everything he can to, one, control his courtroom and two, ensure a fair trial for the defendant.' In Justice Merchan's 17 years on the bench, 13 as presiding judge in the Mental Health Court he created, he has had his share of unusual cases. There was a murder trial involving a supposed curse on the defendant; the daredevils who jumped off the World Trade Center with parachutes; and a so-called soccer-mom madam accused of running a high-end brothel on the Upper East Side. In that case, an appeals court reduced the steep bail Justice Merchan had set, calling it 'unreasonable.' None of those defendants challenged the judge quite like Mr. Trump, who claims that the case is a witch hunt and declared that Justice Merchan's gag order had infringed on his First Amendment rights. The former president has tested the order's limits by posting articles that named and attacked Justice Merchan's daughter, Loren, and his wife, Lara. The articles, by the conservative activist Laura Loomer, included photos of Loren Merchan and copies of a 2007 mortgage statement for a house owned by Justice Merchan and his wife. Previously, Mr. Trump falsely accused Loren Merchan of posting an image of him behind bars on social media. The trial, which could last two months as a parade of former aides and allies takes the stand against him, will dominate Justice Merchan's calendar this spring. On off-days, he will continue to preside over Mental Health Court. The program is for defendants charged with felonies and diagnosed with a serious mental illness. People who are accepted enter a guilty plea and then begin a period of treatment and judicial supervision. Those who complete the program successfully can have their charges reduced or dismissed. During one recent session, Justice Merchan showed particular interest in the relationship between a defendant and his child, and praised him for his dedication. 'You want to do better by your daughter,' Justice Merchan said. 'I'm sure she's going to appreciate that.'  Donald J. Trump has repeatedly tried to have Juan M. Merchan removed as the judge in his case. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Juan M. Merchan, the judge overseeing Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan, has declined to step aside from the case, rejecting the former president's effort to delay the trial and attack his integrity. The judge announced the decision in the opening minutes of Mr. Trump's trial on Monday morning. After Justice Merchan rules on a variety of legal issues, the trial will begin in earnest with jury selection. 'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said Monday before rejecting the request. 'We want to follow the law,' he added. 'We want justice to be done.' Mr. Trump's lawyers had called on Justice Merchan to recuse himself in a recent court filing, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. The Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case that accuses Mr. Trump of falsifying records to conceal a sex scandal from voters, had argued that no conflict of interest existed. And judicial ethics experts cast doubt on Mr. Trump's request, noting that the judge was not responsible for his daughter's career. It was just the latest attempt by Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to both delay the trial and oust Justice Merchan. Nor will it be the last: In a separate civil action filed last week, Mr. Trump asked an appeals court to pause the case while it considers whether to remove Justice Merchan. It is a long-shot bid that a single appeals court judge rejected and will be likely to fail before a full five-judge panel. When Mr. Trump tried last year to have Justice Merchan kicked off the case, Justice Merchan rejected it then as well, citing a state advisory committee on judicial ethics that determined that his impartiality could not reasonably be questioned based on his daughter's interests. The repeated attempts reflect the former president's long-running effort to delay all four of his criminal cases past Election Day. Stalling is one of Mr. Trump's favored legal tactics, and he uses it liberally in Manhattan, as well as in the three other cities where he faces criminal charges. If Mr. Trump reclaims the White House, the criminal cases against him would most likely grind to a halt. In the attempt in appeals court to compel the judge's recusal, Emil Bove, a lawyer for the former president, argued that certain facts had changed since Justice Merchan first declined to step aside last year, including that Mr. Trump was now the presumptive Republican nominee for president. But a lawyer for the court system, Lisa Evans, said that there was no reason that the judge should step aside. 'There is absolutely no evidence to show that Judge Merchan will stand to benefit from the outcome of this trial,' Ms. Evans said.

Adam Gray/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The streets outside the Manhattan courtroom where former President Donald J. Trump was set to go on trial were buzzing with anticipation on Monday morning as a crush of reporters — and a trickle of protesters — gathered to bear witness. Right-wing activists were planning rallies in the park directly opposite the court, which was subject to a heavy police presence. Some journalists and line-sitters had arrived late Sunday night, staking out places in the line to secure limited spaces inside the court's overflow room, where most reporters were gathered. Cameras lined the sidewalks outside the courthouse, a glowering edifice at 100 Centre Street, just blocks from New York's City Hall. TV crews were going live in intervals since before dawn, even as the police manned metal barricades. As the sun rose, some anti-Trump demonstrators had arrived, including one toting a sign reading 'Loser,' a favorite insult of the former president. Nadine Seiler, 58, took a midnight bus from Waldorf, Md., to get to the courthouse by dawn. 'This is the first and possibly only trial he's going to be on,' she said, holding up a spray-painted sheet reading 'Convict Trump Already.' Mr. Trump also had fans outside the courthouse, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist who argued with an anti-Trump protester as a gaggle of journalists surrounded them. Andrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City and lawyer for Mr. Trump, also came by to show support, arguing that the trial was a political persecution. 'He's somebody who I consider to be a mentor, almost like an uncle to me,' said Mr. Giuliani. Noting Mr. Trump's status as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Mr. Giuliani claimed: 'They want to tie him up for months at a time.' Others were simply there to witness the moment. 'I think it's a really difficult moment in American history,' said Sue Scarlett Montgomery, a filmmaker. 'It's a sad day, but here we are.'  The first criminal trial of an American president officially began on Monday as prosecutors and defense lawyers convened in a Manhattan courtroom to start selecting the jury that will decide Donald J. Trump's fate. The initial pool of prospective jurors dwindled rapidly. More than half of the first group of 96 were dismissed in short order after indicating that they did not believe they could be impartial. Court adjourned for the day roughly two hours after jury selection began, with zero jurors chosen. Before beginning the arduous process of choosing a jury for the landmark trial — on allegations that Mr. Trump falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star — the judge overseeing the case once again declined to step aside, rejecting Mr. Trump's latest effort to oust him. But there was also a ruling that favored the former president: The judge, Juan M. Merchan, rejected a request by prosecutors to introduce accusations of sexual assault that women lodged against Mr. Trump years ago, calling them 'rumors' and 'complete gossip.' The Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case against Mr. Trump, also asked the judge to hold Mr. Trump in contempt and penalize him $3,000 for violating a gag order barring him from attacking witnesses in the case. On social media over the weekend, Mr. Trump assailed one of the prosecution's key witnesses: Michael D. Cohen, his former fixer. Mr. Cohen paid $130,000 to the porn star, Stormy Daniels, during the 2016 presidential campaign to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she said she had with Mr. Trump. After the lunch break — during which Mr. Trump posted a video of an ally yelling about the judge's wife — Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month to discuss potential violations of the gag order, which also bars Mr. Trump from attacking the judge's family. The jury selection process could take two weeks or more, and the trial may spill into June. Mr. Trump is expected to be in the courtroom for much of it. Mr. Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted during pretrial arguments on Monday, sometimes smirking and scoffing, but also appearing to nod off, his mouth slack and his head drooping to his chest. After the trial got underway in the afternoon, he chuckled when Justice Merchan told the first group of 96 prospective jurors that he would ensure a fair trial. Mr. Trump, who might take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied the sexual encounter with Ms. Daniels. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records to hide the reimbursements to Mr. Cohen. They argue the payment to Ms. Daniels was part of a pattern: Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election. Here's what else to know about Mr. Trump's trial: This is the Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump, and it was brought by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a year ago. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. The case, one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America. Mr. Trump's team will be looking for red needles in a blue haystack.\nMr. Trump has twice sought Justice Merchan's recusal, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. Justice Merchan has declined to step aside, noting a ruling by a judicial ethics commission that found his daughter's work posed no conflict for him. 'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said in court on Monday, adding, 'we want to follow the law, we want justice to be done.' Mr. Trump has also attacked the judge's daughter on social media.\nHundreds of potential jurors have been summoned. Those who say they cannot be fair or otherwise serve are being excused, and the remaining prospective jurors will answer 42 questions compiled before the trial. Lawyers on both sides will be able to remove a limited number of them without explanation. The lawyers can also ask to remove a potential juror 'for cause' by providing specific reasons they believe that person cannot be fair. In addition to the payment to Ms. Daniels, Mr. Bragg's office is expected to highlight two other deals involving The National Enquirer, a tabloid that has longstanding ties to Mr. Trump. In one deal, the tabloid bought the silence of a man who had heard that Mr. Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock, a rumor that turned out to be false, and in the other, it paid Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, who wanted to sell her story of an affair with Mr. Trump.\nThe prosecution's witness list is expected to include David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, as well as Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal could also testify. Prospective jurors will answer a uniform set of questions aimed at discerning bias for or against the former president. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Follow our live coverage of Trump's hush money trial . The hundreds of New Yorkers who report for jury duty Monday morning in Manhattan will embark on an experience not found in history books: They will be vetted as jurors for the trial of a former U.S. president. The task won't be easy. Lawyers for Donald J. Trump and prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney's office will narrow the pool to 12 jurors and several alternates. Both sides will try to discern biases that could alter the outcome of the trial, posing dozens of questions that have been discussed and debated for weeks. The jurors, for their part, will be expected to answer each question honestly in an intimidating environment, just steps away from the former president, who is expected to attend much of the trial. Here's what we know about the process: The jury pool is composed of Manhattanites. Beyond that, little about the group is known, even by prosecutors and defense lawyers. Both sides will use the next several days, or weeks, to find out all they can. Because New York State does not allow juries to operate in full anonymity, the parties, including the former president, will know the jurors' names. The lawyers will also have access to their addresses. (Mr. Trump will not.) The public may never know the jurors' names. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, granted the prosecutors' request to withhold them. After reading a summary of the allegations, Justice Merchan will ask the prospective jurors whether they believe they can be fair and impartial. They will also be asked if they have any scheduling conflicts that would prevent them from attending every day of the trial, which could last more than six weeks. Those who raise concerns will most likely be removed from the pool. The jurors who remain will all be asked the same set of questions. One by one, they will talk — briefly and vaguely — about what they do for a living, their education and their families. They will be asked where they get their news, what radio and podcasts they listen to and whether they've read books written by Mr. Trump or his former fixer Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be a central witness. Other questions will be more pointed. Jurors will be asked if they've ever volunteered or attended a campaign event for Mr. Trump or one of his opponents. They will also be asked to divulge feelings or opinions they have about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case. But the jurors will not be asked how they voted in past elections, whom they plan to vote for, whether they have made political contributions or their party registration. Mr. Trump's legal team and prosecutors for the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, can challenge the inclusion of prospective jurors by providing specific reasons they believe a juror cannot be fair and impartial. The judge has the final say. Both sides will also receive a certain number of chances to remove jurors without explanation. After all of the challenged jurors are removed from the jury pool, Justice Merchan will seat the jury with those who remain. If Mr. Trump's behavior at previous trials is any guide, he is likely to be very involved in jury selection. In a previous defamation case, Mr. Trump was fixated on the jurors from the moment they walked into the courtroom. He pivoted in his chair to study them as they answered biographical questions. He frequently talked to his attorneys. But Mr. Trump's comments about the jurors in this case should start and stop in the courtroom. In addition to being ordered not to reveal their names, Mr. Trump is also subject to a gag order issued by Justice Merchan preventing him from making public statements about them.  © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nDonald J. Trump's lawyers faced an uphill battle Monday with Justice Juan M. Merchan, a no-nonsense jurist. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab courtroom in New York City while Mr. Trump looked on.\nMr. Trump was charged in Manhattan, a deeply Democratic county and his former home, with falsifying nearly three dozen business records in an attempt to cover up a payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, who has said she had a brief sexual encounter with him in 2006.\nMr. Trump denies that encounter happened, and has declared his innocence, calling the charges politically motivated. He has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a Democrat, who also attended the first day of trial on Monday.\nMr. Trump faces 34 felony counts and could face probation or up to four years of prison time.\nThe trial, which is expected to last weeks, has a fascinating list of potential witnesses: Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer turned apostate, who made the payment; Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who says she, too, had an affair with Mr. Trump; and Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels herself may testify.\nBefore any of that happens, a jury must be selected, a winnowing that began Monday.\nHere are five takeaways from Mr. Trump's first day on trial:\nJustice Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, has been consistent about batting back defense motions on issues including the tardy disclosure of documents by prosecutors and efforts to delay or even dismiss the case.\nThat pattern continued on Monday, as Justice Merchan rejected a defense effort to force his recusal. The defense had cited several issues, including the fact that his daughter is a Democratic political consultant.\nHe also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost.\nBut Mr. Trump's lawyers convinced Justice Merchan that sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the so-called Access Hollywood tape, in which Mr. Trump was caught bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial, calling them 'complete rumors, complete gossip, completely hearsay.'\nJustice Merchan's decisions on Monday made it clear that the trial will resurface unsavory events in the former president's life.\nThose include the Access Hollywood tape and other stories that Mr. Trump sought to suppress including an alleged affair with Ms. McDougal. Justice Merchan said on Monday that both could be discussed.\nIn a minor victory for the defense, the judge reaffirmed that the 'Access Hollywood' tape itself could not be played, but that Trump's exact words could be entered into the record.\nStill, most of Mr. Merchan's rulings indicated that salacious details of Mr. Trump's biography will be heard in court.\nEntering the courtroom, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here.'\nOnce he was in front of Mr. Merchan, Mr. Trump looked a lot less enthusiastic. He slouched. He scowled. He scoffed. And he was quiet, not the norm for a man who built a political career with his gift for slashing attacks and vicious put-downs.\nIn court, the former president spoke only briefly, when asked a few questions by Justice Merchan about procedural matters, and whether he understood the consequences — ejection or jail — if he interrupted proceedings. He did whisper with his lawyers. And when the prosecution played a recording of him claiming to have great respect for women, he mouthed the word 'true.'\nBut all in all, it seems it could be an exhausting experience for Mr. Trump; at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep.\nIt's easy to forget how long it takes to do a little in legal settings. On Monday, the morning session was dominated by maneuvering by prosecutors and the defense, even as prospective jurors waited. By lunch, they were still waiting.\nJury selection could take days or weeks, and the trial itself may take two months. The Passover holiday could cause delays, Justice Merchan said, though he might make some of that up by holding hearings on court matters on Wednesdays, which was previously going to be an off day.\nBy afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into Justice Merchan's courtroom. He warmly welcomed them, introduced the lawyers and Mr. Trump and read them a summary of the case.\nJustice Merchan asked if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president. Of the 96 prospective jurors in the room at that time, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused.\nThe remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.\nApril 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 5:15 p.m. ET Trump spoke briefly to TV cameras after court adjourned for the day, repeating his longstanding claims that the trial is a 'political witch hunt' before heading to his motorcade and departing the courthouse.\nVideo Reporter: [inaudible] the trial — [inaudible] So thank you very much.

Trump's first criminal trial began inside a Manhattan courthouse on Monday, the scene outside had elements of a feisty political skirmish and a surreal circus rolled into one.\nThe streets below the courtroom drew a mix of gawkers, activists and publicity hounds, along with a large contingent of journalists.\nLaura Loomer, a right-wing activist known for her aggressive tactics and closeness with Mr. Trump, led a chant of 'Donald Trump Did Nothing Wrong!' alongside Andrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and Trump lawyer.\n'We're going to be here every single day talking to all you fake-news media freaks,' Ms. Loomer said through a Harvey Milk-style bullhorn in a video she posted on social media. 'And letting you know that Donald Trump did nothing wrong until you start reporting the truth.'\nMs. Loomer described the case as a 'witch hunt' — a frequent assertion of Mr. Trump's — and criticized a key witness for the prosecution, Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, and the wife of the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan.\nMr. Trump promptly reposted the video on Truth Social — despite a gag order that bars him from attacking witnesses in the case or Justice Merchan's family. His post, made during the lunch break, came shortly before Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month on prosecutors' request that Mr. Trump be held in contempt of court over statements they say violate the order.\nPerformance artists also vied for attention. One, known as Crackhead Barney, stood screaming outside the gates surrounding Collect Pond Park that she had been kicked out, and demanded police officers' badge numbers. Another played the flute atop a park bench, notes drifting through the wind and his instrument glinting in the sunlight.\nSome anti-Trump demonstrators held handmade signs emblazoned with 'Loser' and 'Convict Trump Already,' while others tried to confront Ms. Loomer. One, Sue Scarlett Montgomery, asked reporters why they were paying attention to Ms. Loomer, a former Republican candidate for Congress who previously visited a treacherous migrant crossing in Panama as part of her anti-Muslim activism.\n'They're covering me because I broke the story about this corrupt judge here,' Ms. Loomer shot back, attacking Judge Merchan's daughter, a Democratic political consultant who has also been a target of Mr. Trump.\nApril 15, 2024, 4:15 p.m. ET April 15, 2024, 4:15 p.m. ET The latest potential juror to be questioned reads The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, but is also the first person to say they are a New York Post reader.

Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate.\nThe potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair.\nThe process could take two weeks or more — and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court.\n'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.'\nThe stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County — Manhattan, as most people know it — which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020.\nMr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions.\nMr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated.\nProsecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28.\nUnlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.'\nSome may not be completely forthcoming.\n'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said.\nMr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors.\n'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J.

Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted Monday morning, as his lawyers and prosecutors hashed out pretrial motions before jury selection in his criminal case.\nEven as a judge was hearing arguments on last-minute issues in a criminal case that centers on salacious allegations and threatens to upend his bid for the presidency, Mr. Trump appeared to nod off a few times, his mouth going slack and his head drooping onto his chest.\nThe former president's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, passed him notes for several minutes before Mr. Trump appeared to jolt awake and notice them.\nAt other times, Mr. Trump whispered and exchanged notes with Mr. Blanche. He sat motionless while his own words from the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape — on which bragged about grabbing women's genitals — were read from a transcript by a prosecutor.\nAt times, Mr. Trump's emotions were characteristically on display. He smirked and scoffed, and appeared frustrated when the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, did not immediately agree that he could miss court to attend the graduation of his youngest son, Barron.\nBut when Justice Merchan warned that Mr. Trump could be ejected or thrown in jail if he disrupts the proceedings, the former president indicated that he understood.\nThe only time Mr. Trump showed a flash of humor was when he laughed at one of his own social media posts, which attacked his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be the prosecution's central witness.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J. Trump's comments on the 'Access Hollywood' tape will allowed to be introduced as evidence. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times The judge in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial on Monday again refused to allow the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape to be played for jurors, but said that the comments Mr. Trump made on the tape could be introduced as evidence.\nOn the tape, revealed in The Washington Post about a month before Mr. Trump was elected president in 2016, he is heard bragging about grabbing women's genitals, saying he could do so with abandon because 'when you're a star, they let you do it.'\n'You can do anything,' Mr. Trump said on the recording.\nThe tape rocked Mr. Trump's campaign. And prosecutors in Manhattan say it led him to agree to pay off Stormy Daniels, a porn star, who was shopping a story of a 2006 sexual encounter with the candidate.\nMichael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former fixer, paid Ms. Daniels $130,000. The payment is at the heart of the 34 felony charges against Mr. Trump, who is accused of falsifying business records to cover it up.\nThe judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, had previously ruled that prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office could question witnesses about the tape, but found that it would be prejudicial to allow the actual video to the played. He reaffirmed that ruling on Monday.\n'You can bring out what was said in the tape,' Justice Merchan said, adding that he didn't want jurors 'to hear Mr. Trump's voice and his gestures' in the tape.\nIn a victory for the defense, the judge also ruled that the prosecution could not introduce evidence about sexual assault allegations against Mr. Trump that surfaced in the aftermath of the tape becoming public, calling them 'complete hearsay.'\nHowever, Justice Merchan said that prosecutors could introduce emails that followed the tape's disclosure, showing frantic efforts by Trump advisers to contain the fallout. The correspondence, he said, 'bolsters the people's claim that this was a crucial event.'\nTodd Blanche, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, had called on Justice Merchan to reconsider admitting 'this extremely salacious evidence,' which he described as 'very prejudicial.'\nMr. Trump, who is again the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has denied any wrongdoing and has cast the case against him as politically motivated.\nJustice Juan M.

Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Inside a dreary Lower Manhattan courtroom on a recent Wednesday, Justice Juan M. Merchan convened a special session for people with mental health troubles who had landed in legal jeopardy. He calmly counseled them, praised any signs of progress and shook the hand of one man who, thanks to medication, had turned his life around.\nBut a different type of criminal defendant is now testing the judge's equanimity: Donald J. Trump.\nMr. Trump's trial on charges that he covered up a sex scandal before and after the 2016 presidential election will bring a maelstrom that no other judge in New York's vast judiciary has ever experienced.\nKnown as a no-nonsense, drama-averse jurist, Justice Merchan, 61, has already reprimanded Mr. Trump's lawyers for arguments that he considered frivolous and issued a gag order intended to protect prosecutors, witnesses and his own family from Mr. Trump's vitriol — and yet the former president has continued to post articles with pictures of the judge's daughter, a political consultant who has worked with Democratic candidates.\nAlthough Justice Merchan is a registered Democrat, records show he was previously a Republican, and people who know him described the judge as a moderate, law-and-order former prosecutor.\nTwo people close to Justice Merchan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the judge had privately expressed pain over the attacks on his daughter, but the people said that those attacks won't compromise his ability to oversee the case. Other people who know the judge said that he will cast aside Mr. Trump's drama — and exert control over the trial.\n'It is Judge Merchan's show,' said Jill Konviser, a retired judge who has known Justice Merchan for more than 15 years. She added: 'He will do everything he can to, one, control his courtroom and two, ensure a fair trial for the defendant.'\nIn Justice Merchan's 17 years on the bench, 13 as presiding judge in the Mental Health Court he created, he has had his share of unusual cases. There was a murder trial involving a supposed curse on the defendant; the daredevils who jumped off the World Trade Center with parachutes; and a so-called soccer-mom madam accused of running a high-end brothel on the Upper East Side. In that case, an appeals court reduced the steep bail Justice Merchan had set, calling it 'unreasonable.'\nNone of those defendants challenged the judge quite like Mr. Trump, who claims that the case is a witch hunt and declared that Justice Merchan's gag order had infringed on his First Amendment rights.\nThe former president has tested the order's limits by posting articles that named and attacked Justice Merchan's daughter, Loren, and his wife, Lara. The articles, by the conservative activist Laura Loomer, included photos of Loren Merchan and copies of a 2007 mortgage statement for a house owned by Justice Merchan and his wife. Previously, Mr. Trump falsely accused Loren Merchan of posting an image of him behind bars on social media.\nThe trial, which could last two months as a parade of former aides and allies takes the stand against him, will dominate Justice Merchan's calendar this spring.\nOn off-days, he will continue to preside over Mental Health Court. The program is for defendants charged with felonies and diagnosed with a serious mental illness. People who are accepted enter a guilty plea and then begin a period of treatment and judicial supervision. Those who complete the program successfully can have their charges reduced or dismissed.\nDuring one recent session, Justice Merchan showed particular interest in the relationship between a defendant and his child, and praised him for his dedication.\n'You want to do better by your daughter,' Justice Merchan said. 'I'm sure she's going to appreciate that.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Donald J. Trump has repeatedly tried to have Juan M. Merchan removed as the judge in his case. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times Juan M. Merchan, the judge overseeing Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan, has declined to step aside from the case, rejecting the former president's effort to delay the trial and attack his integrity.\nThe judge announced the decision in the opening minutes of Mr. Trump's trial on Monday morning. After Justice Merchan rules on a variety of legal issues, the trial will begin in earnest with jury selection.\n'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said Monday before rejecting the request. 'We want to follow the law,' he added. 'We want justice to be done.'\nMr. Trump's lawyers had called on Justice Merchan to recuse himself in a recent court filing, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant.\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case that accuses Mr. Trump of falsifying records to conceal a sex scandal from voters, had argued that no conflict of interest existed. And judicial ethics experts cast doubt on Mr. Trump's request, noting that the judge was not responsible for his daughter's career.\nIt was just the latest attempt by Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to both delay the trial and oust Justice Merchan. Nor will it be the last: In a separate civil action filed last week, Mr. Trump asked an appeals court to pause the case while it considers whether to remove Justice Merchan. It is a long-shot bid that a single appeals court judge rejected and will be likely to fail before a full five-judge panel.\nWhen Mr. Trump tried last year to have Justice Merchan kicked off the case, Justice Merchan rejected it then as well, citing a state advisory committee on judicial ethics that determined that his impartiality could not reasonably be questioned based on his daughter's interests.\nThe repeated attempts reflect the former president's long-running effort to delay all four of his criminal cases past Election Day. Stalling is one of Mr. Trump's favored legal tactics, and he uses it liberally in Manhattan, as well as in the three other cities where he faces criminal charges. If Mr. Trump reclaims the White House, the criminal cases against him would most likely grind to a halt.\nIn the attempt in appeals court to compel the judge's recusal, Emil Bove, a lawyer for the former president, argued that certain facts had changed since Justice Merchan first declined to step aside last year, including that Mr. Trump was now the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\nBut a lawyer for the court system, Lisa Evans, said that there was no reason that the judge should step aside.\n'There is absolutely no evidence to show that Judge Merchan will stand to benefit from the outcome of this trial,' Ms. Evans said.\nVideo transcript\nTrump Supporters Rally Outside New York Courthouse Pro-Trump protesters gathered near the Manhattan courthouse where the former president's criminal trial is taking place.

Adam Gray/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The streets outside the Manhattan courtroom where former President Donald J. Trump was set to go on trial were buzzing with anticipation on Monday morning as a crush of reporters — and a trickle of protesters — gathered to bear witness.\nRight-wing activists were planning rallies in the park directly opposite the court, which was subject to a heavy police presence. Some journalists and line-sitters had arrived late Sunday night, staking out places in the line to secure limited spaces inside the court's overflow room, where most reporters were gathered.\nCameras lined the sidewalks outside the courthouse, a glowering edifice at 100 Centre Street, just blocks from New York's City Hall. TV crews were going live in intervals since before dawn, even as the police manned metal barricades. As the sun rose, some anti-Trump demonstrators had arrived, including one toting a sign reading 'Loser,' a favorite insult of the former president.\nNadine Seiler, 58, took a midnight bus from Waldorf, Md., to get to the courthouse by dawn. 'This is the first and possibly only trial he's going to be on,' she said, holding up a spray-painted sheet reading 'Convict Trump Already.'\nMr. Trump also had fans outside the courthouse, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist who argued with an anti-Trump protester as a gaggle of journalists surrounded them.\nAndrew Giuliani, the son of Rudy Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City and lawyer for Mr. Trump, also came by to show support, arguing that the trial was a political persecution.\n'He's somebody who I consider to be a mentor, almost like an uncle to me,' said Mr. Giuliani.\nNoting Mr. Trump's status as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Mr. Giuliani claimed: 'They want to tie him up for months at a time.'\nOthers were simply there to witness the moment. 'I think it's a really difficult moment in American history,' said Sue Scarlett Montgomery, a filmmaker. 'It's a sad day, but here we are.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT The first criminal trial of an American president officially began on Monday as prosecutors and defense lawyers convened in a Manhattan courtroom to start selecting the jury that will decide Donald J. Trump's fate.\nThe initial pool of prospective jurors dwindled rapidly. More than half of the first group of 96 were dismissed in short order after indicating that they did not believe they could be impartial. Court adjourned for the day roughly two hours after jury selection began, with zero jurors chosen.\nBefore beginning the arduous process of choosing a jury for the landmark trial — on allegations that Mr. Trump falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star — the judge overseeing the case once again declined to step aside, rejecting Mr. Trump's latest effort to oust him.\nBut there was also a ruling that favored the former president: The judge, Juan M. Merchan, rejected a request by prosecutors to introduce accusations of sexual assault that women lodged against Mr. Trump years ago, calling them 'rumors' and 'complete gossip.'\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case against Mr. Trump, also asked the judge to hold Mr. Trump in contempt and penalize him $3,000 for violating a gag order barring him from attacking witnesses in the case.\nOn social media over the weekend, Mr. Trump assailed one of the prosecution's key witnesses: Michael D. Cohen, his former fixer. Mr. Cohen paid $130,000 to the porn star, Stormy Daniels, during the 2016 presidential campaign to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she said she had with Mr. Trump.\nAfter the lunch break — during which Mr. Trump posted a video of an ally yelling about the judge's wife — Justice Merchan said he would hold a hearing later this month to discuss potential violations of the gag order, which also bars Mr. Trump from attacking the judge's family.\nThe jury selection process could take two weeks or more, and the trial may spill into June. Mr. Trump is expected to be in the courtroom for much of it.\nMr. Trump seemed alternately irritated and exhausted during pretrial arguments on Monday, sometimes smirking and scoffing, but also appearing to nod off, his mouth slack and his head drooping to his chest. After the trial got underway in the afternoon, he chuckled when Justice Merchan told the first group of 96 prospective jurors that he would ensure a fair trial.\nMr. Trump, who might take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied the sexual encounter with Ms. Daniels. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records to hide the reimbursements to Mr. Cohen. They argue the payment to Ms. Daniels was part of a pattern: Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election.\nHere's what else to know about Mr. Trump's trial:\nThis is the Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump, and it was brought by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, a year ago. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. The case, one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America. Mr. Trump's team will be looking for red needles in a blue haystack.\nMr. Trump has twice sought Justice Merchan's recusal, citing his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. Justice Merchan has declined to step aside, noting a ruling by a judicial ethics commission that found his daughter's work posed no conflict for him. 'There is no agenda here,' Justice Merchan said in court on Monday, adding, 'we want to follow the law, we want justice to be done.' Mr. Trump has also attacked the judge's daughter on social media.\nHundreds of potential jurors have been summoned. Those who say they cannot be fair or otherwise serve are being excused, and the remaining prospective jurors will answer 42 questions compiled before the trial. Lawyers on both sides will be able to remove a limited number of them without explanation. The lawyers can also ask to remove a potential juror 'for cause' by providing specific reasons they believe that person cannot be fair.\nIn addition to the payment to Ms. Daniels, Mr. Bragg's office is expected to highlight two other deals involving The National Enquirer, a tabloid that has longstanding ties to Mr. Trump. In one deal, the tabloid bought the silence of a man who had heard that Mr. Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock, a rumor that turned out to be false, and in the other, it paid Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, who wanted to sell her story of an affair with Mr. Trump.\nThe prosecution's witness list is expected to include David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, as well as Hope Hicks, a former aide to Mr. Trump. Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal could also testify.\nProspective jurors will answer a uniform set of questions aimed at discerning bias for or against the former president. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Follow our live coverage of Trump's hush money trial .\nFollow our live coverage of Trump's hush money trial . The hundreds of New Yorkers who report for jury duty Monday morning in Manhattan will embark on an experience not found in history books: They will be vetted as jurors for the trial of a former U.S. president.\nThe task won't be easy. Lawyers for Donald J. Trump and prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney's office will narrow the pool to 12 jurors and several alternates. Both sides will try to discern biases that could alter the outcome of the trial, posing dozens of questions that have been discussed and debated for weeks.\nThe jurors, for their part, will be expected to answer each question honestly in an intimidating environment, just steps away from the former president, who is expected to attend much of the trial.\nHere's what we know about the process:\nThe jury pool is composed of Manhattanites. Beyond that, little about the group is known, even by prosecutors and defense lawyers. Both sides will use the next several days, or weeks, to find out all they can.\nBecause New York State does not allow juries to operate in full anonymity, the parties, including the former president, will know the jurors' names. The lawyers will also have access to their addresses. (Mr. Trump will not.)\nThe public may never know the jurors' names. The judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, granted the prosecutors' request to withhold them.\nAfter reading a summary of the allegations, Justice Merchan will ask the prospective jurors whether they believe they can be fair and impartial. They will also be asked if they have any scheduling conflicts that would prevent them from attending every day of the trial, which could last more than six weeks. Those who raise concerns will most likely be removed from the pool.\nThe jurors who remain will all be asked the same set of questions. One by one, they will talk — briefly and vaguely — about what they do for a living, their education and their families. They will be asked where they get their news, what radio and podcasts they listen to and whether they've read books written by Mr. Trump or his former fixer Michael D. Cohen, who is expected to be a central witness.\nOther questions will be more pointed. Jurors will be asked if they've ever volunteered or attended a campaign event for Mr. Trump or one of his opponents. They will also be asked to divulge feelings or opinions they have about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case.\nBut the jurors will not be asked how they voted in past elections, whom they plan to vote for, whether they have made political contributions or their party registration.\nMr. Trump's legal team and prosecutors for the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, can challenge the inclusion of prospective jurors by providing specific reasons they believe a juror cannot be fair and impartial. The judge has the final say.\nBoth sides will also receive a certain number of chances to remove jurors without explanation. After all of the challenged jurors are removed from the jury pool, Justice Merchan will seat the jury with those who remain.\nIf Mr. Trump's behavior at previous trials is any guide, he is likely to be very involved in jury selection. In a previous defamation case, Mr. Trump was fixated on the jurors from the moment they walked into the courtroom. He pivoted in his chair to study them as they answered biographical questions. He frequently talked to his attorneys.\nBut Mr. Trump's comments about the jurors in this case should start and stop in the courtroom. In addition to being ordered not to reveal their names, Mr. Trump is also subject to a gag order issued by Justice Merchan preventing him from making public statements about them.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",

Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, told CBS that President Biden needed to ensure 'that young people feel included in the conversation, not just as a vote but as part of the governing coalition.' He added, 'I think part of the frustration by young people is that they oftentimes don't feel heard. They feel like their voices and their votes are taken advantage of come election time.' He said he thought Biden had taken steps toward including them. April 21, 2024, 12:15 p.m. ET April 21, 2024, 12:15 p.m. ET Representative Tony Gonzales, a Republican of Texas whose district encompasses a vast swath of the U.S.-Mexico border, delivered a harsh criticism of his hard-right G.O.P. colleagues who voted against the military aid package to U.S. allies, comparing some members with the Ku Klux Klan. 'The way to take out the bully is to bloody their nose,' he said after saying that the days where rank-and-file members were 'kind of easygoing' and 'put their head down' were over. 'The fight is here,' he added. April 21, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET April 21, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a Republican vice-presidential contender who supported federal abortion bans when she was in Congress, told CNN that she didn't anymore because the overturning of Roe v. Wade 'returned the power back to the states.' She then sought to distance herself from her own state's law, which bans abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest, saying it was passed before she became governor. April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET Asked on CNN if Biden should debate Trump, Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Democrat of Illinois, said Biden was 'a terrific debater' but Trump 'lies and lies and lies, and it's so hard to respond to that in the middle of a debate.' He added, 'Do you talk about what you want to do for the future, or do you respond to the lies that have come out of Donald Trump's mouth every minute? So I'm concerned about that, just to be honest with you.' April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET April 21, 2024, 11:56 a.m. ET Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a potential vice-presidential pick for Donald Trump, refused to say on CNN whether she would have certified the 2020 election as Mike Pence did on Jan. 6. 'That was the day we hope we never see again,' she said. 'We did not do justice by our country by showing and fighting over that day. We should focus on our freedoms and continue to uphold our Constitution. So talking in hypotheticals is not something that I do.' President Trump's campaign committee ended March with $45 million on hand, up from $33.5 million at the end of February, an improvement as he seeks to close the formidable fund-raising gap with President Biden, whose campaign had $85.5 million. It's not just about donors, though: The Trump campaign's spending has slowed – in March, it spent just $3.7 million, compared with $29.2 million spent by the Biden campaign. Credit... Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a potential vice-presidential pick for former President Donald J. Trump, refused to say on Sunday whether she would have certified the 2020 election if she had been in Vice President Mike Pence's position. She also dodged questions about whether she supported exceptions to abortion bans for rape and incest. 'You can go back and keep talking about Jan. 6, but the fact of the matter is that was a day we hope we never see again here in this country,' Ms. Noem said on CNN. 'We did not do justice by our country by showing and fighting over that day. We should focus on our freedoms and continue to uphold our Constitution. So talking in hypotheticals is not something that I do.' When the interviewer, Dana Bash, pressed her on whether Mr. Pence had been wrong to certify the election results, Ms. Noem again avoided a direct answer, instead criticizing Mr. Pence for denouncing Mr. Trump after Jan. 6. 'I wasn't in Mike Pence's shoes, and the information that he had at that time — I don't know how he based his decisions,' she said. 'I think he's a nice man. I think that he's failed Donald Trump since that day, because he certainly does not recognize that we need someone in the White House who needs him out on the trail advocating for him, instead of constantly criticizing and going back and ripping him apart.' On abortion, Ms. Noem, who supported a federal ban when she was a member of Congress, said she now believed restrictions should be left to individual states. That is the position Mr. Trump took this month, though his allies have developed plans that could functionally ban abortion nationwide without formally doing so. Mr. Trump has also expressed support for rape and incest exceptions, which South Dakota's near-total abortion ban does not include. When asked about that, Ms. Noem tried to distance herself from her own state's law, noting that it was a 'trigger ban' enacted years ago to take effect if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 'The law in my state was passed decades before I ever became governor,' she said, adding: 'That may be a topic that will continue to be discussed in South Dakota. Our law today allows an exception to save the life of the mother, but the people in South Dakota will decide what their laws look like.' She did not give a clear answer when Ms. Bash asked what she believed South Dakota's laws should look like. 'I can have an opinion, and I can weigh forward and I can look at the science and what we've learned about babies in the womb and believe that we should protect life, but I think that our law today is what South Dakota wants,' she said. 'And they'll continue to have that debate, and I'll continue to follow through on my role, which is to make sure the will of the people is enforced.' Ms. Bash repeated her question, and Ms. Noem implied — but did not say outright — that she might oppose a rape and incest exception. 'We have a law that says that there is an exception for the life of the mother, and I just don't believe a tragedy should perpetuate another tragedy,' she said. Versions of that statement are common among people who believe abortion should be illegal even in cases of rape and incest. 'I believe in taking care of mothers that are in a crisis situation and that we should be locking alongside them, giving them all the information and the best information they can make before they have to be put in a situation where an abortion is the only option that they have,' she added. Ms. Noem also echoed Mr. Trump's claims that the criminal charges against him in New York — where his trial began last week — were political, and affirmed that she would support him even if he were convicted of felonies. 'When he was in the White House, every single day as governor, I got to be on offense, I got to solve problems,' she said. 'And since Joe Biden has been in the White House, I just have to defend the freedoms of my people in South Dakota. I'm every day trying to push back on what this federal government is trying to do by increasing costs for the everyday families that get up every day and go to work. So yes, Donald Trump should be back in that White House. I'm going to do all I can to help him win.' Credit... Chris Seward/Associated Press Former President Donald J. Trump's presidential campaign committee ended March with $45 million on hand, federal filings showed Saturday, as he tries to close the fund-raising gap with President Biden. But Mr. Trump's campaign is spending much less than it was at the start of the year, which has helped it inch closer. In March, it spent just $3.7 million, the new filings show, compared with $11.4 million in January — and much less than the $29.2 million spent by Mr. Biden's campaign in March. In other words, Mr. Trump's campaign is guarding resources as it seeks to build a campaign war chest for the general election. This cycle began with the announcement of former President Donald J. Trump's campaign in November 2022 and President Biden's in April 2023. Raised $43.8 $158.5 $15.3 $114.7 Spent $29.2 $74.3 $4 $70.1 Net cash $85.5 — $44.6 — Mr. Biden's campaign had $85.5 million on hand at the end of March, according to its monthly filing with the Federal Election Commission, a significant increase from the month before: He ended February with $71 million in his campaign account while Mr. Trump ended February with less than half that. As Mr. Trump and Republicans chase the Democrats' financial edge, Mr. Biden has also started to narrow the polling gap between himself and Mr. Trump. Since late February, the president has cut a deficit of five percentage points to a single point, a virtual tie, according to a recent survey by The New York Times and Siena College. The rivals each capitalized on splashy fund-raisers in the past month that brought in tens of millions of dollars for their respective campaigns. But Mr. Trump's haul from an April 6 event in Palm Beach, Fla., will be reflected on a future filing. His campaign reported that it and the Republican National Committee raked in more than $50.5 million from the dinner, which was held at the home of the billionaire John Paulson. The total nearly doubled the $26 million that Mr. Biden's campaign said it raised on March 28 at Radio City Music Hall in New York, a star-studded event headlined by the president and two former presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Those funds were included in Mr. Biden's March fund-raising numbers. Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump are primarily raising money though joint fund-raising agreements with their respective parties, arrangements that legally allow them to pull in hundreds of thousands of dollars from individual donors, some of which flows into their campaigns. Joint fund-raising committees for both candidates filed reports with the Federal Election Commission this week, providing the first details of 2024 of major donors to both candidates, and the total scale of their fund-raising haul. But the F.E.C. reports for presidential campaigns, which are filed monthly in election years, offer different insights about candidates' activities and how the committees backing them are spending money. By the end of the 2020 cycle Biden had raised and spent more than $1 billion and Trump more than $700 million dollars. For example, federal law guarantees political campaigns bottom-dollar rates for broadcast advertising, so campaign committees are often used to pay for television time. In the first three months of 2024, Mr. Biden's campaign has spent $45.2 million on media buys and production, filings show — more than half of its total of $74.1 million in spending. The Biden campaign has spent $6.9 million on payroll and related expenses, and an additional $6.9 million on 'text message outreach.' His campaign's spending shot up in March, after two relatively steady months. In contrast, Mr. Trump's campaign spending has slowed sharply since the beginning of the year, when he was still fending off Republican primary challengers. Since Jan. 1, Mr. Trump's campaign has spent $23 million — but just $3.7 million of that was in March. His campaign has paid $6 million for placed media this year, all of it before Super Tuesday. One of Mr. Trump's committees — a leadership PAC called Save America, which he has used to pay his legal bills — reported on Saturday that it had almost $4.1 million on hand at the end of March, roughly the same amount as it had at the end of February. The group spent $5 million in March, including $3.7 million in bills to the legal teams defending him. Mr. Trump's campaign itself also paid about $473,000 in legal expenses. A super PAC backing Mr. Trump, MAGA Inc., reported raising $14.4 million in March, including a $5 million contribution from the former Trump cabinet official Linda McMahon and $4.2 million from Robert T. Bigelow, an aerospace and real estate mogul. The group also transferred $5 million to Save America — part of a huge refund of money from the super PAC to the committee over the past year. With national polls consistently suggesting that the rematch between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden could hinge on a few states or a single one, that has magnified the candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running as an independent. It has also drawn attention to how the liberal scion is paying for his campaign and what he is spending money on, including for ballot access and security. His selection of Nicole Shanahan, a wealthy Silicon Valley lawyer and investor, as his running mate already appears to have become a boon for his campaign. Of the $5.4 million that Mr. Kennedy raised in March, $2 million came from Ms. Shanahan, who until last year was married to the Google co-founder Sergey Brin. A correction was made on : An earlier version of this story misstated the total amount MAGA Inc. raised in March. It was $14.4 million, not $9.4 million. The lower figure inaccurately took into account a $5 million transfer from the group to another Trump committee. How we handle corrections Credit... Travis Dove for The New York Times After former President Donald J. Trump sat in a courtroom in New York for much of the last week, Saturday night was supposed to herald a return to the campaign trail and the large rallies where he often gives long, freewheeling speeches. With thousands gathered on the tarmac at an airport in Wilmington, N.C., Mr. Trump's campaign was building anticipation. Two hours before he was set to speak, the campaign sent a fund-raising blast with a message from Mr. Trump: 'They can't keep me off stage! Did they think I would run and hide?' Ninety minutes later, the skies darkened to charcoal and lightning flashed. As thunderstorms swept toward the area and the National Weather Service issued watches and warnings concerning dangerous winds and hail, the rally was canceled over safety concerns. 'We'll make up for this very quickly at another time,' Mr. Trump said on a call he made into the rally that was broadcast over the speakers. 'We'll do it as quick as possible. I'm devastated that this could happen.' But the cancellation, which Mr. Trump indicated was out of his hands, highlights the challenges that he may face as he tries to balance his presidential campaign with a criminal trial that will keep him busy through May. For much of the last week, Mr. Trump's public comments had been limited to social media posts and remarks to reporters outside the courtroom. His only campaign stop was at a bodega in New York City, in a state he overwhelmingly lost in the last two elections and that is not expected to be in play in November. Saturday's rally was expected to serve as a preview of the upcoming weeks, with Mr. Trump traveling on weekends to campaign in battleground states that are more central to his efforts to return to the White House. He has repeatedly claimed that the trial is preventing him from campaigning in places like North Carolina, which he won in 2016 and 2020, but where Democrats are making a big push in November. Opening arguments are slated to start on Monday, and the trial is set to last six to eight weeks. As is often the case with Mr. Trump's rallies, the crowds began lining up hours ahead of his expected remarks. Among those gathered outside was a group wearing shirts with the logo of the Proud Boys, a prominent far-right extremist group. One person held a sign that read 'Free All of the J6 Prisoners,' a reference to those serving sentences in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Mr. Trump, who faces four criminal indictments that include charges tied to his efforts to overturn his election loss, has recently embraced dozens of Jan. 6 defendants. He has called them 'hostages' and has said he would consider pardoning them. In a statement, Ammar Moussa, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, criticized the group's presence, pointing to remarks Mr. Trump made in a debate in 2020, in which he told the Proud Boys to 'stand back and stand by.' 'This is Donald Trump's America: where white nationalists and violent far-right extremists are empowered and working families are left behind,' Mr. Moussa wrote. Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, responded in a statement, 'We don't comment on stupid.' Mr. Trump's remarks were expected to face particular scrutiny given that he is under a gag order in his criminal trial that bans him from attacking witnesses, prosecutors, jurors and court staff, as well as their relatives and relatives of the judge. Prosecutors have said Mr. Trump has violated the gag order seven times, and there is a hearing about the issue on Tuesday. Mr. Trump did travel to North Carolina earlier in the day, attending a fund-raiser in Charlotte in the afternoon. When he called into the rally, he told the attendees that he was minutes away from 'flying in' to Wilmington but that the authorities 'would prefer that we not come in' over safety concerns. 'I'm so sorry,' Mr. Trump said. 'But we'll do it again, and we'll do it bigger and better. You have my promise.' As the crowd left to seek shelter in their cars, vendors outside were still selling an array of merchandise, some of which had been created specifically for the occasion. One T-shirt promoted what it called the Wilmington stop on Mr. Trump's 'Save America' tour. 'I was there!' The shirt read. 'Where were you???'

In other words, Mr. Trump's campaign is guarding resources as it seeks to build a campaign war chest for the general election.\nThis cycle began with the announcement of former President Donald J. Trump's campaign in November 2022 and President Biden's in April 2023.\nRaised $43.8 $158.5 $15.3 $114.7 Spent $29.2 $74.3 $4 $70.1 Net cash $85.5 — $44.6 — Mr. Biden's campaign had $85.5 million on hand at the end of March, according to its monthly filing with the Federal Election Commission, a significant increase from the month before: He ended February with $71 million in his campaign account while Mr. Trump ended February with less than half that.\nAs Mr. Trump and Republicans chase the Democrats' financial edge, Mr. Biden has also started to narrow the polling gap between himself and Mr. Trump. Since late February, the president has cut a deficit of five percentage points to a single point, a virtual tie, according to a recent survey by The New York Times and Siena College.\nThe rivals each capitalized on splashy fund-raisers in the past month that brought in tens of millions of dollars for their respective campaigns. But Mr. Trump's haul from an April 6 event in Palm Beach, Fla., will be reflected on a future filing. His campaign reported that it and the Republican National Committee raked in more than $50.5 million from the dinner, which was held at the home of the billionaire John Paulson.\nThe total nearly doubled the $26 million that Mr. Biden's campaign said it raised on March 28 at Radio City Music Hall in New York, a star-studded event headlined by the president and two former presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Those funds were included in Mr. Biden's March fund-raising numbers.\nMr. Biden and Mr. Trump are primarily raising money though joint fund-raising agreements with their respective parties, arrangements that legally allow them to pull in hundreds of thousands of dollars from individual donors, some of which flows into their campaigns.\nJoint fund-raising committees for both candidates filed reports with the Federal Election Commission this week, providing the first details of 2024 of major donors to both candidates, and the total scale of their fund-raising haul.\nBut the F.E.C. reports for presidential campaigns, which are filed monthly in election years, offer different insights about candidates' activities and how the committees backing them are spending money.\nBy the end of the 2020 cycle Biden had raised and spent more than $1 billion and Trump more than $700 million dollars.\nFor example, federal law guarantees political campaigns bottom-dollar rates for broadcast advertising, so campaign committees are often used to pay for television time. In the first three months of 2024, Mr. Biden's campaign has spent $45.2 million on media buys and production, filings show — more than half of its total of $74.1 million in spending.\nThe Biden campaign has spent $6.9 million on payroll and related expenses, and an additional $6.9 million on 'text message outreach.' His campaign's spending shot up in March, after two relatively steady months.\nIn contrast, Mr. Trump's campaign spending has slowed sharply since the beginning of the year, when he was still fending off Republican primary challengers.\nSince Jan. 1, Mr. Trump's campaign has spent $23 million — but just $3.7 million of that was in March. His campaign has paid $6 million for placed media this year, all of it before Super Tuesday.\nOne of Mr. Trump's committees — a leadership PAC called Save America, which he has used to pay his legal bills — reported on Saturday that it had almost $4.1 million on hand at the end of March, roughly the same amount as it had at the end of February.\nThe group spent $5 million in March, including $3.7 million in bills to the legal teams defending him. Mr. Trump's campaign itself also paid about $473,000 in legal expenses.\nA super PAC backing Mr. Trump, MAGA Inc., reported raising $14.4 million in March, including a $5 million contribution from the former Trump cabinet official Linda McMahon and $4.2 million from Robert T. Bigelow, an aerospace and real estate mogul. The group also transferred $5 million to Save America — part of a huge refund of money from the super PAC to the committee over the past year.\nWith national polls consistently suggesting that the rematch between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden could hinge on a few states or a single one, that has magnified the candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running as an independent.\nIt has also drawn attention to how the liberal scion is paying for his campaign and what he is spending money on, including for ballot access and security.\nHis selection of Nicole Shanahan, a wealthy Silicon Valley lawyer and investor, as his running mate already appears to have become a boon for his campaign. Of the $5.4 million that Mr. Kennedy raised in March, $2 million came from Ms. Shanahan, who until last year was married to the Google co-founder Sergey Brin.\nA correction was made on : An earlier version of this story misstated the total amount MAGA Inc. raised in March. It was $14.4 million, not $9.4 million. The lower figure inaccurately took into account a $5 million transfer from the group to another Trump committee.\nHow we handle corrections\nCredit... Travis Dove for The New York Times After former President Donald J. Trump sat in a courtroom in New York for much of the last week, Saturday night was supposed to herald a return to the campaign trail and the large rallies where he often gives long, freewheeling speeches.\nWith thousands gathered on the tarmac at an airport in Wilmington, N.C., Mr. Trump's campaign was building anticipation. Two hours before he was set to speak, the campaign sent a fund-raising blast with a message from Mr. Trump: 'They can't keep me off stage! Did they think I would run and hide?'\nNinety minutes later, the skies darkened to charcoal and lightning flashed. As thunderstorms swept toward the area and the National Weather Service issued watches and warnings concerning dangerous winds and hail, the rally was canceled over safety concerns.\n'We'll make up for this very quickly at another time,' Mr. Trump said on a call he made into the rally that was broadcast over the speakers. 'We'll do it as quick as possible. I'm devastated that this could happen.'\nBut the cancellation, which Mr. Trump indicated was out of his hands, highlights the challenges that he may face as he tries to balance his presidential campaign with a criminal trial that will keep him busy through May.\nFor much of the last week, Mr. Trump's public comments had been limited to social media posts and remarks to reporters outside the courtroom. His only campaign stop was at a bodega in New York City, in a state he overwhelmingly lost in the last two elections and that is not expected to be in play in November.\nSaturday's rally was expected to serve as a preview of the upcoming weeks, with Mr. Trump traveling on weekends to campaign in battleground states that are more central to his efforts to return to the White House.\nHe has repeatedly claimed that the trial is preventing him from campaigning in places like North Carolina, which he won in 2016 and 2020, but where Democrats are making a big push in November. Opening arguments are slated to start on Monday, and the trial is set to last six to eight weeks.\nAs is often the case with Mr. Trump's rallies, the crowds began lining up hours ahead of his expected remarks. Among those gathered outside was a group wearing shirts with the logo of the Proud Boys, a prominent far-right extremist group. One person held a sign that read 'Free All of the J6 Prisoners,' a reference to those serving sentences in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.\nMr. Trump, who faces four criminal indictments that include charges tied to his efforts to overturn his election loss, has recently embraced dozens of Jan. 6 defendants. He has called them 'hostages' and has said he would consider pardoning them.\nIn a statement, Ammar Moussa, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, criticized the group's presence, pointing to remarks Mr. Trump made in a debate in 2020, in which he told the Proud Boys to 'stand back and stand by.'\n'This is Donald Trump's America: where white nationalists and violent far-right extremists are empowered and working families are left behind,' Mr. Moussa wrote.\nChris LaCivita, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, responded in a statement, 'We don't comment on stupid.'\nMr. Trump's remarks were expected to face particular scrutiny given that he is under a gag order in his criminal trial that bans him from attacking witnesses, prosecutors, jurors and court staff, as well as their relatives and relatives of the judge. Prosecutors have said Mr. Trump has violated the gag order seven times, and there is a hearing about the issue on Tuesday.\nMr. Trump did travel to North Carolina earlier in the day, attending a fund-raiser in Charlotte in the afternoon. When he called into the rally, he told the attendees that he was minutes away from 'flying in' to Wilmington but that the authorities 'would prefer that we not come in' over safety concerns.\n'I'm so sorry,' Mr. Trump said. 'But we'll do it again, and we'll do it bigger and better. You have my promise.'\nAs the crowd left to seek shelter in their cars, vendors outside were still selling an array of merchandise, some of which had been created specifically for the occasion. One T-shirt promoted what it called the Wilmington stop on Mr. Trump's 'Save America' tour.\n'I was there!' The shirt read. 'Where were you???'\nRobert Draper contributed reporting.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",

            "summary": "Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis. The case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces. The issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years. The dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. A group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter. City officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond. Here's what else to know: The case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution. 'The city of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town,' the lawsuit said. 'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness — policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances — the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks. April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET The argument is scheduled for 65 minutes. But it will probably last more than twice that long. April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET The stakes are high. In San Francisco, which is embroiled in a lawsuit over encampments, city officials have complained for months that a sweeping injunction based on the Grants Pass decision and other Ninth Circuit rulings has complicated law enforcement around downtown tent camps. Over the weekend, I asked Senator Scott Wiener, a Democratic legislator who represents San Francisco, what he was hoping for from the Supreme Court. 'Certainty,' he told me, 'because things have been chaotic here.'  April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET In briefs on the case, California leaders have tried to take a nuanced position, arguing, in essence, that they don't want to criminalize homelessness but need more flexibility to clear the most dangerous encampments and compel people to take shelter when it is offered. This tricky balance was reflected in Gov. Gavin Newsom's brief 'in support of neither party.' April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET Outside the Supreme Court building this morning, activists hoping to protect the rights of homeless people have gathered with signs that call for 'Housing Not Handcuffs.' Many of them are draped in reflective thermal blankets. An encampment in Los Angeles in December. Credit... Mark Abramson for The New York Times Tent encampments lining public parks and city sidewalks. Piles of garbage, human waste and used needles. According to leaders across the political spectrum who have asked the Supreme Court to address homelessness, those are the consequences of a sharp increase in homelessness that have forced many cities to 'a breaking point.' Although the case before the court on Monday centers on the narrow issue of whether the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment shields homeless people with no options for shelter from fines, fees and jail time, officials and advocates across the country are watching the case closely for its potential to reshape homelessness policy. The case underscores deep divisions over how best to address homelessness and how much leeway to give to local and state officials to help solve the problem. Theane Evangelis, a lawyer for the city of Grants Pass, Ore., who also represented the city of Boise, Idaho, in a similar case in 2018, warned that 'the stakes could not be higher for every city in the country.' If the Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling on behalf of the homeless plaintiffs, she added, cities everywhere 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.' Those who side with the homeless plaintiffs counter that the issue before the court is a focused one, on how to interpret the Constitution. The cities' willingness to embrace solutions like more affordable housing will determine whether the homelessness crisis will begin to abate, they say. 'The first thing for folks who aren't in this field — or understanding the nuances of this case — to understand is that nobody wants a country where people are forced to sleep outside,' said Ann Oliva, chief executive of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, an advocacy group founded in the 1980s with bipartisan roots. In briefs, supporters of Grants Pass have contended that local and state policymakers, not judges, are best placed to devise homelessness policies. The cases from Grants Pass and Boise had allowed 'federal judges to serve as the nation's ‘homelessness policy czars,'' wrote the Cicero Institute, a Texas policy group critical of longstanding federal policy that channels funds to programs to provide the homeless with permanent housing without requiring people to undergo mental health or drug treatment. Lawyers for the National Alliance to End Homelessness say that imposing penalties, rather than providing housing and services, ignores the roots of the issue. In its brief to the court, the group said that the city of Grants Pass and its defenders, 'rather than working to end it,' sought 'to banish homeless people out of sight and out of mind.' 'The threat of criminal penalties does not reduce homelessness,' the brief argued. 'At most, it drives unsheltered homeless people into hiding, leading to greater health and safety concerns for localities. Criminal punishment for peaceably sleeping outside as an unsheltered homeless person is not only cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but unnecessary, expensive and counterproductive.'  April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET It is early in California, but today's arguments are being closely watched here. California has about 12 percent of the nation's population, but roughly a third of the nation's homeless people. A lot of factors play into that, including the sunny weather to a crippling housing shortage. But rulings by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit constraining tent camp enforcement have made California's homelessness crisis particularly wrenching and visible. April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET This is the start of a big week at the court, featuring the final arguments of the term. In addition to the homelessness case today, the justices will hear an abortion case on Wednesday and a case on Trump's claim that he is immune from prosecution on Thursday. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has said that he opposes criminalizing homelessness but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass have impeded the ability of the local authorities to move people into shelters and temporary housing. Credit... Jeff Chiu/Associated Press The Goldwater Institute and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ordinarily have little in common. One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states. But for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West. On Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis — the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing. The conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them. Advocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless. In the nine Western states in the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, however, officials have increasingly begged the court to explicitly define the point at which a community can reclaim its shared spaces without triggering lawsuits. Some echo conservative appointees on the Ninth Circuit like Judge Daniel Bress, who issued a scathing response last year after the liberal majority voted not to give the Grants Pass case a rehearing before the full appeals court. (The three-judge had panel found that penalties for bunking outdoors violated the Constitution if the local population of homeless people exceeded the city's shelter capacity.) The Ninth Circuit, he wrote, need only look to its doorstep to see the fruit of its decision — a dystopia of 'homelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics dealing, severe mental health impairment' and post-Covid 'hollowing out.' In Phoenix, where a massive encampment near the Arizona State Capitol consumed millions of state dollars and years of litigation, Timothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs of the Goldwater Institute, noted that both sides had asked the court for clarification. 'It just shows,' he said, 'that across the board, the Ninth Circuit ruling that you have a constitutional right to sleep in a public park is unworkable and has got to be reversed.' In California, where more than 180,000 people are homeless, Mr. Newsom wrote in his brief to the court that he opposes criminalizing homelessness, but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass 'have impeded not only the ability to enforce basic health and safety measures, but also the ability to move people into available shelter beds and temporary housing.' Since his election in 2018, California has pumped more than $20 billion into programs to address homelessness, including specialized housing, a new court-based approach for dealing with addiction and mental illness and a $6.38 billion bond. At a news conference last week, he recalled pitching in to dismantle one tent camp in Oakland that 'felt like a scene out of a ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark' where, you know, thousands and thousands of rats appeared running all around us.' 'This is to me just about common sense, not about ideology,' the governor said.  'Suddenly, I found myself homeless,' Laura Gutowski said. 'I never expected it to come to this.' Credit... Mason Trinca for The New York Times Inside a warming shelter, Laura Gutowski detailed how her life had changed since she became homeless two and a half years ago in Grants Pass, a former timber hub in the foothills of southern Oregon. Her husband's death left her without steady income. She lived in a sedan, and then in a tent, in sight of the elementary school where her son was once a student. She constantly scrambled to move her belongings to avoid racking up more fines from the police. 'I never expected it to come to this,' said Ms. Gutowski, 55. She is one of several hundred homeless people in this city of about 40,000 that is at the center of a major case before the Supreme Court on Monday with broad ramifications for the nationwide struggle with homelessness. After Grants Pass stepped up enforcement of local ordinances that banned sleeping and camping in public spaces by ticketing, fining and jailing homeless people, lower courts ruled that it amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishment' by penalizing people who had nowhere else to go. Many states and cities that are increasingly overwhelmed by homelessness are hoping the Supreme Court overturns that decision — or severely limits it. They argue that it has crippled their efforts to address sprawling encampments, rampant public drug use and fearful constituents who say they cannot safely use public spaces. That prospect has alarmed homeless people and their advocates, who contend that a ruling against them would lead cities to fall back on jails, instead of solutions like affordable housing and social services. The case highlights the fierce divide over the thorny issue of how to regulate homelessness. Theane Evangelis, a lawyer representing Grants Pass, said the Supreme Court's decision would reverberate widely. If it does not overturn the lower-court decision, she said, cities around the United States 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.' Ed Johnson, a lawyer for the Oregon Law Center, a nonprofit legal aid group, who represents the homeless residents, said a ruling against them would strip them of their few protections. 'Can a city make it illegal on every inch of city land, every minute of the day, for people to live outside when they have nowhere else to go?' he said. Homelessness across the country climbed to the highest total on record last year, increasing by 12 percent to more than 650,000 people, according to a count by the federal government. Lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Credit... Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times At the core of the Supreme Court battle over a small Oregon town's treatment of its homeless people is a narrow question: Does the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual treatment apply to a city's efforts to crack down on public sleeping and camping? The Eighth Amendment is most commonly applied to punishments, not to laws themselves, and it is often the focus of litigation around the death penalty, solitary confinement and life without the possibility of parole. But in the case on Monday, lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Because the town, Grants Pass, has no homeless shelter, unaffiliated with any religious group, that is open to everyone, they argue, all homeless people there are involuntarily homeless and cannot be punished for having nowhere to go. To make that argument, the homeless plaintiffs have looked to rulings that apply the amendment beyond punishments themselves and to the concept that a person cannot be penalized for their state of being. In one landmark 1962 decision, Robinson v. California, the court found that a person could not be punished for being addicted to drugs, paving the way for subsequent applications. Because those rulings found that the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishing people for having 'an involuntary status,' the homeless plaintiffs say that it would also be relevant to their situation. They add that they are being disciplined for circumstances outside their control, in this instance 'universal biological necessities like sleeping and using a blanket to survive cold temperatures when they have no choice but to be outside.' The city argues that this is an inappropriate use of the Eighth Amendment and a fundamental misunderstanding of its purpose. Two legal experts, in filing a friend-of-the-court brief siding with Grants Pass, argued that the Constitution did bar criminalizing someone's state of being, rather than their specific conduct. But that prohibition, the law professors — Peter W. Low of the University of Virginia and Joel S. Johnson of Pepperdine — added, had a 'shaky Eighth Amendment footing.'  © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis.\nThe case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces.\nThe issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years.\nThe dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces.

One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states.\nBut for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West.\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks.\nThe City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis — the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing.\nThe conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them.\nAdvocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless.\nIn the nine Western states in the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, however, officials have increasingly begged the court to explicitly define the point at which a community can reclaim its shared spaces without triggering lawsuits. Some echo conservative appointees on the Ninth Circuit like Judge Daniel Bress, who issued a scathing response last year after the liberal majority voted not to give the Grants Pass case a rehearing before the full appeals court. (The three-judge had panel found that penalties for bunking outdoors violated the Constitution if the local population of homeless people exceeded the city's shelter capacity.)\nThe Ninth Circuit, he wrote, need only look to its doorstep to see the fruit of its decision — a dystopia of 'homelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics dealing, severe mental health impairment' and post-Covid 'hollowing out.'\nIn Phoenix, where a massive encampment near the Arizona State Capitol consumed millions of state dollars and years of litigation, Timothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs of the Goldwater Institute, noted that both sides had asked the court for clarification.\n'It just shows,' he said, 'that across the board, the Ninth Circuit ruling that you have a constitutional right to sleep in a public park is unworkable and has got to be reversed.'\nIn California, where more than 180,000 people are homeless, Mr. Newsom wrote in his brief to the court that he opposes criminalizing homelessness, but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass 'have impeded not only the ability to enforce basic health and safety measures, but also the ability to move people into available shelter beds and temporary housing.' Since his election in 2018, California has pumped more than $20 billion into programs to address homelessness, including specialized housing, a new court-based approach for dealing with addiction and mental illness and a $6.38 billion bond.\nAt a news conference last week, he recalled pitching in to dismantle one tent camp in Oakland that 'felt like a scene out of a ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark' where, you know, thousands and thousands of rats appeared running all around us.'\n'This is to me just about common sense, not about ideology,' the governor said.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT 'Suddenly, I found myself homeless,' Laura Gutowski said. 'I never expected it to come to this.' Credit... Mason Trinca for The New York Times Inside a warming shelter, Laura Gutowski detailed how her life had changed since she became homeless two and a half years ago in Grants Pass, a former timber hub in the foothills of southern Oregon.\nHer husband's death left her without steady income. She lived in a sedan, and then in a tent, in sight of the elementary school where her son was once a student. She constantly scrambled to move her belongings to avoid racking up more fines from the police.\n'I never expected it to come to this,' said Ms. Gutowski, 55. She is one of several hundred homeless people in this city of about 40,000 that is at the center of a major case before the Supreme Court on Monday with broad ramifications for the nationwide struggle with homelessness.\nAfter Grants Pass stepped up enforcement of local ordinances that banned sleeping and camping in public spaces by ticketing, fining and jailing homeless people, lower courts ruled that it amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishment' by penalizing people who had nowhere else to go.\nMany states and cities that are increasingly overwhelmed by homelessness are hoping the Supreme Court overturns that decision — or severely limits it. They argue that it has crippled their efforts to address sprawling encampments, rampant public drug use and fearful constituents who say they cannot safely use public spaces.\nThat prospect has alarmed homeless people and their advocates, who contend that a ruling against them would lead cities to fall back on jails, instead of solutions like affordable housing and social services.\nThe case highlights the fierce divide over the thorny issue of how to regulate homelessness.\nTheane Evangelis, a lawyer representing Grants Pass, said the Supreme Court's decision would reverberate widely. If it does not overturn the lower-court decision, she said, cities around the United States 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.'\nEd Johnson, a lawyer for the Oregon Law Center, a nonprofit legal aid group, who represents the homeless residents, said a ruling against them would strip them of their few protections. 'Can a city make it illegal on every inch of city land, every minute of the day, for people to live outside when they have nowhere else to go?' he said.\nHomelessness across the country climbed to the highest total on record last year, increasing by 12 percent to more than 650,000 people, according to a count by the federal government.\nLawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Credit... Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times At the core of the Supreme Court battle over a small Oregon town's treatment of its homeless people is a narrow question: Does the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual treatment apply to a city's efforts to crack down on public sleeping and camping?\nThe Eighth Amendment is most commonly applied to punishments, not to laws themselves, and it is often the focus of litigation around the death penalty, solitary confinement and life without the possibility of parole.\nBut in the case on Monday, lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Because the town, Grants Pass, has no homeless shelter, unaffiliated with any religious group, that is open to everyone, they argue, all homeless people there are involuntarily homeless and cannot be punished for having nowhere to go.\nTo make that argument, the homeless plaintiffs have looked to rulings that apply the amendment beyond punishments themselves and to the concept that a person cannot be penalized for their state of being.\nIn one landmark 1962 decision, Robinson v. California, the court found that a person could not be punished for being addicted to drugs, paving the way for subsequent applications. Because those rulings found that the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishing people for having 'an involuntary status,' the homeless plaintiffs say that it would also be relevant to their situation. They add that they are being disciplined for circumstances outside their control, in this instance 'universal biological necessities like sleeping and using a blanket to survive cold temperatures when they have no choice but to be outside.'\nThe city argues that this is an inappropriate use of the Eighth Amendment and a fundamental misunderstanding of its purpose.\nTwo legal experts, in filing a friend-of-the-court brief siding with Grants Pass, argued that the Constitution did bar criminalizing someone's state of being, rather than their specific conduct. But that prohibition, the law professors — Peter W. Low of the University of Virginia and Joel S. Johnson of Pepperdine — added, had a 'shaky Eighth Amendment footing.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",

            "summary": "Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis. The case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces. The issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years. The dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. A group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter. City officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond. Here's what else to know: The case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution. 'The city of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town,' the lawsuit said. 'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness — policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances — the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks. April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET The argument is scheduled for 65 minutes. But it will probably last more than twice that long. April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET The stakes are high. In San Francisco, which is embroiled in a lawsuit over encampments, city officials have complained for months that a sweeping injunction based on the Grants Pass decision and other Ninth Circuit rulings has complicated law enforcement around downtown tent camps. Over the weekend, I asked Senator Scott Wiener, a Democratic legislator who represents San Francisco, what he was hoping for from the Supreme Court. 'Certainty,' he told me, 'because things have been chaotic here.'

California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness — policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances — the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks.\nApril 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET The argument is scheduled for 65 minutes. But it will probably last more than twice that long.\nApril 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET The stakes are high. In San Francisco, which is embroiled in a lawsuit over encampments, city officials have complained for months that a sweeping injunction based on the Grants Pass decision and other Ninth Circuit rulings has complicated law enforcement around downtown tent camps. Over the weekend, I asked Senator Scott Wiener, a Democratic legislator who represents San Francisco, what he was hoping for from the Supreme Court. 'Certainty,' he told me, 'because things have been chaotic here.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET In briefs on the case, California leaders have tried to take a nuanced position, arguing, in essence, that they don't want to criminalize homelessness but need more flexibility to clear the most dangerous encampments and compel people to take shelter when it is offered. This tricky balance was reflected in Gov. Gavin Newsom's brief 'in support of neither party.'\nApril 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET Outside the Supreme Court building this morning, activists hoping to protect the rights of homeless people have gathered with signs that call for 'Housing Not Handcuffs.'

According to leaders across the political spectrum who have asked the Supreme Court to address homelessness, those are the consequences of a sharp increase in homelessness that have forced many cities to 'a breaking point.'\nAlthough the case before the court on Monday centers on the narrow issue of whether the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment shields homeless people with no options for shelter from fines, fees and jail time, officials and advocates across the country are watching the case closely for its potential to reshape homelessness policy.\nThe case underscores deep divisions over how best to address homelessness and how much leeway to give to local and state officials to help solve the problem.\nTheane Evangelis, a lawyer for the city of Grants Pass, Ore., who also represented the city of Boise, Idaho, in a similar case in 2018, warned that 'the stakes could not be higher for every city in the country.'\nIf the Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling on behalf of the homeless plaintiffs, she added, cities everywhere 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.'\nThose who side with the homeless plaintiffs counter that the issue before the court is a focused one, on how to interpret the Constitution. The cities' willingness to embrace solutions like more affordable housing will determine whether the homelessness crisis will begin to abate, they say.\n'The first thing for folks who aren't in this field — or understanding the nuances of this case — to understand is that nobody wants a country where people are forced to sleep outside,' said Ann Oliva, chief executive of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, an advocacy group founded in the 1980s with bipartisan roots.\nIn briefs, supporters of Grants Pass have contended that local and state policymakers, not judges, are best placed to devise homelessness policies.\nThe cases from Grants Pass and Boise had allowed 'federal judges to serve as the nation's ‘homelessness policy czars,'' wrote the Cicero Institute, a Texas policy group critical of longstanding federal policy that channels funds to programs to provide the homeless with permanent housing without requiring people to undergo mental health or drug treatment.\nLawyers for the National Alliance to End Homelessness say that imposing penalties, rather than providing housing and services, ignores the roots of the issue.\nIn its brief to the court, the group said that the city of Grants Pass and its defenders, 'rather than working to end it,' sought 'to banish homeless people out of sight and out of mind.'\n'The threat of criminal penalties does not reduce homelessness,' the brief argued. 'At most, it drives unsheltered homeless people into hiding, leading to greater health and safety concerns for localities. Criminal punishment for peaceably sleeping outside as an unsheltered homeless person is not only cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but unnecessary, expensive and counterproductive.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET It is early in California, but today's arguments are being closely watched here. California has about 12 percent of the nation's population, but roughly a third of the nation's homeless people. A lot of factors play into that, including the sunny weather to a crippling housing shortage. But rulings by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit constraining tent camp enforcement have made California's homelessness crisis particularly wrenching and visible.\nApril 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET This is the start of a big week at the court, featuring the final arguments of the term. In addition to the homelessness case today, the justices will hear an abortion case on Wednesday and a case on Trump's claim that he is immune from prosecution on Thursday.\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California has said that he opposes criminalizing homelessness but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass have impeded the ability of the local authorities to move people into shelters and temporary housing. Credit... Jeff Chiu/Associated Press The Goldwater Institute and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ordinarily have little in common. One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states.\nBut for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West.\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks.\nThe City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis — the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing.\nThe conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them.\nAdvocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless.\nIn the nine Western states in the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, however, officials have increasingly begged the court to explicitly define the point at which a community can reclaim its shared spaces without triggering lawsuits. Some echo conservative appointees on the Ninth Circuit like Judge Daniel Bress, who issued a scathing response last year after the liberal majority voted not to give the Grants Pass case a rehearing before the full appeals court. (The three-judge had panel found that penalties for bunking outdoors violated the Constitution if the local population of homeless people exceeded the city's shelter capacity.)\nThe Ninth Circuit, he wrote, need only look to its doorstep to see the fruit of its decision — a dystopia of 'homelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics dealing, severe mental health impairment' and post-Covid 'hollowing out.'\nIn Phoenix, where a massive encampment near the Arizona State Capitol consumed millions of state dollars and years of litigation, Timothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs of the Goldwater Institute, noted that both sides had asked the court for clarification.\n'It just shows,' he said, 'that across the board, the Ninth Circuit ruling that you have a constitutional right to sleep in a public park is unworkable and has got to be reversed.'\nIn California, where more than 180,000 people are homeless, Mr. Newsom wrote in his brief to the court that he opposes criminalizing homelessness, but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass 'have impeded not only the ability to enforce basic health and safety measures, but also the ability to move people into available shelter beds and temporary housing.' Since his election in 2018, California has pumped more than $20 billion into programs to address homelessness, including specialized housing, a new court-based approach for dealing with addiction and mental illness and a $6.38 billion bond.\nAt a news conference last week, he recalled pitching in to dismantle one tent camp in Oakland that 'felt like a scene out of a ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark' where, you know, thousands and thousands of rats appeared running all around us.'\n'This is to me just about common sense, not about ideology,' the governor said.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT 'Suddenly, I found myself homeless,' Laura Gutowski said. 'I never expected it to come to this.' Credit... Mason Trinca for The New York Times Inside a warming shelter, Laura Gutowski detailed how her life had changed since she became homeless two and a half years ago in Grants Pass, a former timber hub in the foothills of southern Oregon.\nHer husband's death left her without steady income. She lived in a sedan, and then in a tent, in sight of the elementary school where her son was once a student. She constantly scrambled to move her belongings to avoid racking up more fines from the police.\n'I never expected it to come to this,' said Ms. Gutowski, 55. She is one of several hundred homeless people in this city of about 40,000 that is at the center of a major case before the Supreme Court on Monday with broad ramifications for the nationwide struggle with homelessness.\nAfter Grants Pass stepped up enforcement of local ordinances that banned sleeping and camping in public spaces by ticketing, fining and jailing homeless people, lower courts ruled that it amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishment' by penalizing people who had nowhere else to go.\nMany states and cities that are increasingly overwhelmed by homelessness are hoping the Supreme Court overturns that decision — or severely limits it. They argue that it has crippled their efforts to address sprawling encampments, rampant public drug use and fearful constituents who say they cannot safely use public spaces.\nThat prospect has alarmed homeless people and their advocates, who contend that a ruling against them would lead cities to fall back on jails, instead of solutions like affordable housing and social services.\nThe case highlights the fierce divide over the thorny issue of how to regulate homelessness.\nTheane Evangelis, a lawyer representing Grants Pass, said the Supreme Court's decision would reverberate widely. If it does not overturn the lower-court decision, she said, cities around the United States 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.'\nEd Johnson, a lawyer for the Oregon Law Center, a nonprofit legal aid group, who represents the homeless residents, said a ruling against them would strip them of their few protections. 'Can a city make it illegal on every inch of city land, every minute of the day, for people to live outside when they have nowhere else to go?' he said.\nHomelessness across the country climbed to the highest total on record last year, increasing by 12 percent to more than 650,000 people, according to a count by the federal government.\nLawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Credit... Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times At the core of the Supreme Court battle over a small Oregon town's treatment of its homeless people is a narrow question: Does the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual treatment apply to a city's efforts to crack down on public sleeping and camping?\nThe Eighth Amendment is most commonly applied to punishments, not to laws themselves, and it is often the focus of litigation around the death penalty, solitary confinement and life without the possibility of parole.\nBut in the case on Monday, lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Because the town, Grants Pass, has no homeless shelter, unaffiliated with any religious group, that is open to everyone, they argue, all homeless people there are involuntarily homeless and cannot be punished for having nowhere to go.\nTo make that argument, the homeless plaintiffs have looked to rulings that apply the amendment beyond punishments themselves and to the concept that a person cannot be penalized for their state of being.\nIn one landmark 1962 decision, Robinson v. California, the court found that a person could not be punished for being addicted to drugs, paving the way for subsequent applications. Because those rulings found that the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishing people for having 'an involuntary status,' the homeless plaintiffs say that it would also be relevant to their situation. They add that they are being disciplined for circumstances outside their control, in this instance 'universal biological necessities like sleeping and using a blanket to survive cold temperatures when they have no choice but to be outside.'\nThe city argues that this is an inappropriate use of the Eighth Amendment and a fundamental misunderstanding of its purpose.\nTwo legal experts, in filing a friend-of-the-court brief siding with Grants Pass, argued that the Constitution did bar criminalizing someone's state of being, rather than their specific conduct. But that prohibition, the law professors — Peter W. Low of the University of Virginia and Joel S. Johnson of Pepperdine — added, had a 'shaky Eighth Amendment footing.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",

            "summary": "Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The challenging process of choosing a jury in the first criminal trial of a former American president proceeded slowly on Tuesday, as prospective jurors were questioned individually about their ability to fairly consider the charges against Donald J. Trump. Shortly before noon, lawyers began directly questioning the first group of prospective jurors to make it through initial queries. Questions involved their opinions on campaign finance law and on the trial's potential witnesses, including a porn star and a tabloid publisher. Earlier, some prospective jurors who had previously indicated that they would be able to be impartial had changed their minds after taking a night to think about it. 'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I hoped I could be,' one admitted. He was excused. It could take two weeks or more to pick the 12 jurors who will decide the case, which centers on allegations that the former president falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star, Stormy Daniels. The pool of possible jurors being scrutinized on Tuesday came from an initial group of 96, dozens of whom were dismissed immediately on Monday after indicating that they felt they could not fairly reach a decision. The dismissals underscored the difficulty of picking a jury in a city where the defendant is widely reviled. Mr. Trump, who may take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied all wrongdoing. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records that hid reimbursements to his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who had paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to buy her silence. Prosecutors say that Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election. Here's what to know about the case: The case was brought a year ago by Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. It is one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, but may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nA day after Mr. Trump appeared to nod off during pretrial motions, he was back at the defense table. He appeared somewhat bored as the jury selection process continued, with prospective jurors responding to a series of mostly yes or no questions.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America.\nMr. Trump has repeatedly complained that the case is a politically motivated witch hunt and has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and his family, as well as key witnesses, including Mr. Cohen. Justice Merchan has imposed a gag order on Mr. Trump that bars him from attacking witnesses, jurors, prosecutors or the judge's family. Even before the trial began on Monday, prosecutors asked Justice Merchan to hold the former president in contempt of court over social media posts about Mr. Cohen; the judge said he would hold a hearing later this month.

Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, accused Donald J. Trump of falsifying business records connected to a hush money payment to a porn star. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony counts. Credit Credit... Andrew Seng for The New York Times All 34 felony counts at the center of the Manhattan criminal case against former President Donald J. Trump stem from a $130,000 hush-money payment handed over to a porn star in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign. The specific charges are far less titillating: falsifying business records in the first degree. But a conviction could still result in jail time. The payment was made by Mr. Trump's fixer, Michael D. Cohen, to Stormy Daniels in order to buy her silence about a sexual liaison she said she had with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump directed him to make the payment. Paying hush money is not illegal. But while serving as the commander in chief, prosecutors say, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen in a manner that constituted fraud: In internal records, Mr. Trump's company classified the reimbursement as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet there were no such expenses, according to prosecutors, who say the agreement was also fictional. Those records underpin the 34 counts of falsifying business records: 11 involve the checks, 11 center on monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted to the company and 12 involve entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust. Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing. In announcing the charges a year ago, Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, said that his office must keep a close eye on how companies conduct business in New York. 'This is the business capital of the world,' Mr. Bragg said. 'We regularly do cases involving false business statements. The bedrock — in fact, the basis for business integrity and a well-functioning business marketplace — is true and accurate record-keeping.' The charges against Mr. Trump are all Class E felonies, the lowest category in New York. Each count carries a maximum prison sentence of four years. Nothing in the law requires the judge, Juan E. Merchan, to imprison Mr. Trump if the jury convicts him. The judge could instead sentence him to probation. But Justice Merchan has made it clear that he takes white-collar crime seriously and could put Mr. Trump behind bars. It's possible, however, if Mr. Trump is convicted of more than one count, Justice Merchan would impose a concurrent sentence, under which Mr. Trump would serve all time simultaneously. Key Players in the Trump Criminal Trial ›  April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET Olivia Bensimon Reporting from outside the courthouse Journalists still vastly outnumber the Trump supporters who have gathered near the courthouse today. One man's Stars and Stripes flag flaps in the breeze, two other people are sitting on benches. Neighborhood workers on their lunch breaks bask in the spring sun. Jury selection is often a lengthy process, but in the first criminal trial of a former American president, currently taking place in a Manhattan criminal courthouse, it's going more slowly than normal. In part, that is because of the nature of the case: Jurors, once seated, will be asked to decide whether Donald J. Trump committed a crime. Prosecutors have charged him with 34 felonies, accusing him of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal that could have hurt his first presidential run. But the process has been particularly drawn-out because, once would-be jurors say they can be fair and impartial, they are being asked a series of 42 questions. After that, they face additional scrutiny from lawyers for the prosecution and the defense. Here are the 42 questions: 1. Without telling us your address, in what neighborhood do you live?

Yet on the first two days of jury selection, several prospective jurors revealed potentially identifying information, reflecting the difficulty of having an anonymous jury in a case with an intense media spotlight. On the first day, a woman said she worked for a city agency of approximately 500 people and revealed its name. Later, a man who identified himself as a bookseller revealed the name of the small store where he works. This continued on Tuesday when others revealed the names of employers. While some worked for companies that were large, where the potential jurors could likely remain unidentifiable, others were less cautious. One woman revealed the name of the three-person company she owns with her husband. Justice Merchan did not interject as the prospective jurors divulged the information, nor did he caution them against doing so. Juries are not completely anonymous in New York State. Mr. Trump, his lawyers and the prosecutors have access to the names of the prospective jurors. But after a request by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, Justice Merchan decided to withhold the names from the public. Mr. Trump did not oppose the request. The accidental self-identifications are a notable departure from how federal Judge Lewis A. Kaplan conducted jury selection in Mr. Trump's defamation trial in January, brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. In the federal system, jurors are allowed to remain anonymous, even to parties in the case. Before potential jurors answered basic questions about their backgrounds, Judge Kaplan instructed them not to reveal personal information. 'Don't give us anything that could enable anybody to pin you down geographically,' he said. He also cautioned them not to reveal their names to each other, and when the trial concluded, he left them with these ominous words: 'My advice to you is that you never disclose that you were on this jury,' Judge Kaplan said. 'And I won't say anything more about it.'

We are running 5 to 7 minutes per person. The very premise of the trial is that prosecutors believe Donald J. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times Donald J. Trump first ran for president nearly a decade ago. Now, as he runs again in a political climate that he helped create, his Manhattan criminal trial is partly a referendum on his tactics during that first campaign. The trial's very premise is that prosecutors believe Mr. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign — sex scandals involving a porn star and a Playboy model, for example — he concealed them, the prosecutors say. But in a development that will bolster their case, prosecutors on Monday secured permission from the judge to admit evidence connected to Mr. Trump's overall political strategy in 2016. Much of it bears the former president's imprint: aggressive tweets, false denials, coordination with a tabloid publisher and more. The judge's ruling showed how the weapons that worked so well for Mr. Trump then are being turned against him in the courtroom now. The techniques prosecutors highlighted Monday were not invented by Mr. Trump for use in his campaign; they are behaviors he exhibited throughout his life as a businessman and a reality-television star. But in modern American political history, such raw tactics had rarely been seen at such a high level. One example is Mr. Trump's relationship with The National Enquirer tabloid and its publisher, David Pecker, who is expected to appear as a witness. The Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case, obtained permission from the judge on Monday to introduce evidence related to a 2015 meeting among Mr. Trump, Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump's former fixer, Michael D. Cohen. A prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, said on Monday that the three men had 'conspired to influence the 2016 election.' That meeting laid the groundwork for hush-money deals with a porn star, Stormy Daniels, and a Playboy model, Karen McDougal. But another result of that meeting, Mr. Steinglass said, were explosive headlines about Mr. Trump's opponents in the Republican primary, including those claiming that Ben Carson had committed 'medical malpractice' and that Senator Ted Cruz had a 'family connection to J.F.K.'s assassin.' A lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, protested the admission of evidence related to that meeting, saying that newspaper publishers met with candidates 'all the time,' and that there was nothing improper about it, let alone illegal. That admission worked against him. The judge, Juan M. Merchan, said that he was glad that Mr. Blanche believed that there was nothing wrong with the meeting — because it meant that he should not mind that the evidence would be introduced. 'There is no reason not to allow it in,' Justice Merchan said. Mr. Steinglass won again when he persuaded Justice Merchan to admit evidence of the Trump campaign in crisis after the publication in 2016 of the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump boasted about grabbing women by their genitals. 'The video sent the campaign into a tailspin,' Mr. Steinglass said. He offered up an email sent by a Washington Post reporter to Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump's campaign spokeswoman. Mr. Steinglass said that Ms. Hicks had forwarded the exchange to Stephen K. Bannon, Kellyanne Conway and other members of the campaign team, 'suggesting that their response should be to deny, deny, deny.' Eventually, he said, Mr. Bannon sent it to Mr. Cohen. Mr. Blanche again protested, but was again rebuffed. The judge said he would allow jurors to see the email, saying that the ensuing thread was relevant. The exchanges that prosecutors and defense lawyers debated on Monday underscored Mr. Trump's penchant for delegating dirty work to others, giving himself some distance in the process. The hush-money deals worked that way: Mr. Cohen paid off Ms. Daniels, while The National Enquirer bought Ms. McDougal's silence. (Mr. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to his reimbursement of Mr. Cohen.) That habit is still on display this year, and can be helpful given that Justice Merchan has barred Mr. Trump from attacking witnesses, prosecutors and the judge's own family. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump posted on social media a video of Laura Loomer, a political ally, in the park outside the courthouse. Ms. Loomer, speaking into a bullhorn, insinuated that the judge's family was politically compromised. Had Mr. Trump said that himself, he would have risked violating the judge's gag order.

On Tuesday, the spectacle of the first trial of a president was fading into New York's usual urban bustle. Credit... Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The scene outside Manhattan's Criminal Court on Tuesday morning was placid — by New York standards — after the tense crush on the first day of Donald J. Trump's trial. On Monday, cable news stations had staked out every concrete surface bordering Centre Street. On Tuesday, there were swaths of open ground in the space reserved for media organizations. As the sun rose and workers in Collect Pond Park removed overflowing trash cans around 5:30 a.m., only five people were in the line for those holding official passes for entry. In the line for the general public were some familiar faces among court-watchers, including Ron Sinibaldi, whose hobbies include following high-profile cases. He's previously attended proceedings involving Senator Robert Menendez, who is accused of taking bribes, and New Jersey officials involved in closing the George Washington Bridge as political retribution. Everyday street scenes played out nearby. Around 7 a.m., a lone man fed pigeons in the park, which was sparsely populated by the time Mr. Trump's motorcade arrived nearly two hours later. An exception: one older man holding up a red Trump 2024 flag and shouting at television reporters: 'Fight! Fight! Fight for Donald Trump!' Shortly after, a line of young children toddled through, flanked by teacher's aides and clutching a rope, their neon orange vests a pop of color. Anusha Bayya contributed reporting.

Justice Merchan kindly reminded them to be on time going forward.  In court Monday, former President Donald J. Trump scowled and scoffed, and apparently slept. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The criminal trial of Donald J. Trump, the nation's 45th president and the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, started Monday with potential jurors assembling in a drab New York City courtroom as Mr. Trump looked on. Before jury selection began, the judge, Juan M. Merchan, a veteran New York jurist, rejected another effort to force his recusal by the defense, which cited several issues, including his daughter's work as a Democratic political consultant. He also ruled that prosecutors could introduce evidence regarding Mr. Trump's involvement with coordinating publicity with The National Enquirer to aid his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump's lawyers had described the evidence as a 'sideshow,' but lost. But Mr. Trump's lawyers did persuade Justice Merchan that mentioning sexual assault allegations that arose against Mr. Trump after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump was recorded bragging about grabbing women's genitals, would be prejudicial to the former president. Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial. Entering the courtroom Monday, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here,' but he looked less enthusiastic in front of Justice Merchan. He quietly slouched and scowled — and at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep. By afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into the courtroom. Some quickly left: When the judge asked the first group of 96 if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused. The remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.   The jury selection process in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan could take two weeks or more. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Lawyers representing the State of New York and Donald J. Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate. The potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair. The process could take two weeks or more — and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court. 'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.' The stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County — Manhattan, as most people know it — which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020. Mr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated. Prosecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28. Unlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.' Some may not be completely forthcoming. 'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said. Mr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors. 'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'  Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Not since Eugene V. Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning. Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases: two federal, one in New York and another in Georgia. The first of those to go to trial is the sex scandal cover-up in New York, where jury selection began on Monday. For now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, beyond having to be present in a courtroom, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But some of the cases are proceeding at a pace that could bring verdicts before the election — and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that will arise if he is convicted. Others would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges. Here is what we know, and what we don't know. This is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes. The Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be 'natural born' citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years. There are no limitations based on character or criminal record. While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices. The Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground. 'We let states set the time, place and manner' of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, 'but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don't let the state add new substantive requirements.' While that view is not universal among legal experts, it prevailed in court in 2019, after California passed a law requiring candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the law from taking effect, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' after taking an oath to support the Constitution. Numerous lawsuits had argued that Mr. Trump's actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, met this bar. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine's secretary of state did the same. But the Supreme Court — led by a conservative supermajority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself — concluded that only Congress had the power to enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. (Four of the justices, including the three liberals, wanted to allow a wider range of options for disqualification.) Congress is not going to do that with Republicans in control of the House. And the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal cases, meaning convictions would not disqualify Mr. Trump either. Congress can designate either groups of people to whom Section 3 applies (such as people who fought for the Confederacy) or specific crimes that, upon conviction, would trigger disqualification, said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University. But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty. 'Whether or not Trump is tried, convicted, acquitted, that's a separate question from whether or not he's disqualified,' said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. One of the charges in the federal case related to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election — conspiracy to violate civil rights — once carried a disqualification penalty, Mr. Kreis said, but Congress removed it decades ago. Now that Mr. Trump has secured a majority of delegates to the Republican convention, the party has no mechanism to nominate somebody else. Under the party's official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, 'such support shall not be recognized.' Nor have top Republicans shown any interest in another nominee. If he were forced to withdraw from the race after the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him. Probably not. Mr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony. Most felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day. He could also petition for clemency, which would require the approval of the governor — Ron DeSantis, who ran against Mr. Trump in the Republican primary — and two Florida cabinet members. Chris Taylor, the director of external affairs for the Florida Commission on Offender Review, confirmed that a Florida resident convicted of a felony could apply to have their voting rights restored through that process even if their conviction happened outside Florida. Since Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison. So if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he could be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote. No one knows. 'We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 'It's just guessing.' Legally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. 'I don't think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,' Professor Levinson said. In practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts. In theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself. More likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump's lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch. On the federal charges only, he could also try to pardon himself — or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a 'self pardon' was constitutional. Or President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that 'the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,' Professor Chemerinsky said. But that wouldn't apply to the New York or Georgia cases, because the president does not have pardon power for state charges. Again, no one knows, particularly when it comes to the New York and Georgia cases. In the two federal cases, a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges. The Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents — that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties — applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario. 'The reasons why we wouldn't want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn't want to prosecute a sitting president,' said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department's reasoning. 'My guess is, if the Trump prosecution were still ongoing in some way and Trump were elected, the Justice Department — which would be the Trump Justice Department — would say, ‘We're following the 1973 memo.'' Like so much else here, this would be legally untested, and it is impossible to say what the Supreme Court would do if the question reached it. In its Clinton v. Jones ruling in 1997, the court allowed a lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed. But that case was civil, not criminal, and it was filed by a private citizen, not by the government itself. Charlie Savage contributed reporting.  © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe challenging process of choosing a jury in the first criminal trial of a former American president proceeded slowly on Tuesday, as prospective jurors were questioned individually about their ability to fairly consider the charges against Donald J. Trump.\nShortly before noon, lawyers began directly questioning the first group of prospective jurors to make it through initial queries. Questions involved their opinions on campaign finance law and on the trial's potential witnesses, including a porn star and a tabloid publisher.\nEarlier, some prospective jurors who had previously indicated that they would be able to be impartial had changed their minds after taking a night to think about it. 'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I hoped I could be,' one admitted. He was excused.\nIt could take two weeks or more to pick the 12 jurors who will decide the case, which centers on allegations that the former president falsified documents to cover up a sex scandal involving a porn star, Stormy Daniels.\nThe pool of possible jurors being scrutinized on Tuesday came from an initial group of 96, dozens of whom were dismissed immediately on Monday after indicating that they felt they could not fairly reach a decision. The dismissals underscored the difficulty of picking a jury in a city where the defendant is widely reviled.\nMr. Trump, who may take the witness stand in his own defense, has denied all wrongdoing. But prosecutors say that, while serving as president, he allowed his company to falsify records that hid reimbursements to his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who had paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to buy her silence. Prosecutors say that Mr. Trump, faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign, concealed them to influence the election.\nHere's what to know about the case:\nThe case was brought a year ago by Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison. It is one of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, but may be the only one to make it to trial before Election Day.\nA day after Mr. Trump appeared to nod off during pretrial motions, he was back at the defense table. He appeared somewhat bored as the jury selection process continued, with prospective jurors responding to a series of mostly yes or no questions.\nJury selection will be crucial for both sides. Prosecutors have some advantage, as the jury pool is drawn from Manhattan, one of the most Democratic counties in America.\nMr. Trump has repeatedly complained that the case is a politically motivated witch hunt and has attacked the judge, Juan M. Merchan, and his family, as well as key witnesses, including Mr. Cohen. Justice Merchan has imposed a gag order on Mr. Trump that bars him from attacking witnesses, jurors, prosecutors or the judge's family. Even before the trial began on Monday, prosecutors asked Justice Merchan to hold the former president in contempt of court over social media posts about Mr. Cohen; the judge said he would hold a hearing later this month.\nApril 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 2:00 p.m. ET Anusha Bayya\nAnusha Bayya Reporting from outside the courthouse A midday addition to the crowd here, albeit briefly: Mayor Eric Adams has come by, flanked by his security detail, and was soon peppered with questions by reporters.

Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, accused Donald J. Trump of falsifying business records connected to a hush money payment to a porn star. Mr. Trump pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony counts. Credit Credit... Andrew Seng for The New York Times All 34 felony counts at the center of the Manhattan criminal case against former President Donald J. Trump stem from a $130,000 hush-money payment handed over to a porn star in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe specific charges are far less titillating: falsifying business records in the first degree. But a conviction could still result in jail time.\nThe payment was made by Mr. Trump's fixer, Michael D. Cohen, to Stormy Daniels in order to buy her silence about a sexual liaison she said she had with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump directed him to make the payment.\nPaying hush money is not illegal. But while serving as the commander in chief, prosecutors say, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen in a manner that constituted fraud: In internal records, Mr. Trump's company classified the reimbursement as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet there were no such expenses, according to prosecutors, who say the agreement was also fictional.\nThose records underpin the 34 counts of falsifying business records: 11 involve the checks, 11 center on monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted to the company and 12 involve entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust. Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing.\nIn announcing the charges a year ago, Manhattan's district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, said that his office must keep a close eye on how companies conduct business in New York.\n'This is the business capital of the world,' Mr. Bragg said. 'We regularly do cases involving false business statements. The bedrock — in fact, the basis for business integrity and a well-functioning business marketplace — is true and accurate record-keeping.'\nThe charges against Mr. Trump are all Class E felonies, the lowest category in New York. Each count carries a maximum prison sentence of four years.\nNothing in the law requires the judge, Juan E. Merchan, to imprison Mr. Trump if the jury convicts him. The judge could instead sentence him to probation.\nBut Justice Merchan has made it clear that he takes white-collar crime seriously and could put Mr. Trump behind bars. It's possible, however, if Mr. Trump is convicted of more than one count, Justice Merchan would impose a concurrent sentence, under which Mr. Trump would serve all time simultaneously.\nKey Players in the Trump Criminal Trial › Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:35 p.m. ET Olivia Bensimon\nOlivia Bensimon Reporting from outside the courthouse Journalists still vastly outnumber the Trump supporters who have gathered near the courthouse today. One man's Stars and Stripes flag flaps in the breeze, two other people are sitting on benches. Neighborhood workers on their lunch breaks bask in the spring sun.\nJury selection is often a lengthy process, but in the first criminal trial of a former American president, currently taking place in a Manhattan criminal courthouse, it's going more slowly than normal.\nIn part, that is because of the nature of the case: Jurors, once seated, will be asked to decide whether Donald J. Trump committed a crime. Prosecutors have charged him with 34 felonies, accusing him of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal that could have hurt his first presidential run.\nBut the process has been particularly drawn-out because, once would-be jurors say they can be fair and impartial, they are being asked a series of 42 questions. After that, they face additional scrutiny from lawyers for the prosecution and the defense.\nHere are the 42 questions:\n1. Without telling us your address, in what neighborhood do you live?

Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Last month, Justice Juan M. Merchan ordered that prospective jurors' names would be shielded from the public, underscoring the need for privacy for those who may decide Donald J. Trump's criminal fate — and tempt the anger of his followers.\nYet on the first two days of jury selection, several prospective jurors revealed potentially identifying information, reflecting the difficulty of having an anonymous jury in a case with an intense media spotlight.\nOn the first day, a woman said she worked for a city agency of approximately 500 people and revealed its name. Later, a man who identified himself as a bookseller revealed the name of the small store where he works.\nThis continued on Tuesday when others revealed the names of employers. While some worked for companies that were large, where the potential jurors could likely remain unidentifiable, others were less cautious. One woman revealed the name of the three-person company she owns with her husband.\nJustice Merchan did not interject as the prospective jurors divulged the information, nor did he caution them against doing so.\nJuries are not completely anonymous in New York State. Mr. Trump, his lawyers and the prosecutors have access to the names of the prospective jurors. But after a request by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, Justice Merchan decided to withhold the names from the public. Mr. Trump did not oppose the request.\nThe accidental self-identifications are a notable departure from how federal Judge Lewis A. Kaplan conducted jury selection in Mr. Trump's defamation trial in January, brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll.\nIn the federal system, jurors are allowed to remain anonymous, even to parties in the case. Before potential jurors answered basic questions about their backgrounds, Judge Kaplan instructed them not to reveal personal information.\n'Don't give us anything that could enable anybody to pin you down geographically,' he said.\nHe also cautioned them not to reveal their names to each other, and when the trial concluded, he left them with these ominous words: 'My advice to you is that you never disclose that you were on this jury,' Judge Kaplan said. 'And I won't say anything more about it.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 16, 2024, 1:11 p.m. ET April 16, 2024, 1:11 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich\nJonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse The prospective jurors have just been excused for lunch.

We are running 5 to 7 minutes per person.\nThe very premise of the trial is that prosecutors believe Donald J. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times Donald J. Trump first ran for president nearly a decade ago.\nNow, as he runs again in a political climate that he helped create, his Manhattan criminal trial is partly a referendum on his tactics during that first campaign.\nThe trial's very premise is that prosecutors believe Mr. Trump orchestrated an election interference scheme. Faced with damaging stories that could have doomed his campaign — sex scandals involving a porn star and a Playboy model, for example — he concealed them, the prosecutors say.\nBut in a development that will bolster their case, prosecutors on Monday secured permission from the judge to admit evidence connected to Mr. Trump's overall political strategy in 2016. Much of it bears the former president's imprint: aggressive tweets, false denials, coordination with a tabloid publisher and more.\nThe judge's ruling showed how the weapons that worked so well for Mr. Trump then are being turned against him in the courtroom now.\nThe techniques prosecutors highlighted Monday were not invented by Mr. Trump for use in his campaign; they are behaviors he exhibited throughout his life as a businessman and a reality-television star. But in modern American political history, such raw tactics had rarely been seen at such a high level.\nOne example is Mr. Trump's relationship with The National Enquirer tabloid and its publisher, David Pecker, who is expected to appear as a witness.\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, which brought the case, obtained permission from the judge on Monday to introduce evidence related to a 2015 meeting among Mr. Trump, Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump's former fixer, Michael D. Cohen. A prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, said on Monday that the three men had 'conspired to influence the 2016 election.'\nThat meeting laid the groundwork for hush-money deals with a porn star, Stormy Daniels, and a Playboy model, Karen McDougal. But another result of that meeting, Mr. Steinglass said, were explosive headlines about Mr. Trump's opponents in the Republican primary, including those claiming that Ben Carson had committed 'medical malpractice' and that Senator Ted Cruz had a 'family connection to J.F.K.'s assassin.'\nA lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, protested the admission of evidence related to that meeting, saying that newspaper publishers met with candidates 'all the time,' and that there was nothing improper about it, let alone illegal.\nThat admission worked against him. The judge, Juan M. Merchan, said that he was glad that Mr. Blanche believed that there was nothing wrong with the meeting — because it meant that he should not mind that the evidence would be introduced.\n'There is no reason not to allow it in,' Justice Merchan said.\nMr. Steinglass won again when he persuaded Justice Merchan to admit evidence of the Trump campaign in crisis after the publication in 2016 of the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, in which Mr. Trump boasted about grabbing women by their genitals.\n'The video sent the campaign into a tailspin,' Mr. Steinglass said.\nHe offered up an email sent by a Washington Post reporter to Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump's campaign spokeswoman. Mr. Steinglass said that Ms. Hicks had forwarded the exchange to Stephen K. Bannon, Kellyanne Conway and other members of the campaign team, 'suggesting that their response should be to deny, deny, deny.' Eventually, he said, Mr. Bannon sent it to Mr. Cohen.\nMr. Blanche again protested, but was again rebuffed. The judge said he would allow jurors to see the email, saying that the ensuing thread was relevant.\nThe exchanges that prosecutors and defense lawyers debated on Monday underscored Mr. Trump's penchant for delegating dirty work to others, giving himself some distance in the process.\nThe hush-money deals worked that way: Mr. Cohen paid off Ms. Daniels, while The National Enquirer bought Ms. McDougal's silence. (Mr. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to his reimbursement of Mr. Cohen.)\nThat habit is still on display this year, and can be helpful given that Justice Merchan has barred Mr. Trump from attacking witnesses, prosecutors and the judge's own family.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump posted on social media a video of Laura Loomer, a political ally, in the park outside the courthouse. Ms. Loomer, speaking into a bullhorn, insinuated that the judge's family was politically compromised.\nHad Mr. Trump said that himself, he would have risked violating the judge's gag order.\nApril 16, 2024, 10:51 a.m. ET April 16, 2024, 10:51 a.m. ET Kate Christobek\nKate Christobek Reporting from the courthouse Jury selection has been a slow and slogging exercise but there are occasional moments of levity.

Justice Merchan said the allegations would be off-limits during the trial.\nEntering the courtroom Monday, Mr. Trump said he was 'very proud to be here,' but he looked less enthusiastic in front of Justice Merchan. He quietly slouched and scowled — and at one point before lunch, he appeared to fall asleep.\nBy afternoon, prospective jurors finally made their way into the courtroom. Some quickly left: When the judge asked the first group of 96 if any believed they could not be fair and impartial to the former president, more than 50 raised their hands. They were immediately excused.\nThe remaining jurors were each asked 42 questions. By the end of Monday, 11 jurors had been questioned and two more were excused: a woman who said she could not be fair and a man who said his child's wedding date could conflict with the trial.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT The jury selection process in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan could take two weeks or more. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times Lawyers representing the State of New York and Donald J. Trump will try to divine unspoken political biases, opinions about law enforcement and other hidden agendas in picking the 12 people who will decide the former president's fate.\nThe potential jurors, who could face public anger and threats if they are chosen, will be asked about their education, occupations, families and news sources. They will be asked to reveal whether they volunteered for or against Mr. Trump. Perhaps most critically, they will be asked whether their feelings would interfere with their ability to be fair.\nThe process could take two weeks or more — and may be as pivotal as any evidence presented in court.\n'It's the most important part,' said Arthur Aidala, a defense attorney whose firm has had many high-profile clients, including Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's former lawyer. 'And the hardest part too.'\nThe stakes of jury selection are particularly high for Mr. Trump's team, which is aware of the former president's poor standing among many in New York County — Manhattan, as most people know it — which overwhelmingly voted for President Biden in 2020.\nMr. Trump's legal team sees the case as winnable, although some believe a full acquittal is less likely than the prospect of finding jurors willing to cause a mistrial by holding out against a unanimous guilty verdict, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions.\nMr. Trump's lawyers want a jury that includes younger Black men and white working-class men, particularly public employees like police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers. Those who have had bad experiences with the legal system will also be prized by the defense, which has cast the case as politically motivated.\nProsecutors, conversely, will probably be looking for more educated voters from Democratic neighborhoods, fishing for those who consume news from sources like MSNBC, known for its outspoken liberal hosts, and who are fond of late-night comedians like Stephen Colbert, who hosted a presidential panel with Mr. Biden on March 28.\nUnlike most trials, where many potential jurors are loath to serve, some may be actively trying to get seated in this case. Michael Farkas, a defense attorney, said that those who seem to be angling for the jury 'are the people who are most likely to have a partisan agenda.'\nSome may not be completely forthcoming.\n'In a case like this, both parties can pretty much rest assured that they are going to have people on the jury that aren't being completely honest about how they feel,' Mr. Farkas said.\nMr. Aidala was blunter about potential jurors.\n'They lie,' he said, adding, 'People want to be on that jury because they think they're going to write a book or they're going to be on '20/20' or '48 Hours' or one of those things.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Not since Eugene V. Debs campaigned from a prison cell more than a century ago has the United States experienced what might now happen: a prominent candidate with a felony conviction running for president. And never before has that candidate been someone with a real chance of winning.\nFormer President Donald J. Trump has been charged with dozens of felonies across four cases: two federal, one in New York and another in Georgia. The first of those to go to trial is the sex scandal cover-up in New York, where jury selection began on Monday.\nFor now, he faces no formal campaign restrictions, beyond having to be present in a courtroom, and he remains highly competitive in polls. But some of the cases are proceeding at a pace that could bring verdicts before the election — and the Constitution and American law have clear answers for only some of the questions that will arise if he is convicted.\nOthers would bring the country into truly uncharted territory, with huge decisions resting in the hands of federal judges.\nHere is what we know, and what we don't know.\nThis is the simplest question of the bunch. The answer is yes.\nThe Constitution sets very few eligibility requirements for presidents. They must be at least 35 years old, be 'natural born' citizens and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years.\nThere are no limitations based on character or criminal record. While some states prohibit felons from running for state and local office, these laws do not apply to federal offices.\nThe Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground.\n'We let states set the time, place and manner' of elections, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School who specializes in election law, 'but I think the best reading of our Constitution is you don't let the state add new substantive requirements.'\nWhile that view is not universal among legal experts, it prevailed in court in 2019, after California passed a law requiring candidates to release their tax returns in order to appear on primary ballots. A federal district judge blocked the law from taking effect, saying it was most likely unconstitutional. The California Supreme Court also unanimously blocked it as a violation of the state constitution, and the case never reached the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' after taking an oath to support the Constitution.\nNumerous lawsuits had argued that Mr. Trump's actions before and on Jan. 6, 2021, met this bar. In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine's secretary of state did the same. But the Supreme Court — led by a conservative supermajority, with three justices appointed by Mr. Trump himself — concluded that only Congress had the power to enforce Section 3 against candidates for federal office. (Four of the justices, including the three liberals, wanted to allow a wider range of options for disqualification.)\nCongress is not going to do that with Republicans in control of the House. And the 14th Amendment is separate from criminal cases, meaning convictions would not disqualify Mr. Trump either.\nCongress can designate either groups of people to whom Section 3 applies (such as people who fought for the Confederacy) or specific crimes that, upon conviction, would trigger disqualification, said Anthony Michael Kreis, an assistant professor of law at Georgia State University. But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty.\n'Whether or not Trump is tried, convicted, acquitted, that's a separate question from whether or not he's disqualified,' said Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nOne of the charges in the federal case related to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election — conspiracy to violate civil rights — once carried a disqualification penalty, Mr. Kreis said, but Congress removed it decades ago.\nNow that Mr. Trump has secured a majority of delegates to the Republican convention, the party has no mechanism to nominate somebody else. Under the party's official convention rules, if a delegate tries to support someone other than the person the primary results bound them to, 'such support shall not be recognized.'\nNor have top Republicans shown any interest in another nominee.\nIf he were forced to withdraw from the race after the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him.\nafter the convention, party leaders could replace him then; they considered doing so in 2016 after the release of the 'Access Hollywood' tape in which he bragged about grabbing women's genitals. But this is highly unlikely given how vigorously the party has circled the wagons around him. Probably not.\nMr. Trump is registered to vote in Florida, and he would be disenfranchised there if convicted of a felony.\nMost felons in Florida regain voting rights after completing their full sentence, including parole or probation, and paying all fines and fees. But it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump, if convicted, would have time to complete his sentence before Election Day.\nHe could also petition for clemency, which would require the approval of the governor — Ron DeSantis, who ran against Mr. Trump in the Republican primary — and two Florida cabinet members. Chris Taylor, the director of external affairs for the Florida Commission on Offender Review, confirmed that a Florida resident convicted of a felony could apply to have their voting rights restored through that process even if their conviction happened outside Florida.\nSince Mr. Trump also has a residence in New York, he could switch his voter registration there to take advantage of its more permissive approach: Felons in New York can vote while on parole or probation. But, as in Florida and almost every other state, they are still disenfranchised while in prison.\nSo if Mr. Trump is imprisoned, he could be in the extraordinary position of being deemed fit to be voted for, but unfit to vote.\nNo one knows.\n'We're so far removed from anything that's ever happened,' said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 'It's just guessing.'\nLegally, Mr. Trump would remain eligible to be president even if he were imprisoned. The Constitution says nothing to the contrary. 'I don't think that the framers ever thought we were going to be in this situation,' Professor Levinson said.\nIn practice, the election of an incarcerated president would create a legal crisis that would almost certainly need to be resolved by the courts.\nIn theory, Mr. Trump could be stripped of his authority under the 25th Amendment, which provides a process to transfer authority to the vice president if the president is 'unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.' But that would require the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to declare Mr. Trump unable to fulfill his duties, a remote prospect given that these would be loyalists appointed by Mr. Trump himself.\nMore likely, Mr. Trump could sue to be released on the basis that his imprisonment was preventing him from fulfilling his constitutional obligations as president. Such a case would probably focus on the separation of powers, with Mr. Trump's lawyers arguing that keeping a duly elected president in prison would be an infringement by the judicial branch on the operations of the executive branch.\nOn the federal charges only, he could also try to pardon himself — or to commute his sentence, leaving his conviction in place but ending his imprisonment. Either action would be an extraordinary assertion of presidential power, and the Supreme Court would be the final arbiter of whether a 'self pardon' was constitutional.\nOr President Biden, on his way out the door, could pardon Mr. Trump on the basis that 'the people have spoken and I need to pardon him so he can govern,' Professor Chemerinsky said.\nBut that wouldn't apply to the New York or Georgia cases, because the president does not have pardon power for state charges.\nAgain, no one knows, particularly when it comes to the New York and Georgia cases.\nIn the two federal cases, a likely outcome would be that a Trump-appointed attorney general would withdraw the charges.\nThe Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents — that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties — applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario.\n'The reasons why we wouldn't want to indict a sitting president are the reasons we wouldn't want to prosecute a sitting president,' said Professor Chemerinsky, who has disagreed with the department's reasoning. 'My guess is, if the Trump prosecution were still ongoing in some way and Trump were elected, the Justice Department — which would be the Trump Justice Department — would say, ‘We're following the 1973 memo.''\nLike so much else here, this would be legally untested, and it is impossible to say what the Supreme Court would do if the question reached it.\nIn its Clinton v. Jones ruling in 1997, the court allowed a lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed. But that case was civil, not criminal, and it was filed by a private citizen, not by the government itself.\nCharlie Savage contributed reporting.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",

Lawmakers say it's a national security threat, and that the Chinese government could lean on its owner, ByteDance, to obtain sensitive U.S. user data or influence content on the app to serve its interests.\nRoughly 170 million Americans use TikTok. That's half the population of the United States.\nRoughly 170 million Americans use TikTok. That's half the population of the United States. There's a long road of legislation, deal making and legal challenges ahead before TikTok could be forced to change ownership or even be banned. The Senate would need to pass the legislation —which it may do as soon as next week, now that the House has bundled it into a foreign aid package that it is likely to vote on over the weekend. It would have to survive lawsuits from TikTok and creators. Buyers would have to clear regulatory approval. And after all that, Beijing could simply block a deal. But imagining what a United States without TikTok would look like throws into sharp relief just how much the app has worked its way into American culture.\nTikTok, which officially landed in the United States in 2018, was the most downloaded app in the country, and the world, in 2020, 2021 and 2022. It wasn't that the elements of it were so new — compelling videos from randos had long been a staple of American pop culture — but TikTok put the pieces together in a new way.\nUnlike Instagram, Facebook or Snapchat, TikTok didn't build itself around social connections. Its goal is pure, uncut entertainment. The algorithm ingested every data point it could from what users skipped, liked or shared — and spat it directly into the maddeningly habit-forming For You Page. Fans whispered reverently that it knew them better than they knew themselves.\nHere are 19 ways of understanding how TikTok became part of American life. The music America listens to, the movies it sees, what conspiracies it believes, how it can make or break a product's success, who it defines as a celebrity — all of it has been influenced by TikTok, for good and bad. Even if you've never opened the app, you've lived in a culture that exists downstream of what happens there.\nof what happens there. Insular, slow-changing Hollywood responded to TikTok's arrival in 2018 in typical fashion: complete dismissal. We're way too busy making pictures to worry about some new short-form video app.\nInsular, slow-changing Hollywood responded to TikTok's arrival in 2018 in typical fashion: complete dismissal. We're way too busy making pictures to worry about some new short-form video app. Then came denial. (This thing is just another fad.) Next, fear. (Teenagers and young adults are never going to the movies again!)\nBut there's a plot twist: Hollywood has come to see TikTok as indispensable.\n'Anyone But You,' a Sony romantic comedy starring Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, arrived to a piddly $8 million in ticket sales over Christmas weekend. The movie turned into a full-fledged hit ($219 million) after TikTok users (at the urging of Sony) began making videos of themselves re-enacting the credit sequence.\nTikTok also served as a ticket-selling machine for 'M3gan,' a Universal-Blumhouse horror movie about a sassy robot that has spawned a new franchise; 'Wonka,' which debuted in December and collected $632 million; and the Barbenheimer box office phenomenon, otherwise known as 'Barbie,' with $1.4 billion, and 'Oppenheimer,' with about $1 billion. Rote glamour shots and insipid interviews — ye olde studio publicity tools — don't work on TikTok; users want behind-the-scenes 'realness.' Hence 'Oppenheimer' stars goofing in a hotel hallway before a premiere, and pink-clad 'Barbie' stars cavorting on the floor with puppies.\n'Now that studios have figured out how to harness TikTok, the last thing they want is for it to go dark,' said Sue Fleishman, a former Universal and Warner Bros. executive who is now a consultant. 'That would actually be a big problem.'\nRecently, V Spehar has posted TikTok videos telling viewers what they might have missed from President Biden's State of the Union address, the first 15 actions that former President Donald J. Trump said he would take if he's re-elected in November and Caitlin Clark's WNBA starting salary.\nRecently, V Spehar has posted TikTok videos telling viewers what they might have missed from President Biden's State of the Union address, the first 15 actions that former President Donald J.

Spehar posts to more than three million followers from the handle @UnderTheDeskNews and films many clips lying on the floor, a gimmick that began as an effort to differentiate from the authoritative tone of traditional television news anchors. The style of communication has resonated enough to make Mx. Spehar a regular at White House briefings with social media influencers.\nNews aggregation and analysis accounts like Mx. Spehar's are shaping the discourse about current events in the United States, especially among young people. They're a modern version of old-school bloggers — users respond to the personal tone, and the editorializing. (Some creators have even built followings simply by reading print news articles to their followers.)\nPew Research Center has found that about one-third of 18- to 29-year-olds say they get news regularly on the platform, far outpacing people in other age groups.\nIn 2023, about 14% of American adults said they regularly got news on TikTok, compared with just 3% percent in 2020.\nIn 2023, about 14% of American adults said they regularly got news on TikTok, compared with just 3% percent in 2020. Other sites have similar draws. Roughly 16 percent of all American adults get their news from Instagram, and a similar amount from X. Far more people consume news on Facebook and YouTube.\nThe appeal of TikTok and other social sites has made mainstream outlets nervous, and has raised some concerns around accuracy and context as original reporting is funneled through other accounts. The Wall Street Journal has more than 340,000 followers on TikTok, while The New York Times has nearly 630,000 — numbers that pale in comparison with the followings of individual commentators like Mx.

Not counting all the times the post was referenced in videos by other TikTok users, it has been seen more than seven million times in less than three months.\nTall tales are common on TikTok, where a flimsy patchwork of assumptions and coincidences — often concerning the schemes of a nefarious echelon of elites — is illustrated by dramatic images generated by artificial intelligence and spooky musical tracks. (Other such hits include false theories that President Joe Biden rigged the Super Bowl in favor of the Kansas City Chiefs or that Justin Bieber had signaled he was a victim of PizzaGate. False allegations of voter fraud also abound.)\nAbbie Richards, a misinformation researcher who studies the TikTok ecosystem, said that such posts thrive because of the platform's potent recommendation algorithms and its low barrier to entry.\nTikTok allows users to earn money from their videos through tools such as its creator rewards program and livestream subscriptions. Conspiracy theories, which draw high engagement, are one of the most profitable categories, said Ms. Richards, a senior video producer at the liberal watchdog group Media Matters.\n'It's like candy for your brain — it tells a story that simplifies the world in a way that feels good to you,' she said.\nA quarter of American adults who use the app create 98 percent of its videos.\nA quarter of American adults who use the app create 98 percent of its videos. The toothpaste theory was promoted by two young men known for conspiratorial content, including popular posts about satanic hit men and Britney Spears. They claimed that the colored dots on toothpaste tubes correspond to all-natural, medicinal or chemical ingredients.\nThe post was quickly reposted, copied and stitched into reaction videos. Some came from dentists, who explained that the dots were actually used during the toothpaste packaging process to help guide manufacturing equipment to properly cut and seal the tubes.\nThat conspiracy theory is not new — they rarely are on TikTok. Colgate, a major toothpaste manufacturer, addressed the color patch rumor last year and said that 'as much as we love cracking secret codes, this one actually has nothing to crack because it's entirely untrue.'\nEven silly rumors, however, can spin out from TikTok into real-world harms. The baseless concerns that store-bought toothpaste tubes might hide toxic ingredients reignited recommendations to opt instead for unproven and potentially damaging homemade options.\nBy Madison Malone Kircher\nIncluding but certainly not limited to: Butter boards, sexy water, blueberry milk nails, unexpected red, lucky girl syndrome, first-time-cool syndrome, bed rotting, 75 soft, 75 cozy, bookshelf wealth, loud budgeting, broccoli freckles, strawberry makeup, glazed donut skin, latte makeup, cowboy copper hair, old money blonde, expensive brunette, orange peel theory, quiet luxury, stealth wealth, tomato girl summer, indie sleaze, coquette, looksmaxxing, male perms, vanilla girl, clean girl, soft girl, coastal grandma, coastal cowgirl, low-high visual weight makeup, sleepy-girl mocktails, fluffy coffee, shrimp tree, girl math, girl dinner, mob wife, clowncore, balletcore, Barbiecore, royalcore, corecore.\nFor the music industry , TikTok has become a potent but unpredictable promotional outlet, and a vital one in the race to mint a new hit.

Young artists like Olivia Rodrigo and Lil Nas X saw their popularity explode on the platform, and acts like Fleetwood Mac have seen decades-old songs get a boost from memes on the app. But TikTok is also the latest tech platform to draw the anger of the music industry for low royalty rates. In February, Universal Music Group, which represents artists like Ms. Rodrigo, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and Drake, withdrew the rights to its music on the app, saying that TikTok was trying to 'bully' the company to accept low terms.\nWithin days, millions of TikTok videos using music from Universal artists went mute, and since then guessing which side would blink first has become a media-business parlor game.\nLast week, however, Ms. Swift — who releases her music through Universal, but has owned the copyrights to her work since 2018 — broke ranks and put her songs back on TikTok, just ahead of the release of her next album on Friday. Now the question is, will other artists will follow.\nFor years I thought TikTok was mostly a parenting problem , and had only tangential bearing on what I cover: threats to national security. It took a while — and a lot of conversations with both tech firms and government officials — for me to become concerned about the potential that it could also pose a major problem on that front.\nFor years I thought TikTok was mostly a parenting problem, and had only tangential bearing on what I cover: threats to national security. It took a while — and a lot of conversations with both tech firms and government officials — for me to become concerned about the potential that it could also pose a major problem on that front. Not because the company's Chinese owners could figure out your dance-move preferences, but because the algorithm at the core of the app is wrapped in such mystery.\nSo what's the issue? The algorithm doesn't belong to TikTok; it is provided by engineers working for ByteDance, the Chinese company that controls the platform and develops the code in enormous secrecy in laboratories around the world, in Beijing, Singapore and Mountain View, Calif.\nThe Chinese government is intent on keeping it that way. It has issued regulations that require Beijing's regulators to grant permission before any ByteDance algorithms can be licensed to outsiders. They are unlikely to do so.\nAnd so, as long as it is written by ByteDance, and can't be picked apart on the outside, there will always be the risk that it will become a pipeline for influencing citizens, and thus voters, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways.\nSenator Mark Warner, the chairman of Senate Intelligence Committee, has noted that because TikTok has emerged as a major source of news — and because it collects data on users that the Chinese government could find useful, even crucial — it poses a serious threat, and could become 'the most powerful propaganda tool ever.'\nAt least based on what the United States has made public. The intelligence agencies have been giving closed-door briefings, but presumably there hasn't been a classified blockbuster, since there would likely be great pressure to declassify it.\nStill, we have seen waves of new influence campaigns flowing out of China — much of it aimed at nations other than the United States. While TikTok has not been at the center of those campaigns, clearly, the Chinese have learned a lot in the past few years, including from the Russians. (Researchers have also found that topics commonly suppressed in China, including about the Tibetan and Uyghur populations, appear to be unusually underrepresented on TikTok compared with Instagram.)\nThis is not a problem that would be solved by simply selling TikTok's operations to an American buyer. Sure, the bill that went through the House bans a new, Western-owned TikTok from having any 'operational relationship' with ByteDance, 'including any cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm.' Good luck with that — TikTok would no longer be TikTok.\nThe real question is whether anyone gets to look under the hood. Because to make Americans trust TikTok, the country will need an early warning system, something that will assure everyone that a technology that became popular because it generated memes and celebrates self-expression does not become a conduit for a foreign government interested in subtly influencing how we vote.\nSouthern Alamance Middle School, a public school in Graham, N.C., recently came up with a novel way to combat student distractions from social media. Or at least to curb the phenomenon that some teachers have dubbed 'Toilet TikToks.'\nSouthern Alamance Middle School, a public school in Graham, N.C., recently came up with a novel way to combat student distractions from social media. Or at least to curb the phenomenon that some teachers have dubbed 'Toilet TikToks.' The problem: Educators there noticed a spike in the number of students asking to leave class — sometimes as frequently as nine times per day — to go to the bathroom, where they made TikTok videos.\nThe solution: Administrators decided to remove the bathroom mirrors that students used to film TikToks and primp for their close-ups. They also introduced an online system that issues students digital hall passes when they want to be excused from class and that allows administrators to track students' locations. 'Since removing the mirrors,' administrators wrote in a message to parents in January, 'we have seen a drastic decrease in bathroom visits from students asking to be excused just to make videos.'\nToilettoks — a TikTok genre, dating back at least five years, in which students use school bathrooms as film sets for dance routines, lip-syncing clips or critiques of unclean lavatories — are one of the milder social media annoyances for schools.\nAcross the United States, students have also used school bathrooms as arenas to stage, film and post videos of bullying, physical assaults on schoolmates and acts of vandalism.\nIn March, Alamance-Burlington schools announced that it was joining dozens of other U.S. districts that have filed lawsuits accusing social media platforms, including TikTok, of unfairly ensnaring young people.\n'We're seeing the negative impacts of social media on our students every day,' Kristy Davis, the acting superintendent of Alamance-Burlington schools, said. 'Their well-being has to be the top priority.'\nMy favorite Instagram account is a collection of TikToks.

Curated by the videographer Leia Jospé, @favetiktoks420 hunts for Gen-Z's ickiest thirst traps and bleakest acting exercises and delivers them to me in a Millennial-safe package, uploading them directly to a social network that I actually use. By the time TikTok debuted, in 2017, I was already in my 30s and too old and lazy to work another app into my rotation. Instagram and Twitter were distracting enough. But now those platforms lie downstream of TikTok's creative wellspring, waiting for bits of its most popular content to drift into the open internet. TikToks float into my friends' Instagram stories, percolate into our group chats, swirl into my Twitter feed. My phone is always bleating with its outro sound effect. I rarely open TikTok, but I watch TikToks all the time.\nTikToks let loose a chaotic element into Instagram's internet mall, and they break the monotony of Twitter's boosted tech-bro threads. They stock YouTube compilations and spark Facebook debates and fuel trend pieces.\nIf TikTok were to disappear, it would feel, at least for a while, like the internet's big content spigot had been turned to a trickle. Rival platforms have tried to remake themselves in TikTok's image — building in short-form videos, algorithmic timelines and searchable sound clips — but have failed to reproduce the hypnotic energy of its perpetual discovery machine. We'd be left with a diluted version of its secret sauce.\nBut any network that hopes to capitalize on its own popularity will disrupt its product. Even as other social media platforms try to become TikTok, TikTok is trying to become them, lengthening its videos to compete with YouTube and introducing an e-commerce platform to 'drive meaningful shopping experiences' and rival Instagram. Eventually some new, inexplicably addictive platform will rise in its place. And I will rely on the kindness of some slightly younger strangers to show me what's on it.\nMuch has been said about the 'addictive design' of TikTok. But what is the social media site actually doing to our brains?\nThere is very little research looking at what goes on inside people's heads while they're using TikTok. But one small study conducted on Chinese university students used magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activity while they watched personalized TikTok videos (ones the algorithm had selected based on their past use) versus generalized ones (videos the app recommended to new users).\nThe students had greater activity in several areas of the brain, including ones associated with reward, attention and processing social information, while viewing personalized videos. In other words, the algorithm did its job.\nOther social media platforms have been shown to turn on similar brain regions. So what makes TikTok different? Some experts have proposed that it can send users into a 'flow state': the experience of being so absorbed in a task that the person loses track of time. Backing this up, one study found that TikTok users reported experiencing higher levels of flow than Instagram users.\n'Flow' is often associated with work or hobbies — activities that are challenging enough to be engaging but not frustrating. Watching videos doesn't require skill the way that many flow-inducing activities do, yet the app is able to induce the feelings of enjoyment, concentration and time distortion that are characteristic of flow — possibly because of the algorithm's immersive quality.\nIs there any more official signal that a business titan has arrived at the heart of the American social-financial-artistic-political power nexus than being invited to be an honorary host of the annual Met Gala, a.k.a. 'the party of the year'? Any more glamorous recognition than being asked to join its convener, the Vogue editor, Anna Wintour, in the Metropolitan Museum's soaring atrium as the great and the good of Hollywood, fashion, sports, Wall Street and Washington swan past?\nIs there any more official signal that a business titan has arrived at the heart of the American social-financial-artistic-political power nexus than being invited to be an honorary host of the annual Met Gala, a.k.a. 'the party of the year'? Any more glamorous recognition than being asked to join its convener, the Vogue editor, Anna Wintour, in the Metropolitan Museum's soaring atrium as the great and the good of Hollywood, fashion, sports, Wall Street and Washington swan past? On May 6, TikTok will be lead sponsor of both the party and the museum fashion exhibition it celebrates. The company's chief executive, Shou Chew, has been named an honorary chair of this year's gala, along with the Loewe designer Jonathan Anderson, while Ms. Wintour, Zendaya, Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez and Chris Hemsworth are the event's co-chairs.\nThat placement would put TikTok firmly in the tradition of previous gala sponsors like Amazon, Instagram and Apple — tech companies bedazzled by the Old Establishment, which in turn is bedazzled by their blush of upstart cool.\nIt is an acknowledgment, if any were needed, of the prominent role the app has come to play in fashion in a mere few years.\nIt was only in 2021, after all, that Ms. Wintour was criticized for inviting TikTok stars such as Addison Rae and Dixie D'Amelio to the party — for somehow cheapening it by catering to the buzzfeed machine of the smartphone, rather than the elite. After all, not just anyone can get an invite, even if they can afford the $50,000 price tag for a seat; Ms. Wintour vets every guest, and the price of admission has to do with cultural currency even more than actual currency.\nWhich is why, of course, TikTok belongs. Despite the fact that all social media is forbidden inside the party.\nFast-forward three years, and there are more than 75 billion views associated with the #TikTokfashion hashtag; almost 500 million with #2023Gala alone. Luxury brands routinely sign up TikTok stars as brand ambassadors along with every other kind of star, hoping to access their audience (received relevance is something Vogue might be getting out of the association, too). And thus is created a virtuous — or vicious? — cycle in which TikTok feeds the gala machine, which feeds TikTok, which is the vicarious experience that has come to feed us all.\nTikTok is a motherlode of mental health content , filled with compelling first-person accounts of everything from major depression to selective mutism. Depending on your perspective, that's either a very good thing — or concerning.\nTikTok is a motherlode of mental health content, filled with compelling first-person accounts of everything from major depression to selective mutism. Depending on your perspective, that's either a very good thing — or concerning. Corey Basch, who analyzed 100 popular TikTok videos with the hashtag mentalhealth for a 2022 study, emerged concerned about the looping effect of the algorithm.\n'What's so important and disturbing to recognize is the downward spiral that users can get swept into,' said Dr. Basch, a professor of public health at William Paterson University. 'If one is drawn to posts related to despair and anxiety, they can easily spend hours exposed to repetitive content known as an echo chamber.'\nThe surge of content about mental health has meant that young people are more likely to self-diagnose before seeing a clinician, psychiatrists report. Diagnoses for ADHD and anxiety disorders shot up during the pandemic years, especially among young people.\nSome researchers have expressed concern about how profit motives may feed into these trends, since platforms often feature advertising from app-based mental health services, and influencers have sponsorship deals with such companies.\n'They say we can diagnose you really quick, just take this five-question quiz and we can send you a prescription in a nice little box,' said Holly Avella, a Ph.D. candidate at Rutgers University who has researched mental health and social media.\nResearchers also warn that TikTok videos can deliver misinformation. A review of literature published last year found that around one-fifth of videos mentioning cognitive behavioral therapy were inaccurate, describing it as ineffective or harmful.\nBut some users credit the app with breaking open the national conversation around mental illness.\n'You can sit there on your pedestal and pooh-pooh it all you want,' said Kate Speer, who has used her social media feeds to describe her experience of serious mental illness. TikTok is helpful for 'the very people who are struggling the most, those who don't have access to services in the real world and who might even be so disabled by mental illness that they are locked in their houses.'\nBy Michael M.

Instead, he released his first TikTok. 'Chiefs or Niners?' asked a disembodied, youthful-sounding voice. 'Two great quarterbacks; hard to decide,' replied the president, casually dressed in a half-zip sweater and khakis. The caption was 'lol hey guys.'\nTeam Biden, like most other major politicians, had previously resisted joining the app because of security concerns related to its Chinese ownership. (The Donald Trump campaign is not on TikTok, and Mr. Trump has expressed divergent views about the app, proposing a ban during his presidency but recently criticizing an attempt by Congress to curtail its use in the United States.)\nGiving in was a nod to the irrefutable importance of TikTok, where about 14 percent of American adults regularly get news, in an election year. There's now a small studio in the Biden campaign office in Wilmington, Del., where staff members can film 'candid' videos with the candidate.\n62% of Americans between 18- and 29-years-old use the platform, greater than the share of that age group that voted in the last presidential election.\n62% of Americans between 18- and 29-years-old use the platform, greater than the share of that age group that voted in the last presidential election. Campaigns have a rich tradition of adapting to the latest technological fads, from wireless radio to television sets and, more recently, to social platforms like Facebook and Snapchat. Many of these efforts share a how-do-you-do-fellow-kids quality to them, and in an attempt to avoid appearing out of touch, the Biden campaign relies on young, digitally fluent aides to host its TikToks.\nIt works, sometimes. One video claims to have Trump 'caught on camera' making offensive remarks, an attempt to replicate the amateur spontaneity of many TikToks. (In reality, it's someone's iPhone aimed at a TV broadcast of a Trump speech.) Other times it comes across try-hard-y, like the video that dismisses a post by Representative Jim Jordan using a popular 'I Ain't Reading All That' online meme.\nThe @bidenhq account, though, is hovering around 299,000 followers — still small beans in the TikTok world.

The internet might have killed malls, but now it is one big mall.\nBecause the bite-size videos are addictive, and partly because advertising on the platform is relatively inexpensive for smaller brands, the app has become a core part of many companies' marketing plans. Brands say that their videos populated with everyday people can more easily go viral than on, say, Instagram, where they often need to pay expensive influencers. And people who notice shopping-related content spend more time on TikTok, according to eMarketer.\nThe average user spends nearly an hour — 58 minutes — per day on the platform.\nThe average user spends nearly an hour — 58 minutes — per day on the platform. Last year, TikTok debuted a prominent shopping feed on the app that now allows people to buy goods directly from a wide array of vendors.

In some cases, the effect has been dramatic:\nCooking is different now.

One crucial distinction between the hit recipes of today (like Emily Mariko's salmon and rice bowl) and those of yesteryear (The Silver Palate's chicken marbella) is the medium. Before, a static image was all you had to get the point across in a recipe, with step-by-step instructions printed in a cookbook.\nNow recipes unfold over time. In a 30-second video, there are obvious visual cues that viewers can absorb, techniques they can sink their teeth into. The videos depict process, not just stages, and allow you to jump-cut your way through a recipe in a few blinks.\nBut for all the access to techniques and cuisines that TikTok has provided home cooks, the platform favors concepts, over actual recipes — eggs fried in a puddle of pesto, sandwich fillings chopped into a homogenous mixture, mini pancakes served like cereal. The most shareable recipes are the ones that you can watch once, then turn around and make — no measurements, bake times or reading needed. Just dump, stir, like, follow, repeat.\nEvery social media app is, essentially, a spy in your pocket. When it comes to data collection, TikTok is no worse than the others.

When it comes to data collection, TikTok is no worse than the others. The main difference, and the one that's driving the current conversation in Washington, is that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company. TikTok, like other apps, seeks a huge amount of information from you, and some pieces of it that can seem innocuous are quite revealing, including:\nAn I.P. address is a unique identifier associated with your device or the network you use to get on the internet. TikTok can use your I.P. address and location to determine the advertising you see, but it can also reveal other real-life associations. When people access a social network from the same I.P. address, it reveals that they may know one another offline. ByteDance, which owns TikTok, used I.P. address data collected from journalists using the app to try to identify company employees who were speaking to them.\nGiving TikTok access to the hundreds (or thousands) of numbers and email addresses on your phone — an opt-in feature — lets them draw unexpected insights into your life, such as who your doctors are, your present and former colleagues, your one-night stands, and on and on. TikTok may then recommend you follow them as 'people you may know' — and your account, in turn, will be suggested to them, so beware of sharing contacts if you're trying to stay anonymous. Even if you don't share your contacts, TikTok can look for the phone or email address you gave the company in other users' address books unless you go into the privacy settings and turn off 'Suggest Your Account to Others.'\nUnless your messages are end-to-end encrypted, which they are not on TikTok, they can be reviewed by the company storing them for you.\nAre you obsessed with steamy Twilight highlight reels or home repair videos?

'I searched, ‘how to write goals,'' she said. 'There was this lady walking you through this meditation to visualize your future self, and it was one of the only times I could see an older version of myself. It was so inspirational, I closed the app, got out a piece of paper and started writing.'\nIn a video by the account @salarytransparentstreet that's been viewed more than 23 million times, a lawyer candidly shares she makes $134,000 a year, a teacher says she earns $53,000 and a man who does chemical risk assessments for the federal government divulges he makes $60,000 a year. The point, according to Hannah Williams, the 27-year-old content creator behind the account, is to help people better understand what they could be earning. (Ms. Williams says she made more than $1 million in 2023 before expenses through her videos and earns revenue from brand sponsorships and ads).\nFinTok, as the money and personal finance community on the app is called, has fundamentally changed the way we accept advice from strangers — and altered how much ordinary people are willing to share about that most taboo subject: how much money they have.\nSure, the app has allowed established finance gurus like Dave Ramsey and Suze Orman to expand their empires. But is has also given rise to people like Vivian Tu, a 30-year-old former Wall Street trader who runs the account @yourrichbff.

There are also crypto scams, including a rampant one using deepfake videos of Elon Musk. (Ads for crypto or financial services are banned from the platform, in part to help protect people from getting involved with high-risk investments. )\nBut often, when scams or bad advice crop up, commenters have no problem offering corrections.

            "summary": "Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The United States and other members of the United Nations Security Council urged restraint in the Middle East on Sunday, as officials in Israel debated how to respond to a direct attack by Iran over the weekend that threatened to further destabilize the region. Israel's military, with the help of the United States, Britain and Jordan, shot down nearly all of the drones and missiles that Iran fired on Saturday, in what was believed to be the first direct Iranian attack on Israel after years of a shadow war. Life largely returned to normal in Israel on Sunday, and there were indications that the military would not seek to immediately retaliate against Iran, even as tensions remained high in the region. Iranian officials also appeared to signal that its operation against Israel was over. Israel's war cabinet concluded a meeting on Sunday evening without deciding how to respond to Iran's assault, according to an official briefed on the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks more freely. By nightfall, the military had yet to detail possible options, the official said.\nIn public, Israeli ministers appeared divided over how to respond. Benny Gantz, a centrist minister and one of three voting members of the war cabinet, said that Israel should exact a price from Iran, but only 'in a way and at a time that suits us.' Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right minister, then criticized Mr. Gantz for his perceived moderation, arguing that Israel should deter Iran by going 'crazy.'\nThe Biden administration is advising Israel that it does not necessarily need to fire back at Iran, with U.S. officials saying that Israel had proved its ability to protect itself.\nIranian officials issued a series of statements that appeared designed to keep tensions from escalating further. Iran's foreign minister said that Tehran 'has no intention of continuing defensive operations, but if necessary it will not hesitate to protect its legitimate interests against any new aggression.' Residents remove possessions and inspect their homes following Israeli airstrikes in Khan Yunis, Gaza, on Saturday. Israeli military analysts are divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza. Credit...Within moments of Israel and its allies shooting down a fusillade of Iranian missiles and drones this weekend, many began wondering what the latest exchange between Israel and Iran would mean for the war in the Gaza Strip. The Iranian attack was retaliation for what was widely believed to be an Israeli strike this month on an embassy building in Damascus that killed seven Iranian officials, including three top commanders in Iran's armed forces. But it occurred against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel is battling Hamas, a militant group funded and armed by Iran. Israeli military analysts were divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza, now in its sixth month. The next fulcrum in that war could hinge on whether Israel decides to pursue Hamas in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have fled amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis. Some analysts argued that the implications for Gaza would depend on whether Israel responded with a major counterattack against Iran. Others contended that Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip would be unaffected. Shlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and a former director of the Israeli military's strategic planning division, said that if Israel responds with substantial force to the Iranian attack, it could spark a multifront war that would compel the Israeli leadership to move its attention away from Gaza. In the case of a significant regional conflagration, General Brom said, Israel might choose to delay its plans to invade Rafah, which Israeli officials describe as the last Hamas stronghold. 'It's not comfortable for us to have simultaneous, high-intensity wars in multiple theaters,' General Brom added. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to send ground forces into Rafah, despite international pressure to back off the operation. On Sunday, an Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that the Iranian attack would have no effect on the military's plan to invade Rafah. A large-scale direct confrontation with Iran could potentially bring the war in Gaza to a close, General Brom said. But for the war to end in such a way, it would require a broader cease-fire that encompassed several parties, including Israel, Iran and the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. 'There's an idea that in order to resolve a crisis, the situation first needs to become worse,' he said, explaining that an escalation followed by a comprehensive cease-fire with Iran might incline that country to push its regional proxies to stop fighting with Israel. While the members of Israel's war cabinet did not issue a formal statement after meeting on Sunday, a separate Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, indicated that the country would respond to the Iranian assault — although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how. Other military experts, however, dismissed the link between the Iranian attack and the war in Gaza. 'There's no connection at all,' said Amos Gilead, a retired major general who served in Israeli military intelligence. General Gilead said that Israel's army had enough resources to fight against Iran and continue to wage war against Hamas in Gaza. Others analysts made a similar point, arguing that the resources needed to fight Iran were different from those needed in Gaza. Israel needs fighter jets and air defense systems to counter Iran, they said. In contrast, they added, the army mainly requires ground troops, drones, and attack helicopters to fight Hamas in Gaza. 'There's no real tension between these two things,' said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel's National Security Council. Still, General Eiland said that the success of the coalition that repelled the Iranian attack, which included the United States, Britain and Jordan, could inspire Israel to take advantage of the momentum to overcome its declining status internationally by ending the war in Gaza. Though the United States, Israel's closest ally, has broadly supported Israel's decision to go to war in Gaza, it has increasingly signaled its displeasure over the mounting death toll and warned against a major ground assault in Rafah. The support the United States provided Israel on Sunday in shooting down Iranian drones and missiles could give it more leverage over its Israeli counterparts. While General Eiland said such an outcome could help Israel develop good will in the international community and contribute to reaching a solution to end the war in Gaza and skirmishes with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, he was doubtful that Mr. Netanyahu would purse such a path. 'He says he wants to achieve ‘total victory' in Gaza and conquer Rafah, a process that could last two or three months,' he said, referring to the prime minister. 'It's clear Netanyahu has a different mind-set and priorities.' Aaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

Credit... Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, with diplomats urging restraint by all parties to prevent conflict in the region from escalating. The brazen attack this weekend, when Iran launched a barrage of drones and missiles in retaliation for Israel's attacking its embassy compound in Syria earlier in the month, was the first time Iran had launched open attacks against Israel from its soil. The attack has unnerved a region already roiling in conflict, raising concerns among diplomats and U.N. officials that a new, potentially wide and destructive war could spark if both sides don't stand down. António Guterres, the Secretary General of the U.N., told the Council that it was 'time to step back from the brink,' and that its members, as well as the United Nations at large, had the collective responsibility 'to actively engage all parties concerned to prevent further escalation.' The meeting on Sunday was convened at the request of Israel. The Council has not collectively issued a statement condemning Iran's attack, and it has also not issued a statement condemning Israel's attack on Iran's embassy in Damascus that killed several senior commanders. All 15 members of the Council must reach a consensus for a statement to be issued and none was reached on both issues. The Security Council is one of the few venues where adversaries engaged in conflict come face to face and sit in the same chamber. On Sunday, both Israel and Iran's ambassadors were present and delivered fiery comments about the other's country, blaming each other for actions they both called terrorism. Gilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador, said Iran's attack had 'crossed every red line' and Israel reserved the right to retaliate. Mr. Erdan called for the Council to take severe action against Iran, including 'crippling' sanctions and statements of condemnation. 'The fact that Israel's air defense proved to be superior does not change the brutality of Iran's attack,' he said. Iran's ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, said his country had an 'inherent right to self-defense' after Israel's attack on its diplomatic compound. Mr. Iravani said that Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region,' but that if its interests, people or national security came under attack it would 'respond to any such threat or aggressions vigorously and in accordance with international law.' The United States and Iran both said that they do not seek war with one another, but that if one attacks the other's interests, there would be a defensive response. Robert A. Wood, a U.S. representative to the U.N., told the Security Council that the 'U.S. is not seeking escalation, our actions have been defensive in nature,' and said the U.S. goal was to 'de-escalate' and then get back to securing an end to the conflict in Gaza. Mr. Wood said the U.S. planned to bring further action on Iran at the Council and called on the Council to unequivocally condemn Iran's actions. Any resolution against Iran put forth by the U.S. at the Council would likely be vetoed by Russia and China, two of Iran's close allies, who sharply criticized Israel for what they said was reckless violation of international law when it attacked Iran's embassy compound. 'What happened in the night of the 14th of April did not happen in a vacuum,' said Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's ambassador to the U.N. China's ambassador, Dai Bing, called on the Council to 'exercise maximum calm and restraint' and said the implementation of an immediate cease-fire is the 'top priority.' Israel has said that the embassy compound was a legitimate military target because senior commanders from Iran's Quds Forces, the external branch of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, were holding a meeting inside the building.

Shear Reporting from Washington The White House said that President Biden and King Abdullah II of Jordan spoke on Sunday about the Iranian attacks and pledged to stay in contact in the days ahead.

Ramadan Abed/Reuters As thousands of displaced Palestinians attempted to return to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, Israeli troops fired at the crowd, forcing people to turn back in panic, according to an emergency worker and two people who tried to make the journey. Wafa, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency, reported that five people were killed and 23 wounded by Israeli gunfire and artillery in the incident on Al-Rashid Street south of Gaza City as a crowd of Gazans headed north to their homes. The circumstances of the deaths could not be confirmed independently, and the Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions about whether its forces opened fire on Palestinian civilians trying to cross to northern Gaza. For months, the Israeli military has barred Palestinians who have been displaced by the war in Gaza from returning to their homes in northern Gaza. It has become a sticking point in negotiations between Israel and Hamas. It was not clear why some Palestinians believed that Israel would not block them from returning on Sunday. But they were making the journey on a day when Iran had launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel. More than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its assault there in October, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. The assault occurred in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people. On Sunday morning Jamila Ibrahim, 39, said that she began hearing of some Palestinians who left early and managed to get back to the north. She later spoke with friends who were able to return north. But there were very few. Around 10:30 a.m. she and her three children — who are between 10 and 17 — set out, joining other people on the journey. She said there were no official notices from the Israel military, which has occupied large parts of Gaza after it launched a ground invasion, that residents would be allowed to return to their homes. It was just based on word of mouth, as well as people seeing others leaving and being encouraged to join the trek home, she said. 'Some people were scared, they didn't know what fate they were heading to, they didn't know what would happen,' she said. 'Some were happy that they were going to return.' Most people were on foot — carrying what little food they had or their few belongings in bags and luggage — and some paid large sums of money to go by car, trucks or donkey carts, she said. But they all took the same seaside road, heading north toward an Israeli checkpoint that has cut off southern Gaza from the north. 'There was lots of tension, lots of tension among the people, they were scared they could be shot,' she said. Those who tried to cross north in the middle of the night — around 4 a.m. — managed to make it to the north, she said, based on her conversation with friends who crossed successfully. But later that morning, by the time she and other displaced Palestinians tried to follow, Israeli forces opened fire on them, she said. 'Around 12:30 the Israelis started shooting,' she said. Mazen Al-Harazeen, a first responder in Gaza, said Israeli forces fired weapons and he did not know how many had been killed, but he said, 'There was shooting and martyrs.' Early Sunday morning, Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces, or I.D.F., wrote on social media that the rumors that the army was allowing residents to return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip were false. 'The I.D.F. will not allow the return of residents,' he added. 'For your safety, do not approach the forces operating there.' Nearly 2 million Gazans have been displaced by the war between Hamas and Israel, now in its sixth month. One of their biggest concerns is when and if they will be allowed to return to their homes, or whether they will be permanently displaced, as previous generations were. Around 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes in 1947 and 1948 during the wars surrounding Israel's establishment as a state. Bilal Shbair contributed reporting.

At Amina al-Hasoni's house in the village of al-Fur'ah, Israel, the Iranian attack wounded her and ripped holes in the roof and floor. Credit... Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times The hospital waiting room was quiet on Sunday: There was no crowd of relatives, no flood of patients. Israel's air defenses had just fended off a large-scale Iranian attack, with only one serious casualty recorded. But there was no sense that a crisis had been averted outside the pediatric intensive care unit at Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel's city of Beersheba. Instead, tension filled the air until the doors to the ward swung open and a gasping mother stumbled out, her face contorted. Then raw emotion quickly took its place as she crumbled into a chair, crying. While Israel suffered little in the way of significant damage overnight, this one family was dealt a devastating blow. Amina al-Hasoni, 7, was clinging to life — the sole serious casualty of the Iranian barrage. And were it not for systemic inequities in Israel, her relatives said, maybe she too could have been spared. There are roughly 300,000 Arab Bedouins in the Negev desert. About a quarter of them live in villages that are not recognized by Israeli officials. Without state recognition, those communities have long suffered from a lack of planning and basic services like running water, sewers and electricity. And few have access to bomb shelters, despite repeated requests to the state. The Hasoni family lives in one such community, sharing a hilltop in the Negev village of al-Fur'ah with a plot of disconnected houses. When rocket warning sirens went off on Saturday night, Amina's uncle Ismail said he felt stuck — there was nowhere to go. Booms overhead signaled air defenses intercepting missiles before there was a big explosion. Then he heard a woman screaming — his sister — and 'I started running,' he said. Ismail, 38, found his sister outside her house holding Amina, who was bleeding from the head. Her family had decided to flee the rockets, running out the front door. But Amina, who slept in a back room with pink walls covered in painted butterflies, didn't make it. A missile fragment ripped through the home's thin metal roof, shearing a hole with sharp metallic edges. It made impact just in front of the door — which is where Amina was knocked unconscious. 'I think it hit her while she was running away,' Ismail said. He said he took the injured Amina from his sister and lifted the girl into his own arms. Ismail then tracked down a car that raced her toward the hospital, more than 40 minutes away on a rutted, winding road that fades out in some places, with camels crossing in others. Only then, with Amina on her way, did he go inside the house, where he said he saw a large, black piece of shrapnel about the size of a pretzel jar. And 'there was blood,' he said, a puddle that had turned into a stream across the tile floor, to the front door. By Sunday afternoon, the orange patterned tiles had been cleaned. None of the dozen or so relatives there could say who had done it, only that 'it was bad for the children to see' all the blood. But Ismail hasn't gone back inside. 'It's difficult,' he said, his jeans and boots still spattered with blood. Not far from where he sat, a pink Minnie Mouse blanket and a small black-and-white girl's dress hung on a family clothesline. 'We could have built shelters here,' Ismail added. He dismissed any suggestions that what happened to Amina was bad luck. 'It's part of a policy,' he said. 'We can't do anything.' The missile fragment that tore into Amina's home was one of more than 150 collected in the area on Sunday by police bomb disposal teams, and the family said officers had taken away the piece that hit their home. The teams combed the desert for hours, searching for debris and carting away huge hunks of twisted metal — efforts repeated across Israel. The Hasoni home is not far from a military base, Nevatim, that was reportedly a target of the Iranian assault and that Israeli officials said was lightly damaged. That is little consolation to Amina's father, Muhammad, who spent the morning at the hospital taking turns at her bedside. He didn't say much to her, he said, and just repeated her name. Amina — the youngest of his 14 children — 'likes to laugh and have fun all the time,' said Muhammad, 49. She's a good student with a 'strong personality,' he added, who doesn't always listen to instructions. And she loves to draw. He called Iran's actions 'inhumane.' 'May God demolish them,' he said, without hesitation.

Tomer Neuberg/Associated Press After convening a virtual meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, Group of 7 leaders adopted a joint declaration that reaffirmed their 'full solidarity and support to Israel' and accused Iran of having risked 'provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation' that must be avoided. Iran's attack, which appeared to have been mostly intercepted by Israel and its allies, was carried out in retaliation for Israeli attacks on an Iranian Embassy building in Syria earlier this month. Iranian leaders have signaled that their retaliation is over unless they are attacked again. The joint declaration from the leaders of G7 nations — Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, as well as the European Union — demanded that 'Iran and its proxies cease their attacks.' The leaders said they were ready 'to take further measures now and in response to further destabilizing initiatives.' Hoping to head off Israel from further escalating the conflict, President Biden privately advised Israel against firing back on Iran, U.S. officials said on Sunday. It was not yet clear how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his government would respond. Leaders of the European Union have publicly urged restraint from both countries as they, too, condemned Iran's actions. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, called the attack 'blatant and unjustifiable,' adding that 'all actors must now refrain from further escalation.' Charles Michel, president of the European Council, said that the condemnation from G7 leaders was unanimous and that 'all parties must exercise restraint.' 'Ending the crisis in Gaza as soon as possible, notably through an immediate cease-fire, will make a difference,' Mr. Michel added.

Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times Many Iranians stayed glued to their television screens and phones Saturday night, anxiously following updates as their country launched a military attack on Israel and fearing a wider war that would only add to the country's current economic upheaval. In Tehran and several other big cities, lines of cars stretched a mile or more outside gas stations in the middle of the night. Some parents kept their children home from school on Sunday. Tehran's airport closed down, and will remain that way until at least Monday morning. Iranians living inside the country said in interviews that they were worried the confrontation with Israel would spiral out of control and hoped both sides would avoid escalating the conflict. Soheil, a 37-year-old engineer in Isfahan who, like several other Iranians, asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution, said all he and his colleagues could talk about at work on Sunday was the prospect of a broader conflict. 'I'm afraid of war,' he said. 'It will have a great impact on our daily lives, especially on the economy and the price of dollar, and the anxiety will affect our mental health.' Since a strike two weeks ago on the Iranian Embassy complex in Syria that killed three top military commanders, Iran's currency, the rial, has fallen sharply against the U.S. dollar, shrinking purchasing power as Iran's leaders vowed to respond. Nafiseh, a 36-year-old high school teacher in Tehran, said that many of her students did not attend school on Sunday because parents were worried about counterattacks from Israel. 'It's all everyone is talking about, from teenagers to teachers and family members, it's all about the war and attacks,' she said. Supporters of the government hailed the attacks as Iran's showcasing its military might to defend itself on Saturday, with several hundred gathering in Tehran's Palestine Square to celebrate with fireworks and chants of 'Death to Israel.' A large mural on the square depicted Iranian missiles with a message written in Farsi and Hebrew that read, 'Next time the slap will be harder.' On Sunday night, a crowd formed again in the square, carrying signs and chanting anti-Israel slogans. Others took to social media to say they would fight for their country unconditionally if Iran were to go to war. 'When a foreign enemy is involved, honor means standing with our country even at the cost of our lives,' Reza Rashidpour, a civil engineer, wrote on social media. 'Long live Iran, long live soldiers of Iran.' But critics of the government denounced the attacks, seeing them as a misadventure that risks harming ordinary Iranians. Many Iranians oppose government policies that include funding, arming and training groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed group that has increasingly traded fire with Israel since the Oct. 7 attacks that set off the current fighting in Gaza. In protests against the government over the past few years a recurring chant has been, 'No to Gaza, no to Lebanon, my life for Iran.' Ali, a 53-year-old veteran of the Iran-Iraq war who lives in Kerman, said the existence of the Islamic Republic depends on 'crisis.' 'Now they are exploiting the war and the crisis to survive,' he said.

Hannah Mckay/Reuters After many Israelis spent a long night huddled in bomb shelters, life crept back toward calm on Sunday, even as the people of Israel waited tensely to see how their government would respond to the Iranian strikes that set off rarely heard sirens in Jerusalem. Jerusalem is targeted much less frequently than border communities or the coastal metropolis of Tel Aviv, but during the assault loud booms resounded in the skies, where missiles and interceptors wove around one another like fireflies. In areas of Jerusalem with a mostly Jewish population, many crowded into public bomb shelters, some wearing pajamas and lugging sleeping bags. 'There were more people there than usual,' said Zev Palatnik, 33, who spent some of the night in his building's bomb shelter alongside his neighbors. 'There's a sense that the rockets from Iran are more sophisticated than the ones from Gaza,' he said, adding that there was a higher level of anxiety as a result. But on Sunday, a relatively steady amount of foot traffic flowed in downtown Jerusalem as Israelis returned to work. Ron Cohen, a 37-year-old engineer, said he had hoped that the Israeli government would immediately strike back at Iran, but he did not expect a significant Israeli response. 'Not much, maybe a few small things,' he said. 'Our government knows how to defend, but not how to attack.' For the Israelis among the tens of thousands forced to flee communities along the borders with Gaza and Lebanon, the assault compounded six exhausting months of war. Many expressed uncertainty over the best way for the government to respond. Gidi Lapid, who left his home in Metula, near the border with Lebanon, with his family at the beginning of the war, said Israel might be able to show strength through restrained action. But at the same time, Iranians 'should be the ones in existential dread, in bomb shelters, stocking up on food and water,' Mr. Lapid said by phone from Eliav, a small town near Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem.

U.S. funding for both Israel and Ukraine has languished in Congress; Mr. Johnson initially refused to take up a $95 billion aid package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan passed by the Senate, and the Senate refused to take up a House Republican proposal that conditioned aid to Israel on domestic spending cuts. In recent weeks, Mr. Johnson has repeatedly vowed to ensure that the House moves to assist Ukraine. He has been searching for a way to structure a foreign aid package that could secure a critical mass of support amid stiff Republican resistance to sending aid to Kyiv and mounting opposition among Democrats to unfettered military aid for Israel. But the attacks from Iran have ratcheted up the pressure on Mr. Johnson to bring some kind of package to the floor this week, potentially forcing him to make a decision he has been agonizing over for weeks. He left it unclear on Sunday whether the legislation he said the House would advance this week would also include aid for Ukraine. Mr. Johnson said he believed that some proposals around Ukraine aid enjoyed broad support among House Republicans. He noted that he met with former President Donald J. Trump on Friday at his estate in Florida and that Mr. Trump had been supportive of conditioning the aid as a loan. 'I think these are ideas that I think can get consensus, and that's what we've been working through,' Mr. Johnson said. 'We'll send our package. We'll put something together and send it to the Senate and get these obligations completed.' Before the attacks in Israel over the weekend, Mr. Johnson had privately floated bringing up the $95 billion spending package for Ukraine and Israel passed by the Senate in February — and moving it through the House in tandem with a second bill containing policies endorsed by the conservative wing of his party. That plan envisioned two consecutive votes — one on the Senate-passed bill and another on a package of sweeteners geared toward appeasing Republicans who otherwise would be infuriated by Mr. Johnson's decision to push through a bipartisan aid package for Ukraine. Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Sunday that the two conflicts were tied together, and that he hoped they would be addressed together. 'What happened in Israel last night happens in Ukraine every night,' he said on CBS's 'Face The Nation.' Mr. McCaul said that he had previously secured a 'commitment' from Mr. Johnson that a broad national security bill would be brought to the House floor for a vote, but that the timing was unclear. 'My preference,' he said, 'is this week.' Minho Kim contributed reporting.

Iranian officials also appeared to signal that its operation against Israel was over.\nIsrael's war cabinet concluded a meeting on Sunday evening without deciding how to respond to Iran's assault, according to an official briefed on the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks more freely. By nightfall, the military had yet to detail possible options, the official said.\nIn public, Israeli ministers appeared divided over how to respond. Benny Gantz, a centrist minister and one of three voting members of the war cabinet, said that Israel should exact a price from Iran, but only 'in a way and at a time that suits us.' Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right minister, then criticized Mr. Gantz for his perceived moderation, arguing that Israel should deter Iran by going 'crazy.'\nThe Biden administration is advising Israel that it does not necessarily need to fire back at Iran, with U.S. officials saying that Israel had proved its ability to protect itself.\nIranian officials issued a series of statements that appeared designed to keep tensions from escalating further.

Israeli military analysts are divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza. Credit...Within moments of Israel and its allies shooting down a fusillade of Iranian missiles and drones this weekend, many began wondering what the latest exchange between Israel and Iran would mean for the war in the Gaza Strip.\nThe Iranian attack was retaliation for what was widely believed to be an Israeli strike this month on an embassy building in Damascus that killed seven Iranian officials, including three top commanders in Iran's armed forces. But it occurred against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel is battling Hamas, a militant group funded and armed by Iran.\nIsraeli military analysts were divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza, now in its sixth month. The next fulcrum in that war could hinge on whether Israel decides to pursue Hamas in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have fled amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis.\nSome analysts argued that the implications for Gaza would depend on whether Israel responded with a major counterattack against Iran. Others contended that Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip would be unaffected.\nShlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and a former director of the Israeli military's strategic planning division, said that if Israel responds with substantial force to the Iranian attack, it could spark a multifront war that would compel the Israeli leadership to move its attention away from Gaza.\nIn the case of a significant regional conflagration, General Brom said, Israel might choose to delay its plans to invade Rafah, which Israeli officials describe as the last Hamas stronghold.\n'It's not comfortable for us to have simultaneous, high-intensity wars in multiple theaters,' General Brom added.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to send ground forces into Rafah, despite international pressure to back off the operation. On Sunday, an Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that the Iranian attack would have no effect on the military's plan to invade Rafah.\nA large-scale direct confrontation with Iran could potentially bring the war in Gaza to a close, General Brom said. But for the war to end in such a way, it would require a broader cease-fire that encompassed several parties, including Israel, Iran and the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.\n'There's an idea that in order to resolve a crisis, the situation first needs to become worse,' he said, explaining that an escalation followed by a comprehensive cease-fire with Iran might incline that country to push its regional proxies to stop fighting with Israel.\nWhile the members of Israel's war cabinet did not issue a formal statement after meeting on Sunday, a separate Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, indicated that the country would respond to the Iranian assault — although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how.\nOther military experts, however, dismissed the link between the Iranian attack and the war in Gaza.\n'There's no connection at all,' said Amos Gilead, a retired major general who served in Israeli military intelligence.\nGeneral Gilead said that Israel's army had enough resources to fight against Iran and continue to wage war against Hamas in Gaza.\nOthers analysts made a similar point, arguing that the resources needed to fight Iran were different from those needed in Gaza. Israel needs fighter jets and air defense systems to counter Iran, they said. In contrast, they added, the army mainly requires ground troops, drones, and attack helicopters to fight Hamas in Gaza.\n'There's no real tension between these two things,' said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel's National Security Council.\nStill, General Eiland said that the success of the coalition that repelled the Iranian attack, which included the United States, Britain and Jordan, could inspire Israel to take advantage of the momentum to overcome its declining status internationally by ending the war in Gaza.\nThough the United States, Israel's closest ally, has broadly supported Israel's decision to go to war in Gaza, it has increasingly signaled its displeasure over the mounting death toll and warned against a major ground assault in Rafah. The support the United States provided Israel on Sunday in shooting down Iranian drones and missiles could give it more leverage over its Israeli counterparts.\nWhile General Eiland said such an outcome could help Israel develop good will in the international community and contribute to reaching a solution to end the war in Gaza and skirmishes with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, he was doubtful that Mr. Netanyahu would purse such a path.\n'He says he wants to achieve ‘total victory' in Gaza and conquer Rafah, a process that could last two or three months,' he said, referring to the prime minister. 'It's clear Netanyahu has a different mind-set and priorities.'\nAaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.\nWhere air defense systems were seen intercepting missiles or drones Damage or other evidence of attack visible\nWhere air defense systems were seen intercepting missiles or drones Damage or other evidence of attack visible United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addresses the United Nations Security Council during an emergency meeting at U.N. headquarters on Sunday. Credit... Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, with diplomats urging restraint by all parties to prevent conflict in the region from escalating.\nThe brazen attack this weekend, when Iran launched a barrage of drones and missiles in retaliation for Israel's attacking its embassy compound in Syria earlier in the month, was the first time Iran had launched open attacks against Israel from its soil. The attack has unnerved a region already roiling in conflict, raising concerns among diplomats and U.N. officials that a new, potentially wide and destructive war could spark if both sides don't stand down.\nAntónio Guterres, the Secretary General of the U.N., told the Council that it was 'time to step back from the brink,' and that its members, as well as the United Nations at large, had the collective responsibility 'to actively engage all parties concerned to prevent further escalation.'\nThe meeting on Sunday was convened at the request of Israel. The Council has not collectively issued a statement condemning Iran's attack, and it has also not issued a statement condemning Israel's attack on Iran's embassy in Damascus that killed several senior commanders. All 15 members of the Council must reach a consensus for a statement to be issued and none was reached on both issues.\nThe Security Council is one of the few venues where adversaries engaged in conflict come face to face and sit in the same chamber. On Sunday, both Israel and Iran's ambassadors were present and delivered fiery comments about the other's country, blaming each other for actions they both called terrorism.\nGilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador, said Iran's attack had 'crossed every red line' and Israel reserved the right to retaliate. Mr. Erdan called for the Council to take severe action against Iran, including 'crippling' sanctions and statements of condemnation.\n'The fact that Israel's air defense proved to be superior does not change the brutality of Iran's attack,' he said.\nIran's ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, said his country had an 'inherent right to self-defense' after Israel's attack on its diplomatic compound. Mr. Iravani said that Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region,' but that if its interests, people or national security came under attack it would 'respond to any such threat or aggressions vigorously and in accordance with international law.'\nThe United States and Iran both said that they do not seek war with one another, but that if one attacks the other's interests, there would be a defensive response.\nRobert A. Wood, a U.S. representative to the U.N., told the Security Council that the 'U.S. is not seeking escalation, our actions have been defensive in nature,' and said the U.S. goal was to 'de-escalate' and then get back to securing an end to the conflict in Gaza. Mr. Wood said the U.S. planned to bring further action on Iran at the Council and called on the Council to unequivocally condemn Iran's actions.\nAny resolution against Iran put forth by the U.S. at the Council would likely be vetoed by Russia and China, two of Iran's close allies, who sharply criticized Israel for what they said was reckless violation of international law when it attacked Iran's embassy compound.\n'What happened in the night of the 14th of April did not happen in a vacuum,' said Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's ambassador to the U.N.\nChina's ambassador, Dai Bing, called on the Council to 'exercise maximum calm and restraint' and said the implementation of an immediate cease-fire is the 'top priority.'\nIsrael has said that the embassy compound was a legitimate military target because senior commanders from Iran's Quds Forces, the external branch of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, were holding a meeting inside the building.\nApril 14, 2024, 7:11 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 7:11 p.m. ET Michael D.

Credit... Ramadan Abed/Reuters As thousands of displaced Palestinians attempted to return to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, Israeli troops fired at the crowd, forcing people to turn back in panic, according to an emergency worker and two people who tried to make the journey.\nWafa, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency, reported that five people were killed and 23 wounded by Israeli gunfire and artillery in the incident on Al-Rashid Street south of Gaza City as a crowd of Gazans headed north to their homes.\nThe circumstances of the deaths could not be confirmed independently, and the Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions about whether its forces opened fire on Palestinian civilians trying to cross to northern Gaza.\nFor months, the Israeli military has barred Palestinians who have been displaced by the war in Gaza from returning to their homes in northern Gaza. It has become a sticking point in negotiations between Israel and Hamas.\nIt was not clear why some Palestinians believed that Israel would not block them from returning on Sunday. But they were making the journey on a day when Iran had launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel.\nMore than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its assault there in October, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. The assault occurred in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people.\nOn Sunday morning Jamila Ibrahim, 39, said that she began hearing of some Palestinians who left early and managed to get back to the north. She later spoke with friends who were able to return north. But there were very few.\nAround 10:30 a.m. she and her three children — who are between 10 and 17 — set out, joining other people on the journey.\nShe said there were no official notices from the Israel military, which has occupied large parts of Gaza after it launched a ground invasion, that residents would be allowed to return to their homes. It was just based on word of mouth, as well as people seeing others leaving and being encouraged to join the trek home, she said.\n'Some people were scared, they didn't know what fate they were heading to, they didn't know what would happen,' she said. 'Some were happy that they were going to return.'\nMost people were on foot — carrying what little food they had or their few belongings in bags and luggage — and some paid large sums of money to go by car, trucks or donkey carts, she said. But they all took the same seaside road, heading north toward an Israeli checkpoint that has cut off southern Gaza from the north.\n'There was lots of tension, lots of tension among the people, they were scared they could be shot,' she said.\nThose who tried to cross north in the middle of the night — around 4 a.m. — managed to make it to the north, she said, based on her conversation with friends who crossed successfully.\nBut later that morning, by the time she and other displaced Palestinians tried to follow, Israeli forces opened fire on them, she said.\n'Around 12:30 the Israelis started shooting,' she said.\nMazen Al-Harazeen, a first responder in Gaza, said Israeli forces fired weapons and he did not know how many had been killed, but he said, 'There was shooting and martyrs.'\nEarly Sunday morning, Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces, or I.D.F., wrote on social media that the rumors that the army was allowing residents to return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip were false.\n'The I.D.F. will not allow the return of residents,' he added. 'For your safety, do not approach the forces operating there.'\nNearly 2 million Gazans have been displaced by the war between Hamas and Israel, now in its sixth month. One of their biggest concerns is when and if they will be allowed to return to their homes, or whether they will be permanently displaced, as previous generations were.\nAround 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes in 1947 and 1948 during the wars surrounding Israel's establishment as a state.\nBilal Shbair contributed reporting.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:49 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:49 p.m. ET Aaron Boxerman\nAaron Boxerman Reporting from Jerusalem While Israel's war cabinet members didn't issue a formal statement after the meeting, an Israeli official familiar with the discussions indicated that Israel would undoubtedly respond — although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how.

Credit... Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times The hospital waiting room was quiet on Sunday: There was no crowd of relatives, no flood of patients. Israel's air defenses had just fended off a large-scale Iranian attack, with only one serious casualty recorded.\nBut there was no sense that a crisis had been averted outside the pediatric intensive care unit at Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel's city of Beersheba. Instead, tension filled the air until the doors to the ward swung open and a gasping mother stumbled out, her face contorted. Then raw emotion quickly took its place as she crumbled into a chair, crying.\nWhile Israel suffered little in the way of significant damage overnight, this one family was dealt a devastating blow. Amina al-Hasoni, 7, was clinging to life — the sole serious casualty of the Iranian barrage. And were it not for systemic inequities in Israel, her relatives said, maybe she too could have been spared.\nThere are roughly 300,000 Arab Bedouins in the Negev desert. About a quarter of them live in villages that are not recognized by Israeli officials. Without state recognition, those communities have long suffered from a lack of planning and basic services like running water, sewers and electricity. And few have access to bomb shelters, despite repeated requests to the state.\nThe Hasoni family lives in one such community, sharing a hilltop in the Negev village of al-Fur'ah with a plot of disconnected houses. When rocket warning sirens went off on Saturday night, Amina's uncle Ismail said he felt stuck — there was nowhere to go.\nBooms overhead signaled air defenses intercepting missiles before there was a big explosion. Then he heard a woman screaming — his sister — and 'I started running,' he said.\nIsmail, 38, found his sister outside her house holding Amina, who was bleeding from the head. Her family had decided to flee the rockets, running out the front door. But Amina, who slept in a back room with pink walls covered in painted butterflies, didn't make it.\nA missile fragment ripped through the home's thin metal roof, shearing a hole with sharp metallic edges. It made impact just in front of the door — which is where Amina was knocked unconscious.\n'I think it hit her while she was running away,' Ismail said.\nHe said he took the injured Amina from his sister and lifted the girl into his own arms. Ismail then tracked down a car that raced her toward the hospital, more than 40 minutes away on a rutted, winding road that fades out in some places, with camels crossing in others.\nOnly then, with Amina on her way, did he go inside the house, where he said he saw a large, black piece of shrapnel about the size of a pretzel jar. And 'there was blood,' he said, a puddle that had turned into a stream across the tile floor, to the front door.\nBy Sunday afternoon, the orange patterned tiles had been cleaned. None of the dozen or so relatives there could say who had done it, only that 'it was bad for the children to see' all the blood. But Ismail hasn't gone back inside.\n'It's difficult,' he said, his jeans and boots still spattered with blood. Not far from where he sat, a pink Minnie Mouse blanket and a small black-and-white girl's dress hung on a family clothesline.\n'We could have built shelters here,' Ismail added.\nHe dismissed any suggestions that what happened to Amina was bad luck.\n'It's part of a policy,' he said. 'We can't do anything.'\nThe missile fragment that tore into Amina's home was one of more than 150 collected in the area on Sunday by police bomb disposal teams, and the family said officers had taken away the piece that hit their home. The teams combed the desert for hours, searching for debris and carting away huge hunks of twisted metal — efforts repeated across Israel.\nThe Hasoni home is not far from a military base, Nevatim, that was reportedly a target of the Iranian assault and that Israeli officials said was lightly damaged.\nThat is little consolation to Amina's father, Muhammad, who spent the morning at the hospital taking turns at her bedside. He didn't say much to her, he said, and just repeated her name.\nAmina — the youngest of his 14 children — 'likes to laugh and have fun all the time,' said Muhammad, 49. She's a good student with a 'strong personality,' he added, who doesn't always listen to instructions. And she loves to draw.\nHe called Iran's actions 'inhumane.'\n'May God demolish them,' he said, without hesitation.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET Iran's ambassador to the U.N., Amir Saeid Iravani, addressed the Council after his Israeli counterpart and defended his country's actions as the 'inherent right to self-defense' in response to the attack on its diplomatic compound in Syria two weeks ago.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET Iravani said Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region' and has 'no intention' of engaging in conflict with the United States, but warned that it would respond proportionately if Israel or the U.S. military were to attack Iran or its interests.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:26 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:26 p.m. ET Israel's U.N. ambassador, Gilad Erdan, who had requested the emergency meeting of the Security Council, assailed Iran and its proxies, saying Iran had crossed every red line in its attack and that Israel reserved the right to retaliate.

In protests against the government over the past few years a recurring chant has been, 'No to Gaza, no to Lebanon, my life for Iran.'\nAli, a 53-year-old veteran of the Iran-Iraq war who lives in Kerman, said the existence of the Islamic Republic depends on 'crisis.'\n'Now they are exploiting the war and the crisis to survive,' he said.\nApril 14, 2024, 4:08 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 4:08 p.m. ET Gaya Gupta\nGaya Gupta Reporting from New York The United Nations Security Council has begun its emergency meeting to address Iran's attacks on Israel. 'The people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating, full-scale conflict,' the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, said in opening remarks. 'Now is the time to defuse and deescalate. Now is the time for maximum restraint.'\nApril 14, 2024, 4:36 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 4:36 p.m. ET For the Security Council to issue any statement condemning Iran's actions all of its 15 members would have to agree — a prospect that appears unlikely, given its recent lack of consensus over issuing condemnation statements on Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks and the attack on the Iranian Embassy compound in Syria, which prompted Iran's strikes.\nA woman carries a weapon in Tel Aviv on Sunday after Iran launched drones and missiles toward Israel. Credit... Hannah Mckay/Reuters After many Israelis spent a long night huddled in bomb shelters, life crept back toward calm on Sunday, even as the people of Israel waited tensely to see how their government would respond to the Iranian strikes that set off rarely heard sirens in Jerusalem.\nJerusalem is targeted much less frequently than border communities or the coastal metropolis of Tel Aviv, but during the assault loud booms resounded in the skies, where missiles and interceptors wove around one another like fireflies.\nIn areas of Jerusalem with a mostly Jewish population, many crowded into public bomb shelters, some wearing pajamas and lugging sleeping bags.\n'There were more people there than usual,' said Zev Palatnik, 33, who spent some of the night in his building's bomb shelter alongside his neighbors. 'There's a sense that the rockets from Iran are more sophisticated than the ones from Gaza,' he said, adding that there was a higher level of anxiety as a result.\nBut on Sunday, a relatively steady amount of foot traffic flowed in downtown Jerusalem as Israelis returned to work. Ron Cohen, a 37-year-old engineer, said he had hoped that the Israeli government would immediately strike back at Iran, but he did not expect a significant Israeli response.\n'Not much, maybe a few small things,' he said. 'Our government knows how to defend, but not how to attack.'\nFor the Israelis among the tens of thousands forced to flee communities along the borders with Gaza and Lebanon, the assault compounded six exhausting months of war. Many expressed uncertainty over the best way for the government to respond.\nGidi Lapid, who left his home in Metula, near the border with Lebanon, with his family at the beginning of the war, said Israel might be able to show strength through restrained action.\nBut at the same time, Iranians 'should be the ones in existential dread, in bomb shelters, stocking up on food and water,' Mr. Lapid said by phone from Eliav, a small town near Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem. 'Not our peace-seeking nation.'\nApril 14, 2024, 2:58 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 2:58 p.m. ET Euan Ward\nEuan Ward Reporting from Beirut, Lebanon Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group, congratulated Iran on Sunday for an 'unprecedented attack' on Israel, calling it a 'natural and legal right' in the wake of the deadly strike on the Iranian Embassy complex in Damascus. Although Hezbollah, Iran's most powerful regional proxy, launched rockets into the Golan Heights amid the overnight attack, it largely remained on the sidelines.\nApril 14, 2024, 2:48 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 2:48 p.m. ET Adam Sella\nAdam Sella Reporting from Tel Aviv With much attention shifted to Iran, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an Israeli grass-roots citizens' group, reiterated its call for a deal to release the approximately 100 hostages held in Gaza. The group said in a statement that the fear and uncertainty felt by Israelis during Iran's overnight strike 'pale in comparison to the terror, dread, despair, loneliness, cold, physical and mental torment' experienced by the hostages.\nApril 14, 2024, 2:32 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 2:32 p.m. ET Eric Schmitt\nEric Schmitt Reporting from Washington American officials said U.S. fighter jets shot down more than 70 exploding drones in the attack Saturday, while two Navy warships in the eastern Mediterranean destroyed between four and six ballistic missiles and an Army Patriot battery in Iraq knocked down at least one missile that passed overhead. The more than 300 drones and missiles Iran launched was on the high end of what U.S. analysts had expected, one official said.\nApril 14, 2024, 1:52 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 1:52 p.m. ET After a virtual meeting today, leaders of the Group of 7 nations reaffirmed their 'full solidarity and support to Israel' in a statement condemning Iran's attack. The leaders said Iran risked 'provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation' that must be avoided. 'We will continue to work to stabilize the situation and avoid further escalation,' they said. 'In this spirit, we demand that Iran and its proxies cease their attacks.'\nApril 14, 2024, 1:48 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 1:48 p.m. ET Aaron Boxerman\nAaron Boxerman Reporting from Jerusalem Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, told reporters that Iran and its proxies had fired about 350 exploding drones, cruise missiles, ballistic missiles and rockets at Israel overnight. That amounted to a total of about '60 tons of warheads and explosive materials,' he said in an evening briefing.\n'We're going to try again this week,' Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday about voting on a bill to aid Israel. Credit... Kenny Holston/The New York Times Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday after Iran's overnight attack on Israel that the House would vote in the coming days on aid for Israel, and he suggested that aid for Ukraine could be included in the legislation.\n'House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel,' Mr. Johnson said on Fox News, noting that he had previously advanced two aid bills to help the U.S. ally. 'We're going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together. Right now, we're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.'\nU.S. funding for both Israel and Ukraine has languished in Congress; Mr. Johnson initially refused to take up a $95 billion aid package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan passed by the Senate, and the Senate refused to take up a House Republican proposal that conditioned aid to Israel on domestic spending cuts.\nIn recent weeks, Mr. Johnson has repeatedly vowed to ensure that the House moves to assist Ukraine. He has been searching for a way to structure a foreign aid package that could secure a critical mass of support amid stiff Republican resistance to sending aid to Kyiv and mounting opposition among Democrats to unfettered military aid for Israel.\nBut the attacks from Iran have ratcheted up the pressure on Mr. Johnson to bring some kind of package to the floor this week, potentially forcing him to make a decision he has been agonizing over for weeks.\nHe left it unclear on Sunday whether the legislation he said the House would advance this week would also include aid for Ukraine.\nMr. Johnson said he believed that some proposals around Ukraine aid enjoyed broad support among House Republicans. He noted that he met with former President Donald J. Trump on Friday at his estate in Florida and that Mr. Trump had been supportive of conditioning the aid as a loan.\n'I think these are ideas that I think can get consensus, and that's what we've been working through,' Mr. Johnson said. 'We'll send our package. We'll put something together and send it to the Senate and get these obligations completed.'\nBefore the attacks in Israel over the weekend, Mr. Johnson had privately floated bringing up the $95 billion spending package for Ukraine and Israel passed by the Senate in February — and moving it through the House in tandem with a second bill containing policies endorsed by the conservative wing of his party. That plan envisioned two consecutive votes — one on the Senate-passed bill and another on a package of sweeteners geared toward appeasing Republicans who otherwise would be infuriated by Mr. Johnson's decision to push through a bipartisan aid package for Ukraine.\nRepresentative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Sunday that the two conflicts were tied together, and that he hoped they would be addressed together. 'What happened in Israel last night happens in Ukraine every night,' he said on CBS's 'Face The Nation.'\nMr. McCaul said that he had previously secured a 'commitment' from Mr. Johnson that a broad national security bill would be brought to the House floor for a vote, but that the timing was unclear.\n'My preference,' he said, 'is this week.'\nMinho Kim contributed reporting.\nApril 14, 2024, 1:02 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 1:02 p.m. ET Adam Sella\nAdam Sella Reporting from Tel Aviv The Israeli military said in a statement that it is calling up 'approximately two reserve brigades for operational activities on the Gaza front.' Reservist soldiers played a key role in the military's operations in Gaza earlier in the war, when more than 300,000 citizen soldiers were called up. Since late February, many reservists have been released back to their normal lives while professional soldiers took on the brunt of the fighting.\nApril 14, 2024, 12:56 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 12:56 p.m. ET Leaders of the Group of 7 nations convened on Sunday and condemned Iran's attack on Israel, according to the White House and the president of the European Council, Charles Michel.

Credit... Jim Hollander/EPA, via Shutterstock In a deeply divided Israel, even the dramatic scene above the country's skies on Sunday is open to political interpretation.\nFor supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's display of defensive technology against an Iranian salvo that included hundreds of drones and missiles proves Mr. Netanyahu has long been right to warn about the threat posed by Iran.\nHis opponents are loath to give him any credit, reserving their praise for the air force.\n'Like everything in Israel in recent years, the story is split into two narratives,' said Mazal Mualem, an Israeli political commentator for Al-Monitor, a Middle East news site, and the author of a recent biography of the Israeli leader.\n'The division and polarization in Israeli society prevents people from seeing the full picture,' Ms. Mualem added.\nIran's barrage on Sunday, launched in response to an Israeli attack on an Iranian Embassy building this month in Damascus that killed several high-ranking commanders in Iran's armed forces, came at a perilous time for Mr. Netanyahu.\nAt home, he is an unpopular leader whom many hold responsible for his government's policy and intelligence failures that led to the deadly Hamas-led attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, which prompted Israel to go to war in Gaza. Abroad, he is the focus of international censure over Israel's prosecution of that war, which has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Gazans.\nHow he ultimately emerges from this episode may depend on what happens next.\nMr. Netanyahu now must make a choice. Will he respond to Iran with a forceful counterattack and potentially entangle Israel and other countries in a broader war? Or will he absorb the attack, which gravely injured one 7-year-old girl but otherwise did limited damage, and defer to the coalition that helped defend Israel in the interests of regional stability?\nIsrael's allies have been urging restraint.\n'The question is whether Israel is going to retaliate immediately, or surprise the Iranians in one way or another,' said Efraim Halevy, who served as director of Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, during the latter part of Mr. Netanyahu's first term in the 1990s.\nNo Israeli leader has warned about Iran so consistently as Mr. Netanyahu or, for that matter, has spent so long in office. Israel's longest serving prime minister, he has been in power for about 17 years overall.\nSince his first year in office in 1996, Mr. Netanyahu warned that a nuclear Iran would be catastrophic and that time was running out. For the nearly three decades since, he has been sounding the same alarm.\nIran maintains a network of proxy militias across the region, including in Gaza, which the government funds and supplies with weapons. Some of those militias in Yemen, Syria and Lebanon have battled with Israel, creating distractions for the Israeli government and military amid the war with Hamas.\nBut perhaps more troubling, experts say, is that Iran is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon. Mr. Netanyahu's backers still credit him with having put Iran's nuclear program on the world agenda then, and they praise him now for investing in the mighty, multilayered air defense system that allowed Israel and its allies, including the United States, to intercept the vast majority of Iranian drones and missiles this weekend before they reached Israel.\nSometimes resorting to gimmicks and antics to draw attention to Iran's nuclear progress, Mr. Netanyahu has in the past made opposing Iran a key part of his global diplomacy. Once, at the United Nations General Assembly he held up a cartoonish drawing of a bomb marked with red lines depicting enrichment levels. Another time, at the Munich Security Conference, he waved around a piece of wreckage from what he said was an Iranian drone sent from Syria and shot down by Israel.\n'Everywhere he went he was talking about it,' recalled Jeremy Issacharoff, a former Israeli ambassador to Germany and for years the Ministry of Foreign Affairs point man coordinating diplomatic efforts on regional security and the Iranian threat.\nAt times, Mr. Netanyahu's campaign against Iran has severely strained Israel's relations with American presidents, though bipartisan U.S. support for Israel has long been considered a strategic asset.\nAround 2012, Mr. Netanyahu infuriated the Obama administration by pushing hard for President Barack Obama to set clear 'red lines' on Iran's nuclear progress that would prompt the United States to undertake a military strike. Before that, the Israeli prime minister was making plans for a unilateral Israeli strike in the face of tough opposition from Washington and public criticism from a string of former Israeli security chiefs. It was never clear if Mr. Netanyahu was bluffing, and the prospect of an imminent strike receded.\nHe further challenged Mr. Obama in 2015 with an impassioned speech to a joint meeting of Congress denouncing what he called a 'bad deal' being negotiated by the United States and other world powers with Iran to curb its nuclear program.\nWhen President Donald J. Trump came to power, Mr. Netanyahu encouraged him to withdraw from the agreement — a move that many Israeli experts have called a dire mistake and a failure of Mr. Netanyahu's Iran policy.\n'Since then, there have been no constraints on the program,' Mr. Issacharoff said, adding, 'It has never been more advanced.'\nBut it was also under Mr. Netanyahu's watch that Israel forged diplomatic relations with more Arab states that are considered part of the moderate, anti-Iranian axis, including the United Arab Emirates.\nRegardless of what comes next, Ms. Mualem, the Netanyahu biographer, said, 'Bibi is still in the game,' referring to him by his nickname. 'He's a central player, and it isn't over, diplomatically or politically. And he plays a long game.'\nMourners on Sunday with the bodies of Palestinians in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip. Credit... Ramadan Abed/Reuters As the world's attention shifted to Iran's attack on Israel, Palestinians in Gaza experienced a relatively calm night for the first time in more than six months but were quickly jolted back to reality when airstrikes there continued on Sunday morning.\nWhile Iranian drones and aircraft were making their way to Israeli territory on Saturday night, the incessant noise of Israeli drones and warplanes disappeared from Gaza's skies, residents said.\n'Finally some calmness after six months of buzzing and noises!' Yousef Mema, a Gazan activist with a significant social media following, wrote on Instagram.\nAnother influencer, Mahmoud Shurrab, recorded himself walking in the middle of the street, the skies overhead quiet. 'I can't believe it, silence,' he said in a video posted on Instagram.\nThe calm did not last. The Israeli military said on Sunday that its forces were pressing on with a raid in the central Gaza Strip for the fourth day, where they 'eliminated dozens of terrorists in face-to-face battles and with air support.' And Wafa, the Palestinian Authority news agency, reported that several Palestinians had been killed in a strike on a home in Nuseirat in central Gaza, and that at least eight others were wounded in a strike on three homes in Beit Hanoun, a city in the northeast of the strip.\nSome Palestinians worried that an escalation between Israel and Iran would distract from the dire situation in the Gaza Strip, potentially diverting international attention from the Israeli bombardment and looming famine there.\n'I think it is not at all in the Palestinians' side or favor to have a new front open with Israel,' said Amer Nasser, 64. 'This will distract the people around the world from seeing what is happening in Gaza,' he added.\nFor many, the Iranian attack was unexpected.\nFayez al-Samman, a 76-year-old car trader from Gaza City who is sheltering in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza, said he spent the night listening to the news on the radio. 'It was a surprise for me when I heard the missiles were targeting Israeli sites,' he said.\nOsama al-Hato, 53, another man from Gaza City staying in Deir al-Balah, said he was happy that Iran had targeted Israel. 'However, I did not follow the news nor expect the Iranian reaction to this extent,' he added.\nAymen Zidan, 57, a wholesale vegetable supplier from Deir al-Balah, said he had had little expectation that Iran would target Israel, although he believed Iran's attack was for its own interests, not for the sake of Palestinians in Gaza like him.\nEven so, he said, he felt 'relieved that there is a country that said no to Israel.'\nRaja Abdulrahim contributed reporting from New York.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT © 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences",

Trump engaged in a conspiracy to cover up a sex scandal in order to get elected president in 2016. The first witness called was the tabloid publisher David Pecker, whom prosecutors described as one member of a three-man plot to conceal damaging stories — including a porn star's account of a sexual tryst — as Mr. Trump mounted his bid for the presidency. Mr. Pecker was on the stand for only a few minutes in the afternoon before court adjourned for the day. He described how his publication, The National Enquirer, paid for stories, a practice he called 'checkbook journalism.' He is expected to return to the stand on Tuesday. Matthew Colangelo, one of the prosecutors for the Manhattan district attorney's office, told the jury in his opening statement that the case was about 'a criminal conspiracy and a coverup,' describing how Mr. Trump, his longtime counsel Michael D. Cohen, and Mr. Pecker engaged in a strategy to 'catch and kill' negative stories. The lead lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, insisted in his opening statement that the former president had done nothing wrong. 'President Trump is innocent,' he told the jury. 'President Trump did not commit any crimes.' The case centers on a $130,000 hush-money payment that Mr. Cohen made to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, to buy her silence as the 2016 campaign was winding down. Prosecutors say he was reimbursed by Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump falsified business records to conceal his conduct. Mr. Colangelo said the payment to Ms. Daniels came on the heels of another scandal — the 'Access Hollywood' tape, on which Mr. Trump bragged about groping women. Ms. Daniels's account, he said, 'could have been devastating to his campaign.' He added, 'With pressure mounting and Election Day fast approaching, Donald Trump agreed to the payoff and directed Cohen to proceed.' Mr. Cohen, who was an executive vice president at the Trump Organization and counsel to Mr. Trump, and Mr. Pecker are expected to be central witnesses. Mr. Blanche attacked Mr. Cohen's credibility, saying that his livelihood hinges on attacking the former president, and insisted that prosecutors were attempting to present perfectly legal activities, such as entering into nondisclosure agreements, in a negative light. 'I have a spoiler alert: There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,' Mr. Blanche said. 'It's called democracy.' He continued: 'They put something sinister on this idea as if it were a crime. You'll learn it's not.' Here's what else to know about the trial: The Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump was unveiled a year ago by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and if convicted could face up to four years in prison. Those are felonies because prosecutors say Mr. Trump sought to conceal another crime. On Monday, they strongly emphasized a violation of state election law — conspiracy to promote election — that is not one of the actual charges, but they say is baked into the overall crime.\nThe case is the former president's first criminal trial, although he has been indicted three other times in three other cities. With those other cases tied up in appeals and other delays, the Manhattan case may be the only one he faces before the 2024 presidential election. The trial is expected to last six weeks.\nBefore opening statements, the judge overseeing the case delivered a crucial ruling that determined what prosecutors can question Mr. Trump about should he decide to take the stand in his own defense. The ruling, a significant victory for prosecutors that might prompt Mr. Trump to decide not to testify, allows them to question him about several recent losses he suffered in unrelated civil trials, including a fraud case this year in which the former president was found liable for conspiring to manipulate his net worth and was penalized $454 million.\nThe jury was drawn from a pool of residents of Manhattan, where Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular; during jury selection, dozens of prospective jurors were excused because they said they could not be impartial. But the jurors who were selected each pledged to decide the case based only on the facts. Read more about them.\nThe case will receive vast media attention, but the proceedings won't be shown on television. Matthew Colangelo, a prosecutor, said there would be 'only one conclusion: Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.' Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times The Manhattan district attorney's office and lawyers for Donald J. Trump presented opening statements to jurors on Monday, with prosecutors accusing the former president of entering a criminal conspiracy while the defense sought to discredit two key witnesses. A prosecutor, Matthew Colangelo, began by telling jurors that Mr. Trump had conspired with his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, and the publisher of The National Enquirer, David Pecker, to conceal damaging stories during his 2016 campaign. 'This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover-up,' Mr. Colangelo said, telling a story about a hush-money payment to a porn star and insisting that the former president was ultimately responsible. In the end, Mr. Colangelo said, there would be 'only one conclusion: Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.' Immediately after Mr. Colangelo's presentation, Mr. Trump's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, directly disagreed, insisting that the jury acquit the former president. Mr. Trump, he said, had engaged in actions that were legal and normal. 'President Trump did not commit any crimes,' Mr. Blanche told the jury, using the former president's preferred form of address. The lawyer told jurors that Mr. Trump had earned the right to be referred to as 'president' and reminded them that he was the presumptive Republican nominee. Mr. Blanche argued that there was nothing illegal about nondisclosure agreements, which he said companies, the wealthy and the famous all use frequently. And, he said, prosecutors were wrong to suggest something criminal about Mr. Trump's efforts to win the White House. 'I have a spoiler alert: There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,' Mr. Blanche said. 'It's called democracy.' Mr. Blanche asserted that Mr. Cohen, a key prosecution witness, was paid for legal services, and he attempted to undermine Mr. Cohen's credibility. Mr. Blanche called Mr. Cohen a 'criminal' who 'can't be trusted' and suggested that he was testifying only because he didn't get a job in the Trump administration. He also took aim at Stormy Daniels, the former porn star who claimed she had sex with Mr. Trump, characterizing her as an opportunist who had used a brief encounter with Mr. Trump related to his reality show, 'The Apprentice,' to make huge sums of money. He added that Ms. Daniels was 'biased' against the former president and made a living off her story about the sexual encounter. Mr. Blanche also sought to minimize the charges, saying the records at the heart of the case were just '34 pieces of paper' that the former president had nothing to do with. Mr. Trump is accused of falsifying business records — which is a felony if prosecutors can show the records were altered with an intent to commit or conceal a second crime. A year ago, when the former president was formally charged with 34 felonies, the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, told reporters that he did not have to specify what the second crime was, and listed three options. During opening statements, Mr. Colangelo made it clear he believed that the strongest case relied on one of those options: convincing jurors that Mr. Trump concealed the violation of a state law that forbids 'conspiracy to promote or prevent an election.'

The New York state court system has just agreed to publish a transcript of each day's proceeding by the end of the following day on its website. You can find the daily transcripts here. April 22, 2024, 1:07 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:07 p.m. ET Trump's motorcade left the courthouse just after 1:05 p.m., wrapping up the trial's first day of testimony. The view was blocked by an N.Y.P.D. dump truck, to many reporters' great frustration. Inside Collect Pond Park, across from the courthouse, a lone pro-Trump protester's 'Trump for President '24' banner flaps meekly in the light breeze. April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse The charges against Trump, which accuse him of falsifying records, are felonies because prosecutors say he sought to conceal another crime. Prosecutors had said before the trial that they had a menu of three crimes to choose from. The one they emphasized most strongly today is a violation of state election law: 'conspiracy to promote election.' It's not one of the actual charges, but they say it was baked into the overall crime. April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse And its worth emphasizing that when the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, was first asked about this, at a news conference directly after Trump was formally charged, he said that prosecutors did not have to specify which crime they were alleging Trump concealed. But today, Colangelo took the opposite tack: hitting the word 'conspiracy' again and again. April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:05 p.m. ET With the trial now underway, here's the People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump by the numbers: The case was born as 'Investigation No. 2018-00403803 – Investigation Into the Business Affairs of John Doe.' That's how the Manhattan district attorney's office identified the six-year inquiry that led to today's proceedings, with the number and name appearing on subpoenas and the correspondence case. Arrest No. M23613757 was given to Mr. Trump when he surrendered last year on April 4. And when the former president was arraigned later that day, his indictment was given a Docket Number, IND-71543-23, which the court system uses to track the case.  Collect Pond Park across from the courthouse has attracted onlookers and interested parties since Donald J. Trump's trial began last week. Credit... Nate Schweber for The New York Times Andrew Giuliani, the son of Donald J. Trump's former lawyer and a regular strutting presence on the periphery of the courthouse where the former president is on trial, posed for photos inside Collect Pond Park. Grinning and wearing a campaign jacket, Mr. Giuliani, who has made a career as a right-wing media figure, hugged supporters of Mr. Trump on Monday. From one, he borrowed a flag with Mr. Trump's face that promotes him for president in 2024. 'Two-thousand twenty-four years in prison!' taunted Ricky Caballero, 56, from Brooklyn. 'He owes your dad money. Why you out here supporting him?' Mr. Caballero wore a tank top with a Puerto Rican flag. He said that was his heritage, and that he remembers watching Mr. Trump lob paper towels at survivors of Hurricane Maria in 2017. Mr. Caballero said he was still furious. Mr. Giuliani circulated like a celebrity among Mr. Trump's supporters and ignored Mr. Caballero. It was one of a number of loud exchanges between supporters and detractors of Mr. Trump that were noticeably monitored by the police. There were no police in the park on Friday, when a man amid a mental health crisis burned himself to death in an anti-government protest.

At one point, the sound of the national anthem wafted through the park, courtesy of the flute-playing activist Marc Crawford Leavitt.

April 22, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:14 p.m. ET Jesse McKinley Reporting from the courthouse Pecker says in his experience, the only thing that's important 'is the cover' of a magazine. David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, was described as a master of the 'catch-and-kill' technique by people who have worked for him. Credit... Mary Altaffer/Associated Press 'Catch-and-kill' is a term coined by old-time tabloid editors for buying the exclusive rights to stories, or 'catching' them, for the specific purpose of ensuring the information never becomes public. That's the 'killing' part. Why would anyone want to spend money on a story that it never intends to publish? In the world of tabloid journalism, where ethical lines are blurry, deciding what to publish and why is often a calculus that covers favors doled out and chits called in. David Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, who also oversaw other tabloids such as Star and lifestyle publications such as Men's Fitness, was a master of the technique, according to people who have worked for him. In 2003, Mr. Pecker's company, American Media Inc., bought several muscle magazines founded by a mentor of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilding legend and movie star. When Mr. Schwarzenegger, who was often featured in those magazines, jumped into the recall election to replace California's governor, Mr. Pecker ordered his staff to buy up negative stories about him in order to protect his investment, former employees said. Staff members called it 'the David Pecker Project.' American Media paid $20,000 to a former mistress of Mr. Schwarzenegger so that she would not speak about their affair — though news of it had previously been published. The company paid another $1,000 to her friend and $2,000 to a man who had a video of Mr. Schwarzenegger dancing lewdly in Rio de Janeiro 20 years earlier. Mr. Schwarzenegger was elected governor. Mr. Pecker's publications made deals with other celebrities as well, though not always for money. He traded away dirt about the golfer Tiger Woods in exchange for an exclusive interview in Men's Fitness in 2007, according to people with knowledge of that episode. And, according to the prosecutors in the Manhattan trial of Donald J. Trump, Mr. Pecker employed 'catch-and-kill' tactics in the 2016 presidential election, paying a doorman and a Playboy model to suppress negative stories about Mr. Trump and boost the candidacy of his longtime associate.  April 22, 2024, 12:11 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:11 p.m. ET Kate Christobek Reporting from the courthouse Justice Merchan has shown so far that he is eager to keep this trial on schedule. Court will be adjourned for the day in less than a half an hour, but yet the judge has chosen to start the first witness. He seems serious about keeping his word to the jurors that the trial will last six weeks. April 22, 2024, 12:08 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:08 p.m. ET Alan Feuer Providing analysis of Trump cases What will be interesting about Pecker's testimony, if it goes as opening statements suggested it would, is that he won't really be describing Trump's involvement in any actual criminal activity. Rather, he will serve as a tour guide to the seamy way in which Trump used The National Enquirer to his political advantage — a storytelling point on the way to alleged criminal activity. April 22, 2024, 12:10 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:10 p.m. ET Jonah Bromwich Reporting from the courthouse And yet, prosecutors have framed Pecker's involvement here as part of a 'conspiracy.' This could be a risk for them — conspiracy is not one of the charged crimes. And this jury has at least two lawyers. David Pecker's publication, The National Enquirer, was a repository for as many secrets as it published. Credit... Marion Curtis/Associated Press The first witness in Donald J. Trump's criminal is David Pecker, who was the publisher of The National Enquirer, and had traded favors with Mr. Trump since the 1990s. Mr. Pecker, who was sometimes referred to as the 'tabloid king,' had long used his publications to curry favor with Mr. Trump and other celebrities, in exchange for tips or for business reasons. Staff members called Mr. Trump, like other favored stars who were off limits, an 'F.O.P.' — 'Friend of Pecker.' Mr. Trump and Mr. Pecker, along with Mr. Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen, hatched a plan in August 2015 to boost his upstart presidential campaign, prosecutors say. The former Trump allies are each expected to take a turn on the witness stand, giving testimony that could help make him the first president convicted of a felony. Prosecutors for Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, will try to show that the hush money payment to a porn star at the center of the trial was part of a larger effort to suppress negative news about Mr. Trump to sway the election. That scheme, they will contend, includes two other deals, both involving Mr. Pecker. Mr. Trump had announced his presidential campaign in June 2015. The plan the men laid out two months later was simple, according to court documents, interviews with people involved in the events or familiar with them, private communications and other records. Mr. Pecker would use The Enquirer to publish positive stories about Mr. Trump's campaign and negative stories about his rivals. He would alert Mr. Trump, through Mr. Cohen, when The Enquirer learned of stories that might threaten Mr. Trump. The Enquirer could buy the rights to those stories in order to suppress them, a practice known in the tabloid world as 'catch and kill.' In late 2015, Mr. Pecker's company paid $30,000 to suppress a claim by a former doorman at a Trump building who said he had heard Mr. Trump fathered a child out of wedlock — a rumor that was apparently untrue. Then in August 2016, The Enquirer's parent company paid $150,000 to a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, to keep her account of an affair with Mr. Trump quiet. Two months later, Mr. Pecker and The Enquirer's editor helped Mr. Cohen negotiate a $130,000 hush-money payment with Stormy Daniels, the former porn star who also said she had sex with Mr. Trump. He has denied both women's claims. Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance crimes in 2018. The Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., made a deal that year to avoid federal prosecution, acknowledging that it had illegally tried to influence the election.

The National Enquirer's master of 'Catch and Kill,' he was part of the conspiracy that Colangelo described in his opening statement, working with Trump and Cohen to bury negative stories about Trump and publish negative ones about his rivals. He's expected to tell the jury about his conversations with Trump and Cohen about killing the bad stories, including the one about Stormy Daniels.

Trump has assembled a team of defense lawyers with extensive experience representing people charged with white-collar crimes to defend him against the charges filed by the Manhattan district attorney's office. Some have worked for Mr. Trump for years. Others are more recent additions, but are involved in the former president's broader legal defense, also representing him in other criminal cases. Here's a look at Mr. Trump's defense team: Mr. Blanche started representing Mr. Trump last year, leaving a prestigious position as a partner at Wall Street's oldest law firm to take him on as a client. He is also representing Mr. Trump in his federal classified documents case in Florida and his federal election interference case in Washington. Mr. Blanche has also represented Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, as well as Boris Epshteyn, an adviser to Mr. Trump. Before turning to private practice, Mr. Blanche was a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where he supervised violent-crime cases. Ms. Necheles has been a lawyer for Mr. Trump since 2021 and represented the Trump Organization during its criminal tax fraud trial in Manhattan. The business was convicted of 17 felonies and ordered by Justice Juan M. Merchan to pay the maximum penalty of $1.6 million. Ms. Necheles previously represented defendants in major organized-crime and public-corruption cases, including Venero Mangano, the Genovese crime family underboss who was known as Benny Eggs. Mr. Bove, the newest addition to Mr. Trump's legal team, is a legal partner to Mr. Blanche. He is a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York who turned to private practice and now represents defendants charged with white-collar crimes. Mr. Stern is a law partner to Ms. Necheles and also defended the Trump Organization in its criminal tax-fraud trial. He has previous experience representing clients charged with bribery, fraud and conspiracy.  Justice Juan M. Merchan handed prosecutors a legal cudgel that could dissuade Donald J. Trump from testifying. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times The judge in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial ruled on Monday morning that prosecutors could ask the former president about a range of previous cases that he has lost, as well as past violations of gag orders, in the event that he decides to testify in his defense. Among other cases, the ruling by the judge, Juan M. Merchan, would allow prosecutors to question Mr. Trump about the civil fraud case brought by the New York attorney general, Letitia James, in which the former president was found to have inflated his net worth to obtain favorable loans. That case resulted in a $454 million judgment against Mr. Trump. Justice Merchan will also allow the Manhattan district attorney's office — which brought the case against Mr. Trump — to question him about civil cases brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. Those cases found that Mr. Trump was liable for sexually abusing and defaming Ms. Carroll in the first instance and for defamation in the second. (Justice Merchan did not mention the sexual abuse finding, only the defamation, in his ruling regarding the Carroll cases on Monday.) Justice Merchan will also let prosecutors ask about Mr. Trump's attack on a law clerk in a civil fraud case, in violation of a gag order, as well as a 2018 decision that led to the dissolution of the Donald J. Trump Foundation to resolve a case brought by the New York attorney general at the time, Barbara Underwood, over financial irregularities. The former president suggested in early April that he would testify in the criminal trial, saying that prosecutors 'have no case.' That said, Mr. Trump has promised to testify in previous cases only to back out, and Justice Merchan's decision could change his thinking on such a maneuver. Justice Merchan said that, in the event that Mr. Trump did testify, he would give jurors 'careful and specific' instructions about the scope of prosecutors' queries, adding that he had 'greatly curtailed' what specifics could be the target of questions. However, Justice Merchan warned Mr. Trump that his ruling was 'a shield and not a sword' and that the former president's testimony could open 'the door to questioning that has otherwise been excluded.' Mr. Trump is being tried on charges that he falsified business records to cover up a hush-money payment to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. He has denied the charges. Susan Hoffinger and Joshua Steinglass are among the experienced team that the Manhattan district attorney has put together to prosecute Donald J. Trump. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has assembled an accomplished team to take on perhaps the most high-profile case in his office's history: the first criminal trial against former President Donald J. Trump. The group includes veteran prosecutors and former white-collar criminal defense lawyers who have extensive experience going up against Mr. Trump. Here's a look at the prosecution team: Mr. Steinglass, who has served as an assistant district attorney since 1998, is a recent addition to this case; in 2022 he helped lead the team that secured a conviction against the Trump Organization for conspiracy, criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records. He typically prosecutes significant violent crimes, such as a violent brawl on the Upper East Side that led to the conviction of two Proud Boy extremists in 2019. After starting her career at the Manhattan district attorney's office, Ms. Hoffinger founded her own firm and spent 20 years as a defense lawyer focusing on white-collar criminal defense. She rejoined the district attorney's office in 2022 and worked with Mr. Steinglass to obtain the conviction of the Trump Organization in its criminal tax fraud trial. A prosecutor for 28 years, Mr. Conroy previously led the Manhattan district attorney's office's major economic crimes unit, where he was involved in the prosecution of the bankrupt law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf and supervised investigations into multinational financial institutions for falsification of business records. Mr. Conroy is the longest serving member of this trial team. Mr. Colangelo joined the district attorney's office in 2022 after serving for two years as a senior official at the U.S. Department of Justice. He previously worked for the New York attorney general's office, where he oversaw the investigation into the Trump Foundation, which led to its dissolution. He was also, for a time, one of the lead lawyers on the civil fraud inquiry into Mr. Trump. Before joining Mr. Bragg's major economic crimes unit in 2022, Ms. Mangold clerked for a U.S. District Court judge in New Jersey and worked in private practice for over 10 years. As a partner at the law firm Kobre & Kim, Ms. Mangold focused on criminal and regulatory investigations related to financial misconduct. Ms. Ellis joined the Manhattan district attorney's office in 2018 after working as an associate at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. Before becoming a lawyer, Ms. Ellis worked as a legal analyst at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank.  Broadcast feeds from the trial are limited to those from outside the courtroom. Credit... Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times The Manhattan criminal trial of Donald J. Trump will be closely followed around the world. But you will not be able to watch the proceedings on TV. There will be no video feed aired live from the courtroom. Nor will there be an audio feed, as some federal courts allow. New York courts generally do not permit video to be broadcast from courtrooms, although a feed is being transmitted into an overflow room for the reporters covering the trial. And cameras will be stationed in the hallway outside the courtroom to capture Mr. Trump's remarks as he enters and leaves. Shortly after court adjourned on Monday, the state's chief administrative judge, Joseph A. Zayas, issued a statement saying that transcripts of each day of the trial would be published online by the end of the following day on the court system's website. Judge Zayas was responding to a request for public transcripts filed last week by a New York lawyer, Jim Walden, on behalf of a civic group and a news website. 'With current law restricting the broadcasting of trial proceedings and courtroom space for public spectators very limited, the release of the daily transcripts on the court system's website is the best way to provide the public a direct view of the proceedings in this historic trial,' Judge Zayas wrote in his statement. Court will be in session, for the most part, every weekday except Wednesdays, from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., until the trial ends. The weeklong jury selection process was a pressure cooker for many of the nearly 300 Manhattan residents who were summoned to be interviewed. Credit... Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times Follow our live coverage of Trump's hush money trial in Manhattan. The two Manhattan residents were led into the courtroom to fulfill a foundational civic duty: to be interviewed as prospective jurors. But in the room when they arrived was a defendant, Donald J. Trump, unlike any in American history. Both would-be jurors, a man and a woman, were eventually excused. But the experience thrust them into the spotlight in a way they never had imagined. One was challenged by Mr. Trump's lawyers over his past social media posts relating to the former president. The other has a medical practice that she could not shut for six weeks while serving on the jury. While they were not chosen as jurors, their experiences illustrate the intensity of the attention focused on Mr. Trump's trial — and on the first jury to ever weigh the fate of a former United States president in a criminal proceeding. Both contacted The New York Times only after they were excused from serving. Though the court's rules protecting prospective jurors' identities end when they are dismissed from serving, The Times is withholding their names and most identifying characteristics about them. Like the other prospective jurors who were considered, both included detailed personal information on the juror questionnaires they filled out, including where they work. They were made to answer those questions by speaking into a microphone in open court; soon, both were blindsided as details of their lives ricocheted around the internet. They said they were frustrated that so much attention was devoted to prospective jurors and ascertaining information about them. While they later learned that the judge in the case, Justice Juan M. Merchan, had ordered the redaction of some of the information jurors were ordered to reveal publicly, they felt that he had acted too late. As with many things connected to the trial, the rhythms and even some of the parameters are being written in real time. Their experiences mirrored some that other prospective jurors who were dismissed have described. One, a man who gave his name as Mark to NBC News, said he had 'satirized Mr. Trump often in my artwork,' and because of that, he had expected not to be chosen. A woman who gave her name as Kara, who said the nature of her job made serving extremely difficult, told NBC News that she realized the gravity of serving on any criminal jury, but particularly this one. Seeing Mr. Trump in person, she said, was 'very jarring.' He was, she realized, just 'another guy.' One of the prospective jurors who spoke with The Times, the man, did not immediately realize what case he was involved in when he was led into the courtroom on the 15th floor of the Manhattan criminal courthouse. The woman had a sense a week earlier, having read a news story about the trial beginning the week she was supposed to respond to a juror summons. The man, sitting a few rows behind the prosecutors' table when the two were part of the first panel of 96 prospective jurors brought into the courtroom Monday afternoon, felt a sense of calm about five minutes into being there. Trump was simply a defendant, he thought. It was a business-records trial. Prosecutors were on one side, the defense lawyers on the other. The woman was struck by the fact that Mr. Trump stood and waved to prospective jurors, she said, as he and his lawyers were introduced to the group. It felt more to her like the behavior of a campaigning candidate than of a criminal defendant. (Mr. Trump, of course, is both.) Both were put off by efforts by Mr. Trump's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, to assess prospective jurors' views of Mr. Trump. The man said Mr. Blanche seemed 'folksy' in a way he found disingenuous, while the woman was sharper, describing a 'witch hunt' to root out people sympathetic to Democrats on the panel — a phrase Mr. Trump uses often to criticize the various prosecutors investigating his conduct. The man in particular was frustrated that he was asked about past social media posts in which he had been critical of Mr. Trump, which Mr. Blanche's team raised and which Justice Merchan ultimately agreed meant the man should be excused. The man believed he could have been fair and resented the implication that he could not have been. Both he and the woman, who said they believed in the system of jury service, noted that they had begun the day taking sworn oaths vowing to render a fair and impartial judgment on the evidence. The man believed his own views — especially views from years ago — had no bearing on his ability to judge the evidence. If anything, he said, he would have been hyper-conscious in doing so. Both had realized the magnitude of what serving on that jury would mean. But they were also conscious of the threats and blowback that could come with weighing evidence against Mr. Trump — particularly with their personal details traceable in public. And both had concerns about being chosen because of that; the man in particular said his spouse had been worried. Both would have valued being part of the historic trial. But both also had a sense of relief that they were not picked.  Former President Donald J. Trump is accused of 34 felonies, but a conviction is no sure thing. Credit... Pool photo by Curtis Means In the official record, the case is known as the People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump, and, for now, the people have the stronger hand: They have insider witnesses, a favorable jury pool and a lurid set of facts about a presidential candidate, a payoff and a porn star. On Monday, the prosecutors will formally introduce the case to 12 all-important jurors, embarking on the first prosecution of an American president. The trial, which could brand Mr. Trump a felon as he mounts another White House run, will reverberate throughout the nation and test the durability of the justice system that Mr. Trump is attacking in a way that no other defendant would be allowed to do. Though the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has assembled a mountain of evidence, a conviction is hardly assured. Over the next six weeks, Mr. Trump's lawyers will seize on three apparent weak points: a key witness's credibility, a president's culpability and the case's legal complexity. Prosecutors will seek to maneuver around those vulnerabilities, dazzling the jury with a tale that mixes politics and sex, as they confront a shrewd defendant with a decades-long track record of skirting legal consequences. They will also seek to bolster the credibility of that key witness, Michael D. Cohen, a former fixer to Mr. Trump who previously pleaded guilty to federal crimes for paying the porn star, Stormy Daniels. Daniel J. Horwitz, a veteran defense lawyer who previously worked in the Manhattan district attorney's office prosecuting white-collar cases, said prosecutors can be expected to corroborate Mr. Cohen's story wherever possible. 'The prosecution has layers upon layers of evidence to back up what Michael Cohen says,' Mr. Horwitz said. Despite its tawdry particulars, District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg has cast the case as one of election interference. Credit... Pool photo by Mary Altaffer Both sides will lay out their cases in opening statements on Monday, offering dueling interpretations of the evidence some six years after the payoff to Ms. Daniels entered the public consciousness and briefly imperiled Mr. Trump's presidency. But in previewing the case for prospective jurors last week, Manhattan prosecutors emphasized neither the payoff that secured Ms. Daniels's silence, nor the sex scandal that was buried in the process. One prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, instead distilled the trial's stakes to a fundamental question: 'This case is about the rule of law and whether or not Donald Trump broke it.' Mr. Steinglass's boss, Mr. Bragg, has offered a loftier interpretation, casting Mr. Trump's actions as election interference. Although Mr. Trump's lawyers might claim he was merely trying to hide embarrassing stories from his family, Mr. Bragg says Mr. Trump orchestrated a scheme to conceal simmering sex scandals from voters as they headed to the polls in 2016. All told, his allies struck three hush-money deals, paying off people who had stories to tell — stories that could have derailed Mr. Trump's candidacy. Mr. Bragg's prosecutors will seek to turn that 2016 campaign strategy against him: The tactics that helped propel Mr. Trump to victory will be admitted as evidence and reconsidered far beyond the courtroom. Aides and friends who lied on Mr. Trump's behalf will take the witness stand to testify against him. They include: David Pecker, the tabloid publisher who bought and buried damaging stories about Mr. Trump; Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman who tried to spin reporters; and Mr. Cohen, the fixer who paid Ms. Daniels. Mr. Pecker, who ran the company that owned The National Enquirer, is set to go first, and is expected to recount for the jury several conversations with Mr. Trump about the hush money, according to a person familiar with the plan. Stormy Daniels was paid $130,000 to bury her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Credit... Jeenah Moon for The New York Times Mr. Trump faces 34 felony counts, and up to four years behind bars, but more than just his freedom is at stake. If convicted, he might lose the right to vote, including to cast a ballot for himself. If he were to win back the White House, he would be the first convicted criminal to serve as commander in chief. And the question of how he might serve a prison sentence, should it come to that if he does not receive probation, could throw the country into turmoil. America has grown accustomed to seeing Mr. Trump smash through its customs and is now witnessing a phenomenon that is a first in the 248 years of its history. Presidents have been impeached, driven from office and rejected at the polls. Mr. Trump is about to be the first to have his fate decided not just by voters, but by 12 citizens in a jury box. And they all hail from Manhattan, the borough that made Mr. Trump famous, and where he is now deeply unpopular. A favorable jury pool, legal experts say, has given Mr. Bragg a leg up at the trial. Yet the jury, which was made final on Friday and includes six alternates, is no rubber stamp: It includes at least two people who have expressed some affection for the former president, and it takes only one skeptical member to force a mistrial, an outcome that Mr. Trump would celebrate as a win. The stakes are high for Mr. Bragg as well. He is betting his career and his legacy on a prosecution he inherited, rejected and then transformed. When he took office in 2022, he declined to bring a financial fraud case against Mr. Trump that his predecessor had prepared, prompting an uproar when two prosecutors resigned in protest. But Mr. Bragg continued to investigate and soon revisited the hush-money deal — an episode that had become known internally as 'the zombie case,' because it kept coming back to life. Little more than a year after taking office, Mr. Bragg indicted the former president. Three other indictments followed in three other cities, but with those cases mired in delay, Mr. Bragg's trial may now be the only one that Mr. Trump will face before Election Day. The Manhattan case comprises the three hush-money deals: with Ms. Daniels, with a former Playboy model and with a onetime doorman who told a tale of Mr. Trump fathering a child out of wedlock. Mr. Pecker and his tabloid bought the silence of the doorman, whose story turned out to be false. They also bought the rights to the story told by the model, Karen McDougal, and then never wrote it, a practice known as 'catch and kill.' David Pecker, the chief executive of American Media, had a cooperative relationship with Mr. Trump for years. Credit... Marion Curtis/Associated Press Then there was Ms. Daniels, who was interested in selling her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Mr. Pecker drew the line there: Her price was too high. Instead, he and a top editor alerted Mr. Cohen, who soon paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 not to tell her story about a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump a decade earlier. Mr. Cohen has said he acted at Mr. Trump's direction, but the former president is not charged over the payment itself. Instead, he stands accused of covering up the transaction by disguising reimbursements to Mr. Cohen. In internal records, Mr. Trump's company marked those payments as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet no such expenses existed, prosecutors say, and the retainer agreement was fictional. Mr. Trump is accused of engineering — or, at least, approving — the coverup. His company, prosecutors argue, produced 34 false records that underpin the counts against him: 11 checks, 11 monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted and 12 entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust. Mr. Trump signed several of the checks in the White House, as prosecutors will surely point out at the trial. But directly linking Mr. Trump to the plot to falsify those records is another matter altogether. His lawyers will be likely to argue that he was oblivious, and that Mr. Cohen handled the specifics. Mr. Cohen hashed out the reimbursement plan with Mr. Trump's chief financial officer, Allen H. Weisselberg, who is serving jail time for perjury and will not testify, records show. The lack of a firsthand witness to confirm Mr. Cohen's account is a potential flaw in the case, but it may not be fatal. Prosecutors plan to introduce a document containing Mr. Weisselberg's handwritten notes about the reimbursements — a key piece of evidence demonstrating that Mr. Cohen did not act alone. And under the law, the prosecutors need not prove that Mr. Trump personally falsified the records. Already during the trial's first week, Mr. Steinglass laid the groundwork with a simple analogy: He asked prospective jurors whether they could accept that, if a husband hired a hit man to murder his wife, the husband was just as guilty as the man who pulled the trigger. 'Can you all follow the same kind of logic in this case?' Mr. Steinglass asked the prospective jurors. Many said they could. Mr. Cohen is expected to offer the closest thing this case has to a smoking gun: He is likely to say that, in early 2017, he and Mr. Trump discussed the repayment scheme in the Oval Office. If Mr. Trump testifies in his own defense, that could pit Mr. Cohen's word against Mr. Trump's — a he-said, he-said story, with two questionable narrators. Whether or not Mr. Trump takes the stand, the trial could become a referendum on Mr. Cohen's credibility, with the verdict possibly hinging on a convincing performance. In 2018, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to a variety of federal crimes, admitting to participating in the hush-money deals with Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal and lying to Congress about plans for a Trump business deal in Russia. Mr. Trump's lawyers will seek to emphasize Mr. Cohen's checkered past at every turn. And, on cross-examination, Mr. Trump's lawyers are likely to portray Mr. Cohen as a serial liar with a grudge against his former boss. Michael D. Cohen, a former fixer to Mr. Trump and a conduit for the hush money, will be a crucial witness. Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times Susan Necheles, one of Mr. Trump's lawyers, began that campaign during jury selection. She referenced Mr. Cohen's 2022 book 'Revenge,' questioning the credibility of 'someone who says that they want revenge against President Trump.' Yet the prosecution is expected to note that Mr. Cohen told many of his lies for Mr. Trump. And prosecutors will offer evidence corroborating the broad strokes of Mr. Cohen's story, which could persuade jurors when they are weighing his testimony about the crucial Oval Office meeting. Mr. Trump's White House executive assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, who has been identified as a potential witness, could confirm that Mr. Cohen did indeed meet with Mr. Trump, even if she cannot confirm what they discussed. Mr. Pecker can support at least some of Mr. Cohen's testimony about Mr. Trump's involvement in the hush-money deals. And a recording Mr. Cohen made of a call he had with Mr. Trump will capture the former president discussing the deal with Ms. McDougal. 'The prosecution's argument is that you can trust Michael Cohen beyond a reasonable doubt as to their isolated conversation,' said Mr. Horwitz, the former prosecutor. He called the approach 'Prosecuting 101.' William K.

Trump engaged in a conspiracy to cover up a sex scandal in order to get elected president in 2016.\nThe first witness called was the tabloid publisher David Pecker, whom prosecutors described as one member of a three-man plot to conceal damaging stories — including a porn star's account of a sexual tryst — as Mr. Trump mounted his bid for the presidency.\nMr. Pecker was on the stand for only a few minutes in the afternoon before court adjourned for the day. He described how his publication, The National Enquirer, paid for stories, a practice he called 'checkbook journalism.' He is expected to return to the stand on Tuesday.\nMatthew Colangelo, one of the prosecutors for the Manhattan district attorney's office, told the jury in his opening statement that the case was about 'a criminal conspiracy and a coverup,' describing how Mr. Trump, his longtime counsel Michael D. Cohen, and Mr. Pecker engaged in a strategy to 'catch and kill' negative stories.\nThe lead lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, insisted in his opening statement that the former president had done nothing wrong. 'President Trump is innocent,' he told the jury. 'President Trump did not commit any crimes.'\nThe case centers on a $130,000 hush-money payment that Mr. Cohen made to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, to buy her silence as the 2016 campaign was winding down. Prosecutors say he was reimbursed by Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump falsified business records to conceal his conduct.\nMr. Colangelo said the payment to Ms. Daniels came on the heels of another scandal — the 'Access Hollywood' tape, on which Mr. Trump bragged about groping women. Ms. Daniels's account, he said, 'could have been devastating to his campaign.'\nHe added, 'With pressure mounting and Election Day fast approaching, Donald Trump agreed to the payoff and directed Cohen to proceed.'\nMr. Cohen, who was an executive vice president at the Trump Organization and counsel to Mr. Trump, and Mr. Pecker are expected to be central witnesses.\nMr. Blanche attacked Mr. Cohen's credibility, saying that his livelihood hinges on attacking the former president, and insisted that prosecutors were attempting to present perfectly legal activities, such as entering into nondisclosure agreements, in a negative light.\n'I have a spoiler alert: There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,' Mr. Blanche said. 'It's called democracy.'\nHe continued: 'They put something sinister on this idea as if it were a crime. You'll learn it's not.'\nHere's what else to know about the trial:\nThe Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump was unveiled a year ago by the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg. Mr. Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and if convicted could face up to four years in prison. Those are felonies because prosecutors say Mr. Trump sought to conceal another crime. On Monday, they strongly emphasized a violation of state election law — conspiracy to promote election — that is not one of the actual charges, but they say is baked into the overall crime.\nThe case is the former president's first criminal trial, although he has been indicted three other times in three other cities. With those other cases tied up in appeals and other delays, the Manhattan case may be the only one he faces before the 2024 presidential election. The trial is expected to last six weeks.\nBefore opening statements, the judge overseeing the case delivered a crucial ruling that determined what prosecutors can question Mr. Trump about should he decide to take the stand in his own defense. The ruling, a significant victory for prosecutors that might prompt Mr. Trump to decide not to testify, allows them to question him about several recent losses he suffered in unrelated civil trials, including a fraud case this year in which the former president was found liable for conspiring to manipulate his net worth and was penalized $454 million.\nThe jury was drawn from a pool of residents of Manhattan, where Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular; during jury selection, dozens of prospective jurors were excused because they said they could not be impartial. But the jurors who were selected each pledged to decide the case based only on the facts. Read more about them.\nThe case will receive vast media attention, but the proceedings won't be shown on television.\nMatthew Colangelo, a prosecutor, said there would be 'only one conclusion: Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.' Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times The Manhattan district attorney's office and lawyers for Donald J. Trump presented opening statements to jurors on Monday, with prosecutors accusing the former president of entering a criminal conspiracy while the defense sought to discredit two key witnesses.\nA prosecutor, Matthew Colangelo, began by telling jurors that Mr. Trump had conspired with his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, and the publisher of The National Enquirer, David Pecker, to conceal damaging stories during his 2016 campaign.\n'This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover-up,' Mr. Colangelo said, telling a story about a hush-money payment to a porn star and insisting that the former president was ultimately responsible.\nIn the end, Mr. Colangelo said, there would be 'only one conclusion: Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.'\nImmediately after Mr. Colangelo's presentation, Mr. Trump's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, directly disagreed, insisting that the jury acquit the former president. Mr. Trump, he said, had engaged in actions that were legal and normal.\n'President Trump did not commit any crimes,' Mr. Blanche told the jury, using the former president's preferred form of address. The lawyer told jurors that Mr. Trump had earned the right to be referred to as 'president' and reminded them that he was the presumptive Republican nominee.\nMr. Blanche argued that there was nothing illegal about nondisclosure agreements, which he said companies, the wealthy and the famous all use frequently. And, he said, prosecutors were wrong to suggest something criminal about Mr. Trump's efforts to win the White House.\n'I have a spoiler alert: There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election,' Mr. Blanche said. 'It's called democracy.'\nMr. Blanche asserted that Mr. Cohen, a key prosecution witness, was paid for legal services, and he attempted to undermine Mr. Cohen's credibility. Mr. Blanche called Mr. Cohen a 'criminal' who 'can't be trusted' and suggested that he was testifying only because he didn't get a job in the Trump administration.\nHe also took aim at Stormy Daniels, the former porn star who claimed she had sex with Mr. Trump, characterizing her as an opportunist who had used a brief encounter with Mr. Trump related to his reality show, 'The Apprentice,' to make huge sums of money.\nHe added that Ms. Daniels was 'biased' against the former president and made a living off her story about the sexual encounter.\nMr. Blanche also sought to minimize the charges, saying the records at the heart of the case were just '34 pieces of paper' that the former president had nothing to do with.\nMr. Trump is accused of falsifying business records — which is a felony if prosecutors can show the records were altered with an intent to commit or conceal a second crime.\nA year ago, when the former president was formally charged with 34 felonies, the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, told reporters that he did not have to specify what the second crime was, and listed three options. During opening statements, Mr. Colangelo made it clear he believed that the strongest case relied on one of those options: convincing jurors that Mr. Trump concealed the violation of a state law that forbids 'conspiracy to promote or prevent an election.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 1:37 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 1:37 p.m. ET Alan Feuer\nAlan Feuer Providing analysis of Trump cases There's some good news for people who want to follow the Trump trial in detail, but can't make it to the courthouse.

Credit... Mary Altaffer/Associated Press 'Catch-and-kill' is a term coined by old-time tabloid editors for buying the exclusive rights to stories, or 'catching' them, for the specific purpose of ensuring the information never becomes public. That's the 'killing' part.\nWhy would anyone want to spend money on a story that it never intends to publish? In the world of tabloid journalism, where ethical lines are blurry, deciding what to publish and why is often a calculus that covers favors doled out and chits called in.\nDavid Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, who also oversaw other tabloids such as Star and lifestyle publications such as Men's Fitness, was a master of the technique, according to people who have worked for him.\nIn 2003, Mr. Pecker's company, American Media Inc., bought several muscle magazines founded by a mentor of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilding legend and movie star. When Mr. Schwarzenegger, who was often featured in those magazines, jumped into the recall election to replace California's governor, Mr. Pecker ordered his staff to buy up negative stories about him in order to protect his investment, former employees said.\nStaff members called it 'the David Pecker Project.' American Media paid $20,000 to a former mistress of Mr. Schwarzenegger so that she would not speak about their affair — though news of it had previously been published. The company paid another $1,000 to her friend and $2,000 to a man who had a video of Mr. Schwarzenegger dancing lewdly in Rio de Janeiro 20 years earlier. Mr. Schwarzenegger was elected governor.\nMr. Pecker's publications made deals with other celebrities as well, though not always for money. He traded away dirt about the golfer Tiger Woods in exchange for an exclusive interview in Men's Fitness in 2007, according to people with knowledge of that episode.\nAnd, according to the prosecutors in the Manhattan trial of Donald J.

This could be a risk for them — conspiracy is not one of the charged crimes. And this jury has at least two lawyers.\nDavid Pecker's publication, The National Enquirer, was a repository for as many secrets as it published. Credit... Marion Curtis/Associated Press The first witness in Donald J. Trump's criminal is David Pecker, who was the publisher of The National Enquirer, and had traded favors with Mr. Trump since the 1990s.\nMr. Pecker, who was sometimes referred to as the 'tabloid king,' had long used his publications to curry favor with Mr. Trump and other celebrities, in exchange for tips or for business reasons. Staff members called Mr. Trump, like other favored stars who were off limits, an 'F.O.P.' — 'Friend of Pecker.'\nMr. Trump and Mr. Pecker, along with Mr. Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen, hatched a plan in August 2015 to boost his upstart presidential campaign, prosecutors say. The former Trump allies are each expected to take a turn on the witness stand, giving testimony that could help make him the first president convicted of a felony.\nProsecutors for Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, will try to show that the hush money payment to a porn star at the center of the trial was part of a larger effort to suppress negative news about Mr. Trump to sway the election. That scheme, they will contend, includes two other deals, both involving Mr. Pecker.\nMr. Trump had announced his presidential campaign in June 2015. The plan the men laid out two months later was simple, according to court documents, interviews with people involved in the events or familiar with them, private communications and other records.\nMr. Pecker would use The Enquirer to publish positive stories about Mr. Trump's campaign and negative stories about his rivals. He would alert Mr. Trump, through Mr. Cohen, when The Enquirer learned of stories that might threaten Mr. Trump. The Enquirer could buy the rights to those stories in order to suppress them, a practice known in the tabloid world as 'catch and kill.'\nIn late 2015, Mr. Pecker's company paid $30,000 to suppress a claim by a former doorman at a Trump building who said he had heard Mr. Trump fathered a child out of wedlock — a rumor that was apparently untrue. Then in August 2016, The Enquirer's parent company paid $150,000 to a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, to keep her account of an affair with Mr. Trump quiet. Two months later, Mr. Pecker and The Enquirer's editor helped Mr. Cohen negotiate a $130,000 hush-money payment with Stormy Daniels, the former porn star who also said she had sex with Mr. Trump. He has denied both women's claims.\nMr. Cohen pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance crimes in 2018.\nThe Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., made a deal that year to avoid federal prosecution, acknowledging that it had illegally tried to influence the election.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 12:07 p.m. ET April 22, 2024, 12:07 p.m. ET Maggie Haberman\nMaggie Haberman Reporting from the courthouse Merchan stops testimony, says he realizes jurors weren't given writing materials to take notes.

Trump has assembled a team of defense lawyers with extensive experience representing people charged with white-collar crimes to defend him against the charges filed by the Manhattan district attorney's office. Some have worked for Mr. Trump for years. Others are more recent additions, but are involved in the former president's broader legal defense, also representing him in other criminal cases.\nHere's a look at Mr. Trump's defense team:\nMr. Blanche started representing Mr. Trump last year, leaving a prestigious position as a partner at Wall Street's oldest law firm to take him on as a client. He is also representing Mr. Trump in his federal classified documents case in Florida and his federal election interference case in Washington.\nMr. Blanche has also represented Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, as well as Boris Epshteyn, an adviser to Mr. Trump. Before turning to private practice, Mr. Blanche was a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where he supervised violent-crime cases.\nMs. Necheles has been a lawyer for Mr. Trump since 2021 and represented the Trump Organization during its criminal tax fraud trial in Manhattan. The business was convicted of 17 felonies and ordered by Justice Juan M. Merchan to pay the maximum penalty of $1.6 million.\nMs. Necheles previously represented defendants in major organized-crime and public-corruption cases, including Venero Mangano, the Genovese crime family underboss who was known as Benny Eggs.\nMr. Bove, the newest addition to Mr. Trump's legal team, is a legal partner to Mr. Blanche. He is a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York who turned to private practice and now represents defendants charged with white-collar crimes.\nMr. Stern is a law partner to Ms. Necheles and also defended the Trump Organization in its criminal tax-fraud trial. He has previous experience representing clients charged with bribery, fraud and conspiracy.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Justice Juan M. Merchan handed prosecutors a legal cudgel that could dissuade Donald J. Trump from testifying. Credit... Ahmed Gaber for The New York Times The judge in Donald J. Trump's criminal trial ruled on Monday morning that prosecutors could ask the former president about a range of previous cases that he has lost, as well as past violations of gag orders, in the event that he decides to testify in his defense.\nAmong other cases, the ruling by the judge, Juan M. Merchan, would allow prosecutors to question Mr. Trump about the civil fraud case brought by the New York attorney general, Letitia James, in which the former president was found to have inflated his net worth to obtain favorable loans. That case resulted in a $454 million judgment against Mr. Trump.\nJustice Merchan will also allow the Manhattan district attorney's office — which brought the case against Mr. Trump — to question him about civil cases brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. Those cases found that Mr. Trump was liable for sexually abusing and defaming Ms. Carroll in the first instance and for defamation in the second. (Justice Merchan did not mention the sexual abuse finding, only the defamation, in his ruling regarding the Carroll cases on Monday.)\nJustice Merchan will also let prosecutors ask about Mr. Trump's attack on a law clerk in a civil fraud case, in violation of a gag order, as well as a 2018 decision that led to the dissolution of the Donald J. Trump Foundation to resolve a case brought by the New York attorney general at the time, Barbara Underwood, over financial irregularities.\nThe former president suggested in early April that he would testify in the criminal trial, saying that prosecutors 'have no case.' That said, Mr. Trump has promised to testify in previous cases only to back out, and Justice Merchan's decision could change his thinking on such a maneuver.\nJustice Merchan said that, in the event that Mr. Trump did testify, he would give jurors 'careful and specific' instructions about the scope of prosecutors' queries, adding that he had 'greatly curtailed' what specifics could be the target of questions.\nHowever, Justice Merchan warned Mr. Trump that his ruling was 'a shield and not a sword' and that the former president's testimony could open 'the door to questioning that has otherwise been excluded.'\nMr. Trump is being tried on charges that he falsified business records to cover up a hush-money payment to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. He has denied the charges.\nSusan Hoffinger and Joshua Steinglass are among the experienced team that the Manhattan district attorney has put together to prosecute Donald J. Trump. Credit... Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has assembled an accomplished team to take on perhaps the most high-profile case in his office's history: the first criminal trial against former President Donald J. Trump. The group includes veteran prosecutors and former white-collar criminal defense lawyers who have extensive experience going up against Mr. Trump.\nHere's a look at the prosecution team:\nMr. Steinglass, who has served as an assistant district attorney since 1998, is a recent addition to this case; in 2022 he helped lead the team that secured a conviction against the Trump Organization for conspiracy, criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records. He typically prosecutes significant violent crimes, such as a violent brawl on the Upper East Side that led to the conviction of two Proud Boy extremists in 2019.\nAfter starting her career at the Manhattan district attorney's office, Ms. Hoffinger founded her own firm and spent 20 years as a defense lawyer focusing on white-collar criminal defense. She rejoined the district attorney's office in 2022 and worked with Mr. Steinglass to obtain the conviction of the Trump Organization in its criminal tax fraud trial.\nA prosecutor for 28 years, Mr. Conroy previously led the Manhattan district attorney's office's major economic crimes unit, where he was involved in the prosecution of the bankrupt law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf and supervised investigations into multinational financial institutions for falsification of business records. Mr. Conroy is the longest serving member of this trial team.\nMr. Colangelo joined the district attorney's office in 2022 after serving for two years as a senior official at the U.S. Department of Justice. He previously worked for the New York attorney general's office, where he oversaw the investigation into the Trump Foundation, which led to its dissolution. He was also, for a time, one of the lead lawyers on the civil fraud inquiry into Mr. Trump.\nBefore joining Mr. Bragg's major economic crimes unit in 2022, Ms. Mangold clerked for a U.S. District Court judge in New Jersey and worked in private practice for over 10 years. As a partner at the law firm Kobre & Kim, Ms. Mangold focused on criminal and regulatory investigations related to financial misconduct.\nMs. Ellis joined the Manhattan district attorney's office in 2018 after working as an associate at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. Before becoming a lawyer, Ms. Ellis worked as a legal analyst at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Broadcast feeds from the trial are limited to those from outside the courtroom. Credit... Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times The Manhattan criminal trial of Donald J. Trump will be closely followed around the world. But you will not be able to watch the proceedings on TV.\nThere will be no video feed aired live from the courtroom. Nor will there be an audio feed, as some federal courts allow.\nNew York courts generally do not permit video to be broadcast from courtrooms, although a feed is being transmitted into an overflow room for the reporters covering the trial. And cameras will be stationed in the hallway outside the courtroom to capture Mr. Trump's remarks as he enters and leaves.\nShortly after court adjourned on Monday, the state's chief administrative judge, Joseph A. Zayas, issued a statement saying that transcripts of each day of the trial would be published online by the end of the following day on the court system's website.\nJudge Zayas was responding to a request for public transcripts filed last week by a New York lawyer, Jim Walden, on behalf of a civic group and a news website.\n'With current law restricting the broadcasting of trial proceedings and courtroom space for public spectators very limited, the release of the daily transcripts on the court system's website is the best way to provide the public a direct view of the proceedings in this historic trial,' Judge Zayas wrote in his statement.\nCourt will be in session, for the most part, every weekday except Wednesdays, from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., until the trial ends.\nThe weeklong jury selection process was a pressure cooker for many of the nearly 300 Manhattan residents who were summoned to be interviewed.

The two Manhattan residents were led into the courtroom to fulfill a foundational civic duty: to be interviewed as prospective jurors.\nBut in the room when they arrived was a defendant, Donald J. Trump, unlike any in American history.\nBoth would-be jurors, a man and a woman, were eventually excused. But the experience thrust them into the spotlight in a way they never had imagined.\nOne was challenged by Mr. Trump's lawyers over his past social media posts relating to the former president. The other has a medical practice that she could not shut for six weeks while serving on the jury.\nWhile they were not chosen as jurors, their experiences illustrate the intensity of the attention focused on Mr. Trump's trial — and on the first jury to ever weigh the fate of a former United States president in a criminal proceeding.\nBoth contacted The New York Times only after they were excused from serving. Though the court's rules protecting prospective jurors' identities end when they are dismissed from serving, The Times is withholding their names and most identifying characteristics about them.\nLike the other prospective jurors who were considered, both included detailed personal information on the juror questionnaires they filled out, including where they work.\nThey were made to answer those questions by speaking into a microphone in open court; soon, both were blindsided as details of their lives ricocheted around the internet. They said they were frustrated that so much attention was devoted to prospective jurors and ascertaining information about them.\nWhile they later learned that the judge in the case, Justice Juan M. Merchan, had ordered the redaction of some of the information jurors were ordered to reveal publicly, they felt that he had acted too late. As with many things connected to the trial, the rhythms and even some of the parameters are being written in real time.\nTheir experiences mirrored some that other prospective jurors who were dismissed have described. One, a man who gave his name as Mark to NBC News, said he had 'satirized Mr. Trump often in my artwork,' and because of that, he had expected not to be chosen.\nA woman who gave her name as Kara, who said the nature of her job made serving extremely difficult, told NBC News that she realized the gravity of serving on any criminal jury, but particularly this one.\nSeeing Mr. Trump in person, she said, was 'very jarring.' He was, she realized, just 'another guy.'\nOne of the prospective jurors who spoke with The Times, the man, did not immediately realize what case he was involved in when he was led into the courtroom on the 15th floor of the Manhattan criminal courthouse. The woman had a sense a week earlier, having read a news story about the trial beginning the week she was supposed to respond to a juror summons.\nThe man, sitting a few rows behind the prosecutors' table when the two were part of the first panel of 96 prospective jurors brought into the courtroom Monday afternoon, felt a sense of calm about five minutes into being there. Trump was simply a defendant, he thought. It was a business-records trial. Prosecutors were on one side, the defense lawyers on the other.\nThe woman was struck by the fact that Mr. Trump stood and waved to prospective jurors, she said, as he and his lawyers were introduced to the group. It felt more to her like the behavior of a campaigning candidate than of a criminal defendant. (Mr. Trump, of course, is both.)\nBoth were put off by efforts by Mr. Trump's lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, to assess prospective jurors' views of Mr. Trump. The man said Mr. Blanche seemed 'folksy' in a way he found disingenuous, while the woman was sharper, describing a 'witch hunt' to root out people sympathetic to Democrats on the panel — a phrase Mr. Trump uses often to criticize the various prosecutors investigating his conduct.\nThe man in particular was frustrated that he was asked about past social media posts in which he had been critical of Mr. Trump, which Mr. Blanche's team raised and which Justice Merchan ultimately agreed meant the man should be excused.\nThe man believed he could have been fair and resented the implication that he could not have been. Both he and the woman, who said they believed in the system of jury service, noted that they had begun the day taking sworn oaths vowing to render a fair and impartial judgment on the evidence. The man believed his own views — especially views from years ago — had no bearing on his ability to judge the evidence. If anything, he said, he would have been hyper-conscious in doing so.\nBoth had realized the magnitude of what serving on that jury would mean.\nBut they were also conscious of the threats and blowback that could come with weighing evidence against Mr. Trump — particularly with their personal details traceable in public. And both had concerns about being chosen because of that; the man in particular said his spouse had been worried.\nBoth would have valued being part of the historic trial. But both also had a sense of relief that they were not picked.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT Former President Donald J. Trump is accused of 34 felonies, but a conviction is no sure thing. Credit... Pool photo by Curtis Means In the official record, the case is known as the People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump, and, for now, the people have the stronger hand: They have insider witnesses, a favorable jury pool and a lurid set of facts about a presidential candidate, a payoff and a porn star.\nOn Monday, the prosecutors will formally introduce the case to 12 all-important jurors, embarking on the first prosecution of an American president. The trial, which could brand Mr. Trump a felon as he mounts another White House run, will reverberate throughout the nation and test the durability of the justice system that Mr. Trump is attacking in a way that no other defendant would be allowed to do.\nThough the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, has assembled a mountain of evidence, a conviction is hardly assured. Over the next six weeks, Mr. Trump's lawyers will seize on three apparent weak points: a key witness's credibility, a president's culpability and the case's legal complexity.\nProsecutors will seek to maneuver around those vulnerabilities, dazzling the jury with a tale that mixes politics and sex, as they confront a shrewd defendant with a decades-long track record of skirting legal consequences. They will also seek to bolster the credibility of that key witness, Michael D. Cohen, a former fixer to Mr. Trump who previously pleaded guilty to federal crimes for paying the porn star, Stormy Daniels.\nDaniel J. Horwitz, a veteran defense lawyer who previously worked in the Manhattan district attorney's office prosecuting white-collar cases, said prosecutors can be expected to corroborate Mr. Cohen's story wherever possible.\n'The prosecution has layers upon layers of evidence to back up what Michael Cohen says,' Mr. Horwitz said.\nDespite its tawdry particulars, District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg has cast the case as one of election interference. Credit... Pool photo by Mary Altaffer Both sides will lay out their cases in opening statements on Monday, offering dueling interpretations of the evidence some six years after the payoff to Ms. Daniels entered the public consciousness and briefly imperiled Mr. Trump's presidency.\nBut in previewing the case for prospective jurors last week, Manhattan prosecutors emphasized neither the payoff that secured Ms. Daniels's silence, nor the sex scandal that was buried in the process. One prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, instead distilled the trial's stakes to a fundamental question: 'This case is about the rule of law and whether or not Donald Trump broke it.'\nMr. Steinglass's boss, Mr. Bragg, has offered a loftier interpretation, casting Mr. Trump's actions as election interference. Although Mr. Trump's lawyers might claim he was merely trying to hide embarrassing stories from his family, Mr. Bragg says Mr. Trump orchestrated a scheme to conceal simmering sex scandals from voters as they headed to the polls in 2016. All told, his allies struck three hush-money deals, paying off people who had stories to tell — stories that could have derailed Mr. Trump's candidacy.\nthree hush-money deals, paying off people who had stories to tell — stories that could have derailed Mr. Trump's candidacy. Mr. Bragg's prosecutors will seek to turn that 2016 campaign strategy against him: The tactics that helped propel Mr. Trump to victory will be admitted as evidence and reconsidered far beyond the courtroom. Aides and friends who lied on Mr. Trump's behalf will take the witness stand to testify against him.\nThey include: David Pecker, the tabloid publisher who bought and buried damaging stories about Mr. Trump; Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman who tried to spin reporters; and Mr. Cohen, the fixer who paid Ms. Daniels. Mr. Pecker, who ran the company that owned The National Enquirer, is set to go first, and is expected to recount for the jury several conversations with Mr. Trump about the hush money, according to a person familiar with the plan.\nStormy Daniels was paid $130,000 to bury her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Credit... Jeenah Moon for The New York Times Mr. Trump faces 34 felony counts, and up to four years behind bars, but more than just his freedom is at stake. If convicted, he might lose the right to vote, including to cast a ballot for himself. If he were to win back the White House, he would be the first convicted criminal to serve as commander in chief. And the question of how he might serve a prison sentence, should it come to that if he does not receive probation, could throw the country into turmoil.\nAmerica has grown accustomed to seeing Mr. Trump smash through its customs and is now witnessing a phenomenon that is a first in the 248 years of its history. Presidents have been impeached, driven from office and rejected at the polls. Mr. Trump is about to be the first to have his fate decided not just by voters, but by 12 citizens in a jury box.\nAnd they all hail from Manhattan, the borough that made Mr. Trump famous, and where he is now deeply unpopular. A favorable jury pool, legal experts say, has given Mr. Bragg a leg up at the trial.\nYet the jury, which was made final on Friday and includes six alternates, is no rubber stamp: It includes at least two people who have expressed some affection for the former president, and it takes only one skeptical member to force a mistrial, an outcome that Mr. Trump would celebrate as a win.\nThe stakes are high for Mr. Bragg as well. He is betting his career and his legacy on a prosecution he inherited, rejected and then transformed.\nWhen he took office in 2022, he declined to bring a financial fraud case against Mr. Trump that his predecessor had prepared, prompting an uproar when two prosecutors resigned in protest.\nBut Mr. Bragg continued to investigate and soon revisited the hush-money deal — an episode that had become known internally as 'the zombie case,' because it kept coming back to life. Little more than a year after taking office, Mr. Bragg indicted the former president.\nThree other indictments followed in three other cities, but with those cases mired in delay, Mr. Bragg's trial may now be the only one that Mr. Trump will face before Election Day.\nThe Manhattan case comprises the three hush-money deals: with Ms. Daniels, with a former Playboy model and with a onetime doorman who told a tale of Mr. Trump fathering a child out of wedlock.\nMr. Pecker and his tabloid bought the silence of the doorman, whose story turned out to be false. They also bought the rights to the story told by the model, Karen McDougal, and then never wrote it, a practice known as 'catch and kill.'\nDavid Pecker, the chief executive of American Media, had a cooperative relationship with Mr. Trump for years. Credit... Marion Curtis/Associated Press Then there was Ms. Daniels, who was interested in selling her story of a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Mr. Pecker drew the line there: Her price was too high.\nInstead, he and a top editor alerted Mr. Cohen, who soon paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 not to tell her story about a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump a decade earlier.\nMr. Cohen has said he acted at Mr. Trump's direction, but the former president is not charged over the payment itself. Instead, he stands accused of covering up the transaction by disguising reimbursements to Mr. Cohen.\nIn internal records, Mr. Trump's company marked those payments as legal expenses, citing a retainer agreement. Yet no such expenses existed, prosecutors say, and the retainer agreement was fictional.\nMr. Trump is accused of engineering — or, at least, approving — the coverup. His company, prosecutors argue, produced 34 false records that underpin the counts against him: 11 checks, 11 monthly invoices Mr. Cohen submitted and 12 entries in the general ledger for Mr. Trump's trust.\nMr. Trump signed several of the checks in the White House, as prosecutors will surely point out at the trial.\nBut directly linking Mr. Trump to the plot to falsify those records is another matter altogether.\nHis lawyers will be likely to argue that he was oblivious, and that Mr. Cohen handled the specifics. Mr. Cohen hashed out the reimbursement plan with Mr. Trump's chief financial officer, Allen H. Weisselberg, who is serving jail time for perjury and will not testify, records show.\nThe lack of a firsthand witness to confirm Mr. Cohen's account is a potential flaw in the case, but it may not be fatal. Prosecutors plan to introduce a document containing Mr. Weisselberg's handwritten notes about the reimbursements — a key piece of evidence demonstrating that Mr. Cohen did not act alone.\nAnd under the law, the prosecutors need not prove that Mr. Trump personally falsified the records. Already during the trial's first week, Mr. Steinglass laid the groundwork with a simple analogy: He asked prospective jurors whether they could accept that, if a husband hired a hit man to murder his wife, the husband was just as guilty as the man who pulled the trigger.\n'Can you all follow the same kind of logic in this case?' Mr. Steinglass asked the prospective jurors. Many said they could.\nMr. Cohen is expected to offer the closest thing this case has to a smoking gun: He is likely to say that, in early 2017, he and Mr. Trump discussed the repayment scheme in the Oval Office.\nIf Mr. Trump testifies in his own defense, that could pit Mr. Cohen's word against Mr. Trump's — a he-said, he-said story, with two questionable narrators.\nWhether or not Mr. Trump takes the stand, the trial could become a referendum on Mr. Cohen's credibility, with the verdict possibly hinging on a convincing performance.\nIn 2018, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to a variety of federal crimes, admitting to participating in the hush-money deals with Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal and lying to Congress about plans for a Trump business deal in Russia. Mr. Trump's lawyers will seek to emphasize Mr. Cohen's checkered past at every turn.\nAnd, on cross-examination, Mr. Trump's lawyers are likely to portray Mr. Cohen as a serial liar with a grudge against his former boss.\nMichael D. Cohen, a former fixer to Mr. Trump and a conduit for the hush money, will be a crucial witness. Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times Susan Necheles, one of Mr. Trump's lawyers, began that campaign during jury selection. She referenced Mr. Cohen's 2022 book 'Revenge,' questioning the credibility of 'someone who says that they want revenge against President Trump.'\nYet the prosecution is expected to note that Mr. Cohen told many of his lies for Mr. Trump. And prosecutors will offer evidence corroborating the broad strokes of Mr. Cohen's story, which could persuade jurors when they are weighing his testimony about the crucial Oval Office meeting.\nMr. Trump's White House executive assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, who has been identified as a potential witness, could confirm that Mr. Cohen did indeed meet with Mr. Trump, even if she cannot confirm what they discussed. Mr. Pecker can support at least some of Mr. Cohen's testimony about Mr. Trump's involvement in the hush-money deals. And a recording Mr. Cohen made of a call he had with Mr. Trump will capture the former president discussing the deal with Ms. McDougal.\n'The prosecution's argument is that you can trust Michael Cohen beyond a reasonable doubt as to their isolated conversation,' said Mr. Horwitz, the former prosecutor. He called the approach 'Prosecuting 101.'\nWilliam K.
