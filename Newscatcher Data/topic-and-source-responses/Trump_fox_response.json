            "excerpt": "Actor and comedian John Leguizamo destroyed a piñata after learning former President Trump was gaining support among Latino voters as the election nears.",
            "summary": "Actor John Leguizamo attacked a piñata in a fit of rage after learning Donald Trump was gaining support among Latino voters.\nAfter he mocked an ad from the Trump campaign targeting Latino voters, \"The Daily Show\" guest host expressed dismay over polls showing he was gaining ground with Latinos.\n\"I mean, clearly, Trump isn't making any effort to get Latino voters or make them a priority,\" Leguizamo scoffed. \"But the thing that hurts the most is that his lazy a-- strategy is actually working.\"\nThe comedy show played a news clip reading the results of a poll earlier this year which put Trump ahead of Biden by six points with Latino voters. Leguizamo reacted by grabbing a piñata from under his desk and punching it.\nThe comedian let out a string of curse words in Spanish aimed at Trump while attacking the piñata. After regaining his composure, Leguizamo warned Democrats were in trouble because Latino voters trusted Trump over Biden to handle their number one concern: inflation.\n\"It looks like the Democrats are in trouble. And you might be thinking, how is this possible? Donald Trump is winning Latinos? ‘Build the wall' Donald Trump? ‘Mass deportations' Donald Trump? Guy who thinks Daddy Yankee is a baseball player, Donald Trump? But the truth is, in 2024, Latino voters have something else on their minds,\" he said.\n\"That's right. For Latinos, this election is all about inflation! And that makes sense! Inflation is bad right now,\" he said before claiming that Trump had no solutions to solve the crisis.\nAnother recent poll from Axios/Ipsos shows Latinos overwhelmingly support Trump over Biden on key issues like the economy.\nThe poll found only 20% of Latinos think Biden is \"good for the U.S. economy,\" while 42% of respondents said the same about Trump. Latinos also favor Trump on immigration, crime and public safety.\nBiden received 50% support among Latino voters in a recent NY Times/Siena College survey, which is historically low for a Democrat, according to a report from The Hill. At the same time, Trump had 41% support among Latinos, which is on the higher end for a GOP candidate in recent elections.",

            "excerpt": "MSNBC's Joy Reid applauded the \"DEIs\" prosecuting Donald Trump on Monday, calling it \"wonderfully poetic\" as his first criminal trial in New York is underway.",
            "summary": "MSNBC host Joy Reid praised some of the Black public officials prosecuting former President Trump, saying Monday \"my DEIs are bringing it home.\"\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was the first person to criminally prosecute Trump, and it was \"wonderfully poetic,\" Reid said. DEI, which stands for diversity, equity and inclusion, has become a hot topic of debate as conservative governments like Florida and Texas have banned such programs from college campuses.\n\"But for me, there is something wonderfully poetic about the fact … the first person to actually criminally prosecute Donald Trump is a Black Harvard grad,\" Reid said. \"The very kind of person that his former staff, the people who worked for him, Steven Miller, etc., want to never be at Harvard Law School. But he was. And he came out and graduated, and he's prosecuting you, Donald.\"\n\"And a Black woman is doing that same exact thing in Georgia and a Black woman forced you to pay a $175 million fine,\" Reid continued, referring to District Attorney Fani Willis in Georgia and New York Attorney General Letitia James. \"Donald Trump is being held to account by the very multicultural, multiracial democracy that he's trying to dismantle … It says something good about our country that we're still capable of having that happen. Go, DEI. My DEIs are bringing it home.\"\nTrump was indicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records in March 2023, following a yearslong investigation by Bragg. The charges against Trump are related to hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges, and the trial for the hush money case began Monday.\nThe former president was also indicted in Georgia, as part of Willis' investigation, on multiple charges related to election interference. In James' case, Trump recently posted a $175 million bond — lowered from $454 million — to prevent the state from seizing his assets while he appeals a judge's ruling that he fraudulently inflated his wealth for financial gain.\nReid said Trump was \"outdoing actual mobsters\" by criticizing the judge on the hush money case, noting one of Trump's lawyers had mobster Benny Eggs as a client.\n\"So Donald Trump is at this point outdoing actual mobsters in his attacks on the judge's family, the daughter,\" she said. \"He knows he will never spend a day, a second, a moment in prison.\"\nTrump returned to the Manhattan courthouse for day two of his hush money payments trial on Tuesday, where Bragg called on Judge Juan Merchan to hold Trump in contempt of court.\nBragg filed the motion minutes after the second day of Trump's trial got underway in Manhattan. It relates to Merchan's gag order against Trump, which prohibits the former president from speaking publicly about prosecutors, witnesses, court officials and their families.\nIn his motion, Bragg argued Trump has \"willfully violated this Court's order by publishing several social media posts attacking two known witnesses— Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.\"\nAn Associated Press/NORC poll found that just 35% of Americans believe Trump committed a crime in the case. Trump told reporters this week that payments he made to Cohen were merely a \"legal expense.\" Cohen has said Trump reimbursed him for a $130,000 payment to keep Daniels quiet about an alleged affair they had, which Trump denies.",

            "excerpt": "Wisconsin voters split their preference between President Biden and former President Trump in a hypothetical 2-way presidential race",
            "summary": "Wisconsin voters split their preference between President Biden and former President Trump in a hypothetical 2-way presidential race — and between backing the Democratic and the Republican congressional candidates in their House district, according to a new Fox News survey of Wisconsin registered voters.\nIn the head-to-head presidential matchup, Biden and Trump tie with 48% support each.\nBiden gets significant backing from urban voters (+29 points), Whites with a college degree (+26), suburban voters (+10), and union households (+8).\nFor Trump, some of his highest support is from White evangelical Christians (+46 points), White men without a college degree (+29), and rural voters (+15).\nVoters under age 45 back Biden by a single point, while those ages 65 and over go for Biden by 10 points.\nThere's a 17-point gender gap, as men go for Trump by 8 points and women for Biden by 9.\nBiden receives a touch more support among Democrats (95%) than Trump gets among Republicans (93%), but Trump is the choice of the small subgroup of independents (by 8 points).\nWhen potential third-party candidates are included, Biden tops Trump by 2 points (43-41%), with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. getting 9%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 2% each. In January, it was Trump who was up by 3 points over Biden, with Kennedy at 7%.\nKennedy receives a bit more of his backing from those who favor Trump (9%) in the 2-way ballot than from Biden (5%).\nBiden won Wisconsin in 2020 by 20,682 votes, less than one percentage point. Trump's 2016 victory was also by less than a point (22,748 votes).\nMore voters trust Trump to do a better job handling immigration (by 13 points) and the economy (+9). Biden is preferred over Trump on abortion (+9), health care (+7), and election integrity (+7). They are rated more evenly on foreign policy (Trump +2) and energy policy (even).\nOn the Middle East, equal numbers think the Biden administration is too supportive of the Israelis (25%) and the Palestinians (24%). Yet the largest share says Biden's support of each is about right (38%) — and they favor him over Trump by 38 points.\nOverall, Wisconsinites feel somewhat positive about their personal finances, as 6 in 10 say their situation is either holding steady (45%) or improving (14%). Both of those groups largely favor Biden, while the 4 in 10 who are falling behind financially go for Trump by a wide margin.\nIn the Congressional ballot test, 46% go for the Democratic candidate in their district and 45% for the Republican. Neither Biden nor Trump is a drain on his party, as 94% of those backing the Congressional Democrat favor Biden and 93% of those supporting the Republican go for Trump.\n\"Data from the 2022 election suggests MAGA candidates ran three to four points worse than non-MAGA Republicans,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts Fox News polls with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"But we're not seeing that ‘Trump tax' so far in the 2024 numbers. Neither are we seeing Biden underperforming other Democrats. It looks like partisans are behaving like partisans.\"\nBy a 5-point margin, more voters think Trump (48%) has the mental soundness to serve effectively as president than Biden (43%). Most Republicans (89%) say Trump has it and most Democrats say Biden does (85%), but independents are 17 points more likely to say Trump is mentally fit.\nThe survey finds 44% approve of Biden's job performance and 55% disapprove — unchanged since January (44-56%). His 48% support in the 2-way race is higher than his approval because 10% of those disapproving of the job he's doing still pick him over Trump.\nNearly two-thirds think Biden was legitimately elected in 2020, and they back him over Trump by 53 points and are twice as likely to approve of the job he's doing (67% approve, 32% disapprove). Among the one-third who say Biden was not legitimately elected, 98% favor Trump in the 2-way race and 98% disapprove of Biden's job performance.\nWisconsin voters are unified when it comes to having a negative opinion of both Biden and Trump. Views of each are net negative by a 10-point margin, as they both receive the same rating: 44% favorable vs 54% unfavorable.\nKennedy's ratings are negative by 13 points, 35% favorable vs. 48% unfavorable. He's viewed much more positively by Republicans (49%) and independents (44%) than Democrats (19%).\nAmong the small segment of so-called double haters (those viewing both Biden and Trump unfavorably), the vote preference splits: Biden 38% vs. Trump 39% % in the two-way ballot test. When third-party candidates are included, they back Kennedy (34%), followed by Biden (21%), Trump (13%), West (10%), and Stein (9%).\nConducted April 11-16, 2024 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,198 Wisconsin registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (174) and cellphones (669) or completed the survey online after receiving a text message (355). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics are representative of the registered voter population.",

            "summary": "Defense attorneys on Monday argued that former President Trump \"is innocent,\" maintaining that he \"had nothing to do\" with the alleged hush money payments that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg argues he orchestrated.\nOpening statements were delivered in the historic and unprecedented criminal trial of the former president on Monday.\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has been charged by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The charges are related to alleged hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all counts. He has blasted the trial as pure politics, a \"political persecution\" and maintains his innocence. The former president, and the first ever to be a defendant in a criminal trial, vowed to \"tell the truth\" if he takes the stand.\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche on Monday said there was nothing illegal done, and argued that Trump was protecting himself against false allegations.\n\"Trump fought back to protect his family, reputation, brand,\" Blanche said. \"And that is not a crime.\"\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo delivered opening statements on Bragg's behalf Monday, saying the case against Trump \"is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover-up.\" Colangelo argued that months after Trump announced his candidacy for president in June 2015, he invited former CEO of American Media Inc. (AMI) David Pecker to Trump Tower for a meeting. His then-attorney and \"fixer\" Michael Cohen was also in the meeting. AMI owned the National Inquirer.\n\"Those three men formed a conspiracy to influence the election,\" Colangelo argued.\nColangelo claimed Cohen paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to \"silence\" her and make sure the public did not learn of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump. Colangelo claimed that after the election, Trump reimbursed Cohen through a series of monthly checks from his businesses but claimed that he disguised those payments as payments for legal services.\nColangelo alleged that Pecker, Cohen and Trump \"conspired to influence the 2016 presidential election,\" and said Pecker would gather harmful information and prevent it from going public. Colangelo alleged he only published flattering stories about Trump and negative stories about opponents.\nColangelo claimed that the men used a practice called \"catch & kill,\" saying they bought damaging information, had the seller of that information sign a non-disclosure agreement, and then blocked the information from being published.\nColangelo said the practice was used three times — once to block a story a former Trump Tower doorman was trying to sell about an alleged out-of-wedlock child. Colangelo said the payment was $30,000. The doorman's story was eventually proven to be untrue.\nThe next payment was to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who claimed a romantic and sexual relationship with Trump. Colangelo alleged that Cohen asked AMI to buy the story. Colangelo said AMI paid McDougal $150,000 in exchange for \"unlimited life rights\" to her story.\nColangelo also alleged there was a payment made of $130,000 to adult film actress Stormy Daniels.\nColangelo said that when it came time to pay Cohen back, Trump \"didn't negotiate the price down — he doubled it.\" Colangelo alleged that his \"willingness to do this shows the importance of hiding the payments\" and alleged \"overall election conspiracy.\"\nColangelo said the payments were made in a series of $35,000 per month in 2017. Colangelo alleged Cohen sent a \"bogus\" invoice for his legal work.\nColangelo also pointed to the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which was revealed weeks before the 2016 election.\n\"This case is about an illegal conspiracy to undermine a presidential election and the steps Trump took to conceal election fraud,\" Colangelo told jurors. \"As you consider the evidence, use common sense, focus on facts, focus on evidence, listen to testimony.\"\nHe added: \"After all evidence is in, we'll speak to you again and explain that evidence leads to only one conclusion — Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.\"\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all counts. Trump defense attorney Todd Blanche then took the floor to deliver the former president's opening statement.\n\"President Trump is innocent,\" Blanche said, arguing that the former president built a large, successful company prior to his presidency. After being elected in 2016, he \"put up a wall between him and his company.\"\nBlanche argued that some of Trump's employees continued to help record personal expenses, and pointed to Cohen, who sent an invoice for $35,000 for legal work.\nBlanche said that invoice was processed and the checks were signed, and said Trump was the only signatory on his personal account.\nBlanche argued that the 34 counts \"are really just 34 pieces of paper,\" pointing to the invoices Cohen sent to Trump Tower, the checks and the ledger entries.\n\"None of this was a crime,\" Blanche said. \"People say that Trump is trying to cover up payments — think…President Trump did not pay Cohen back $130,000. He paid Cohen $420,000.\"\nHe added: \"Would a frugal businessman repay a $130,000 debt to the tune of $420,000?\"\nBlanche said that the $35,000 \"was not a payback.\"\n\"Cohen was Trump's personal attorney,\" Blanche said, noting that Cohen's signature block was labeled at the time \"personal attorney to President Trump.\"\n\"There's nothing fancy about a ledger account,\" Blanche said, adding that Trump \"had nothing to do with the invoice, with the check being generated, or with the entry on the ledger.\"\n\"Trump had nothing to do with the 34 pieces of paper — except that he signed the checks,\" Blanche argued. \"The reality is Trump is not on the hook.\"\nHe added: \"I have a spoiler alert — there is nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy. They put something sinister on it.\" Blanche argued that Cohen paying Daniels \"was not illegal\" and said that entering into a non-disclosure agreement was also not illegal, saying companies \"do that all the time.\"\n\"There is nothing illegal about it,\" Blanche said, arguing that Daniels was attempting to try to embarrass Trump with \"all sorts of allegations\" that could be \"damaging to him and damaging to his family.\"\n\"Trump fought back to protect his family, reputation, brand,\" Blanche said. \"And that is not a crime.\"\nAs for Cohen's allegations, Blanche said Cohen worked as a personal attorney to Trump, and once Trump was elected, wanted a job in the Trump administration.\n\"He didn't get one,\" Blanche said. \"He was loyal for many, many years and defended Trump. But he was also a criminal. He cheated on his taxes, lied to banks, lied about side businesses and, in 2018, he got caught.\"\nCohen, in 2018, pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, making false statements to Congress, making false statements to Congress and tax evasion. He was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\"After getting caught, he made a decision to blame President Trump for all of his problems,\" Blanche said, noting that Cohen was disbarred and is a \"convicted felon\" and a \"convicted perjurer.\"\n\"Cohen was obsessed with Trump,\" Blanche said. \"He's obsessed with President Trump, even to this day.\"\nBlanche added that Cohen goes on social media to rant about Trump and talks about his desire to see the former president go to prison.\n\"Last night, Cohen said he had a mental excitement about this trial,\" Blanche said. \"He cannot be trusted.\"\nBlanche, again, pointed to Cohen's guilty plea to lying under oath.\n\"You cannot make a serious decision about President Trump relying on Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said.\nAs for Stormy Daniels, Blanche reminded that she \"denied having an improper relationship\" with Trump \"in writing.\"\n\"Weeks leading up to 2016, she saw her chance to make a lot of money, and it worked,\" Blanche said, adding that since her name became associated with Trump, she has made \"hundreds of thousands of dollars.\"\nBlanche told the jury that courts have sided with Trump in legal disputes with Daniels.\nBlanche said Daniels \"doesn't know anything\" about the charges, what Cohen wrote on the invoice, or about the checks.\n\"Her testimony, while salacious, does not matter,\" Blanche said.\n\"President Trump is not charged with any conspiracy,\" Blanche continued. \"There is nothing illegal about what happened. This sort of thing happens regularly.\"\nBlanche went on to argue that it \"is not a scheme unless a scheme means something that doesn't matter.\"\n\"Listen to the motivation to sell magazines, if it lines up with ‘catch & kill.' Listen to the evidence, the testimony of Cohen, whether it rings true,\" Blanche said. \"Listen to the folks who still work at Trump Tower, whether that has anything to do with AMI, catch & kill.\"\nHe added: \"You'll reach the conclusion it does not.\"",

            "excerpt": "Former President Trump's trial stemming from the Manhattan DA's probe of alleged hush-money payments ahead of the 2016 presidential election is set to begin Monday with jury selection.",
            "summary": "Former President Trump's trial stemming from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's investigation into alleged hush-money payments ahead of the 2016 presidential election is set to begin Monday with jury selection.\nThe trial in New York City is the first of the election year for the 2024 presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all counts.\nManhattan Judge Juan Merchan is presiding over the trial. Trump's legal team had filed a motion requesting that Merchan be recused from the trial due to his daughter's Democrat-affiliated political work and the judge's alleged \"hostility\" against the 2024 presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\nBragg, last April, charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The charges are related to alleged hush-money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe DA alleged that Trump \"repeatedly and fraudulently falsified New York business records to conceal criminal conduct that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election.\"\n\"During the election, Trump and others employed a ‘catch and kill' scheme to identify, purchase, and bury negative information about him and boost his electoral prospects,\" Bragg alleged in the indictment last year. \"TRUMP then went to great lengths to hide this conduct, causing dozens of false entries in business records to conceal criminal activity, including attempts to violate state and federal election laws.\"\nAccording to New York state law, a charge of falsifying business records in the first degree alleges that the defendant committed a crime of falsifying business records with the intent to defraud. The intent to defraud would be an intent to commit another crime.\nIn 2019, federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York investigated the matter and opted not to charge Trump related to the alleged payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal.\nThe Federal Election Commission also tossed its investigation into the matter in 2021.\nBragg alleged that Trump, from August 2015 to December 2017, \"orchestrated a ‘catch and kill' scheme through a series of payments that he then concealed through months of false business entries.\"\nBragg further alleged that American Media Inc., the parent company of the National Enquirer, paid $30,000 to a former Trump Tower doorman who claimed to have a story about a child whom Trump had out of wedlock.\nThe DA also alleged that American Media Inc. paid $150,000 to a woman who alleged a sexual relationship with Trump. Bragg appeared to refer to McDougal.\nBragg also alleged that Trump \"explicitly directed a lawyer,\" an apparent reference to his former attorney, Michael Cohen, to \"reimburse\" American Media Inc. in cash. He alleged that Cohen, \"12 days before the presidential general election,\" wired $130,000 to an attorney for an adult film actress — an apparent reference to Daniels.\nCohen, in 2019, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years in prison for violating campaign finance laws related to the payments, among other federal charges. Cohen pleaded guilty to arranging the payments but maintains that Trump directed them.\nBragg alleged that after the election, Trump reimbursed Cohen through a series of monthly checks \"first from the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust – created in New York to hold the Trump Organization's assets during TRUMP's presidency – and later from TRUMP's bank account. In total, 11 checks were issued for a phony purpose.\"\n\"Nine of those checks were signed by TRUMP,\" Bragg charged. \"Each check was processed by the Trump Organization and illegally disguised as a payment for legal services rendered pursuant to a non-existent retainer agreement.\"\n\"In total, 34 false entries were made in New York business records to conceal the initial covert $130,000 payment. … Further, participants in the scheme took steps that mischaracterized, for tax purposes, the true nature of the reimbursements.\"\nBragg, who stepped in as district attorney in the middle of the investigation first led by then-DA Cyrus Vance, initially signaled that he would drop the case and not bring charges against Trump. Prosecutors in the office resigned from their posts due to his stance on the matter and launched a public pressure campaign.\nThe trial was set to begin on March 25 but was delayed due to new materials turned over to the prosecution and Trump's defense by the Department of Justice. Those materials were used during the federal investigation into the matter in 2018 and 2019.\nTrump's legal team sought to further delay the case, and even toss it altogether, arguing that the trial should not take place until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the issue of presidential immunity.\nMerchan denied Trump's request and deemed it \"untimely.\"\nLawyers for the presumptive Republican nominee had asked to adjourn the New York trial indefinitely until Trump's immunity claim in his Washington, D.C., election interference case is resolved. The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments this month and issue a ruling in mid-June.\nTrump contends that he is immune from prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office. His lawyers argue that some of the evidence and alleged acts in the hush-money case overlap with his time in the White House and constitute official acts.\nAn appeals court upheld Merchan's denial.\nMeanwhile, Merchan, who the Trump legal team has argued should recuse himself from the case, granted Bragg's request and imposed a gag order on the former president and 2024 presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\nTrump's lawyers have said Merchan's daughter, Loren Merchan, \"has a direct financial interest in these proceedings by virtue of her ownership stake and leadership role at Authentic Campaigns, Inc.\" They said she \"services exclusively Democrat clients\" and is the \"#21 ranked vendor in the country in connection with the 2024 election.\"\n\"In 2019, Ms. Merchan made public statements during a podcast regarding a conversation with Your Honor that reflect bias against President Trump from both speakers in that exchange,\" Blanche wrote Friday. \"Consistent with that conversation, President Biden and Vice President Harris are long-term clients of Authentic and Ms. Merchan, along with many other politicians and entities who are actively campaigning and advocating against President Trump right now.\"\nTrump's attorney also said that at least six of Authentic's clients \"used fundraising solicitations that referenced this case around the time of the Indictment, President Trump's arraignment, or following the Court's denial of President Trump's recusal motion.\"\nBragg, last year, was the first to indict Trump. His trial is the first of four indictments facing the former president and presumptive nominee.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to the charges in all four cases against him – one led by Bragg; two led by Special Counsel Jack Smith; and one led by Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis.",

While the Democratic incumbent is holding events in the battleground state, his 2024 opponent, Donald Trump, is forced to spend the day in a New York City courtroom for the first ever criminal trial of a former president.\nBiden plans to use Scranton, a working class city of roughly 75,000 people, as the backdrop to pitch his new tax plan. His travels through Pennsylvania overlap with the start of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's criminal hush money case against Trump.\nDay two of the New York City trial continues with the jury selection at approximately 9:30 a.m. Tuesday. Trump has been charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree relating to alleged hush money payments to Stormy Daniels during his successful 2016 presidential campaign.\nTrump has been ordered to attend the court proceedings Tuesday and every day of the trial. Judge Juan Merchan told Trump that if he fails to be present, a warrant will be issued for his arrest.\nBiden plans to spend Tuesday night in Scranton before continuing to Pittsburgh on Wednesday morning. He is expected to then briefly visit the White House, but intends to return to Pennsylvania on Thursday, with an event in Philadelphia.\nScranton, Biden's first destination, blends the personal and political for Biden as he grew up in a three-story colonial home in the Green Ridge neighborhood. His family later moved to Delaware, the state Biden ultimately represented in the U.S. Senate.\n\"It's hard to draw paths to Biden winning the White House that don't involve Pennsylvania,\" said Daniel Hopkins, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\nHarry Truman, in 1948, was the last Democrat to become president who did not win the state.\nHis opportunity to campaign comes as Trump is sequestered in a courtroom, defending himself against criminal charges. If convicted, Trump could be sentenced to time behind bars.\nTrump pleaded not guilty to all counts last year.\nAs Monday showed, however, the criminal case against the former president continues to struggle against worries that Trump will get a fair trial.\nYesterday afternoon, 96 prospective jurors were sworn in but more than 50 of them were almost immediately excused for admitting they could not serve as impartial jurors.\n\"It's a scam. It's a political witch hunt,\" Trump said after court adjourned Monday.\nJudge Juan Merchan, who Trump has repeatedly criticized as being partisan and serving the interest of Democrats, addressed Trump directly before calling the prospective jurors into the courtroom.\nThe judge told Trump that if he fails to be present, a warrant will be issued for his arrest. Judge Merchan also told Trump that he has a right to be present at the trial, but that if he disrupts the proceedings he would be removed. Trump nodded after hearing the instructions.\nJudge Merchan denied Trump's request to be excused from the trial next Thursday, after the president expressed he wanted to attend arguments at the Supreme Court about presidential immunity. The judge has not yet ruled on whether the trial will be adjourned so Trump can attend his son Barron's high school graduation.\nBefore jury selection began, Judge Merchan again denied the defense's request to recuse himself.\nJudge Merchan also set a hearing for next Tuesday, April 23 to discuss possible sanctions for Trump violating the gag order.",

Pundits on MSNBC mocked Trump, Monday, with Chris Hayes calling the court proceedings \"sheer psychological torture\" for the former president and Jen Psaki commenting that Trump appeared \"small\" and \"rough.\"\nLARA TRUMP: These people are so deranged and they're completely disconnected, obviously, from the people of this country. They only stand to exist in their own echo chambers. That's the only reason they are talking. And their obsession with Donald Trump is actually preventing them from understanding that it's not Donald Trump that's truly on trial here, it is our very democracy. Because yes, it is Donald Trump today that you will see sitting in a courtroom for this completely meritless clown show of a show trial. But the implications of this are far deeper for this country, because if in America we are able to just manipulate the law when convenient, if we allow violent criminals to go free and prosecute the innocent, if they are willing to thwart the will of the American people and try to remove our choice for president of the United States, then the fabric of this country is irreparably damaged. I want to tell everybody something out there. It is not working. The people of America spoke up yesterday in support of Donald Trump, to the tune of a million and a half dollars raised for his campaign. The average donation was $28. So even here in the abysmal Biden economy, people are coming out and they are financially supporting this president.\nFormer President Donald Trump began the second day of the hush money trial in New York City railing against the case and its \"conflicted\" judge, whom the 45th president called a \"Trump-hating judge.\"\n\"We have a Trump-hating judge. We have a judge who shouldn't be on this case. He's totally conflicted. But this is a trial that should never happen. It should have been thrown out a long time ago,\" Trump said Tuesday before heading into the courtroom, referring to Judge Juan Merchan.\n\"It's a trial that is being looked upon and looked at all over the world. … They're looking at, analyzing it. Every legal pundit, every legal scholar said this trial is a disgrace,\" he added.\nTrump arrived at court in Lower Manhattan for day two of a trial that is anticipated to last at least six weeks as he battles 34 charges of falsifying business records. Jury selection will continue Tuesday, a task that is anticipated to last at least a week.",

            "summary": "Donald Trump wants as much media coverage as possible of his first criminal trial.\nHow surprising is that, given that his campaign says he raised $1.5 million after the trial's first day?\nCNN reports that Trump wants his surrogates \"blanketing the airwaves,\" and that at least four VP contenders have argued his case on air or on social media: Elise Stefanik, J.D. Vance, Tim Scott and Doug Burgum – making this a tryout of sorts.ISRAEL'S SUCCESS, IRAN'S FAILURE AND THE CHANCES OF IGNITING THE MIDEAST POWDER KEG\nBut the most important takeaway from the trial's first two days is that prosecutors want to portray him as a playboy and a womanizer.\nNews flash: Is there anyone on the planet that doesn't already know that? Isn't that baked into the judicial cake?\nManhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg, who's already been criticized for bringing a thin and highly partisan case, argues that his approach will illuminate Trump's motives in steering hush money payments to Stormy Daniels.\nEach day, news outlets from around the world camp out early outside the dingy Lower Manhattan courthouse and, with only sketches from inside the courtroom, report on what's happening through their filter. It is, after all, the first criminal proceeding against a former president, and a conviction, in a borough very unfriendly to Trump, could mean a jail sentence.\nBut the need for something catchy caught fire when Maggie Haberman of the New York Times reported that Trump briefly nodded off, his chin hitting his chest. Trump denounced the story as fake news and Haberman says he later glared at her for several long seconds.\nAs he has done with previous civil cases, Trump denounced the trial, and Judge Juan Merchan, as a travesty and election interference. One thing is true: Bragg's predecessor, Cy Vance Jr., passed on the case, as did federal investigators, and Bragg himself declined to bring charges before reviving the case many months later. He stretched what would have been a misdemeanor – falsifying hush money business records – into the lowest class of New York felony.\nAnd Bragg won election by vowing to go after Trump.IS OUR FIERCELY TRIBAL POLITICS JUST A DISTORTION OF REALITY?\nIn court, the D.A.'s office asked that the gag order be enforced because of Trump's continued attacks on star witness/convicted felon Michael Cohen, and the judge's daughter, who works for Democratic candidates.\nThat didn't stop Trump from asking for a day off from court to attend his son Barron's high school graduation and saying Merchan \"likely\" wouldn't grant the request.\nTrump has made these trials part of his campaign, and this one is no exception, as he unloads to the assembled media mob before and after the proceedings, and sometimes during breaks.\nOn the prosecutors' efforts to fill the testimony with salacious detail, the judge has issued mixed rulings.\nMerchan will not allow accusations against Trump by women from his past, calling these \"rumors.\"\nHe also will not allow the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which Trump boasted of grabbing women by their genitals, to be played, but said prosecutors could talk about it.\nIn light of the National Enquirer's central role, since Cohen passed the $130,000 in hush money to Stormy at the end of the 2016 campaign through the tabloid, then owned by Trump pal David Pecker, the judge said that Karen McDougal, a Playboy playmate, could testify. In another catch-and-kill case, she was paid $150,000 to write a fitness column for another of Pecker's magazines as long as she didn't talk about Trump.\nDaniels says she had a single sexual encounter with Trump; McDougal maintains they had a 10-month affair filled with love. Trump has denied both accounts.\nThat brings us to jury selection.\nWhen the first group of 96 potential jurors was brought in Monday, 50 said they had such strong feelings about Trump that they could not be objective.\nMore made the same claim yesterday, but when both sides got to question the jury pool, some members were not owning up to their anti-Trump sentiments.\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche confronted one such person about a Facebook post applauding Trump losing a court case about his travel ban and said, \"get him out and lock him up.\" The judge dismissed him for cause.\nAnother person, asked about an old social media post involving an anti-Trump video, which the potential juror said was only \"reposted.\" Merchan booted this person as well.SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\nBy day's end, six jurors had been seated.\nThere was another clash in court yesterday when the judge said Trump was saying something to one of the jurors.\n\"Your client was audibly uttering…I will not have any jurors intimidated in the court,\" Merchan told Trump's lawyer.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nJust two days in and we're basically mired in jury selection. Trump doesn't need to worry about attracting lots of media coverage, as we're already at saturation levels.",

            "summary": "Jury selection in former President Trump's historic and unprecedented criminal trial stemming from charges brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is expected to resume Thursday morning.\nBragg has charged Trump, the 2024 presumptive Republican presidential nominee, with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The charges are related to alleged hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all counts. He has blasted the trial as pure politics, a \"political persecution,\" and maintains his innocence. The former president is expected to testify during his trial.\n\"I tell the truth,\" Trump said last week, when asked about his possible testimony.\nTrump is the first president in United States history to stand criminal trial.\nBy the end of jury selection on Tuesday, seven jurors had been selected and sworn in. The jury pool so far includes four men and three women, all living in New York City. Their professions include law, finance, nursing, technology and more.\nCourt will not meet for the trial on Wednesdays, and the third day of jury selection is expected to begin at 9:30 a.m. in Lower Manhattan.\nTuesday, the second day of the trial, brought a filing from Bragg, who argued that Trump should be held in contempt of court for violating the gag order imposed upon him by Judge Juan Merchan, who is presiding over the trial.\nBragg and prosecutors are arguing that Trump must pay a $1,000 fine each for three alleged violations of the gag order, with all relating to social media posts.\nIn the motion, Bragg urged the judge to warn Trump that \"future violations\" of the gag order can be punished \"not only with additional fines, but also with a term of incarceration of up to thirty days.\"\nBut after sitting in a courtroom for more than eight hours of jury selection Tuesday evening, Trump made a campaign stop at Sanaa Convenience Store in Harlem. Trump was met by a large crowd chanting \"Trump, Trump, Trump,\" \"Four more years\" and \"We love Trump.\" The crowd was singing the national anthem.\nThe visit was intended to highlight rising crime in New York City under Bragg's watch.\nTrump blasted the trial and charges against him, saying it is \"rigged,\" \"all politics\" and \"coming out of the [President Biden's] White House.\"\n\"It makes me campaign locally, and that's OK,\" Trump said. \"We're doing better now than we've ever done, so I think it's having a reverse effect.\"\n\"We're going to come in – No. 1, you have to stop crime, and we're going to let the police do their job. They have to be given back their authority. They have to be able to do their job,\" Trump said. \"And we're going to come into New York. We're making a big play for New York, other cities, too. But this city, I love this city.\"\nTrump said New York has \"gotten so bad in the last three years, four years.\"\n\"And we're going to straighten New York out. So, running for president, we're putting a big hit in New York; we could win New York,\" he said.\n\"They want to keep me off the campaign trail,\" Trump said. \"But based on what I'm doing, I think there's more press here than if I went out to some [other] location.\"\nAs for crime in New York City, Trump said, \"It's Alvin Bragg's fault. Alvin Bragg does nothing. He goes after guys like Trump who did nothing wrong. Violent criminals, murderers? They know there are … hundreds of murders all over the city. They know who they are. They don't pick them up. They go after Trump.\"\nHe added, \"The people of New York are not going to take it. That's why they're going to vote for Trump.\"",

Kennedy Jr. at 13%, Green Party candidate Jill Stein at 3% and independent progressive Cornell West at 2%.\nAmong likely voters, it's Trump 42%, Biden 41%, Kennedy 12%, Stein 3% and West 1%.\nWisconsin — which Democrats carried in presidential elections from 1988 through 2012 — was part of the party's so-called ‘blue wall.'\nBut eight years ago, Trump topped Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by a razor-thin margin to win the state. But four years later, Wisconsin was one of six battleground states that Biden narrowly carried over Trump to win the White House.\nThe poll indicates Biden topping Trump 97%-3% among Democrats, with Trump holding a 91%-9% lead among Republicans.\n\"Independents lean substantially to Trump in this month's survey, with 59% for Trump and 41% voting for Biden,\" a release from the Marquette Law School Poll highlights.\nThe poll also notes, \"In the five-way ballot test, Kennedy takes more votes from Republicans than from Democrats and an especially large share from independents. Stein and West take more votes from Democrats than from Republicans.\"\nAccording to the survey, Trump enjoys the advantage when it comes to enthusiasm. Respondents who said they were very enthusiastic about voting supported Trump over Biden 59%-41%.\nThe president campaigned in Wisconsin last month, with Trump stopping in the state earlier this month.\nWisconsin is also one of a handful of states that will determine if Republicans can win back the Senate majority.\nThe poll indicates Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin leads Republican challenger Eric Hovde 52%-47% among registered voters. But the survey suggests the race is deadlocked at 50% among likely voters.\nThe Marquette Law School poll questioned 814 registered voters, with an overall sampling error of plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.",

So running for president, we're putting a big hit in New York – we could win New York,\" Trump said.\nTrump said that \"half a million migrants were brought in to take over the parks, they took over your hotels, they take over everything.\"\n\"They've destroyed so many people. The African-American community now is not getting jobs. Migrants are taking their jobs that are here illegally. Hispanics are not getting jobs. Migrants are taking the jobs,\" Trump said. \"If you look at the unemployment, the unemployment is good for migrants. Now, it went up 10%. All migrants. And they're in our country now. They're coming from prisons. I don't know where you know, they come from mental institutions. They come from prisons. They come from places you don't want to know about.\"\nTrump, shifting back to his historic criminal trial, again said it is a \"Biden trial.\" \"They want to keep me off the campaign trail,\" Trump said. \"But based on what I'm doing, I think there's more press here than if I went out to some [other] location.\" Trump, pointing to law enforcement, said \"the police have to be able to do their job.\"\n\"The police in New York are great. They have to be able to do their job. They have to protect these people,\" Trump said.\nAs for crime in New York City, Trump declared: \"It's Alvin Bragg's fault. Alvin Bragg does nothing. He goes after guys like Trump who did nothing wrong. Violent criminals, murderers? They know there are there are hundreds of murders all over the city. They know who they are. They don't pick them up. They go after Trump.\"\nHe added: \"The people of New York are not going to take it. That's why they're going to vote for Trump.\"\nThe bodega Trump visited has become known as the \"Jose Alba bodega\" after the July 2022 incident. Bragg charged Alba with second degree murder. Alba, while working at the bodega, was attacked behind the counter by Austin Simon, who was seen on surveillance video first coming behind the cashier's desk and attacking him. Despite claiming self-defense, Alba was sent to Riker's Island prison and initially given $250,000 bail.\nBragg's office, at the time, faced widespread condemnation for bringing charges against Alba, as footage strongly suggested that Alba grabbed a knife and fatally stabbed his assailant only after he had been attacked first.\nAmong many other supporters, New York City Mayor Eric Adams and former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton had publicly decried the initial charging decision, saying Alba acted in self-defense to thwart what appeared to be either an attempt on his own life or a robbery in progress.\nBragg ultimately dropped the murder charge on July 19, 2022.\nTrump's visit came after he spent the second day in court for jury selection. Seven jurors had been selected. Court is expected to reconvene on Thursday at 9:30 a.m.\nBragg charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. He pleaded not guilty to all charges and maintains that there was no crime and that there should be no trial.",

Politico wrote earlier this year that Biden has referred to Trump as a \"sick f---\" who enjoys watching others suffer. One of the insiders claimed at the time that Biden had recently said, \"What a f---ing a--hole the guy is,\" referring to Trump.\nTrump himself is no stranger to nicknames, frequently using mocking terms to describe both his Republican and Democratic political rivals.

She argued this was driving the MAGA movement.\n\"The socioeconomic disparities are a lot and class resentment is a lot and anti-intellectualism and elitism is what is driving many of these anti-establishment — which are Trump voters — so, I think that is a huge problem that we have to address,\" Couric said.\nShe went on to double down on her argument that class resentment and jealousy drove voters to support Trump.\n\"I mean globalization and the transition from an industrial to a technological society — I don't know if you've ever been jealous of someone else or resentful — it is such a corroding and bitter, almost bile feeling,\" she told Maher.\n\"I think that when people who are really struggling see people who have everything, and are on top of that, looking down on them, it is just a recipe for such anger and resentment and grievance,\" she continued.\nHowever, Maher pushed back on Couric's argument, suggesting that Trump voters had legitimate complaints about Democrats, bringing up the border hypocrisy of sanctuary city leaders.\nMaher also said he was \"bored\" with the media's negative treatment of Trump and wished they would understand the perspective of the typical Trump voter.\n\"Not to defend Trump, but to defend the people who still vote for him. Because what they see on the other side, to them, is even more dangerous. Because it's closer to home,\" he said, referencing gender ideology in schools and anti-Trump sentiment in the media.\n\"Those kind of things are what they say, 'That's why I'm voting for Trump,'\" Maher added. \"'We don't like him but he's all that stands between us and madness,' That's their view. I would like that view presented [by the media].\"",

            "excerpt": "Fox News Digital compiled the most dramatic moments of former President Trump's hush money trial, including him slamming the trial as 'political persecution.'",
            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump's hush money trial kicked off Monday, where he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.\nThe historical trial began with jury selection, where a pool of more than 500 potential jurors will be peppered with questions to determine if they can fairly weigh in on the charges.\nThe case revolves around payments made by Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to former pornographic actor Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. The $130,000 payment was to allegedly quiet her claims of an alleged extramarital affair she had with Trump in 2006.\nTrump has denied the affair and pleaded not guilty to the charges.\nProsecutors say reimbursements from the Trump Organization to Cohen were falsely recorded as legal expenses. Falsifying business records is a misdemeanor, and prosecutors are working to prove that Trump falsified records with an intent to commit or conceal a second crime, which is a felony.\nThe trial overall is anticipated to last at least six weeks.\nThe first day was action-packed, including Trump sounding off that the case was \"political persecution.\"\nTrump was seen leaving Trump Tower early Monday morning, heading to Manhattan Criminal Court where he addressed the press and railed against the case and its charges.\n\"Nothing like this has ever happened before,\" Trump said at the courthouse Monday ahead of the trial officially beginning. \"This is political persecution ... it's a case that should have never been brought.\"\n\"This is an assault on America and that's why I'm very proud to be here,\" he added.\nTrump has repeatedly slammed the trial and charges, including in Pennsylvania on Saturday, where he held his last scheduled campaign rally ahead of the trial officially beginning.\n\"I will be forced to sit fully gagged. I'm not allowed to talk. They want to take away my constitutional right to talk,\" Trump said in Pennsylvania.\n\"I'm proud to do it for you,\" he continued, calling the trial a \"communist show trial,\" which he claims is orchestrated by the Biden administration. \"Have a good time watching.\"\nThe district attorney's office argued Monday that Trump has violated a gag order three times in social media posts and should pay $1,000 for each violation.\nPresiding Judge Juan Merchan had imposed a gag order on Trump earlier this month that prevents him from making public statements about witnesses and their anticipated testimony in the trial.\n\"The defendant is aware of the April 1 order. We know that from various posts he had made,\" said prosecutor Christopher Conroy before Merchan's ruling.\n\"We think it is important for the court to remind Mr. Trump is a criminal defendant,\" Conroy added.\nTrump's legal team pushed back that the 45th president was defending himself from \"salacious, repeated, vehement attacks by these witnesses.\"\nMerchan announced he will hear arguments on whether Trump violated the order on April 23, before making a decision on the matter. The defense team has until April 19 to file a written response to the prosecutors' claims Trump violated the gag order.\nMerchan doubled down Monday on his previous decision that the jury not be shown the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which surfaced ahead of the 2016 election and shows Trump boasting to host Billy Bush that he could kiss and grope women due to his star power.\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass urged the court to include evidence surrounding the video, which he said is an \"admission of sexual assault\" and \"living proof that the defendant wasn't all talk.\"\n\"That is more than just comments of a sexual nature,\" Steinglass said, adding that when the video surfaced in 2016, it threw Trump's presidential campaign into a \"tailspin.\"\nMerchan had previously denied the prosecution from showing the tape to jurors, saying in March, \"it is not necessary that the tape itself be introduced into evidence or that it be played for the jury.\"\nTrump's attorney said the video is prejudicial and should not be aired to the jurors.\n\"The people will get everything they need to prove the charges in this case from what your honor has already ruled,\" attorney Todd Blanche said.\nProsecutors can introduce Trump's exact words from the video, as well as an email related to the tape, but Merchan said the video itself cannot be shown to jurors.\nThe trial in Lower Manhattan, which will not be televised from the courtroom, attracted a massive media presence on Monday.\nVideo footage shot outside the courtroom shows a long line of journalists staged in front of cameras along at least one block in the Big Apple.\nTrump's trial marks the first time a former president will stand trial on criminal charges. The hush money case is also the first of four criminal cases Trump is expected to face this year while juggling the campaign trail as the presumptive Republican Party's presidential nominee.\nMerchan on Monday told Trump it was \"too early\" for him to decide whether he can attend the high school graduation of his son, Barron Trump, next month, which sparked criticism from Trump as he departed the courthouse.\n\"Amazing things happened today. As you know, my son is graduating from high school, and it looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation of my son who has worked very, very hard,\" Trump said while leaving the courthouse.\n\"He's a great student, very proud of the fact that he did so well and was looking forward for years to have graduation with his mother and father there. It looks like the judge isn't going to allow me to escape this scam. It's a scam trial,\" he continued.\nTrump's defense team had asked the judge for a few scheduling exceptions, including a few days over Passover, as well as his son's high school graduation on May 17.\n\"It really depends on if we are on time and where we are in the trial,\" Merchan said Monday.\nTrump, in his remarks leaving the courthouse, also railed that he will not be permitted to travel to Washington, D.C., next week, when the Supreme Court will hear arguments regarding whether Trump is immune from prosecution in Special Counsel Jack Smith's election interference case.\n\"In addition, as you know, next Thursday, we're before the United States Supreme Court in a very big hearing on immunity. And this is something that we've been waiting for a long time. And the judge, of course, is not going to allow us, he is a very conflicted judge, and he's not going to allow us to go to that,\" he said.\nThe hush money case will resume Tuesday morning with continued jury selection.",

            "summary": "The second day of jury selection in former President Trump's Manhattan criminal trial is expected to begin Tuesday after half of prospective jurors were excused Monday for saying they could not be impartial toward the presumptive Republican nominee.\nCourt is expected to begin again for the second day of Trump's trial at 9:30 a.m. and will resume with jury selection.\nThe trial comes after Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg charged the former president with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree related to alleged hush money payments made before the 2016 presidential election.\nTrump pleaded not guilty to all counts last year.\n\"It's a scam. It's a political witch hunt,\" Trump said after court adjourned Monday.\nProspective jurors were asked to answer 42 questions from a questionnaire that reviews the individual's work history, political affiliation and what media they chose to watch and listen to.\nBut more than 50 of the original 96 prospective jurors were excused almost immediately for admitting they could not serve as impartial jurors. Several were excused due to other issues.\nNew York Judge Juan Merchan is presiding over the trial, despite Trump's request to have him recuse himself due to his alleged hostility toward the former president and due to his daughter's work with Democrat politicians.\nMerchan, from the bench on Monday, said there was \"no basis\" for him to recuse himself.\nThe judge later addressed the former president directly, telling him that he has a right to be present at the trial each day to assist in his defense.\nMerchan warned the former president that if he disrupts proceedings in any way, he would be held in contempt and could be removed from the court. Merchan also said that if Trump is required to appear and fails to do so, a warrant would be issued for his arrest.\nTrump did not verbally respond but nodded in agreement with the judge.\nThe trial is expected to last for approximately six weeks. The court will not meet on Wednesdays and will not meet on Monday, April 29.\nAfter jurors were excused for the day, Merchan rejected a defense request that Trump be excused from the trial next Thursday to attend arguments at the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe high court is hearing arguments on April 25 on the issue of presidential immunity and on whether Trump is immune from prosecution in Special Counsel Jack Smith's election interference case.\n\"Arguing before the Supreme Court is a big deal, and I can certainly appreciate why your client would want to be there, but a trial in New York Supreme Court … is also a big deal,\" Merchan said, rebuffing Trump lawyer Todd Blanche's request.\nMerchan added, \"I will see him here next week.\"\nTrump also requested to attend the high school graduation ceremony for his son, Barron Trump, on May 17. Merchan has not yet decided on whether the former president can be present to celebrate his son.\n\"It looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation of my son who's worked very, very hard,\" Trump said after court adjourned Monday. \"He's a great student, and he's very proud of the fact that he did so well and was looking forward for years to have graduation with his mother and father there. And it looks like the judge isn't going to allow me to escape this scam; it's a scam trial.\"\nMeanwhile, Merchan had imposed a gag order on Trump last month due to his \"prior extrajudicial statements.\" Merchan said they established \"a sufficient risk to the administration of justice.\"\nMerchan ordered that Trump cannot make or direct others to make public statements about witnesses concerning their potential participation or about counsel in the case — other than Bragg — or about court staff, DA staff or family members of staff.\nMerchan also ordered that Trump cannot make or direct others to make public statements about any prospective juror or chosen juror.\nIn court Monday, prosecutors from Bragg's office argued that Trump had violated his gag order on three separate occasions on social media. Prosecutors said Trump should be fined $3,000 for the three alleged violations of the gag order – $1,000 for each violation.\n\"The defendant is aware of the April 1 order. We know that from various posts he had made,\" said prosecutor Christopher Conroy.\n\"We think it is important for the court to remind Mr. Trump is a criminal defendant,\" Conroy added, flagging that Trump might have again violated the gag order Monday morning while attending court.\nBlanche argued that the three posts highlighted by prosecutors did not violate the gag order.\n\"He is responding to salacious, repeated, vehement attacks by these witnesses,\" Blanche said.\nMerchan said he will hear arguments on whether Trump violated the gag order on April 23 at 9:30 a.m.\nBragg, last April, charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The charges are related to alleged hush money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe DA alleged that Trump \"repeatedly and fraudulently falsified New York business records to conceal criminal conduct that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election.\"\nAccording to New York state law, a charge of falsifying business records in the first degree alleges that the defendant committed a crime of falsifying business records with the intent to defraud. The intent to defraud would be an intent to commit another crime.\nIn 2019, federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York investigated the matter and opted not to charge Trump related to the alleged payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal.\nThe Federal Election Commission also tossed its investigation into the matter in 2021.",

It's a case that should have never been brought.\"\n\"This is an assault on America and that's why I'm very proud to be here,\" Trump added. \"This is really an attack on a political opponent.\"\nThe trial began with jury selection, where a pool of more than 500 potential jurors will be asked a series of questions to determine if they can fairly assess the case. The potential jurors will be dismissed until a pool of 12 jurors, as well as a handful of alternates, are selected. The jury selection process is anticipated to last at least a week.\nTrump's legal team said Monday that the 45th president wants to be present for each interview, which Merchan acknowledged but said would likely be tricky due to Trump's Secret Service presence.",

            "excerpt": "NBC News' Steve Kornacki sounded the alarm on some \"troubling\" poll results for President Biden on Sunday, which he said showed mental/physical health was a \"clear liability.\"",
            "summary": "NBC News' Steve Kornacki sounded the alarm on the outlet's latest polling, noting some \"troubling numbers\" for President Biden, as he trails former President Trump in several key categories, such as mental and physical health.\nAccording to the NBC News poll, Trump leads Biden among voters in handling a crisis, being competent and effective, dealing with inflation, having the necessary physical and mental health, and having a strong record as president.\n\"Competent and effective, that was President Biden's, the crux of his campaign pitch in 2020,\" host of \"Meet the Press\" Kristen Welker said. Kornacki noted that back in 2020, the numbers were flipped, and voters viewed Biden as being more competent and effective.\nThe poll found 47% of voters view Trump as competent and effective, compared to just 36% who view the president the same way.\n\"Who has the strong record as president? And again, Trump outpacing Biden on that front. And again, you've got to mention this one, too. Necessary mental and physical health. We asked this four years ago. It was a wash. It's now a clear liability for Joe Biden. So these are all troubling numbers for Biden,\" Kornacki said.\nBiden leads Trump in just two categories; his ability to bring the country together and in dealing with abortion. However, Kornacki noted a lot of voters believed neither candidate was better than the other in their ability to bring the country together.\nWelker and Kornacki noted the poll's findings on RFK Jr.'s standing in the election, as many believe Kennedy would spoil the election for Biden and lead to a Trump victory.\nHowever, the poll found with RFK Jr.'s name on the ballot, the hypothetical match-up would fall to Biden.\n\"We show a 46-44 race for Donald Trump,\" Kornacki said, noting the results of the head-to-head match-up with just Biden and Trump. \"But, look what happens when we add RFK's name to the mix. Suddenly, we have a new leader. Joe Biden, 39%, Donald Trump 37%, there's Kennedy getting 13%. We see by a better than two to one margin, it's Trump voters are flipping to Kennedy in this scenario, not Biden voters.\"\nWelker said the results \"defied conventional wisdom.\"\nKornacki compared Biden's job approval, which currently sits at 42%, to past presidents at the same point in their presidency. Biden's 42% approval rating was the lowest among recent presidencies, including Trump's.\nKornacki also noted that voter interest in the 2024 election was the lowest it has been since NBC News started polling the question in 2008.\nPolling in key battleground states shows the race will prove to be very close, as Biden and Trump are currently tied at 48% in Pennsylvania, a Fox News Poll released on Thursday found.\nIn North Carolina, Trump leads Biden by just two percentage points, according to a poll released in early April.",

            "summary": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suggested on a podcast Friday that her old rival, former President Trump, would be happy to \"kill his opposition\" if he's re-elected president.\nClinton made those comments on the \"Democracy Docket\" podcast with host Marc Elias, a Democratic election lawyer who previously served as general counsel on her 2016 presidential campaign. In their conversation, Clinton said Trump models himself after Russian President Vladimir Putin and other dictators, calling the prospect of his return to the White House \"very scary.\"\n\"Trump was like, you know, just gaga over Putin because Putin does what Trump would like to do: Kill his opposition, imprison his opposition, drive journalists and others into exile, rule without any check or balance,\" Clinton said.\n\"That's what Trump really wants,\" she continued. \"And so we have to be very conscious of how he sees the world because, in that world, he only sees strongmen leaders. He sees Putin, he sees Xi, he sees Kim Jong-un in North Korea. Those are the people he is modeling himself after, and we've been down this road in our, you know, world history. We sure don't want to go down that again.\"\nSince her defeat by Trump in the 2016 election, Clinton has repeatedly claimed that Trump does the bidding of Russia and that Putin interfered in the election to ensure her defeat. She has predicted that if Trump defeats Biden in November, he will attempt to withdraw the U.S. from NATO and rule as an authoritarian in the U.S.\n\"My view, having negotiated with Putin, and knowing one of the reasons he went after me is because he knew I would deal with him in an appropriate way, and Trump would basically do whatever he wanted, it's really important to think about what could happen to our world with Trump back in the White House,\" Clinton told Elias in Friday's podcast.\n\"Withdrawing us from NATO, not caring about what happens with Europe … The idea that he wants Ukraine to fail. The idea that he doesn't want us to be able to surveil our enemies. This is a very scary prospect,\" she said, referencing some Republican opposition to the Ukraine aid bill moving through Congress and the FISA surveillance reauthorization legislation that Trump opposed.\nFox News Digital reached out to Clinton's office for clarification on her remarks but did not receive a response before publication. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

The charges are related to alleged hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all counts. He has blasted the trial as pure politics, a \"political persecution\" and maintains his innocence. The former president, the first ever to be a defendant in a criminal trial, vowed to \"tell the truth\" if he takes the stand.\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche on Monday said there was nothing illegal done, and he argued that Trump was protecting himself against false allegations.\n\"Trump fought back to protect his family, reputation, brand,\" Blanche said. \"And that is not a crime.\"\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo delivered opening statements on Bragg's behalf Monday, saying the case against Trump \"is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover-up.\" Colangelo argued that months after Trump announced his candidacy for president in June 2015, he invited former CEO of American Media Inc. (AMI) David Pecker to Trump Tower for a meeting. His then-attorney and \"fixer\" Michael Cohen was also at the meeting. AMI owned the National Inquirer.\n\"Those three men formed a conspiracy to influence the election,\" Colangelo argued.\nColangelo claimed Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 to \"silence\" her and make sure the public did not learn of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump. Colangelo claimed that after the election, Trump reimbursed Cohen through a series of monthly checks from his businesses but claimed that he disguised those payments as payments for legal services.\nColangelo alleged that Pecker, Cohen and Trump \"conspired to influence the 2016 presidential election,\" and said Pecker would gather harmful information and prevent it from going public. Colangelo alleged he only published flattering stories about Trump and negative stories about opponents.\nColangelo claimed that the men used a practice called \"catch & kill,\" saying they bought damaging information, had the seller of that information sign a non-disclosure agreement and then blocked the information from being published.\nColangelo said the practice was used three times — once to block a story a former Trump Tower doorman was trying to sell about an alleged out-of-wedlock child. Colangelo said the payment was $30,000. The doorman's story was eventually proven to be untrue.\nThe next payment was to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who claimed a romantic and sexual relationship with Trump. Colangelo alleged that Cohen asked AMI to buy the story. Colangelo said AMI paid McDougal $150,000 in exchange for \"unlimited life rights\" to her story.\nColangelo also alleged there was a payment made of $130,000 to Daniels.\nColangelo said that when it came time to pay Cohen back, Trump \"didn't negotiate the price down — he doubled it.\" Colangelo alleged that his \"willingness to do this shows the importance of hiding the payments\" and alleged \"overall election conspiracy.\"\nColangelo said the payments were made in a series of $35,000 per month in 2017. Colangelo alleged Cohen sent a \"bogus\" invoice for his legal work.\nColangelo also pointed to the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which was revealed weeks before the 2016 election.\n\"This case is about an illegal conspiracy to undermine a presidential election and the steps Trump took to conceal election fraud,\" Colangelo told jurors. \"As you consider the evidence, use common sense, focus on facts, focus on evidence, listen to testimony.\"\nHe added, \"After all evidence is in, we'll speak to you again and explain that evidence leads to only one conclusion — Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.\"\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all counts. Blanche then took the floor to deliver the former president's opening statement.\n\"President Trump is innocent,\" Blanche said, arguing that the former president built a large, successful company prior to his presidency. After being elected in 2016, he \"put up a wall between him and his company.\"\nBlanche argued that some of Trump's employees continued to help record personal expenses and pointed to Cohen, who sent an invoice for $35,000 for legal work.\nBlanche said that the invoice was processed, and the checks were signed, and said Trump was the only signatory on his personal account.\nBlanche argued that the 34 counts \"are really just 34 pieces of paper,\" pointing to the invoices Cohen sent to Trump Tower, the checks and the ledger entries.\n\"None of this was a crime,\" Blanche said. \"People say that Trump is trying to cover up payments — think…President Trump did not pay Cohen back $130,000. He paid Cohen $420,000.\"\nHe added, \"Would a frugal businessman repay a $130,000 debt to the tune of $420,000?\"\nBlanche said that the $35,000 \"was not a payback.\"\n\"Cohen was Trump's personal attorney,\" Blanche said, noting that Cohen's signature block was labeled at the time \"personal attorney to President Trump.\"\n\"There's nothing fancy about a ledger account,\" Blanche said, adding that Trump \"had nothing to do with the invoice, with the check being generated, or with the entry on the ledger.\"\n\"Trump had nothing to do with the 34 pieces of paper — except that he signed the checks,\" Blanche argued. \"The reality is Trump is not on the hook.\"\nHe added, \"I have a spoiler alert — there is nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy. They put something sinister on it.\" Blanche argued that Cohen paying Daniels \"was not illegal\" and said that entering into a non-disclosure agreement was also not illegal, saying companies \"do that all the time.\"\n\"There is nothing illegal about it,\" Blanche said, arguing that Daniels was attempting to try to embarrass Trump with \"all sorts of allegations\" that could be \"damaging to him and damaging to his family.\"\n\"Trump fought back to protect his family, reputation, brand,\" Blanche said. \"And that is not a crime.\"\nAs for Cohen's allegations, Blanche said Cohen worked as a personal attorney to Trump, and once Trump was elected, wanted a job in the Trump administration.\n\"He didn't get one,\" Blanche said. \"He was loyal for many, many years and defended Trump. But he was also a criminal. He cheated on his taxes, lied to banks, lied about side businesses and, in 2018, he got caught.\"\nCohen, in 2018, pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, making false statements to Congress, making false statements to Congress and tax evasion. He was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\"After getting caught, he made a decision to blame President Trump for all of his problems,\" Blanche said, noting that Cohen was disbarred and is a \"convicted felon\" and a \"convicted perjurer.\"\n\"Cohen was obsessed with Trump,\" Blanche said. \"He's obsessed with President Trump, even to this day.\"\nBlanche added that Cohen goes on social media to rant about Trump and talks about his desire to see the former president go to prison.\n\"Last night, Cohen said he had a mental excitement about this trial,\" Blanche said. \"He cannot be trusted.\"\nBlanche, again, pointed to Cohen's guilty plea to lying under oath.\n\"You cannot make a serious decision about President Trump relying on Michael Cohen,\" Blanche said.\nAs for Daniels, Blanche reminded that she \"denied having an improper relationship\" with Trump \"in writing.\"\n\"Weeks leading up to 2016, she saw her chance to make a lot of money, and it worked,\" Blanche said, adding that since her name became associated with Trump, she has made \"hundreds of thousands of dollars.\"\nBlanche told the jury that courts have sided with Trump in legal disputes with Daniels.\nBlanche said Daniels \"doesn't know anything\" about the charges, what Cohen wrote on the invoice, or about the checks.\n\"Her testimony, while salacious, does not matter,\" Blanche said.\n\"President Trump is not charged with any conspiracy,\" Blanche continued. \"There is nothing illegal about what happened. This sort of thing happens regularly.\"\nBlanche went on to argue that it \"is not a scheme unless a scheme means something that doesn't matter.\"\n\"Listen to the motivation to sell magazines, if it lines up with ‘catch & kill.' Listen to the evidence, the testimony of Cohen, whether it rings true,\" Blanche said. \"Listen to the folks who still work at Trump Tower, whether that has anything to do with AMI, catch & kill.\"\nHe added: \"You'll reach the conclusion it does not.\"",

            "excerpt": "Former President Trump blasted President Biden Monday ahead of opening statements in his New York criminal trial.",
            "summary": "Former President Trump blasted President Biden on Monday ahead of opening statements in his New York criminal trial and said he wants the American people to \"understand\" that his criminal trial is taking place \"for the purposes of hurting the opponent of the worst president in the history of our country.\"\nTrump arrived in court in Manhattan Monday morning before prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office and his defense attorneys deliver their opening statements in the trial.\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has been charged by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The charges are related to alleged hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all counts. He has blasted the trial as pure politics, a \"political persecution\" and maintains his innocence. The former president, and the first ever to be a defendant in a criminal trial, vowed to \"tell the truth\" if he takes the stand.\n\"I just want to say before we begin — these are all Biden trials,\" Trump said before opening statements were delivered Monday. \"This is done as election interference. Everybody knows it.\"\n\"I'm here instead of being able to be in Pennsylvania and Georgia and lots of other places campaigning, and it's very unfair. Fortunately, the poll numbers are very good,\" Trump continued. \"They've been going up because people understand what's going on.\"\nTrump again blasted the case as a \"witch hunt,\" and said its impetus is in Washington.\n\"It's in coordination with Washington — everything — including the DA's office,\" Trump said. \"I just want people to understand that this is done for the purposes of hurting the opponent of the worst president in the history of our country.\"\nTrump has argued that the cases against him in all jurisdictions — Bragg's; Special Counsel Jack Smith's election interference charges; Smith's classified records charges; and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' charges — have been brought against him for the purposes of election interference and in coordination with President Biden.\nTrump attorney Will Scharf told Fox News Channel on Sunday that the case should never have been brought, and that the facts are on his client's side.\n\"While the prosecution and the media are hell-bent on sensationalizing this case, we're focusing on the facts because the facts show that President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong,\" Scharf said. \"This is a business records case, those business records accurately reflected payments to one of President Trump's lawyers as legal retainer fees. Additionally, those records weren't actually entered by President Trump. He was busy running the country from the White House while all this was happening in Trump Tower in New York.\"\nShifting from Bragg's case and charges against him, Trump on Monday morning also pointed to New York Attorney General Letitia James' case, in which he was forced to post a $175 million bond and found liable for fraud by New York Judge Arthur Engoron after a months-long civil trial without a jury.\n\"[Letitia James] campaigned on the fact that ‘I will get Trump. I'm going to get Trump,'\" Trump said, pointing to James' campaign videos.\nTrump said James had a problem with the bond company he used and is arguing in court Monday that \"she doesn't know the collateral is good.\"\n\"I put up 175 billion in cash and she's questioning the bonding company,\" Trump said. \"Well, when you put up cash and the number is 175, which is what we're supposed to be putting up, but I give it in cash. She shouldn't be complaining about the bonding company.\"\nTrump added that \"nobody is going to be putting up with this.\"\n\"Nobody is going to be listening or coming to New York anymore — business are going to be fleeing because people are treated so badly — it's got to be the most unfriendly place to do business,\" Trump said. \"And that's why businesses are leaving and people are leaving as migrants come in and take over our parks and our schools and everything else.\"\nLawyers for James are arguing Monday that the court should void Trump's $175 million bond in his civil fraud case, questioning whether Knight Specialty Insurance, the company who fronted Trump's bond, could pay the bond if they had to.\nIf the judge sides with James' office, Trump will need to file a new bond. James wants to give Trump seven days to file that new bond, if the ruling is in her favor.\nThe decision will be left, again, to Judge Arthur Engoron.\nTrump, on Monday, blasted James as \"the worst attorney general in this country,\" and slammed Judge Engoron as an \"extremely crazed judge who is the most overturned judge in New York State.\"\nAs for criminal trial stemming from Bragg's investigation, Trump said: \"It's a very, very sad day in America, I can tell you that.\"\nThe former president is subject to a gag order in Bragg's criminal case, which Judge Juan Merchan imposed upon him last month before the trial began. Merchan ordered that Trump cannot make or direct others to make public statements about witnesses concerning their potential participation or about counsel in the case — other than Bragg — or about court staff, DA staff or family members of staff.\nMerchan also ordered that Trump cannot make or direct others to make public statements about any prospective juror or chosen juror. But on Saturday, he let loose with an all-caps rant on his social media platform.\n\"THIS SCAM ‘RUSHED' TRIAL TAKING PLACE IN A 95% DEMOCRAT AREA IS A PLANNED AND COORDINATED WITCH HUNT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT 8 YEARS AGO, BUT EVERYBODY PASSED,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.",

            "excerpt": "Fox News poll shows registered voters show Trump ahead of Biden by three points in Michigan, a shift from Biden's strong lead ahead of the 2020 election",
            "summary": "Four years ago this month — in the early lockdown stages of the coronavirus pandemic — Joe Biden led Donald Trump by 8 points among Michigan voters in a head-to-head presidential matchup. Today, they prefer Trump by 3 points.\nA new Fox News survey of Michigan registered voters finds President Biden receives 46% support to former President Trump's 49%. That's within the margin of sampling error. In February, it was 45% Biden — 47% Trump. In April 2020, Biden was at 49% to Trump's 41%.\nTrump's advantage is mainly due to a 19-point lead among men. He is also the favorite among White men without a college degree (by 33 points), rural voters (+23), voters under age 35 (+16), and White voters (+13). Plus, he is helped by a 4-point edge among independents as well as garnering a bit more support among Republicans (94%) than Biden gets among Democrats (92%).\nBiden's best groups include Black voters (+56), urban voters (+27), suburban women (+21), and voters ages 65 and over (+14).\nSince February, Trump is up 5 points among men, and while Biden has made similar gains among Black voters (+7), his 75% support among Blacks is about 20 points below where it was when he won Michigan in 2020.\nVoters living in union households go for Biden by 12 points, while the much larger non-union segment backs Trump by 7.\nTrump retains more of his 2020 voters, with 95% still supporting him compared to 90% of Biden's 2020 voters backing him.\nIn a potential 5-way race, Trump is ahead of Biden by 42%-40%, with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. receiving 9%, and Jill Stein and Cornel West at 2% each. It was announced Thursday that Kennedy will appear on the ballot in Michigan in November.\nBiden won Michigan by less than three percentage points in 2020. Ninety-six percent of Democrats voted for him, but fewer of them today, 83%, approve of the job he is doing.\nThe president's overall job rating stands at 43% approve and 56% disapprove. Some 11% of those disapproving of Biden's job performance still prefer him over Trump in the matchup.\nMichiganders have mixed views of Biden's approach to the Israel and Hamas war in Gaza, with 24% saying he is too supportive of the Israelis, 21% too supportive of the Palestinians, and 40% about right. Democrats (33%) and independents (22%) are more likely than Republicans (15%) to think Biden is too supportive of the Israelis -- and that shows up in the presidential vote preference. More than one-third of those saying Biden is too close to Israel back Trump (35%), the highest of the four battleground states where Fox News conducted surveys this week (Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin).\nJust over half of Michigan voters are either getting ahead financially or holding steady and those voters choose Biden, while just under half are falling behind and they go big for Trump.\nMore voters trust Trump by wide margins on some of the major issues of the campaign — immigration (+15 points), the economy (+11 points), and foreign policy (+8), while Biden is more narrowly preferred on election integrity (+6), health care (+6), and abortion (+5). The two are trusted about evenly on energy policy (Trump +2).\nBy a 9-point margin, more think Trump (49%) has the mental fitness to serve effectively as president than Biden (40%). Some 22% of Democrats think Biden lacks the metal soundness to serve. That's more than twice the number of Republicans who say the same about Trump (10%).\nMajorities of voters under age 35 disapprove of Biden (63%), think he lacks the mental fitness to serve (68%), trust Trump to handle the economy (61%), and favor Trump in the head-to-head ballot (+16 points).\nOverall, more voters view Biden negatively than positively by 16 points (41% favorable, 57% unfavorable). Trump's personal rating is also in negative territory but by a narrower 8 points (45-53%). Kennedy is underwater by 3 (39-42%), with one in five unable to rate him (19%).\nForty-six percent of voters say they would back the Republican candidate for Congress in their district, while 43% prefer the Democrat. Almost all of those backing the Democratic candidate go for Biden (92%) and most of those favoring the Republican candidate back Trump (93%).\nConducted April 11-16, 2024 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,126 Michigan registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (186) and cellphones (653) or completed the survey online after receiving a text message (287). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sample error of ±3 percentage points. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics of respondents are representative of the registered voter population.",

It's a political witch hunt,\" Trump said after court adjourned Monday.\nJudge Juan Merchan, who Trump has repeatedly criticized as being partisan and serving the interest of Democrats, addressed Trump directly before calling the prospective jurors into the courtroom.

Every parent in America, whether they like you or hate you, will go, 'Yeah, I'd have done that, too,'\" Morgan said Monday on \"The Five.\"\nBarron Trump is graduating later this month from Oxbridge Academy in Palm Beach, Fla., while his father is scheduled to appear before Merchan in a New York courtroom 1,200 miles away.\nMorgan, who notably interviewed Trump for Fox Nation in a sometimes tense back-and-forth in 2022, called the case one of \"the most petty, self-harming acts of political suicide I've ever witnessed.\"\nThe \"Piers Morgan: Uncensored' host also called Merchan's case, brought by New York County District Attorney Alvin Bragg, \"utterly ridiculous.\"\nJudge Jeanine Pirro, who held court in neighboring Westchester County and served as its Republican prosecutor for many years, said Merchan can indeed issue a bench warrant for Trump and have him arrested, but left open whether – as Morgan suggested – it would be politically advantageous.\nMorgan went on to call the idea that a former president would be taken to court with a potential 10-year felony sentence over \"potentially, a one-night-stand with a porn star\" completely nonsensical.\n\"Have you lost your minds, America? What a demeaning way to treat a former president. Secondly, if you're on the left, why would you think this would possibly work? Why would you not think that what you're doing here is going to almost guarantee Donald Trump wins the next election?\" he asked.\nFor his part, Trump said Merchan's decision that he cannot attend Barron's graduation or Supreme Court arguments for another case he is involved in are collectively a \"perfect\" ploy to help the \"radical-left Democrats.\"\n\"That's exactly what they want. This is about election interference, that's all,\" he said in remarks following his day in Manhattan court.\nFox News host Jesse Watters added that former President Bill Clinton also made headlines for his 1998 legal settlement with former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones, but did not receive the same scrutiny Trump has.\nJones received an $850,000 payment over her 1991 claim Clinton – then the state's governor – harassed her inside a Little Rock hotel. Jones – one of several Clinton accusers Trump invited as guests to a Missouri debate against the Democrat's wife Hillary during the 2016 race – claimed Clinton exposed himself and made sexual advances.\nAt the time of the settlement, Clinton attorney Robert Bennett said Jones claim was meritless.\nClinton White House Press Secretary Michael McCurry said at the time that Clinton was \"pleased that he has received the vindication he has long awaited.\"\n\"This is a personal expense,\" Watters said of Trump's hush money payment on \"The Five,\" going on to cite Jones' case.\n\"[Clinton] used private money because it was a private matter,\" he said, suggesting Trump did the same.\n\"This is the most corrupt prosecution… And the jury pool is 90% Democrat. And the star witness is a stone-cold felon and a liar,\" he said, referring to former Trump \"fixer\" Michael Cohen.\n\"[T]he jury pool is basically like the O.J. [Simpson] jury pool. You're going to have people trying to wiggle in to that jury and send a message, just like they did with ‘The Juice.'\"\nWatters appeared to agree with Morgan's sentiment regarding the potential threat of arrest for Trump.\n\"If this judge says he can't attend Barron's high school graduation, [Trump] wins in a landslide,\" he said. \"He'll win California if that happens.\"",

            "summary": "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg filed a motion Tuesday to hold former President Trump in contempt of court, claiming he violated the gag order imposed upon him by publishing three social media posts relating to two known witnesses in his criminal trial — Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.\nBragg is urging Manhattan Judge Juan Merchan to also warn Trump that \"future violations\" of the gag order can be punished \"not only with additional fines, but also with a term of incarceration of up to thirty days.\"\nMerchan last month imposed a gag order on Trump, due to his \"prior extrajudicial statements.\" Merchan said they established \"a sufficient risk to the administration of justice.\"\nMerchan ordered that Trump cannot make or direct others to make public statements about witnesses concerning their potential participation or about counsel in the case — other than Bragg — or about court staff, DA staff or family members of staff.\nMerchan also ordered that Trump cannot make or direct others to make public statements about any prospective juror or chosen juror.\nDuring the first day of the criminal trial and start of jury selection, Manhattan prosecutors suggested Trump had violated the order on three separate occasions on social media. Prosecutors said Trump should be fined $3,000 for the three alleged violations of the gag order — $1,000 for each violation.\nOn Tuesday, Bragg's team filed a motion to hold the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee in contempt of Court.\nThe first statement Bragg's team said was in violation of the order was a social media post on April 10 about Michael Avenatti, a lawyer who formerly represented adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Avenatti was later convicted of stealing from Daniels.\nTrump, earlier this month, re-posted a statement from Avenatti, which said: \"We can't be hypocrites when it comes to the 1st Amendment. It is outrageous that Cohen and Daniels can do countless TV interviews, post on social, & make $$ on bogus documentaries—all by talking sh*t about Trump—but he's gagged and threatened with jail if he responds.\"\nTrump, after re-posting Avenatti's statement, added: \"Thank you to Michael Avenatti --for revealing the truth about two sleeze bags who have, with their lies and misrepresentations, cost our Country dearly!!\"\nBragg's office also pointed to another post from April 10, in which Trump shared a picture of a document titled \"Official Statement of Stormy Daniels,\" which was dated Jan. 30, 2018.\n\"Over the past few weeks I have been asked countless times to comment on reports of an alleged sexual relationship I had with Donald Trump many, many, many years ago,\" the statement from Daniels says. \"I am not denying this affair because I was paid 'hush money' as has been reported in overseas owned tabloids. I am denying this affair because it never happened.\"\nTrump posted, along with the photo, \"LOOK WHAT WAS JUST FOUND! WILL THE FAKE NEWS REPORT IT.\"\nSeparately, Daniels had denied the allegation in a Jan. 10, 2018 statement as well.\n\"I recently became aware that certain news outlets are alleging that I had a sexual and/or romantic affair with Donald Trump many, many, many years ago. I am stating with complete clarity that this is absolutely false,\" Daniels wrote in that Jan. 10, 2018 statement. \"My involvement with Donald Trump was limited to a few public appearances and nothing more.\"\nDaniels wrote in the letter that when she met Trump, he was \"gracious, professional and a complete gentleman to me and EVERYONE in my presence.\"\n\"Rumors that I have received hush money from Donald Trump are completely false,\" the letter read. \"If indeed I did have a relationship with Donald Trump, trust me, you wouldn't be reading about it in the news, you would be reading about it in my book. But the fact of the matter is, these stories are not true.\"\nBragg's office also pointed to a third statement, in which Trump blasted former Manhattan prosecutor Mark Pomerantz.\n\"Has Mark POMERANTZ been prosecuted for his terrible acts in and out of the D.A.'s Office,\" Trump posted on April 13. \"Has disgraced attorney and felon Michael Cohen been prosecuted for LYING? Only TRUMP people get prosecuted by this Judge and these thugs! A dark day for our Country. MAGA2024!!!\"\nCohen, in 2018, pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, making false statements to Congress, making false statements to Congress and tax evasion. He was sentenced to three years in prison.\nAs for Pomerantz, he and his colleague Carey Dunne resigned from the Manhattan district attorney's office in 2022 after Bragg took over as district attorney. At the time, Bragg had stopped pursuing charges against Trump and suspended the investigation \"indefinitely,\" according to a letter written by Pomerantz and obtained by Fox News Digital last year.\nPomerantz and Dunne, who had been leading the investigation under Bragg's predecessor, former Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance, submitted their resignations in February 2022 after Bragg began raising doubts about pursuing a case against Trump.\nAfter Pomerantz resigned, he wrote a tell-all book based on the investigation, which was still ongoing. The book seemingly made the case to charge Trump.\nMeanwhile, Bragg's team, in their Tuesday motion, said that fines may not be enough to prevent future issues and violations of the gag order.\n\"This Court should warn defendant that future violations of the Court's restrictions on his extrajudicial statements can be punished not only with additional fines, but also with a term of incarceration of up to thirty days,\" the motion states.\nThe contempt motion comes as part of the historic criminal trial of Trump. He is the first U.S. president to stand criminal trial.\nBragg charged him with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree related to alleged hush money payments made to Daniels in 2016 ahead of the election.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all counts.",

The attorney was eventually convicted of defrauding Daniels in 2022 and sentenced to 48 months in prison.\nAvenatti had also been sentenced to 14 years in prison for cheating four former clients out of millions of dollars and trying to obstruct the IRS from collecting payroll taxes from a coffee shop he owned.\nIn a phone call from prison, Avenatti told the Post he's been talking to Trump's legal defense team and expressed that he is willing to testify if called upon.\n\"The defense has contacted me,\" he said. \"I'd be more than happy to testify, I don't know that I will be called to testify, but I have been in touch with Trump's defense for the better part of year.\"\nSomeone close to Trump confirmed the ongoing discussions, according to the Post.\nAvenatti defended Trump amid his trial against Daniels, telling the outlet, \"There's no question [the trial] is politically motivated because they're concerned that he may be re-elected.\"\n\"If the defendant was anyone other than Donald Trump, this case would not have been brought at this time, and for the government to attempt to bring this case and convict him in an effort to prevent tens of millions of people from voting for him,\" he said. \"I think it's just flat-out wrong and atrocious.\"\nAvenatti's statements seem to represent an about-face from his previous animosity toward the former president in the years leading up to the trial.\nAs he noted in a recent MSNBC interview he also did from prison, Avenatti described himself as once being Trump's \"most dangerous enemy.\" He even claimed it was his anti-Trump position that motivated the Department of Justice to give him such harsh treatment with his sentencing.\n\"I was not treated fairly and I was treated differently,\" Avenatti told MSNBC host Ari Melber earlier this month.\nMultiple social media users reacted in shock to the news on Saturday.\nPro-Trump digital strategist Alex Bruesewitz commented on X, formerly Twitter: \"Wow @MichaelAvenatti is willing to testify on behalf of @realDonaldTrump. Did not have this on my bingo card this year, but Avenatti knows all the facts about Stormy and disgraceful Michael Cohen. Avenatti has been saying this case is BS for weeks now!\"\nActor and conservative Matthew Marsden said, \"I did not see that coming.\"\nRedState contributor Bonchie said, \"Yes, things can get dumber.\"\nConservative account ALX wrote, \"We are living in interesting times.\"\nAuthor and entrepreneur Carol Roth asked, \"Wtf?\"",

            "excerpt": "CNN legal analyst Elie Honig made the case that convicting former President Trump in the New York hush money trial is not the slam dunk many liberals believe it is.",
            "summary": "CNN legal analyst Elie Honig criticized the New York hush money case against former President Trump in a new podcast interview as \"middling\" and overly reliant on former personal attorney Michael Cohen, saying his credibility was in tatters after telling \"lies upon lies.\"\nAppearing on Tuesday's episode of \"Somebody's Gotta Win,\" Honig insisted a unanimous not guilty verdict is unlikely for Trump, particularly since the trial is taking place in deep-blue Manhattan, but the case was mediocre and would never get a conviction in a swing district.\n\"On the scale of cases that prosecutors charge, it's middling, it seems to me,\" Honig told Puck's Tara Palmeri. \"If they were trying this case in a jurisdiction that would have gone 50-50 Trump-Biden, I would say there's no chance of a conviction. But you know, the healthy majority of criminal cases that go to trial do result in convictions.\"\nTrump's historic trial kicked off Monday, where he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The case revolves around an accusation that he improperly reimbursed Cohen for a $130,000 payoff in 2016 to porn star Stormy Daniels to stay silent about an alleged affair with Trump. Trump has denied the affair and called the criminal case – the first ever against a former U.S. president – an act of \"political persecution.\"\nHonig said it wasn't an \"absurd case on the merits\" but \"not a strong case in particular.\" He explained the alleged crime was not making a hush money payment, but that Trump had made a campaign expenditure in excess of legal limits that wasn't properly reported.\n\"I think the odds are that Trump will get convicted here,\" he said. \"But I wouldn't say 90%. I would put it, you know, 60 to 75% that he gets convicted. And you just never know what a jury is going to do.\"\nHonig said Cohen may actually help Trump's defense team in a multitude of ways.\nHe first pointed to the tape Cohen made, secretly recording his conversation with Trump about the hush money payment to Playboy playmate Karen McDougal, where Cohen is heard telling Trump that he and then-Trump financier Allen Weisselberg were going to \"set the whole thing up\" and when Trump suggested paying cash, Cohen repeatedly replied \"no\" and that he was \"all over it.\"\n\"I would love that as a defense lawyer. I would go, ‘Right there! Game over!'\" Honig said. \"Michael Cohen and Allen Weisselberg are the ones who falsified the business records. The lawyer and the CFO. Donald Trump doesn't know or care about the accounting of it. And the crime is in the accounting.\"\nHe also took Cohen's lack of credibility to task.\n\"Michael Cohen has a unique kind of baggage because this guy has lied and then piled lies upon lies, and piled lies upon lies upon lies,\" Honig said. \"Politico pointed out the other day that Michael Cohen has officially been caught lying to every branch of government. He's lied to DOJ and the IRS and the executive branch. He lied to Congress … He got convicted of that, and he lied to the courts because he now has this bizarre thing – see, Michael likes to say, 'I only ever committed crimes with and for Donald Trump. That's bulls---.\"\nHonig continued, \"Michael Cohen pled guilty to tax fraud and bank fraud on his own for his own money having nothing to do with Trump. But his response to that is, 'When I pled guilty to those things under oath in federal court in 2018, I was lying to the judge then. I didn't actually commit those.' I mean, it's like lies upon lies upon lies. You don't even know what's real and what's up and what's down. And a jury is supposed to believe this guy beyond a reasonable doubt? That's what the defense will say. Prosecutors will say, 'Yes, he lied and committed crimes, but he's come clean and he's backed up by the other evidence.'\"\n\"And so the [defense's] strongest argument is it's all about Michael Cohen, really,\" Palmeri reacted.\n\"It's all about Michael Cohen and they cannot tie Trump to the actual falsification of the records,\" Honig said.\n\"And what do you think the prosecutor's strongest argument is going to be?\" Palmeri followed.\n\"Prosecutor's strongest argument is going to be there's largely a paper trail here,\" Honig said. \"He clearly knew about the hush money payments. They're going to say that of course, he knew they weren't reporting these as campaign violations and his intent was to silence Stormy Daniels, to keep her quiet around the election. Therefore, it's a campaign finance violation.\"\nWhen asked who Trump's strongest witness was, Honig asserted he may not have to call any.\n\"A lot of times, defendants just go with what's called a reasonable doubt defense,\" he sad. \"They just say they haven't proved their case. The only evidence they have is Michael Cohen! You can't bank on Michael Cohen! Would you let him borrow your car or take care of your kids?\"\nHe added, \"All you have to do is punch holes and say they didn't meet their burden.\"",

            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump began the second day of the hush money trial in New York City railing against the case and its \"conflicted\" judge, whom the 45th president called a \"Trump-hating judge.\"\n\"We have a Trump-hating judge. We have a judge who shouldn't be on this case. He's totally conflicted. But this is a trial that should never happen. It should have been thrown out a long time ago,\" Trump said Tuesday before heading into the courtroom, referring to Judge Juan Merchan.\n\"It's a trial that is being looked upon and looked at all over the world. … They're looking at, analyzing it. Every legal pundit, every legal scholar said this trial is a disgrace,\" he added.\nTrump arrived at court in Lower Manhattan for day two of a trial that is anticipated to last at least six weeks as he battles 34 charges of falsifying business records. Jury selection will continue Tuesday, a task that is anticipated to last at least a week.\nNinety-six potential jurors filed into the courtroom Monday, where they were asked a series of questions to determine if they can serve as impartial jurors. More than 50 out of the pool of 96 were dismissed for admitting they could not serve fairly on the panel, while a handful of others were dismissed due to other issues.\nThe court is anticipated to vet a pool of roughly 500 jurors before selecting 12 New Yorkers and a handful of alternates from the group.\nThe trial's origins stretch back to the 2016 election cycle, when former Trump attorney Michael Cohen paid former pornographic actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 to allegedly silence her claims she had an extramarital affair with Trump back in 2006.\nTrump has denied having an affair with Daniels and also pleaded not guilty to the charges.\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg brought forth the indictment last year. Prosecutors say the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen for the payment to Daniels and falsely recorded the payments as legal expenses. Prosecutors are working to prove that Trump falsified the records with an intent to commit or conceal a second crime, which is a felony.\n\"I was paying a lawyer and marked it down as a legal expense account. I didn't know. Marked it down as a legal expense. That's exactly what it was. And you get indicted over that?,\" Trump said on Tuesday.\nTrump has railed against presiding Judge Merchan for months, including on Truth Social, where he has described him as \"suffering from an acute case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.\" Trump's legal team had also demanded Merchan's recusal from the case, citing that Merchan's daughter works as a Democratic consultant. The judge denied the motion on Monday.\n\"There is no agenda here,\" Merchan said Monday ahead of rejecting the recusal request.\n\"We want to follow the law,\" he added. \"We want justice to be done.\"\nTrump's legal team had also called on Merchan last year to recuse himself, pointing to his daughter's work and previous small donations Merchan made to Democrat causes for the 2020 election. The judge also denied that request for recusal, citing that a judicial ethics advisory committee had determined his daughter's interests would not impact his ability to fairly oversee the case.\nThe trial is expected to last for approximately six weeks. The court will not meet on Wednesdays, nor on Monday, April 29.",

            "excerpt": "Former President Donald Trump's \"hush money\" trial is set to kick off Monday. Fox News Digital answers the top nine questions before the case begins.",
            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump's hush money court case will kick off on Monday, marking the first time a former president will stand trial over criminal charges.\nThe historic trial will require Trump, the Republican Party's presumptive nominee for the 2024 election, to defend himself from the Manhattan courtroom while simultaneously campaigning as the election season heats up.\nFox News Digital compiled the top questions regarding the case ahead of it kicking off Monday at 10 a.m in Lower Manhattan.\nDubbed the \"hush money case,\" the trial's origins reach back to October of 2016, when Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen paid former pornographic actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 to allegedly quiet her claims of an alleged extramarital affair she had with the then-real estate tycoon in 2006. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels.\nThe case is also expected to feature two other payments, including a $30,000 payment to a Trump Tower doorman who claimed that Trump fathered a child out of wedlock, and arranged a $150,000 payment through a tabloid publisher to a former Playboy model named Karen McDougal, who also claimed she had an affair with Trump and sold her story to the tabloid. Trump has also vehemently denied these allegations.\nProsecutors allege that the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen, and fraudulently logged the payments as legal expenses.\n\"During the election, TRUMP and others employed a ‘catch and kill' scheme to identify, purchase, and bury negative information about him and boost his electoral prospects,\" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleged last year. \"TRUMP then went to great lengths to hide this conduct, causing dozens of false entries in business records to conceal criminal activity, including attempts to violate state and federal election laws.\"\n\"Catch-and-kill\" schemes are understood as tactics used by media and publishing companies to buy the rights of a person's story with the intention of burying the information.\nBragg announced Trump's indictment in April of 2023 with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.\nThe charges stem from checks reimbursing Cohen over a roughly 12-month period for paying Daniels in 2016. Cohen was separately arrested in 2018 and pleaded guilty to campaign finance charges and lying to Congress. He was sentenced to three years in prison and has since been released.\nFalsifying business records is a misdemeanor, but prosecutors are working to prove that Trump falsified records with an intent to commit or conceal a second crime, which would be a felony.\nThe charges against Trump carry more than a decade in prison, if he is convicted on the counts.\nLegal experts across the nation have weighed in that it is unlikely Trump would face a long prison sentence, if convicted, speculating that the 45th president would instead be given probation or up to four years in prison if found guilty by the jury, Fox News previously reported.\nCharges of falsifying business records are misdemeanors in New York, with prosecutors teeing up a case arguing that Trump falsified the business records to cover another crime, which makes falsifying the records a felony. Legal experts have weighed in that prosecutors will argue that Trump's alleged actions were to ​​conceal campaign finance crimes.\nLegal experts who spoke to Fox News Digital expressed skepticism over the DA's office linking the case to campaign finance crimes, with the Heritage Foundation's senior legal fellow Zack Smith saying that prosecutors are trying to \"bootstrap essentially what would ordinarily be misdemeanor charges into felony offenses.\"\n\"Some of the charges he's trying to bring are false records charges against Donald Trump. Which are ordinarily misdemeanors, unless they were done in furtherance of another felony - simply to cover up another felony. And in this case, as I understand it, Alvin Bragg is saying that the other felony was a federal campaign finance violation. So, you simply have a state prosecutor pursuing a state case against Donald Trump, based on a federal felony offense that the federal government, the Justice Department itself, declined to pursue,\" Smith told Fox News Digital in an interview earlier this month.\nThe Justice Department in 2019 \"effectively concluded\" its investigation into Trump's payments. In 2021, the Federal Elections Commission, the agency dedicated to enforcing campaign finance laws, announced that it had dropped a case looking into whether Trump had violated election laws for the payment to Daniels.\nFormer FEC member Hans Von Spakovsky underscored to Fox News Digital in another interview that both the FEC and DOJ had declined to pursue the case, yet a local DA is working to prove that Trump violated federal law.\n\"The [FEC] looked at this and said that this settlement was not a violation of federal law. The Justice Department also has criminal enforcement authority over federal campaign finance laws, and the Justice Department has also not considered this a crime. And so you have this local DA claiming there's a violation of federal law, when the two federal agencies with enforcement authority over that law say, ‘Well, no, there there was no violation of federal law.' And look, I say that as a former commissioner on the FEC. My job as a commissioner was to enforce federal campaign finance law, and this is simply not a violation of federal law,\" he said.\nIn the hush money case, Trump could not pardon himself if convicted, and if he wins re-election come November 5. The Constitution dictates that a president's pardoning powers \"grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States,\" meaning the powers only apply to federal cases. The hush money case is a state case.\nManhattan Judge Juan M. Merchan, 61, is presiding over the case. Merchan, originally from Colombia, has served on the New York Supreme Court since 2009, overseeing felony criminal cases. He previously served as an assistant district attorney in the Manhattan DA's office in the 1990s and worked in the New York State Attorney General's office, among other roles.\nMerchan has previously overseen high-profile cases, including in 2012 the case of the \"soccer mom madam,\" when a woman named Anna Gristina was charged with running a high-end prostitution ring in Manhattan. He also presided over the Trump Organization's 2022 criminal trial involving charges of criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records, and he is currently overseeing a case involving Trump-supporter Steven Bannon on charges that he defrauded donors to build a wall along the nation's southern border.\nTrump has railed against Merchan on Truth Social, including last month when he called on the judge to recuse himself and cited Merchan's daughter and her work as a political consultant for Democratic politicians.\n\"Judge Juan Merchan, who is suffering from an acute case of Trump Derangement Syndrome (whose daughter represents Crooked Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Adam ‘Shifty' Schiff, and other Radical Liberals, has just posted a picture of me behind bars, her obvious goal, and makes it completely impossible for me to get a fair trial) has now issued another illegal, un-American, unConstitutional ‘order,' as he continues to try and take away my Rights,\" Trump posted on Truth Social last month after he was given a gag order limiting what he could publicly say about the case.\nA large group of potential jurors will gather in the courtroom this week, where they will be presented with an overview of the case and asked whether they are able to serve in a fair and impartial manner.\nThose who show they cannot be impartial will be dismissed, while those who remain will be asked a series of 42 questions, which Merchan released in a letter last week, including:\nJury selection will continue until 12 New Yorkers and a handful of alternates are assigned to the panel.\nTrump has railed against the \"hush money\" case repeatedly, including in Pennsylvania on Saturday, where he held his last scheduled campaign rally ahead of the trial officially beginning Monday.\n\"I will be forced to sit fully gagged. I'm not allowed to talk. They want to take away my constitutional right to talk,\" Trump said in Pennsylvania, referring to the gag order that prevents him from publicly discussing potential witnesses and jurors.\n\"I'm proud to do it for you,\" he continued, calling the trial a \"communist show trial\" which he claims is orchestrated by the Biden administration. \"Have a good time watching.\"\nTrump has repeatedly denied the allegations in the case and has pleaded not guilty to the 34 charges.\nThe 45th president told reporters on Friday that he will testify in the trial, which he described as a \"scam\" and a \"witch hunt.\"\n\"I'm testifying. I tell the truth. I mean, all I can do is tell the truth,\" he said at Mar-a-Lago Friday, Fox News previously reported. \"And the truth is that there's no case.\"\nThe trial will not be televised and is anticipated to last between six and eight weeks. Trump is required under New York law to be in the courtroom throughout court proceedings.",

The $130,000 payment was to allegedly quiet her claims of an alleged extramarital affair she had with Trump in 2006.\nTrump, however, has denied the affair and pleaded not guilty to the charges.\nThe charges stem from checks written by the Trump Organization to Cohen over a roughly 12-month period reimbursing him for the payment to Daniels.

Jury selection is anticipated to last at least a week, while the trial is expected to continue for at least six weeks.\nUpon arrival at the courthouse Monday, Trump slammed the case as \"political persecution.\"\n\"Nothing like this has ever happened before,\" he said in Lower Manhattan. \"This is political persecution. ... It's a case that should have never been brought.\"\n\"This is an assault on America and that's why I'm very proud to be here,\" Trump added. \"This is really an attack on a political opponent.\"",

            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump's historic trial in Manhattan heard its first witness called by the district attorney's office on Monday, former publisher David Pecker.\nPecker previously served as chairman of the National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc., and allegedly was a key figure in a \"catch and kill\" scheme ahead of the 2016 election.\nPecker, 72, took the stand early Monday afternoon ahead of the trial concluding for the day at 12:30. He spoke to the court about American Media Inc. and its various publications, as well as his personal background, and how he owned 10% of American Media when he served as CEO.\nThe court broke out into chuckles when the prosecution team asked Pecker to provide the last four digits of his phone numbers, with Pecker rattling off four different sets of contact numbers. Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass responded \"sorry this isn't a quiz,\" sparking laughter from Pecker and others in the courthouse.\nPecker told the court he worked for the company from March of 1999 to August of 2020, serving as chairman, president, & CEO from 2015-2017.\nThe trial wrapped up earlier than initially anticipated Monday, after a juror said they have a toothache requiring a dental appointment this afternoon.\nThe trial marks the first time a former president has stood trial on criminal charges. Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. He pleaded not guilty to each charge.\nThe case focuses on Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen paying former pornographic actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 to allegedly quiet her claims of an alleged extramarital affair she had with the then-real estate tycoon in 2006.

Trump has also vehemently denied these allegations.\nTrump arrived at the Manhattan courthouse Monday morning, after 12 jurors and six alternates were seated and sworn in on the panel last week.\nJudge Juan Merchan read the jury their rules and instructions Monday, explaining to the panel that jurors must operate fairly, that the defense team is not required to prove Trump's innocence and that the 45th president is also not required to testify. Merchan reiterated to the jurors that they cannot discuss the case with anyone, adding that they also cannot visit any places where a crime allegedly unfolded, and that they cannot research the case.\nTrump briefly addressed the media earlier Monday morning, where he slammed the case as a \"Biden\" trial motivated \"for the purposes of hurting the opponent of the worst president in the history of our country.\"\n\"Nothing like this has ever happened before,\" he said in Lower Manhattan. \"This is political persecution. ...

Bragg, in his case, wants Trump to be held in contempt of court, claiming he violated the gag order imposed upon him by Judge Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the criminal trial.\nBragg says he also intends to use information from the E. Jean Carroll defamation case. Trump was ordered to pay Carroll $83.3 million in damages after he denied allegations that he raped her in the 1990s.\nTrump appealed the decision.\nSeparately, last year, a federal jury in New York City decided that Trump was not liable for rape of Carroll but was liable for sexual abuse and defamation. The former president was ordered to pay $5 million in that trial.\nBragg also said in the filing that he would point to Clinton v. Trump, in which the former president was sanctioned and fined for filing a \"frivolous, bad-faith lawsuit.\"\nThe filing came Wednesday, after two days of jury selection in the trial. Seven jurors were selected and sworn in on Tuesday. Court does not meet for the trial on Wednesdays.\nJury selection is expected to reconvene Thursday at 9:30 a.m. in New York City.",

            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump officially arrived to a Manhattan court Monday as the hush money case kicks off, where he will face trial over 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.\n\"Nothing like this has ever happened before,\" Trump said at the courthouse Monday. \"This is political persecution ... it's a case that should have never been brought.\"\n\"This is an assault on America and that's why I'm very proud to be here,\" he added.\nThe 45th president left Trump Tower early Monday morning, where he was seen waving to supporters before heading to Manhattan Criminal Court.\nThe trial marks the first time a former president will stand trial over criminal charges.\nDubbed the \"hush money\" case, the trial focuses on payments made by Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to former pornographic actor Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. The $130,000 payment was to allegedly quiet her claims of an alleged extramarital affair she had with the then-real estate tycoon in 2006.\nTrump has denied the affair and pleaded not guilty to the 34 charges against him.\nProsecutors allege that the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen, and fraudulently logged the payments as legal expenses. Falsifying business records is a misdemeanor, but prosecutors are working to prove that Trump falsified records with an intent to commit or conceal a second crime, which would be a felony.\n\"During the election, TRUMP and others employed a ‘catch and kill' scheme to identify, purchase, and bury negative information about him and boost his electoral prospects,\" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleged last year. \"TRUMP then went to great lengths to hide this conduct, causing dozens of false entries in business records to conceal criminal activity, including attempts to violate state and federal election laws.\"\nTrump has repeatedly slammed the trial as a \"witch hunt,\" and kicked off Monday by calling the presiding Judge Juan Merchan \"crooked\" while demanding his \"VOICE back\" after Merchan placed a gag order on Trump making public statements about potential witnesses.\n\"I want my VOICE back. This Crooked Judge has GAGGED me. Unconstitutional! The other side can talk about me, but I am not allowed to talk about them! Rigged Trial!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\nTrump, when he arrived at the courthouse Monday, continued that the trial \"is really an attack on a political opponent.\"\nThe trial will begin with jury selection, where potential jurors will be presented with an overview of the case and asked whether they are able to serve in a fair and impartial manner.\nThose who show they cannot be impartial will be dismissed, while those who remain will be asked a series of 42 questions, which Merchan released in a letter last week, including questions such as: \"Do you have any political, moral, intellectual, or religious beliefs or opinions which might prevent you from following the court's instructions on the law or which might slant your approach to this case?\"\nThe case is anticipated to last at least six weeks.",

Hudson said while driving around the area, \"you see a lot of Trump signs, not very many Biden signs.\"\n\"Do you feel like you're in trouble here?\" Hudson asked.\nBiden responded, \"Well, you haven't been driving in the right places, pal.\"\nBiden touted his volunteers, his campaign headquarters and said \"tens of thousands\" of Pennsylvanians had contributed to his campaign.\n\"Guess what the average contribution is? Less than $200, because almost 97% of all our contributions are from small donors,\" the president continued.\n\"He hasn't opened a single headquarters here, we've opened multiple headquarters here. He has no presence here,\" Biden said, referring to Trump.\nHudson also asked Biden to respond to Trump's claim that Biden was \"responsible\" for the former president spending all his time in court.\n\"His lack of ethics has nothing to do with me,\" Biden said. \"I have not once talked to anyone in my administration about Trump's legal problems.\"\n\"I have nothing to do with that,\" Biden continued.\nJury selection for the hush money case against Donald Trump in Manhattan is set to continue on Thursday.\nDistrict Attorney Alvin Bragg charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.

The 2-point difference is within the poll's margin of error.\nAnother poll released in April showed Biden ahead of Trump, by two percentage points.",

            "summary": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin prosecutor said Friday that she won't bring charges against a Republican lawmaker accused of trying to evade state campaign finance laws in order to unseat the powerful speaker of the Assembly.\nWaukesha County District Attorney Susan Opper said she would not be filing felony charges against Rep. Janel Brandtjen as was recommended by the bipartisan Wisconsin Ethics Commission.\nShe is the fourth county prosecutor to decide against filing charges against former President Donald Trump's fundraising committee, Brandtjen and others involved in the effort to unseat Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos.\nUltimately, the state attorney general, Democrat Josh Kaul, could be asked to prosecute the cases.\nThe ethics commission alleges that Trump's fundraising committee and Brandtjen, a Trump ally, conspired in a scheme to evade campaign finance laws to support the Republican primary challenger to Vos in 2022. It forwarded recommendations for filing felony charges to prosecutors in six counties.\nVos angered Trump by firing a former state Supreme Court justice Vos had hired to investigate Trump's discredited allegations of fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Vos launched the probe under pressure from Trump, but eventually distanced himself from Trump's effort to overturn President Joe Biden's win in Wisconsin.\nTrump and Brandtjen then tried to unseat Vos by backing a GOP primary opponent, Adam Steen. Trump called Steen a \"motivated patriot\" when endorsing him shortly before the 2022 primary. Vos, the longest-serving Assembly speaker in Wisconsin history, defeated Steen by just 260 votes.\nThe ethics commission alleges that Trump's Save America political action committee, Brandtjen, Republican Party officials in three counties and Steen's campaign conspired to avoid state fundraising limits as they steered at least $40,000 into the effort to defeat Vos.\nOpper said her decision did not \"clear Rep. Brandtjen of any wrongdoing, there is just not enough evidence to move forward to let a fact finder decide.\"\n\"I am simply concluding that I cannot prove charges against her,\" Opper said in a statement. \"While the intercepted communications, such as audio recordings may be compelling in the court of public opinion, they are not in a court of law.\"",

            "excerpt": "Pro-life and Christian activists say that former President Donald Trump risks alienating a key voting bloc with his moderated stance on abortion ahead of the 2024 election.",
            "summary": "Former President Trump's opposition to a strict abortion ban in Arizona has put him at odds with pro-life and Christian activists, who represent a voter base key to his presidential election effort.\nLast week, the Trump presidential campaign released a statement saying that states should decide how to regulate abortion. Days later, that position was tested when the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that an 1864 law banning abortion without exception for rape or incest should be enforced.\nTrump, who claims to be the most pro-life president in U.S. history, said the court's decision \"went too far\" and urged lawmakers to \"ACT IMMEDIATELY, to remedy what has happened.\" He said that \"ideally\" anti-abortion laws must contain exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. In other comments, he expressed confidence that the Arizona law will be \"straightened out.\"\nThat message was ill-received by Abby Johnson, a former Planned Parenthood director turned pro-life activist, who leads the group \"And Then There Were None.\"\n\"What I heard was that [Trump] is a person that does not believe in banning abortion,\" Johnson told Fox News Digital in an interview. She said there was a conflict between Trump's position that states should decide for themselves and his statement that Arizona went \"too far.\"\n\"So, here was a state that said we're going to ban abortion. And now he says, 'well, no, I don't want you to,'\" Johnson said. \"That tells me he doesn't want to ban it at the federal level. But he also doesn't believe the states should have a right to ban it at the state level.\"\nIt was a disappointing development for Johnson, who spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention in support of Trump's re-election. In her speech, she said Trump \"has done more for the unborn than any other president.\" She pointed to several of his accomplishments, including reinstating the Mexico City policy — critics call it the \"global gag rule\" — which blocks U.S. federal funding for non-governmental organizations that support abortion services, as well as appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, making state abortion restrictions possible.\nIndeed, Trump takes credit for his pro-life record regularly on the campaign trail. But he has also repeatedly criticized fellow Republicans for taking a hard-line stance on the issue, blaming candidates who did not allow for exceptions in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the pregnant person is at risk, for the GOP's setbacks in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\"A lot of politicians who are pro-life do not know how to discuss this topic, and they lose their election. We had a lot of election losses because of this, because they didn't know to discuss it. They had no idea,\" he said last year at a leadership summit of the Concerned Women of America.\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe pro-life cause has also suffered a handful of defeats on ballot initiatives that enshrined abortion rights protections even in red states like Ohio and Kansas. Similar initiatives in Arizona and Florida, among other states, are expected to drive up turnout in the November election.\nWilliam Wolfe, a former Trump official who served in the State and Defense Departments, said those defeats show that \"the culture in America still loves abortion, or deeply misunderstands what is happening in an abortion.\"\nWolfe is the executive director of the Center for Baptist Leadership (CBL), a newly-founded nonprofit that exists to revitalize the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), America's largest Christian protestant denomination. Though the group does not endorse or support political candidates, it released a statement last week chastising Trump for his abortion position and urging him \"to forsake the advice of compromising political consultants.\"\nIn an interview, Wolfe described the Arizona abortion ban as \"a great law\" and encouraged Trump to make an \"unapologetic moral argument\" about how abortion \"ends innocent life\" and \"should be recognized as murder.\"\n\"Evangelicals and Southern Baptists are eager to support candidates who show unflinching courage and make moral arguments against the civilizational suicide that is abortion. I would encourage everybody to stand strong on this issue and run to it and not away from it, because we know that human life is valuable and should be protected from the moment of fertilization until the natural death,\" he said.\nWalker Wildmon, vice president and spokesman of the American Family Association, said the Arizona Supreme Court ruling was a valid ruling that recognizes the pro-life position, that life begins at conception and should be protected until natural death.\nWhile giving Trump credit for his record, Wildmon said the former president's most recent statements are \"out of line with his party and the entire pro-life movement.\"\n\"Just as slavery was a stain on our country, abortion is also a stain on our country. So in our view, since we believe that every life begins at conception, any abortion is too many abortions,\" he said.\nWildmon warned that Trump risks alienating a significant number of Evangelical Christian voters by attempting to appeal to independents or suburban women by watering-down his pro-life stance.\n\"The reality is that wiggling or squirming on the abortion issue isn't going to pick him up many voters,\" he said. \"It will really suppress the Evangelical Christian vote. There's already Evangelical Christians out there, a large voting bloc in the Republican Party, that have some concerns about President Trump and how he handles things and his self-control.\"\nHe added that Trump \"really needs to be moving to the right on this issue\" to consolidate his supporters ahead of a general election showdown with President Biden.\nWhile Republicans triangulate their position on the issue, Democrats have attempted to portray Trump as the man singularly responsible for stripping away women's rights.\n\"Here in Arizona, they have turned the clock back more than a century on women's rights and freedoms. The overturning of Roe was a seismic event. And this ban in Arizona is one of the biggest aftershocks yet,\" Vice President Kamala Harris said at a campaign event in Tuscon on Friday.\nShe called Trump \"the architect of this health care crisis\" and argued a second Trump term would mean \"more bans, more suffering, less freedom.\"\nBrian Burch, president of CatholicVote, said Trump appears mindful that far-reaching laws that restrict abortion access could make his re-election difficult. He and the other pro-life activists interviewed for this story emphasized that Trump remains the best alternative to President Biden for pro-life voters in the upcoming election.\n\"Trump may hold the position that, under the circumstances, states shouldn't go that far. And he's certainly entitled to that position. I believe he's wrong on that, but that's a far-cry from Joe Biden, who is saying he's willing to impose a nationwide abortion at any stage, for any reason, paid-for-by-taxpayers regime on the country,\" Burch told Fox News Digital.\nStill, Johnson said that many pro-life activists she's met with have told her Trump has lost their votes with his criticisms of the Arizona law and Florida's six-week abortion ban. \"It doesn't mean that they're going to go cast their vote for Biden, but they are not going to vote for Trump\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\"I think that just saying that you're pro-life is not going to be good enough anymore for some pro-life voters,\" Johnson added. \"And so while I think there's a lot of people who are waiting to see, and I'm one of those people who are waiting to see if Trump is going to right this ship, I think that he does need to be very careful with how he moves forward between now and the election.\"",

            "summary": "Former President Trump's legal team says it tried to serve ex-pornographic actress Stormy Daniels with a subpoena as she arrived for an event at a bar in a New York City bar last month, but she refused to accept it.\nA process server working for Trump's lawyers said he approached Daniels with papers demanding information related to a documentary recently released about her life and involvement with Trump but was forced to \"leave them at her feet,\" according to a court filing made public Wednesday.\nDaniels is expected to be a key witness in Trump's hush money case, where he is facing over 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The trial marks the first time a former president will stand trial over criminal charges.\n\"I stated she was served as I identified her and explained to her what the documents were,\" process server Dominic DellaPorte wrote. \"She did not acknowledge me and kept walking inside the venue, and she had no expression on her face.\"\nDellaPorte said he tried to serve Daniels prior to a screening of the documentary film \"Stormy\" at the 3 Dollar Bill nightclub in Brooklyn.\nTrump's lawyers are asking Judge Juan M. Merchan to force Daniels to comply with the subpoena. In their filing, they included a photo they said DellaPorte took of Daniels as she strode away.\nDaniels' lawyer Clark Brewster described the requests as an \"unwarranted fishing expedition\" with no relevance to Trump's criminal trial. He claims they never received the paperwork\n\"The process — instituted on the eve of trial — appears calculated to cause harassment and/or intimidation of a lay witness,\" Brewster wrote in an April 9 letter to Merchan, according to The Associated Press. Brewster didn't immediately reply to a message from the news organization seeking comment.\nThe encounter came just weeks before the high-profile case kicked off in Manhattan. Seven jurors have been seated so far and jury selection is set to resume Thursday.\nThe trial will focus on payments made by Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to Daniels ahead of the 2016 election which Trump ended up winning.\nDaniels is expected to testify that the $130,000 payment was to allegedly quiet her claims of an alleged extramarital affair she had with the then-real estate tycoon in 2006.\nTrump has denied the affair and pleaded not guilty to the 34 charges against him.\nProsecutors allege that the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen and fraudulently logged the payments as legal expenses. Falsifying business records is a misdemeanor, but prosecutors are working to prove that Trump falsified records with an intent to commit or conceal a second crime, which would be a felony.",

            "summary": "Most voters prefer former President Donald Trump to handle their top issues over President Joe Biden ahead of the 2024 election, recent polling shows.\nA new NBC News poll found that inflation is the number one issue for voters going into November — an issue that most respondents believe would be better handled by Trump than the current president.\nWhen asked who they preferred to handle the issue of rising costs, the majority of respondents, 52%, said they prefer Trump to Biden.\nOnly 30% of likely voters said that they believe Biden is better at leading on the issue.\nThe survey also found that the crisis at the southern border is the second most important issue to voters, another area where Biden was found to trail Trump.\nWhen asked about their opinion of the president's handling of immigration and the crisis at the border, a whopping 69% of respondents said they disapprove of Biden's handling of the crisis.\nThe NBC poll from April did not ask respondents their current view of Trump's handling of the immigration crisis, but an NBC survey from January revealed that 57% of respondents preferred the former president's handling of the issue at the border over only 22% who favored Biden.\nThe poll also found that if the election were held today, Trump bests Biden by 2-points, 46% to 44%.\nThe results are the most recent in a string of polling that shows voters are not only most worried about the border and rising costs, but that they trust Trump to be the best presidential candidate to handle the issues.\nRecent Fox News statewide surveys in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin mirrored the results that Trump is the preferred candidate to handle the issues of immigration and the economy over Biden.\nAdditionally, a recent Axios/Ipsos survey found that 42% of Latino voters believe Trump is good for the economy, while only 20% could say the same about Biden. On the issue of immigration, 29% of Latino respondents gave Trump a positive rating, over 22% who preferred Biden.\nThe NBC poll was conducted from April 12 to 16, 2024 with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",

            "summary": "Fox News contributor and George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley explained why former President Trump's New York hush money case is a \"Frankenstein case\" on \"America Reports.\" As jury selection began Monday, Turley said Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg took a \"dead misdemeanor\" and attached it to a \"dead alleged felony\" and \"zapped it back into life.\"\nJONATHAN TURLEY: This is a Frankenstein case. They took a dead misdemeanor. They attached it to a dead alleged federal felony and zapped it back into life. So many of us are just amazed to watch this actually walk into court, because it's not a recognizable crime that any of us have seen. This does not appear to be a federal crime, but that's the theory that Bragg is using. So they need to go into the Wayback Machine.\nThis state misdemeanor died because of the statute of limitations. Then what Bragg said was, well, I'm going to allege that you did false filings on business records to hide a crime, but he was very ambiguous [on] what that crime might be. He still is ambiguous, but it is assumed to be a federal election crime. The problem is the federal government doesn't view it as a crime. They decided not to prosecute. And most election experts say that this is the type of thing that's failed in the past. So this bizarre indictment is now going to be an equally bizarre trial. And to this day, there's some confusion as to Bragg's actual theory as to what was the exact crime that Trump was hiding from all of this.\nHUSH MONEY TRIAL JUDGE TEES UP RULING ON WHETHER TRUMP VIOLATED GAG ORDER, SHOULD PAY THOUSANDSThe judge presiding over former President Trump's hush money trial in New York City announced he will hear arguments this month on whether Trump violated a gag order amid the case and should pay $1,000 fines for each violation.\nJudge Juan Merchan said he will hear arguments on April 23 at 9:30 a.m. regarding whether Trump violated a gag order that prevents him from making public statements about witnesses and their anticipated testimony in the trial.\nThe district attorney's office argued Monday that Trump has violated the order three times in social media posts and should pay $1,000 for each violation of the gag order. The prosecutors said Trump should remove the posts and requested that he be held in contempt.",

            "summary": "Donald Trump lost a bid Thursday to pause a string of lawsuits accusing him of inciting the U.S. Capitol attack, while the former president fights his 2020 election interference criminal case in Washington.\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington denied defense lawyers' request to put the civil cases seeking to hold Trump responsible for the Jan. 6, 2021, riot on hold while the criminal case accusing him of conspiring to overturn his election defeat to President Joe Biden plays out.\nIt's the latest legal setback for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, whose trial in a separate criminal case related to hush money payments made during the 2016 campaign began this week with jury selection in New York.\nThe lawsuits brought by Democratic lawmakers and police officers who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 seek civil damages for harm they say they suffered during the attack, which aimed to stop Congress' certification of Biden's victory.\nTrump has claimed he can't be sued over the riot that left dozens of police officers injured, arguing that his words during a rally before the storming of the Capitol addressed \"matters of public concern\" and fell within the scope of absolute presidential immunity.\nWashington's federal appeals court ruled in December that the lawsuits can move forward, rejecting Trump's sweeping claims that presidential immunity shields him from liability. The court, however, said Trump can continue to fight, as the cases proceed, to try to prove that his actions were taken in his official capacity as president.\nIn court papers filed last month, Trump's lawyers told the judge that \"basic fairness to criminal defendants\" warrants pausing the civil cases until after the 2020 election criminal case is resolved. They argued that allowing the lawsuits to proceed could force Trump to \"prematurely telegraph\" his defense strategies in the criminal case.\nMehta, who was appointed to the bench by former President Barack Obama, said the public has an interest in the prompt resolution of the civil lawsuits in addition to the criminal case. And the judge said \"appropriate safeguards\" can be put in place to allow for the lawsuits to advance without infringing on Trump's Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination.\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments next week on Trump's claim that he is immune from criminal prosecution in the election interference case brought by special counsel Jack Smith. The ruling will determine whether Trump will have to stand trial in the case accusing him of a sprawling conspiracy to stay in power after Americans voted him out of office.",

            "summary": "Opening arguments in former President Trump's historic and unprecedented criminal trial are set to begin Monday morning, and the judge is also expected to rule on several motions that could make the trial even more difficult for the former president.\nThe full jury of 12, plus six alternate jurors, were selected and sworn in on Friday after four days of jury selection.\nJudge Juan Merchan, who is presiding over the trial, instructed jurors on Friday not to discuss or to research anything relating to the former president's case over the weekend or while serving on the panel.\nMerchan said opening arguments will be delivered by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's team and Trump defense attorneys.\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has been charged by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The charges are related to alleged hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all counts. He has blasted the trial as pure politics, a \"political persecution\" and maintains his innocence. The former president, and the first ever to be a defendant in a criminal trial, vowed to \"tell the truth\" if he takes the stand.\nTrump attorney Will Scharf told Fox News Channel on Sunday that the case should never have been brought, and that the facts are on his client's side.\n\"While the prosecution and the media are hell-bent on sensationalizing this case, we're focusing on the facts because the facts show that President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong,\" Scharf said. \"This is a business records case, those business records accurately reflected payments to one of President Trump's lawyers as legal retainer fees. Additionally, those records weren't actually entered by President Trump. He was busy running the country from the White House while all this was happening in Trump Tower in New York.\"\nThe former president is subject to a gag order, which Merchan imposed upon him last month before the trial began. Merchan ordered that Trump cannot make or direct others to make public statements about witnesses concerning their potential participation or about counsel in the case – other than Bragg – or about court staff, DA staff or family members of staff.\nMerchan also ordered that Trump cannot make or direct others to make public statements about any prospective juror or chosen juror. But on Saturday, he let loose with an all-caps rant on his social media platform.\n\"THIS SCAM \"RUSHED\" TRIAL TAKING PLACE IN A 95% DEMOCRAT AREA IS A PLANNED AND COORDINATED WITCH HUNT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT 8 YEARS AGO, BUT EVERYBODY PASSED,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"INSTEAD THEY WAITED AND BROUGHT IT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF MY PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE WORST AND MOST INCOMPETENT PRESIDENT EVER, CROOKED JOE BIDEN. IT IS BEING PRESIDED OVER BY PERHAPS THE MOST CONFLICTED JUDGE IN JUDICIAL HISTORY, WHO MUST BE REMOVED FROM THIS HOAX IMMEDIATELY. I DID NOTHING WRONG!\"\nBragg argued in the first week of the trial that Trump has violated his gag order more than seven times, and wants him to pay a $1,000 fine. Bragg, in his motion, urged the judge to warn the former president that another violation could be punishable by up to 30 days' incarceration.\nTrump and his defense attorneys have argued that the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee should not be bound by the gag order, and said it violates his First Amendment rights, as well as the First Amendment rights of his supporters.\nThe judge is expected to rule on whether Trump actually violated the order by early next week.\nAlso Monday, Merchan said he would make a decision on what evidence Bragg's team can use in their effort to \"discredit\" the former president should he testify in his own defense.\nBragg, in a filing last week, said he intends to use Trump's alleged prior \"misconduct and criminal acts\" to discredit him.\nBut Trump has never been convicted of a crime.\nBragg's office said it intends to refer to information from New York Attorney General Letitia James' case against the former president and the determination from New York Judge Arthur Engoron after the months-long non-jury civil fraud trial against Trump and his family.\nEngoron ruled Trump was liable for fraud and \"falsifying business records,\" \"issuing false financial statements,\" \"conspiracy to falsify false financial statements,\" \"insurance fraud\" and \"conspiracy to commit insurance fraud.\"\nTrump was required to post a slashed judgment bond of $175 million as he appeals the ruling.\nThat trial took place without a jury. Trump's defense attorneys Friday objected to any cross-examination of the former president related to James' case and Engoron's ruling due to the appellate division's decision to put the judgment on pause during appeal.\nBut prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said the findings from Engoron showed \"persistent and repeated fraud and illegality.\" While the appellate division did pause the judgment, Colangelo said it says nothing about the merits of the case.\nMeanwhile, Bragg's office also intends to use information from E. Jean Carroll's defamation case against Trump, and more.\nTrump defense attorneys on Friday said each piece of \"evidence\" Bragg's team hopes to use are \"just distractions.\"\nTrump has said he will testify in his defense at the trial, telling reporters last week: \"I tell the truth.\"\nMerchan said he will reserve his decision on what information prosecutors can cross-examine the president with until Monday morning.",

Because of you.\"\nDozens of students were arrested and suspended at Yale and Columbia after anti-Israel protesters set up encampments on campus in the past week.\nProtesters have called for an intifada and the death of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. One Jewish Columbia University student was told to \"kill yourself\" and repeatedly kicked in the stomach during the protests, while a Jewish Yale student was reportedly stabbed in the eye with a Palestinian flag.\nThe demonstrations highlight the growing problem of antisemitism on campus since the October 7 terror attacks and the frustration many younger voters feel towards the Biden administration over its support for Israel.\nRapaport, who has spent years attacking Trump in expletive-laden rants, said he would put up with the former president getting re-elected if it meant angering anti-Israel activists.\n\"It would be worth the screaming, the crying and the yelling. I can't wait to see those f------ protests come November when d--- stained Donald Trump wins because of you f------ little blow jobs,\" he said, before laughing maniacally.\n\"I can't wait!\" he added.\nRapaport, who is Jewish himself and a staunch Israel supporter, has previously warned parents to stop \"wasting\" their money sending their kids to college because of anti-Israel sentiments on campuses.\nHe has also threatened to vote for Trump in the next election on more than one occasion because of far-left policies souring his views of the Democratic Party.\nLast November on an episode of his podcast, Rapaport railed against anti-Jewish hatred in the U.S., warning President Biden to get these protests \"under control\" or he could lose his vote.\n\"I've had conversations with some of my – if it comes down to pig d--- Donald Trump and Smokin' Joe Biden, I'm sorry. I am sorry. Voting for pig d--- Donald Trump is on the table. I'm sorry!\" he remarked at the time.\nHe also suggested he was open to voting for Trump because of New York City's soft-on-crime policies after illegal immigrants were initially released after beating up NYPD officers earlier this year.",

            "summary": "A new well publicized poll from Harvard University is the latest to indicate rising support for former President Trump among the nation's youngest voters, who traditionally are a key part of the Democratic Party's base.\nPresident Biden leads his Republican challenger 45%-37% among people ages 18 to 29 in a Harvard Youth Poll released early Thursday by the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics. Sixteen percent of those questioned were undecided.\nHowever, Biden's 8-point advantage over the former president is much smaller than his 23-point lead over Trump at the same point four years ago in the 2020 election cycle.\nThe president's lead over Trump widens to 50%-37% among registered voters under age 30, and to 56%-37% among those likely to cast a ballot in the November election.\nHowever, even Biden's 19-point margin among likely voters under age 30 is much smaller than his 30-point lead over Trump four years ago.\nAdditionally, the poll indicates that the president's 19-point lead over Trump among likely voters shrinks to 13-points when third party and independent candidates are added to the mix.\nAccording to the survey, Biden stands at 43%, Trump 30%, Democrat turned independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at 8%, Green Party candidate Jill Stein at 4% and independent Cornel West at 2%.\nThe poll suggests Trump's made major gains among young male voters.\n\"Democrats have lost significant ground with young men,\" the poll's release highlighted.\nThe president leads among women by 33 points in the poll, but his advantage among men is just six points. While Biden's lead among women is nearly identical to four years ago, his advantage among men has plummeted 20 points from this point in the 2020 election cycle.\n\"The gap between young men's and young women's political preferences is pronounced,\" polling director for the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics John Della Volpe emphasized.\nHe also cautioned to \"make no mistake, this is a different youth electorate than we saw in 2020 and 2022.\"\nThe poll also indicated that younger voters supporting Trump are much more enthusiastic about the former president than Biden voters are about the current president. More than three-quarters of those backing Trump said they were enthusiastic about their support, compared to just 44% of Biden backers who said the same thing.\nThe poll is the latest to indicate an erosion in support for Biden among younger voters. Also alarming for the president is his approval rating among those under 30, standing at just 31% in the new survey.\nThe Harvard Youth poll of 2,010 Americans ages 18-29 was conducted March 14-21, with an overall sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.",

            "excerpt": "An excused juror in former President Donald Trump's hush money trial spoke to Fox News Tuesday about the selection process after she was dismissed.",
            "summary": "A potential juror in former President Donald Trump's hush money trial in New York City spoke to the media shortly after she was excused from the pool, highlighting the \"serious\" mood inside the courtroom.\n\"Definitely serious,\" former potential juror Kara McGee, who works in cybersecurity, said on Tuesday. \"…Everyone was really taking it upon themselves to step in and do civic duty here, regardless of what people came into it thinking about the defendant.\"\nMcGee said that she told the court she could serve as juror in an unbiased manner, while noting in her comment to the media it would be \"very difficult for anyone really in this country to not come to this without prior opinions.\"\n\"We all have prior opinions on the defendant, unless you've been living in a cardbox,\" she said. McGee said she was excused from the jury pool due to scheduling conflicts with her employment in cybersecurity.\n\"I'm not a fan,\" McGee added of her personal thoughts on Trump. \"During COVID-19, I lived with someone who was immunocompromised, and I think his handling of COVID-19 was abysmal,\" she said.\nThe trial kicked off Monday with a pool of 96 jurors, before roughly 50 were excused on the first day for saying they could not be impartial in the case. An additional nine were removed Monday for other reasons. Of that pool, an estimated 35 candidates remained on Tuesday morning, with 14 of those excused by early Tuesday afternoon.\nMcGee said two of the questions asked of potential jurors most clearly indicated how they felt about Trump and the case.\n\"One of which is: Do you have opinions about the ability for a former sitting president to be tried in a court of law? Which I think the way people answered that showed how they felt about case,\" she said.\n\"The other one was: Do you have any opinions about legal limits for campaign finance donation amounts? Which I believe was another one that was kinda meant to gauge feelings about the particular case,\" she said.\nMcGee said she did make eye contact with Trump as she was excused from the trial.\n\"I looked at him after I had finished giving final answer … I glanced over at him again, and made eye contact with him, and have no idea what he thought at that moment,\" she said of her interaction with Trump.\nTuesday is the second day of trial in the hush money case, which marks the first time a former president has stood trial on criminal charges.\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced last year that Trump was charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records. The charges stem from the 2016 election cycle, when former Trump attorney Michael Cohen paid former pornographic actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 to allegedly silence her claims she had an extramarital affair with Trump back in 2006.\nProsecutors say the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen for the payment to Daniels and falsely recorded the payments as legal expenses. Prosecutors are working to prove that Trump falsified the records with an intent to commit or conceal a second crime, which is a felony.\nTrump has repeatedly denied the affair and pleaded not guilty to the charges.\nTrump spoke to the media earlier Tuesday morning, ahead of entering the courtroom, where he railed against presiding Judge Juan Merchan as a \"conflicted\" judge.\n\"We have a Trump-hating judge. We have a judge who shouldn't be on this case. He's totally conflicted. But this is a trial that should never happen. It should have been thrown out a long time ago,\" Trump said Tuesday morning.\n\"It's a trial that is being looked upon and looked at all over the world. … They're looking at, analyzing it. Every legal pundit, every legal scholar said this trial is a disgrace,\" he added.\nThe trial is anticipated to last at least six weeks, with jury selection expected to last at least a week.",

            "summary": "According to legal expert Jonathan Turley, Trump's on trial for allegedly falsifying business records related to payments to porn star Stormy Daniels. Turley added that it's a misdemeanor and the statute of limitations ran out.\nSomehow, none of that matters in New York City, where guys who randomly punch kids are given a pat on the back and a key to the city. But when it comes to porn star payments, you'd better keep records more detailed than a CVS receipt. But first up: What's up with hush money?\nYou're not supposed to talk about sleeping with a porn star? If that were me, I wouldn't shut up about it.\nMy friends would be like, \"Yes, we know Greg, then Stormy tied you down and spanked you unconscious with a pickleball racket. How many times are you going to tell us?\" Me sleeping with adult film stars — I wouldn't be able to keep it a secret, and neither would they. But they should. They should shut up. That's the deal when you charge for sex.\nYou break that time-honored pledge, and you soil what is otherwise a noble profession that gave us Mata Hari, Heidi Fleiss and Eleanor Roosevelt. I might be wrong on that one. Anywho, Trump's not happy.\nFORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP: As you know, my son is graduating from high school, and it looks like the judge will not let me go through the graduation of my son, who's worked very, very hard. Yeah, he's a great student. Very proud of the fact that he did so well, and was looking forward for years to have graduation with his mother and father there, and it looks like the judge isn't going to allow me to escape this scam. It's a scam trial.\nI haven't seen him this ticked off since I rejected his offer to be the spokesman for Trump Steaks. What can I say? I'm a dedicated vegan. The closest I come nowadays to putting meat in my mouth is when I do downward-facing dog in my nude yoga class. Of course, in their zeal to destroy Trump, Dems are doing him a favor again. For one thing, high school graduations are boring.\nYou sit there for hours in a hot, sweaty auditorium and listen to a bunch of names of strangers' kids just to see 20 seconds when the only important one is getting his diploma. If you're lucky, the kid in the wheelchair might pop a wheelie. What's wrong? And it's not like it's hard to get a high school degree. Everyone has one except Greta Thunberg.\nIt's a high school diploma, for cripes' sake. It's like an Adderall prescription. At that age, everyone gets one. Plus, it's just stressful being around all those seniors. How many times can I repeat, \"Call me when you're 18\"? But maybe I'm just resentful because nobody cared when I graduated from cosmetology school.\nI was class valedictorian and received the Vidal Sassoon Award for outstanding achievement in hair treatment. I came up with the first p**** hair straightener for inmates. It was called \"Haired Straight.\" But if Trump wants to go to his son's graduation, he should.\nGraduations are like losing your virginity — it only happens a few times. And trying to stop him is the biggest favor the Dems can do for him. They'll give him martyr status. He's already like Jesus in that he's the only one who can raise Joe Biden from the dead.\nJust imagine if Trump blows off a day of his dumb trial to watch his son graduate and the cops show up and arrest him. You want bad optics? It'll look worse than the time Jesse wore leggings to sexual harassment training.\nSure, the libs in every newsroom will cheer. Jon Stewart will joke about it on \"The Daily Show\" or \"TDS,\" as I like to call it. How did he swing that gig, anyway?\nLike Chris Christie's personal trainer, this guy only works one day a week. And those clucking hens on \"The View\" will high-five each other so hard, Joy will break both her wrists and have to eat her hay and oats bent over a trough.\nBut the rest of America, the actual voters, they all got to go to their children's graduations or hope to one day. They'll see the injustice and they will go nuts. So if you're watching, President Trump, just go to the graduation. You know, I bet some Brit will steal that line.\nPIERS MORGAN: If you're watching, President Trump, just go to the graduation. Every parent in America, whether they like you or hate you, will go, \"Yeah, I'd have done that too,\" because this case is utterly ridiculous. Why would you not think that what you're doing here is going to almost guarantee Donald Trump wins the next election? The only thing that could absolutely guarantee it is if he's found guilty and put in a prison cell. Because at that moment, Trump wins by a landslide.\nYeah. For once, a Brit is right about something. Well, it's easy when you're competing with Prince Harry, the Teletubbies and Mr. Bean. But once again, Turley said it best.\nJONATHAN TURLEY: Everything about this case is, in my view, legally absurd. You know, this case is basically a state misdemeanor that had run out on the statute of limitations. They took a dead misdemeanor and bootstrapped it into effectively trying a federal crime. But the federal crime here under election law was rejected by the Department of Justice. They didn't feel that this should be charged.\nHe's got great eyebrows. Anyway, he's right. It's lawfare. They can't beat Trump politically because so far, he's defied all the laws of politics, so they've decided to defy all the laws. Alvin Bragg is like O.J., except slower, fatter and more alive.\nThey're twisting the law like a balloon animal with scoliosis to prevent a second Trump term, and they could very well end up bringing it about. On the first day, over half the jurors were nixed after saying they couldn't be impartial. No s***! The city is bluer than a Smurf's b**** after sitting on an ice block.\nSo it's not within the court that matters, where the evidence is key, it's what's outside the courtroom where the pressure to crush Trump matters more. Bottom line: The Dems hate Trump so much that they're willing to destroy the legal system, and now they're on the verge of cementing their own worst nightmare — another Trump term. And this time, he'll be older, wiser and hopefully less h****.",

Bragg has urged the judge to warn the former president that future violations could not only result in additional fines, but possible jail time of up to 30 days.\nThe judge is expected to rule on Bragg's motion this week.\nOpening arguments in former President Trump's historic and unprecedented criminal trial are set to begin Monday morning, and the judge is also expected to rule on several motions that could make the trial even more difficult for the former president.\nThe full jury of 12, plus six alternate jurors, were selected and sworn in on Friday after four days of jury selection.\nJudge Juan Merchan, who is presiding over the trial, instructed jurors on Friday not to discuss or to research anything relating to the former president's case over the weekend or while serving on the panel.\nMerchan said opening arguments will be delivered by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's team and Trump defense attorneys.\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has been charged by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.

            "summary": "The judge presiding over former President Donald Trump's trial in Manhattan delivered the jury its instructions ahead of the prosecution and defense teams delivering their respective opening remarks Monday morning.\nTrump arrived at the Manhattan courthouse Monday morning, after 12 jurors and six alternates were seated and sworn in on the panel last week. Judge Juan Merchan on Monday morning detailed the panel's instructions, including reminding the jury that the defendant is presumed innocent unless the prosecution team proves Trump is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe trial, which is anticipated to last six weeks, will allow jurors to take notes, but Merchan reiterated to the jurors that they cannot discuss the case with anyone, adding that they also cannot visit any places where a crime allegedly unfolded, and that they cannot research the case.\nMerchan also explained to the panel that jurors must operate fairly, that the defense team is not required to prove Trump's innocence, and that the 45th president is also not required to testify.\nThe jurors were reportedly listening intently as Merchan described their rules surrounding the case. The trial is not televised, but media is permitted in an overflow room in the courthouse.\nThe trial's origins reach back to October of 2016, when Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen paid former pornographic actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 to allegedly quiet her claims of an alleged extramarital affair she had with the then-real estate tycoon in 2006. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels.\nTrump was charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. He pleaded not guilty to all counts.\nProsecutors allege that the Trump Organization reimbursed Cohen, and fraudulently logged the payments as legal expenses. Falsifying business records is a misdemeanor, but prosecutors are working to prove that Trump falsified records with an intent to commit or conceal a second crime, which would be a felony.\nMonday's trial schedule will include opening remarks from both the prosecution and the defense teams, and is anticipated to hear from the first witness called by the Manhattan district attorney's office on Monday, David Pecker.\nPecker served as the former chairman of the National Enquirer's parent company American Media Inc., and allegedly was a key figure of a \"catch and kill\" scheme ahead of the 2016 election. Daniels reportedly agreed to grant exclusive rights to the National Enquirer on her claims of an affair with Trump, with Pecker allegedly contacting Cohen to \"purchase\" Daniels' silence on the alleged affair.\nThe trial Monday was supposed to conclude at 2 p.m., ahead of the Jewish holiday of Passover beginning at sundown, but will wrap up at 12:30 due to a juror's toothache and dental appointment.\nTrump slammed the trial in brief comments to the media earlier Monday, calling it a \"Biden\" trial and saying Americans should \"understand\" that his criminal trial is taking place \"for the purposes of hurting the opponent of the worst president in the history of our country.\"\n\"I just want to say before we begin — these are all Biden trials,\" Trump said before opening statements were delivered Monday. \"This is done as election interference. Everybody knows it.\"\n\"I'm here instead of being able to be in Pennsylvania and Georgia and lots of other places campaigning, and it's very unfair. Fortunately, the poll numbers are very good,\" Trump continued. \"They've been going up because people understand what's going on.\"",

That 6-point difference is just inside the poll's margin of error.\nBiden's movement can be attributed to modest gains among Black voters (76% now vs. 71% in January) and voters under age 35 (49% vs. 43%), as well as a notable shift among the small subgroup of independents. In January, Trump had the advantage by 20 points (51% to 31% Biden), while the two presumptive candidates are tied today (42% each).\nTrump's coalition has held relatively steady, with some of his best groups being White evangelical Christians (83%), White men without a degree (75%), rural voters (67%), and voters ages 65 and over (58%).\n\"Trump stalled at 49% in 2020 and GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker was at 48-49% in 2022,\" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Daron Shaw. \"If Georgia voters have soured on Democrats even a little bit, the state is a major pickup opportunity for Trump.\"\nIn a hypothetical five-way race, Trump has a 7-point lead over Biden (46% to 39%), with third-party candidates Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (7%), Cornel West (2%), and Jill Stein (1%) in single digits. This is about where the race stood in January.\n\"Georgia may be the weakest state from Biden's 2020 coalition,\" says Shaw. \"On the plus side, if he can rally African Americans and younger voters, he might be able to recreate his 2020 victory. On the minus side, he might have maxed out that vote in 2020 and it's unclear how compelling his message is to these voters in 2024. I'm in the minority on this point, but it seems North Carolina might be a more promising target this time around.\"\nOn specific issues, Georgia continues to favor Trump, as he is seen as better able to handle — mostly by double-digits — five out of seven issues.\nNotably, Trump has the advantage on the two issues that have been dominating the campaign: immigration (Trump preferred by 23 points) and the economy (+22). He is also favored on foreign policy (+15) and energy policy (+8).\nOn other issues, neither candidate has a significant advantage: Trump has the edge on abortion (+2), whereas Biden is narrowly ahead on health care (+2) and election integrity (+3).\nForty-four percent of voters feel they are falling behind financially vs. 41% who are holding steady and 15% who are getting ahead. Voters saying they are falling behind go for Trump by 54 points, while those getting ahead/holding steady go for Biden by 31 points.\nVoters view Trump more favorably than Biden and see the former president as more mentally fit for the job than the incumbent.\nBy a 2-point margin, Georgians view Trump favorably (50% favorable vs. 48% unfavorable), a reversal from July 2022 when he was viewed negatively by 11 points (43% vs. 54%). They also see Trump as having the mental soundness to serve effectively as president (54% has mental soundness vs. 44% does not).\nBiden's favorable rating is underwater by 15 points (42% favorable vs. 57% unfavorable), and more say he lacks the mental soundness to serve by 22 points (38% mentally sound vs. 60% not).\nBiden's job approval rating is also upside down: 42% approve vs. 58% disapprove, which is about where it was in January.\nA few more things…\n— Views on Kennedy are split, with 39% rating him favorably, 39% unfavorably, and 22% unable to rate him. Democrats are more likely to view him negatively (31% favorable, 46% unfavorable), while Republicans are the opposite (45% favorable, 36% unfavorable). Independents are somewhat split (38% favorable, 33% unfavorable).\n— By a 6-point margin, Georgia voters think the Biden administration is too supportive of the Palestinians (27%) rather than too supportive of the Israelis (21%) in the war in the Middle East. Still, 4 in 10 think Biden's support of each is about right (39%). Democrats are almost 7 times more likely than Republicans to think there's too much support for the Israelis, while Republicans are 4 times more likely to think there's too much support for the Palestinians.\n— In a hypothetical U.S. House race, Georgians prefer the Republican candidate by 8 points (50% to 42% for the Democrat).\nConducted April 11-16 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,128 Georgia registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (150) and cellphones (699) or completed the survey online after receiving a text message (279). Results based on the full sample have a margin of sampling error of ± 3 percentage points. When necessary, weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics are representative of the registered voter population.",

            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee say they'll field a massive team of 100,000 lawyers and volunteers in the key battleground states to monitor and possibly challenge the counting of votes in November's election.\nIn a statement released Friday morning, the Trump campaign and the RNC touted the launch of what they called \"the most extensive and monumental election integrity program in the nation's history.\"\nThe program is expected to be a crucial part of what the RNC calls its \"commitment to ensuring transparency and fairness in the 2024 elections.\"\n\"Election integrity is the foundation of our democracy,\" recently installed RNC chair Michael Whatley said in a statement. \"Through this unprecedented program, we are mobilizing lawyers and volunteers who are committed to preserving the sanctity of our elections.\"\nThe Trump campaign and the RNC say that they plan to deploy what they describe as \"aggressive attorneys\" to monitor voting machine testing, early voting, Election Day voting, mail-in ballot processing, and canvassing, audits and recounts following the election.\nAccording to the announcement, the plans also call for hotlines in the battleground states, which poll watchers and concerned voters can call to report potential problems.\n\"Lawyers will guide poll watchers through the appropriate election code and provide clarity on how various issues should be answered, resolved or escalated,\" according to the announcement. \"This system will be operational from the first day of early voting through election day – and afterward if necessary.\nA majority of states enforce rules regulating partisan monitoring at polling sites, in order to prevent voter intimidation and obstruction of voting. While partisan monitoring is permitted, it isn't allowed to interfere in the voting process other than to report issues.\nThe new program underscores the former president's emphasis on election integrity. For years, Trump has repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims that his 2020 election loss to President Biden was due to massive voter fraud. And he has been indicted in two criminal cases for his alleged efforts to undermine and overturn those election results.\nThe former president and his allies have also claimed that Democrats will try to rig the 2024 election.\n\"Having the right people to count the ballots is just as important as turning out voters on Election Day. Republicans are now working together to protect the vote and ensure a big win on November 5th!\" Trump said in a statement.\nThe RNC — under then-chair Ronna McDaniel — announced in October that it planned to recruit and train tens of thousands of poll workers and watches in the crucial battleground states in the 2024 election.\nAfter Trump became the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, he installed Whatley as RNC chair, and his daughter-in-law Lara Trump as co-chair. Whatley and Lara Trump, as well as RNC chief counsel Charlie Spies, hammered out the new program.",

            "excerpt": "The New York Attorney General's office asked a judge to void a $175 million bond posted by former President Donald Trump claiming the fraud bond isn't properly backed.",
            "summary": "New York Attorney General Letitia James is pushing the judge in former President Donald Trump's civil fraud case to void the $175 million bond that Trump previously posted to appeal his New York civil lawsuit.\nIn her 26-page filing obtained by Fox News Digital, James questions whether the insurance company has sufficient funds to back it up.\nTrump's bond was posted by California-based Knight Specialty Insurance Company (KSIC), but James argued that the insurer was \"not authorized\" to write business in New York, stating it is a small insurer that is not authorized to write business in New York and is not regulated by the state's insurance department, had never before written a surety bond in New York or in the prior two years in any other jurisdiction, and has a total policyholder surplus of just $138 million.\nThe company has a total policyholder surplus of just $138 million, the filing states. According to New York state law, smaller businesses like KSIC are not permitted to expose themselves to liabilities, like a bond, or any potential loss greater than 10 percent of their surplus.\n\"Based on KSIC's policyholder surplus in its most recent annual financial statement of $138,441,671, the limitation of loss on any one risk that KSIC is permitted to write is $13.8 million,\" the lawyers wrote. \"The face amount of the bond exceeds this limitation by $161.2 million.\"\nJames also wrote in the filing that \"KSIC is not qualified to act as the surety under this standard because its management has been found by federal authorities to have operated affiliated companies within KSIC's holding company structure in violation of federal law on multiple occasions within the past several years.\"\n\"KSIC does not now have an exclusive right to control the account and will not obtain such control unless and until it exercises a right to do so on two days' notice,\" the filing read.\nJames also wrote that the Court should not rely on KSIC's financial summary attached to the bond as evidence that KSIC has sufficient capacity to justify writing a $175 million bond.\n\"That is because KSIC sends 100% of its retained insurance risk to affiliates in the Cayman Islands, where lax regulations allow KSIC to use this risk transfer to reduce the liabilities it carries on its books in a way that artificially bolsters its surplus, a practice New York regulators have dubbed \"shadow insurance\" and about which they have sounded the alarm,\" the filing read.\nFor these reasons, James writes that the Court should deny the Motion and require Defendants to post a replacement undertaking within seven days of the Court's ruling.\nIn September, Judge Arthur Engoron ruled that Trump and the Trump Organization had committed fraud while building a real estate empire by deceiving banks, insurers and others by overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth on paperwork used in making deals and securing financing.\nThe judge also prohibited Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump from serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation or legal entity in New York for two years.\nThe former president has repeatedly slammed the case against him and denied any wrongdoing, calling it a \"witch hunt.\"\nJames brought the lawsuit against Trump, accusing Trump and the Trump Organization of fraudulent business practices. James claimed Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric, as well as his associates and businesses, committed \"numerous acts of fraud and misrepresentation\" on their financial statements.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty on all counts.\nThe judge is expected to hold a hearing Monday to discuss the issues raised by the attorney general's office. The hearing is set to run in conjunction with opening statements in Trump's New York criminal trial.",

            "excerpt": "President Biden and former President Trump in a dead heat in the latest Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters",
            "summary": "The Keystone State looks headed for another tight race as President Biden and former President Trump are in a dead heat in the latest Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters, a state Trump won by less than a point in 2016 and Biden reclaimed by just over a point in 2020.\nThe survey of registered voters, released Thursday, finds the former and current presidents tied at 48% each, a slight improvement for Biden who was down by 2 percentage points in March.\nBiden saw modest gains among nonwhite voters (+5), suburban voters (+5) and voters under age 35 (+9), while Trump's coalition, such as conservatives, White evangelicals, White men without a degree, and rural voters, held relatively steady. What's more, Trump kept the advantage he had among independents: He was ahead among them by 7 points in March and maintains an 8-point edge now.\nBiden won union households by 5 points in 2020. Today, he holds the small subgroup by 2 points (49% Biden, 47% Trump). Non-union households split 48% each.\nIn a potential five-way race that includes third-party candidates, Trump comes out on top by 2 points: Trump 44%, Biden 42%, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. 8%, Jill Stein 2%, and Cornel West 1%. In this scenario, 8% of two-way Trump supporters break for Kennedy (none for Stein or West), while 10% of Biden supporters go for Kennedy (6%), Stein (3%), and West (1%).\nBiden is in the Keystone State this week, focusing on the economy and advocating for higher taxes on the wealthy as he visits several cities, including his hometown of Scranton.\nOver 4 in 10 voters feel they are falling behind financially (44%). Almost as many (41%) say they are holding steady, while just 14% say they are getting ahead. Trump leads among those who feel they are falling behind by 53 points, while Biden is ahead by 42 points among those saying getting ahead/holding steady.\nThe March Fox News Poll identified the economy as the top issue for Pennsylvanians, when voters surveyed felt Trump would better handle the issue. Trump's advantage on the issue (+12 points) held steady in the April poll.\nTrump also has a 16-point lead on another top issue: immigration and border security, while voters favor him on foreign policy by 4 points.\nBiden is seen as better at handling abortion (+10), election integrity (+6), and health care (+6).\nThe two major candidates are nearly tied on energy policy (Biden +1), despite concerns among some Democrats that Biden's opposition to fracking might be unpopular, especially after the administration paused new exports of U.S. natural gas earlier this year. A House Oversight Committee hearing on Thursday saw Republicans question the impact the pause would have on the U.S., especially internationally.\nVoters split over the Biden administration's handling of the conflict in the Middle East: 24% think he's too supportive of the Israelis vs. 23% say he's too supportive of the Palestinians. The largest number, 40%, says Biden's approach is about right.\nDemocrats are more likely to think the White House is too supportive of the Israelis, while Republicans are more likely to think it is too supportive of the Palestinians.\nBiden's job approval rating is nearly identical to his personal favorability rating: 45% approve of the job he's doing and 44% have a favorable opinion of him, while 55% disapprove of his job performance and have an unfavorable view of him.\nTrump is perceived slightly better than Biden on his favorable rating, but still underwater by 5 points (47% favorable vs. 52% unfavorable), while Kennedy is underwater by 6 points (40% favorable, 46% unfavorable, 15% can't rate).\nThe candidates' mental soundness has been a topic of debate and Pennsylvania voters are more likely to think Trump has the mental fitness to serve effectively as president (49%) than say the same of Biden (43%). At least half think they both don't have the mental soundness to perform the duties of president (50% Trump does not, 55% Biden does not).\nThe Pennsylvania congressional race is tight as well: 47% say they would vote for the Democratic candidate in their district while 46% support the GOP candidate. That's a reversal from March when Republicans were up by 3 points.\n\"The liabilities Biden has nationally are present in Pennsylvania, but they're muted,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"His standing with core Democratic constituencies is a little stronger, and he does a little better on issues like abortion, health care, and election integrity. It's the difference between being down a few points versus being tied.\"\nConducted April 11-16 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with a sample of 1,141 Pennsylvania registered voters randomly selected from a statewide voter file.

            "excerpt": "Michael Avenatti was once one of Donald Trump's most high-profile foes. Now, speaking from prison, the disgraced lawyer says Trump is a \"victim of the system.\"",
            "summary": "EXCLUSIVE– Michael Avenatti, the one-time \"most dangerous enemy\" of Donald Trump who liberals hoped would bring down his presidency, thinks the hush money case against him in New York is flawed, politically motivated and part of a wider anti-democratic effort to take 2024 out of the voters' hands.\nAnd to prove his point, consider the source, Avenatti told Fox News Digital in a phone interview from federal prison.\n\"I certainly see him as a victim of the system,\" he said. \"And that's something that I never thought I would say. So if Michael Avenatti is coming to his defense, and I was one of his staunchest opponents for a very significant period of time, that should tell people something.\"\nThe disgraced former attorney for Stormy Daniels, who once flirted with a White House run himself before his multiple criminal convictions, thinks the four separate criminal cases Trump is facing as he runs for president in 2024 are \"absolute overkill\" and an effort to keep the American people from having their say between him and President Biden.\n\"You've got a group of individuals in the United States who have decided that they know better as to who should be the next president, and they've decided that they don't want to leave it to quote, the little guy, close quote,\" he said of the various cases against Trump. \"So they're going to take matters into their own hands to prevent those people from being heard, and I am deeply disturbed and disgusted by it.\"\nIf you believe in democracy, he says, \"this should be settled at the ballot box.\" Trump is also facing charges on Georgia election interference, federal election interference and mishandling of classified documents.\n\"There is no question that these prosecutors are trying to make a name for themselves. Each of them wants to be governor or president or both at some point,\" Avenatti said, name-dropping Fani Willis in Georgia as a grandstander in his eyes. \"I mean, it's ludicrous. And the fact that so many people on the left are OK with this because the defendant is Donald Trump really makes me sick to my stomach.\"\nAvenatti, an inmate at minimum-security Terminal Island federal prison in California, has been in contact with the Trump defense team about possibly testifying in the New York case and says he'd tell the truth if called to the stand. A source close to the Trump legal team confirmed those conversations to Fox News Digital.\nTrump's historic trial kicked off last week, where he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The case revolves around an accusation that he improperly reimbursed former lawyer Michael Cohen for a $130,000 payoff in 2016 to porn star Stormy Daniels to stay silent about an alleged affair with Trump, which Trump denies.\n\"If the defendant was anybody other than Donald Trump, this stale case would not be being brought right now,\" Avenatti told Fox News Digital. \"He has definitely been targeted… There is no question that these prosecutors are trying to make a name for themselves.\"\nTrump is the first former president to ever face criminal charges, and he has called the case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, \"political persecution.\" The alleged crime in the case is not making a hush money payment, but rather that Trump knowingly made a campaign expenditure in far excess of legal limits that wasn't properly reported.\nAvenatti burst onto the national scene when he took on Daniels as a client in 2018; they sued Trump to try to reverse the non-disclosure agreement she signed about the alleged affair. That year, Avenatti became a constant cable news presence, doing hundreds of interviews and constantly poking Trump on social media.\nHe frequently predicted Trump wouldn't finish his first term in office, and he and Daniels became media stars, at one point posing for a Vogue photo shoot. Avenatti served as a guest co-host of ABC's \"The View,\" did interviews with Stephen Colbert and Bill Maher, and considered seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.\nBut as quickly as the seasoned litigator became nationally famous, his life collapsed in a sea of scandal and criminal charges beginning in 2019. He's now serving 19 years in prison for a variety of financial crimes, including trying to extort Nike for $25 million, pilfering millions from several clients, obstructing the IRS from collecting taxes, and stealing $300,000 from a book advance from Daniels.\nVarious prosecutors have characterized Avenatti as a \"serial fraudster\" and \"corrupt lawyer who claimed he was fighting for the little guy.\"\nTo say Daniels and his former lawyer have soured on one another since their 2018 partnership and public praising of one another is an understatement. Daniels has said he used his powers for \"evil\" and she never trusted him, only hiring him because he was the only lawyer who would take an adult film star's case.\nAvenatti in turn told Fox News Digital that Daniels fabricated numerous facets of her claims around the hush payment from the Trump campaign. In an affidavit obtained by Fox News Digital that he wrote but was never filed with the court in 2023 – the matter concerned a separate lawyer's representation of Trump – he described Daniels as erratic, temperamental and unstable.\n\"If Stormy Daniels was standing in a convent on a stack of Bibles with her tongue notarized and claiming the earth was round, I wouldn't believe it,\" he said, going on to claim he dropped her as a client in 2019 instead of the other way around.\nDaniels attorney Clark Brewster said in a statement that Avenatti was hardly a reliable source, pointing to his imprisonment for stealing from his own clients, including her.\n\"Mr. Avenatti's representation was terminated by Ms. Daniels after she consulted me and I discovered his forgery of her name and embezzlement of her funds,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Prior to her termination of Mr. Avenatti's services he publicly lauded Ms Daniel's courage, honesty and consistency. He presently stands as a thrice convicted felon for fraud, repeated acts of dishonesty and extortion. His recent desperate attempts crying out from his prison home seeking some relevancy are truly pathetic. Great source.\"\nAsked what had compelled him to come forward with his recent media interviews, Avenatti claimed he'd seen the unfairness of \"the system\" firsthand – he said in another recent interview that his own harsh sentencing for his crimes was due to being Trump's enemy. While he said he didn't see eye-to-eye with Trump on almost anything, it didn't mean he wasn't entitled to due process, and he criticized the gag order against Trump in New York by Judge Juan Merchan.\n\"I know what it's like when the government comes for you,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Regardless of how smart you are or what your resources are, you have little to no hope of prevailing, even if you're a former president of the United States. And I think what is happening to Trump right now is wrong, and it's outrageous. And that is far more important to me than whether I agree with somebody about political views or not, or whether they're a Republican or Democrat.\"",

            "excerpt": "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg may bring up E. Jean Carroll's defamation suit and Attorney General Letitia James' case should former President Trump take the stand, the judge presiding over…",
            "summary": "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg can bring up information from cases brought against former President Trump by New York Attorney General Letitia James and E. Jean Carroll in the cross-examination of the 2024 GOP presumptive nominee should he testify in his own defense, the judge presiding over the trial ruled Monday.\nBragg and prosecutors in the district attorney's office filed a motion last week saying they intend to use Trump's alleged \"prior misconduct and criminal acts\" to discredit him after he testifies in the criminal trial.\nTrump has never been convicted of a crime.\nJudge Juan Merchan, who is presiding over the criminal trial, decided Monday that Bragg's office can bring up information from James' lawsuit against the former president — including New York Judge Arthur Engoron's decision that found him liable of fraud.\nTrump was required to post a $454 million bond in that case, but an appeals court slashed that judgment in half to $175 million while the former president and his legal team appeal the ruling.\nEngoron made the decision after a monthslong, non-jury civil fraud trial.\nMerchan, on Monday, said Bragg can bring up Engoron's ruling. Bragg is also allowed to bring up Trump's alleged violation of the gag order imposed upon him in that case, where Trump was fined more than $10,000.\nMerchan also imposed a gag order on the former president in his criminal trial. Bragg has argued that Trump has violated that order more than seven times already and wants him to pay a $1,000 fine per violation, while being warned that any future violations could be punishable with up to 30 days of incarceration.\nMerchan also said Bragg is able to refer to information from Carroll's defamation case against Trump—specifically the finding that Trump \"defamed\" Carroll by allegedly making false statements.\nA federal jury in January decided Trump must pay Carroll more than $83 million in damages after he denied allegations he raped her in the 1990s.\nThe jury decided Trump must pay $18.3 million in compensatory damages and $65 million in punitive damages.\nA federal jury in New York City decided last year that Trump was not liable for rape, but was liable for sexual abuse and defamation. The former president was ordered to pay $5 million in that trial.\nTrump has repeatedly and vehemently denied the allegation. His denial resulted in Carroll slapping Trump with a defamation lawsuit, claiming that his response caused harm to her reputation.\nThe jury found Carroll was injured as a result of statements Trump made while in the White House in June 2019.\nTrump and his attorneys are also appealing that ruling.\nTrump defense attorneys on Friday said each piece of \"evidence\" Bragg's team hopes to use are \"just distractions.\"\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has been charged by Bragg with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The charges are related to alleged hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all counts. He has blasted the trial as pure politics, a \"political persecution\" and maintains his innocence.\nThe former president, the first ever to be a defendant in a criminal trial, vowed to \"tell the truth\" if he takes the stand.",

            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump railed against the historic trial in Manhattan criminal court Monday, asking why the District Attorney's office picked up the case after other law enforcement bodies did not pursue charges.\n\"If this were such a great case, why didn't the Southern District bring it? Who looked at it and turned it down. Why didn't numerous other agencies and law enforcement groups look at it? Because it was shown to everybody. And very importantly, why didn't the Federal Elections do anything about it? Because this is federal, it's not state,\" he said.\n\"It's not state … It's never happened before, I believe. Never happened before … where the state tries to insert itself into federal elections. Never. Nobody's ever seen it. But, you know, Federal Elections took a total pass on it.\"\nThe Justice Department in 2019 \"effectively concluded\" its investigation into Trump's payments. And in 2021, the Federal Elections Commission, the agency dedicated to enforcing campaign finance laws, announced that it had dropped a case looking into whether Trump had violated election laws for the payment to Daniels.\nManhattan DA Alvin Bragg picked up the case last year, announcing Trump's indictment in April of 2023.\nTrump's trial in a Manhattan courtroom began in earnest Monday, after jury selection last week, and heard its first witness, former American Media Inc. CEO David Pecker.\nPecker was allegedly a key figure to a \"catch and kill\" scheme ahead of the 2016 election. \"Catch-and-kill\" schemes are understood as tactics used by media and publishing companies to buy the rights of a person's story, but do not publish the materials.\nThe trial focuses on a $130,000 payment made by former Trump attorney Michael Cohen to former pornographic actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 to allegedly quiet her claims of an alleged extramarital affair she had with Trump in the early 2000s. Daniels reportedly spoke to the National Enquirer, which is owned by American Media Inc., on her claims of an affair with Trump, with Pecker allegedly contacting Cohen to \"purchase\" Daniels' silence on the alleged affair.\nTrump has repeatedly denied an affair with Daniels and pleaded not guilty to all counts.\n\"During the election, TRUMP and others employed a ‘catch and kill' scheme to identify, purchase, and bury negative information about him and boost his electoral prospects,\" Bragg alleged last year. \"TRUMP then went to great lengths to hide this conduct, causing dozens of false entries in business records to conceal criminal activity, including attempts to violate state and federal election laws.\"\nTrump said Monday that payments to Cohen were above board.\n\"It's a case as to bookkeeping which is a very minor thing in terms of the law, in terms of all the violent crime,\" Trump said Monday afternoon. \"This is a case in which you pay a lawyer, and they call it a legal expense in the books.\"\n\"I got indicted for that,\" he added.\nTrump briefly delivered public comments earlier Monday, where he slammed the case as a \"Biden\" trial motivated \"for the purposes of hurting the opponent of the worst president in the history of our country.\"\n\"I just want to say before we begin — these are all Biden trials,\" Trump said before opening statements were delivered Monday. \"This is done as election interference. Everybody knows it.\"\n\"I'm here instead of being able to be in Pennsylvania and Georgia and lots of other places campaigning, and it's very unfair. Fortunately, the poll numbers are very good,\" Trump continued. \"They've been going up because people understand what's going on.\"",

Yeah, well, it's hard to describe. They haven't really told us yet. It is a misdemeanor document label allegation that dates back eight years.\nBy the way, just for the record, well past the statute of limitations that Alvin Bragg mysteriously brought back to life by turning it into a felony on federal election law, but none of that really matters, does it? This is not about justice. It's not about keeping Americans safe. Do you really think this is a threat to any American in New York City? Let's see. You have violent criminals. You have gang members.

            "summary": "incoming update…\nJury selection in former President Trump's historic and unprecedented criminal trial stemming from charges brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is expected to resume Thursday morning.\nBragg has charged Trump, the 2024 presumptive Republican presidential nominee, with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The charges are related to alleged hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all counts. He has blasted the trial as pure politics, a \"political persecution,\" and maintains his innocence. The former president is expected to testify during his trial.\n\"I tell the truth,\" Trump said last week, when asked about his possible testimony.\nTrump is the first president in United States history to stand criminal trial.\nBy the end of jury selection on Tuesday, seven jurors had been selected and sworn in. The jury pool so far includes four men and three women, all living in New York City. Their professions include law, finance, nursing, technology and more.\nThis is an excerpt from an article by Fox News' Brooke Singman\nFormer President Trump is required, by law, to attend his ongoing criminal trial in person with few exceptions – a potential roadblock to his ongoing 2024 presidential campaign.\nAccording to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 43 states that a defendant \"must be present at: (1) the initial appearance, the initial arraignment, and the plea; (2) every trial stage, including jury impanelment and the return of the verdict; and (3) sentencing.\" The law allows few exceptions to the mandatory attendance rule.\nExceptions where the defendant is not required to be present in the courtroom include if there is an organizational defendant, if it is a misdemeanor offense, if there is a hearing on a legal question, or if there is a correction being made to a sentence - none of which currently apply to Trump's case.\nThe rules also state that, in a case where \"the defendant waives the right to be present, the trial may proceed to completion, including the verdict's return and sentencing, during the defendant's absence.\"\nTrump's hush money trial is expected to last six to eight weeks, with proceedings scheduled to take place weekly on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays – leaving Wednesday and the weekends open for the former president to attend campaign events in-person if he chooses to do so.\nTrump wrote on his TruthSocial platform on Monday that he \"will likely not be able to attend\" the high school graduation ceremony of his son, Barron Trump. While the court has not yet ruled whether Trump may be excused from court that day, the event could be one of many the former president might have to miss.\nWhile Trump's mandatory attendance in court may cause him to miss some pre-scheduled events, it does not mean he will forego campaigning for the next several weeks, as he maintains his social media presence to engage with voters and continues his bid as the Republican Party's 2024 presidential nominee.\nThis is an excerpt from an article by Fox News' Aubrie Spady\nLive Coverage begins here",

            "summary": "Nikki Haley, who was the final rival to former President Trump in the Republican nomination race before ending her White House bid last month, is joining a leading conservative think tank known for focusing on international affairs and national security.\nHaley, the former two-term South Carolina governor who served as ambassador to the United Nations in the Trump administration, is joining the Washington, D.C.-based Hudson Institute.\n\"Nikki is a proven, effective leader on both foreign and domestic policy,\" Hudson President and CEO John P. Walters said in a statement Monday. \"In an era of worldwide political upheaval, she has remained a steadfast defender of freedom and an effective advocate for American security and prosperity. We are honored to have her join the Hudson team.\"\nDuring her White House bid, Haley advocated a muscular U.S. foreign policy to deal with global hot spots such as the war between Russia and Ukraine and the fighting between Israel and Hamas, often offering a stark contrast with Trump's American First agenda of keeping the nation out of international entanglements.\nHaley traded fire over America's overseas role with rival Vivek Ramanswamy, an advocate of Trump's America First philosophy, during the GOP presidential primary debates.\n\"When our policymakers fail to call out our enemies or acknowledge the importance of our alliances, the world is less safe. That is why Hudson's work is so critical,\" Haley said. \"They believe the American people should have the facts and policymakers should have the solutions to support a secure, free, and prosperous future. I look forward to partnering with them to defend the principles that make America the greatest country in the world.\"\nHaley, who received the Hudson Institute's global leadership award in 2018 during her tenure as U.N. ambassador, will serve as the institute's Walter P. Stern Chair. According to the Hudson Institute, the position was created four years ago to commemorate a former chair \"who was instrumental in making Hudson one of Washington's most respected research organizations.\"\nThe institute emphasized that \"it is fitting that Nikki has taken on this title\" because \"she is a courageous and insightful policymaker.\"\nHaley launched her presidential campaign in February of last year, becoming the first major candidate to challenge Trump, who had announced his candidacy three months earlier. Additionally, she was the final rival to Trump, battling the former president in a two-candidate showdown from the New Hampshire primary in late January through Super Tuesday in early March.\nHaley announced that she was suspending her White House campaign on March 6, the day Trump swept 14 of 15 GOP nominating contests on Super Tuesday.\nHowever, Haley made it clear when she exited the Republican presidential nomination race that she intends to keep speaking out.\n\"While I will no longer be a candidate, I will not stop using my voice for the things I believe in,\" she emphasized as she spoke at her presidential campaign headquarters on Daniel Island, in her hometown of Charleston.\nTo date, Haley has declined to endorse Trump.\n\"It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,\" Haley said last month, as she pointed to those who supported her during her White House run.\n\"This is now his time for choosing,\" she emphasized.",

            "summary": "Former President Trump warned of the consequences of losing his presidential immunity argument, saying that if he loses that protection, so will \"crooked\" President Joe Biden.\nThe former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee argued that presidential immunity is essential to the proper functioning of the presidency in a Friday post to his Truth Social account.\n\"Without presidential immunity, it would be impossible for a president to properly function, putting the United States of America in great and everlasting danger!\" he posted, in all capital letters. \"If they take away my presidential immunity, they take away crooked Joe Biden's presidential immunity.\"\nThe Supreme Court of the United States is expected to hear arguments on presidential immunity Thursday, and eventually rule on whether Trump is immune from prosecution on charges stemming from Special Counsel Jack Smith's election interference investigation.\nTrump pleaded not guilty to charges brought by Smith, and has claimed presidential immunity.\nTrump said that without immunity from prosecution, the presidency \"will lose its power and prestige, and under some leaders, have no power at all.\"\n\"The Presidency will be consumed by the other Branches of Government. That is not what our founders wanted!\" he wrote.\nIn another post, Trump argued that if a president does not have immunity, \"the Opposing Party, during his/her term in Office, can extort and blackmail the President by saying that, ‘if you don't give us everything we want, we will Indict you for things you did while in Office,' even if everything done was totally Legal and Appropriate.\"\n\"That would be the end of the Presidency, and our Country, as we know it, and is just one of the many Traps there would be for a President without Presidential Immunity,\" Trump posted.\nPointing to his presidential predecessors, and 2020 and 2024 opponent Biden, Trump said: \"Obama, Bush, and soon, Crooked Joe Biden, would all be in BIG TROUBLE.\"\n\"If a President doesn't have IMMUNITY, he/she will be nothing more than a ‘Ceremonial' President, rarely having the courage to do what has to be done for our Country,\" Trump continued, calling for the protection of presidential immunity. \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\nTrump added that if immunity is not granted to a president, \"every president that leaves office will be immediately indicted by the opposing party.\"\n\"Without complete immunity, a president of the United States would not be able to properly function,\" he said again.\nTrump posted about the issue on his Truth Social platform while he sat in a New York City courtroom for day four of his criminal trial stemming from charges brought against him by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\nBragg charged Trump last year with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The charges are related to alleged hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Trump pleaded not guilty to all counts.\nTrump and his attorneys sought to delay the trial, which began Monday, until after the Supreme Court ruled on the issue of presidential immunity on April 25. That request was denied.\nTrump is required to be in court every day for the criminal trial, which is expected to last through early June. Court for the criminal trial is expected for every day except Wednesdays, and Monday, April 29.\nTrump and his attorneys argued that the former president should be able to attend the Supreme Court arguments on immunity next Thursday, but Judge Juan Merchan, who is presiding over the trial, denied that request as well.\n\"Arguing before the Supreme Court is a big deal, and I can certainly appreciate why your client would want to be there, but a trial in New York Supreme Court … is also a big deal,\" Merchan said this week, rebuffing Trump lawyer Todd Blanche's request.\nMerchan added, \"I will see him here next week.\"\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court has said it would fast-track the appeal, and a ruling on the issue of presidential immunity is expected by mid-June.\nTrump's criminal trial on charges brought against him by Smith has been put on hold pending resolution on the matter.\nSmith charged the former president with conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights. Those charges stemmed from Smith's investigation into whether Trump was involved in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and any alleged interference in the 2020 election result.\nTrump pleaded not guilty to all charges in August.\nThis will be the second time this term the Supreme Court will hear a case involving the presumed Republican presidential nominee.\nLast month, the Supreme Court sided unanimously with the 2024 presumptive Republican nominee in his challenge to Colorado's attempt to kick him off the 2024 primary ballot.\nThe high court ruled in favor of Trump's arguments in the case, which will impact the status of efforts in several other states to remove the likely GOP nominee from their respective ballots.\nThe court considered for the first time the meaning and reach of Article 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars former officeholders who \"engaged in insurrection\" from holding public office again. Challenges have been filed to remove Trump from the 2024 ballot in over 30 states.",

Stern chair.\nThe leading conservative think tank is known for focusing on international affairs and national security.\n\"When our policymakers fail to call out our enemies or acknowledge the importance of our alliances, the world is less safe. That is why Hudson's work is so critical,\" Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said in a statement. \"They believe the American people should have the facts and policymakers should have the solutions to support a secure, free, and prosperous future. I look forward to partnering with them to defend the principles that make America the greatest country in the world.\"\nHaley won primary contests in Vermont and the District of Columbia before suspending her presidential campaign after Super Tuesday.\nThe announcement comes just days after former Vice President Mike Pence accepted a teaching position at Grove City College, a conservative college in Pennsylvania.\nPence, Trump's former vice president who ended his presidential bid more than two months before the Iowa caucuses, \"will immediately begin serving as the Distinguished Visiting Fellow for Faith & Public Life,\" Grove City College said on Thursday, announcing the establishment of its Center for Faith & Public Life \"to explore and support the presence of Christian faith in public institutions.\"\n\"It is my great honor to serve as a visiting fellow to Grove City College's new Center for Faith & Public Life,\" Pence said. \"Faith and engaging in public life are not mutually exclusive, nor should they ever be. History shows that Christians steadily working toward the common good have changed the world, and Grove City College opening a center shows they are committed to continuing this work.\"\nUnlike some other former GOP contenders, Haley and Pence did not endorse Trump when suspending their campaigns.\nVivek Ramaswamy, a multimillionaire former biotech executive, dropped out after coming in fourth place in Iowa. He immediately endorsed Trump and joined the now presumptive GOP nominee on the campaign trail.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis came in second in the Iowa caucuses but ended his campaign before the New Hampshire primary, announcing in doing so he was endorsing Trump.\nSen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., ended his presidential bid in November and helped Trump garner support in South Carolina, where Haley saw little backing from GOP elected officials despite it being her home state.\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a longtime Trump foe, ended his presidential bid less than two weeks before the New Hampshire primary.\nAt the time, Trump chided that Christie was \"desperately seeking a TV job, but sadly, no one wants him.\" He withdrew from consideration for a potential \"No Labels\" third-party run last month.\nTrump has yet to announce a 2024 running mate.",

He was drowning in debt. And I said, ‘I'm sorry, Donald, but I can't help you.'\"\n\"That's what we need,\" Kimmel said in reaction to the clip, \"Pretty good one for a guy who can't put two sentences together.\"\nEarlier in the monologue, the talk show host had been discussing Trump's financial struggles, saying, \"Shares for his media company have plummeted. They're down 70% since they went public a couple of weeks ago. They were down another 14% today.\"\nHis in-studio audience applauded at that news.\nKimmel went on to show a purported stock tracker for the Trump Media & Technology stock, saying, \"You can see, the big drop that occurred yesterday, but even weirder, if you take those peaks and valleys from the past week or so, and you flip them on their side, and then add a little bit of color to them,\" showing how the image appeared to resemble a caricature of Trump's face.\nHe also joked, \"If you bought Trump stock two weeks ago, and shame on you if you did, you lost half your money, but if you hold on just a little bit longer you might be able to lose all of it.\"\nTrump Media & Technology Group's (TMTG) stock price plunged by more than 15% on Monday after the parent company of Trump's Truth Social platform filed to sell millions of more shares.\nShares of TMTG have retreated sharply since their market debut on March 26, falling 60% from the opening price of $70.90.",

The charges are related to alleged hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all counts. He has blasted the trial as pure politics, a \"political persecution\" and maintains his innocence. The former president is expected to testify during his trial.\n\"I tell the truth,\" Trump said last week, when asked about his possible testimony.\nTrump is the first president in United States history to stand criminal trial.\nThe former president is governed by a gag order, which Merchan imposed upon him last month before the trial began.\nMerchan ordered that Trump cannot make or direct others to make public statements about witnesses concerning their potential participation or about counsel in the case — other than Bragg — or about court staff, DA staff or family members of staff.\nMerchan also ordered that Trump cannot make or direct others to make public statements about any prospective juror or chosen juror.\nBragg has argued in the first week of the trial that Trump has violated his gag order more than seven times, and wants him to pay a $1,000 fine. Bragg, in his motion, urged the judge to warn the former president that another violation could be punishable by up to 30 days incarceration.\nTrump and his defense attorneys have argued that the former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee should not be bound by the gag order, and said it violates his First Amendment rights, as well as the First Amendment rights of his supporters.\nThe judge is expected to rule on whether Trump actually violated the order by early next week.\nThe former president has blasted the case this week.\n\"The whole world is watching this New York scandal,\" Trump said, calling it a \"spectacle.\"\n\"It is political and it is a shame—it is a shame,\" Trump said Thursday after court finished for the day.\nThe former president blasted Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg as \"out of control\" and said Judge Juan Merchan who is presiding over the case is \"highly conflicted.\"\n\"The whole thing is a mess,\" he said.\nTrump has blasted the case as election interference and has said Democrats and allies of President Biden, his 2024 opponent, want to keep him off the campaign trail.\nTrump, though, held a campaign event in Upper Manhattan Tuesday evening at a Harlem bodega. He highlighted crime in New York City and said he would work with Democratic lawmakers in the city to fix the city's issues, should he be elected.\nTrump was greeted at that bodega by a massive crowd of supporters chanting \"four more years.\"\nThe former president said that he thinks being confined to the courtroom will have a \"reverse effect\" to what he said the Democrats are hoping for, and feels it will energize his base and new voters ahead of the 2024 election.",

            "summary": "Some lawmakers in Washington, D.C., who pushed for the impeachment of former President Donald Trump sang a different tune as they threw out articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday.\nBoth articles of impeachment against President Biden's Homeland Security secretary were deemed unconstitutional by the Senate on Wednesday in two party-line votes.\nThe first article alleged Mayorkas engaged in the \"willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law\" regarding the southern border in his capacity as DHS secretary, while the second claimed Mayorkas breached public trust.\nMajority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., proposed a point of order declaring the first article unconstitutional, to which the majority of senators agreed following several failed motions by Republicans. It was then deemed unconstitutional with a vote of 51-48, with Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, voting present.\nThe second article was deemed unconstitutional as well, with a party line vote of 51-49. This time Murkowski rejoined the process.\n\"The decision by the Senate to reject House Republicans' baseless attacks on Secretary Mayorkas proves definitively that there was no evidence or Constitutional grounds to justify impeachment,\" DHS spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg told Fox News Digital on Thursday.\n\"As he has done throughout more than 20 years of dedicated public service, Secretary Mayorkas will continue working every day to enforce our laws and protect our country. It's time for Congressional Republicans to support the Department's vital mission instead of wasting time playing political games and standing in the way of commonsense, bipartisan border reforms,\" Ehrenberg added.\nAfter the vote, Schumer turned to X to say, \"Impeachment should NEVER be used to settle policy disagreements.\"\n\"If the GOP spent a fraction of the effort they spent on this meritless impeachment towards working with Democrats on border reform, we might have passed the bipartisan border bill,\" he said. \"But Trump told his GOP allies in Congress to kill it. Trump even said: ‘Please, blame it on me.'\"\nSenate Republicans blocked the Biden-backed border bill earlier this year because they said it didn't address what's fueling the crisis.\n\"They put forward this legislation, ask for more authority, more funds, and frankly, more flexibility — and they say if we don't go for it, Republicans are now responsible for the crisis at the southern border. It's preposterous,\" Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., said back in February.\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt fired back in a statement to Fox News Digital, saying, \"Crooked Joe Biden and Secretary Mayorkas reversed President Trump's effective border policies have allowed a border invasion of more than 14 million illegal criminals, murderers, rapists, and even known terrorists into our country. They must be held accountable. In November, President Trump will fire Crooked Joe Biden and Mayorkas and secure the southern border on day one.\"\nWhen it came to Trump's impeachment in 2021, Schumer sang a different tune.\nThe House impeached Trump for a second time in January 2021 after 10 Republicans abandoned the former president and joined Democrats.\nSchumer said at the time, \"I regret to say for 45 Republican senators to vote for a spurious constitutional objection to the coming impeachment trial was deeply, deeply irresponsible.\"\nDuring the Trump impeachment trial, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., broke from Schumer and said he believed the Senate had a responsibility to hold an impeachment trial but that it was an open question of whether the trial was constitutional.\nBut on the matter of Mayorkas, Murphy called the impeachment \"bs.\"\n\"Republicans only see the border as a campaign issue,\" Murphy posted on X. \"They don't want to solve the problem. They could have worked with us to pass the bipartisan border security bill. Instead, they wasted time on this bs impeachment, which doesn't solve the problem - just keeps it in the news.\"\nMurphy and Schumer did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the impeachment.\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told Fox News at the time of the Trump impeachment that the process was \"plainly unconstitutional.\"\nCotton joined several other Senate Republicans in signing a letter last week, lobbying for Schumer to hold a full impeachment trial for Mayorkas.\nThe Republican lawmakers said in the letter, \"The American people deserve to hear the evidence through a Senate trial in the Court of Impeachment.\"\nCotton could not be reached for comment on Wednesday regarding the latest ruling in the Senate for Mayorkas and how it differs from Trump's impeachment process.",

            "summary": "New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman said she noticed Donald Trump specifically staring at her after she reported he fell asleep in the courtroom during the hush money trial on Monday.\nHaberman, who was part of the reporter pool in the courtroom, gave live updates on the trial and reported that Trump had fallen asleep in the courtroom.\n\"You were actually in the room for that. At one point, the pool said that he was glaring at you for several seconds. You had reported shortly before that, during a break, that he appeared to be falling asleep at one point, as that proceedings were getting tedious. Did you notice that?\" host Kaitlan Collins asked.\nHaberman said she did notice and added, \"he made a pretty specific stare at me and walked out of the room.\"\nHaberman wrote on Monday that Trump had appeared to be sleeping and added, \"his head keeps dropping down and his mouth goes slack.\" Minutes later, she had reported, \"Trump has apparently jolted back awake, noticing the notes his lawyer passed him several minutes ago.\"\nShe claimed Trump didn't like when such things were reported on.\n\"I reported earlier that he had appeared to fall asleep. Now, we had seen him – I want to be clear that I've seen lots of people fall asleep in courtrooms. I've seen jurors fall asleep. I've seen judges fall asleep. If anyone falls asleep who's a criminal defendant in a case, we're going to report on it. But he doesn't like when such things are reported and I'm guessing – I don't know – that that's what this was about,\" Haberman told CNN.\n\"I think that having to sit there and be captive while we all report on him is going to be deeply uncomfortable for him because he is somebody who likes to control things,\" she continued.\nMore than a dozen additional jurors have been excused from participating in the trial so far Tuesday, Fox News Digital reported.\nThe court started on Monday with 96 potential jurors, with roughly 50 being excused on Monday for saying they could not be impartial in the case, and an additional nine were removed for other reasons. That left roughly 35 candidates on Tuesday, and now 14 of those have been excused.\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg filed a motion Tuesday to hold Trump in contempt of court, claiming he violated the gag order imposed upon him by publishing three social media posts relating to two known witnesses in his criminal trial — Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.\nBragg is urging Manhattan Judge Juan Merchan to also warn Trump that \"future violations\" of the gag order can be punished \"not only with additional fines, but also with a term of incarceration of up to thirty days.\"",

            "excerpt": "ESPN host Stephen A. Smith said the hush money trial involving former President Trump is evidence liberals are \"scared\" they \"can't beat him on the issues and the merits.\"",
            "summary": "ESPN host Stephen A. Smith called out liberals directly for pursuing criminal trials against former President Trump, saying that they're \"scared\" they \"can't beat him on the issues.\"\nSmith made the comments during the Tuesday episode of \"The Stephen A. Smith Show,\" which was also day two of Trump's trial over his hush money case with porn star Stormy Daniels.\nAs the trial continued with the swearing in of the first six jurors, Smith argued that the case amounts to an admission on the part of Trump's political opponents that they can't beat him in an election and have to resort to lawfare tactics.\n\"It's much ado about nothing,\" Smith said on the podcast. \"To my liberal friends out there, all you're doing is showing that you're scared you can't beat him on the issues and the merits.\"\nThe host continued, noting this is why Trump \"keeps saying it's a political campaign against me.\"\n\"That's why he keeps saying they can't beat me at the election, at the polls. This is the only way they can do it,\" he said.\nSmith also gave a warning about where this strategy will lead, especially if Trump is never put in jail, predicting there will \"never be peace in this country\" as a result.\n\"And if you don't put him in jail, and he still goes from being the presumptive GOP nominee to the official GOP nominee, and he goes to the polls, even though he was going to whine about winning and being rigged again, you have given more fodder to that argument, which means we'll never have peace in this country.\"\n\"Because tens of millions of people see what extent the other side is willing to go through just to keep him out of office because they can't beat him on their own merits,\" he added.\nSmith expressed frustration last month that the Democratic Party seems to be relying on court cases to hurt Trump rather than find a candidate who can beat him at the ballot box.\n\"Four indictments, 91 counts and the man gets more campaign dollars, climbing in the polls, okay?\" he continued. \"And last time I checked, he still ain't been in cuffs, he still ain't been put behind bars. And he's the presumptive GOP nominee. You can't stop him. You cannot stop him.\"\n\"And so for me, I find myself ashamed of the Democratic Party for their lack of a competitive fervor,\" he added.\n\"You had since 2016 to come up with somebody else, and you still can't do it? That is pathetic. It is pathetic,\" he said. \"And there is no excuse for it whatsoever.\"\nBack on his Tuesday podcast, Smith said that he will not vote third-party in the 2024 election, though he added, \"If I did it, you deserve it.\"\n\"You can't beat [Trump],\" he said, \"Everything you do shows me you can't beat him. It's a damn shame. It really, really is. It's embarrassing.\"",

In Milidantri's circles, the choice is clear, however.\n\"I can't use that language on the air,\" he replied when asked what his friends have said about Biden.\n\"It really is pathetic to watch a man that they can't impeach because he's not capable of it, but yet he's capable of running our country.

Jarrett Coleman, a Republican from the area, said voters in the area lack enthusiasm under Biden's watch compared to Trump's.\n\"President Biden was recently in Lehigh County touting Bidenomics -- the funny thing about Bidenomics is if it was working, the president wouldn't have to travel around the country convincing people it's working,\" he said.",

            "excerpt": "Former President Donald Trump is the first U.S. president to face criminal charges in an American courtroom, yet most of the country is getting news about the trial secondhand.",
            "summary": "NEW YORK (AP) — It's a moment in history — the first U.S. president facing criminal charges in an American courtroom. Yet only a handful of observers are able to see or even hear what is going on.\nInstead, most of the nation is getting news of former President Donald Trump's hush money trial secondhand. Starting with preliminary motions and jury selection Monday, reporters in a Manhattan courtroom must convey what is being said to the outside world after the fact.\nThat's all because New York state law regarding media coverage of court proceedings is one of the most restrictive in the country. Last week's death of O.J. Simpson, whose murder trial beamed live from a California courtroom captivated a nation three decades ago, was a telling reminder of how New York is behind the times — or, at least, a holdout.\nWHY WON'T NEW YORK LET ME SEE IT?\nRegulations limiting media coverage in courtrooms date back nearly a century, when the spectacle of bright flashbulbs and camera operators standing on witness tables during the 1935 trial of the man accused of kidnapping and killing Charles Lindbergh's baby son horrified the legal community, according to a 2022 report by the New York-based Fund for Modern Courts.\nRules to enforce decorum spread nationally, amended to account for the invention of television, as defense lawyers worried that video coverage would harm their cases, the report said.\nYet an interest in open government chipped away at these laws and — slowly, carefully — video cameras began to be permitted in courts across the country, often at the discretion of judges presiding in individual cases.\nNew York allowed them, too, on an experimental basis between 1987 and 1997, but they were shut down. Lobbyists for defense lawyers remain strong in New York and hold particular sway among lawyers in the state Assembly, said Victor Kovner, a former New York City corporation counsel who advocates for open courtrooms.\nNew York and Louisiana are the only states remaining that completely restrict video coverage, the Fund for Modern Courts said.\nTo Kovner and others, that's outrageous.\n\"We're the media capital of the world, we like to think, and the fact that cameras aren't permitted in one of our three branches of government is unacceptable,\" said New York State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who has sponsored a bill to try to change that.\n\"It's one of the most consequential trials of our modern age,\" the senator said. \"I think the public has a right to see exactly what happens in that courtroom.\"\nOn the trial's first day, some reporters suggested that it appeared there were times that Trump drifted off to sleep while watching the proceedings. The former president's campaign disputed that. With no video camera in place and trained on him, there's no way of knowing for sure.\nWAIT — I SAW A PICTURE OF TRUMP IN COURT AT THE TRIAL'S START\nThat's because the presiding judge, Juan M. Merchan, permitted a handful of still photographers to shoot photos of Trump before the day's proceedings started. Once court was called into session, courtroom sketch artists — a dying communications form — hold sway.\nThere is actually some video coverage of the trial, available on monitors in an overflow room adjacent to the main courtroom. It was packed Monday with reporters, court officers and a few members of the public, including Ron Sinibaldi, a former accountant from Long Island who lined up outside the courthouse before midnight for a seat.\n\"I read presidential biographies,\" Sinibaldi said. \"I go to presidential libraries. I'm here for the history.\"\nHOW CAN THOSE INVOLVED GET AROUND THE RESTRICTIONS?\nIn a hallway outside of the courtroom, a limited number of cameras and a small pool of reporters are positioned to capture remarks of anyone involved in the trial who want to address the outside world. That included Trump, even before the proceedings started.\nAbsent live coverage of the trial, how often the former president chooses to take advantage of those cameras and whether news organizations carry his remarks either live, taped or not at all will play a big role in how the case is perceived publicly.\nMSNBC carried his remarks live on Monday morning. \"They're trying to grab the narrative regardless of the outcome,\" CNN reporter Phil Mattingly said of the Trump defense team.\nHOW ARE JOURNALISTS COVERING THE TRIAL HANDLING IT?\nWith some difficulty. CNN stationed a team on the streets of Manhattan outside the courtroom, where a truck festooned with pro-Trump flags frequently drove by, blaring horns and music from loudspeakers. Reporters sometimes struggled to be heard. \"It is kind of a circus down here,\" CNN's Kaitlan Collins said.\nCommentators and experts, many of them with experience in jury selection, offered opinions from outside the courtroom or from studios. Fox News analyst Jonathan Turley said \"most cities, at least those outside of New York,\" will see the case as a weaponization of criminal justice.\nWith estimates that jury selection could take two weeks, and no way of showing it, journalists will have a lot of time to fill unless they turn their attention elsewhere.\nWILL OTHER TRUMP CASES BE TELEVISED?\nGeorgia, where Trump faces charges of election meddling, gives judges discretion over whether to allow television cameras. Superior Court of Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee has said he will make all hearings and trials in that case available for broadcast. That has already included hearings on whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis would be allowed to argue the case.\nFederal courts do not allow cameras in criminal cases. Trump is facing separate federal cases for election interference and mishandling classified documents, although it is not clear when, or if, trials will take place.\nThe feds offer one glimmer of hope: The U.S. Supreme Court permits audio of oral arguments to be broadcast outside of the courtroom. But there's no indication that this would apply to Trump's case. New York's law does not allow audio coverage of his hush money trial.\nProponents of legislation to open up New York courts to electronic media coverage are hoping the attention paid to the Trump case may boost their proposals. The idea is being considered as part of current negotiations over the New York state budget so, theoretically, a new law could even affect the Trump trial if it is passed and goes into effect immediately.\nGiven New York state's history, it's best not to count on it.",

            "summary": "Former Attorney General Bill Barr slammed New York prosecutors for the \"obviously political\" Trump hush money case, calling it an \"abomination\" as jury selection continues in the landmark trial.\nBarr, who led the Department of Justice under former President Trump, argued the case signals what the real threat to democracy is in his opinion – the \"excesses of the progressive left.\"\n\"This case is an abomination,\" Barr said during \"America's Newsroom\" on Wednesday. \"It's obviously political. Seven years after he pays hush money to try to come up with this case. It's also, as you say, it's not only far-fetched… they're trying to predicate it on a federal crime which wasn't prosecuted.\"\n\"And they're wrong about it. This was not a campaign contribution. They're just wrong on the law,\" he continued. \"But to me, this shows that the real threat to liberty, the real threat to our system, are the excesses of the progressive left… They're perverting the system of justice, and… that's where the danger lies. The corruption and subversion of our institutions by the left.\"\nJury selection will resume in the former president's criminal trial in Manhattan on Thursday. Seven New Yorkers have been selected so far to serve in the historical case.\nTrump blasted the trial and charges against him, saying it is \"rigged,\" \"all politics,\" and \"coming out of the [Biden] White House,\" while addressing supporters outside an Upper Manhattan bodega on Tuesday.\n\"It makes me campaign locally, and that's okay,\" Trump said. \"We're doing better now than we've ever done, so I think it's having a reverse effect.\"\n\"We're going to come in – Number one, you have to stop crime and we're going to let the police do their job. They have to be given back their authority. They have to be able to do their job,\" Trump said. \"And we're going to come into New York. We're making a big play for New York, other cities, too. But this city, I love this city.\"\nThe former president has been charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree relating to alleged hush money payments to Stormy Daniels during his successful 2016 presidential campaign.\nHe has been ordered to attend the court proceedings every day of the trial. Judge Juan Merchan told Trump that if he fails to be present, a warrant will be issued for his arrest. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg also threatened to hold him in contempt over alleged gag order violations, even threatening jail time.\nDespite the contentious relationship between Barr and Trump, the former attorney general said he would support the Republican ticket when he votes in November.\n\"Given two bad choices, I think it's my duty to pick the person I think would do the least harm to the country, and in my mind... I will vote the Republican ticket,\" Barr said.\n\"I think the real danger to the country, the real danger to democracy, as I say, is the progressive agenda.... and I said, Trump may be playing Russian roulette, but continuation of the Biden administration is national suicide, in my opinion.\"",

            "excerpt": "Former President Donald Trump held a rally in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania on Saturday and local business owners spoke out to Fox News Digital about the economy and his visit.",
            "summary": "NORTH WHITEHALL TOWNSHIP, Pa. – Al Anderson owns the Leather Corner Post.\nThe bar and grill on the edge of Schnecksville has its roots as a former carriage stop in the 1850s. The landmark, so dubbed from a time before street names when the crossroads at which it sits was marked only by a piece of rawhide nailed to a stake, has seen a lot of change in 170 years.\nAnd for Anderson, the changes have been particularly profound over the past decade as he struggles to keep up with rising costs to keep his business going.\n\"Our costs are through the roof just to stay in business. From A-to-Z we didn't have this four years ago,\" Anderson said. \"Of course, Bidenomics is nothing but printing money and creating inflation.\"\n\"So it's just false. It's bound to break, I just don't know when they're going to break it.\"\nAnderson's sentiments were echoed by other local business owners who expressed excitement before former President Trump's visit to the community and presidential campaign rally at Schnecksville firehall's fairground last Saturday. They seemed to long for the past years of the Trump administration and appear to be rooting for his victory in November.\n\"The economy over the last four years, especially from a customer's standpoint – we have to raise prices all the time. They were just complaining yesterday, too, that diesel fuel is up; everything's up… We have to just keep raising beer prices and food prices, it's just never ending,\" Lauren Anderson, Al's daughter and manager of Leather Corner Post, told Fox News Digital.\n\"I think it's exciting,\" Al Anderson said of Trump's visit. \"Donald Trump coming right next door to us is pretty awesome,\" Lauren added.\n\"I think in the Trump years, we all had more money in our pockets, so we could buy things at a lower cost… you could do more things with less money,\" Al added. \"[Biden-era] economics don't make sense. Go to the grocery store; it's unreal.\"\nCloser to the center of town, Schnecksville native Ed Frack recently opened SuperSets Gym in what was once his childhood IGA grocery store. Frack opened his first gym in Hanover Township, near ABE International Airport, just before Trump left office.\n\"I caught the tail end of it when I opened my first SuperSets,\" he said of Trump's first term. \"I would categorize it as [a time of] growth… Things were just a little easier for businessowners.\"\n\"The younger generation is noticeably spending more money than my generation ever did.\"\n\"At the same time, while they're spending more money, operation costs have doubled, tripled, and increased drastically over the last three years,\" added Frack, who previously battled to keep his first location open during then-Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf's pandemic lockdowns.\nFrack said he was shocked to hear Trump would be visiting the local firehouse over the weekend. \"I thought it was pretty awesome and cool for [him] to come by,\" he said.\nAs for the economic outlook for SuperSets, Frack said it will be difficult, but that he has made \"unorthodox changes\" to his business model to adapt to current conditions.\nHe described the last four years as a \"roller coaster,\" though added he believes the greater Lehigh Valley area retains a \"strong\" economic undercurrent. Inflation and cost-of-living increases, he said, have negatively affected the region, but not to the extent of other parts of the country. Frack added Schnecksville and the greater Allentown area remain a good place overall to start a business.\nLocal resident Zane Gray's father used to own a flooring business in the area, he told Fox News Digital.\nGray said the coronavirus pandemic coupled with the Biden administration's economic policies sent supply prices \"through the roof,\" which led to the business' demise.\n\"Sheets of plywood were $94 per sheet and what homeowner could afford that?\" Gray said. \"That really burnt some holes in our pockets and [we] ended up having to close-up shop, it's a shame.\"\nGray said he had been looking forward to Trump coming to town.\n\"I'm just excited. I'm so happy that he's coming to our little slice of heaven, and he gets to see the true people around here that support him, not these people on Facebook and Instagram,\" he quipped.\n\"It's nice to see some actual support and him coming out to see us. To see that he actually cares about us Pennsylvania locals. As long as he sticks true to his word and I know he will… prices should go down; jobs should be open up. I'll actually be able to afford things again, so I'm looking forward to him being in office.\"\nAbout 25 minutes below Schnecksville, Doug Letterman has operated Letterman's Diner in Kutztown since 1998. Letterman hails originally from Mount Carmel, the heart of the Anthracite coal region where blue-collar workers delivered Trump 2016 wins in counties that had long been reliably Democratic.\nLetterman's customer base down toward the other end of Route 61 is not dissimilar from there, and they overwhelmingly have good things to say about the former president, he said.\nLetterman, like Frack, recalls weathering the Pennsylvania lockdowns, which saw him receive a stack of citations amid pushback from Harrisburg for trying to keep his 23-seat, streetcar-style diner, known for its heaping omelettes and Pennsylvania Dutch flair, open, he said.\nWhile former President Bill Clinton visited his borough during his re-election campaign, Letterman said it was good to see Trump come pretty close this time around. He looks back fondly on Trump's time in the Oval Office.\n\"Biden is not doing a great job. When Trump was in, Trump was doing such a great job,\" Letterman said. \"The economy was doing great. Food costs were down… the economy was so much better than it is now.\"\nHe predicted, however, that Trump will only become more popular in the key areas of the Keystone State such as his own:\n\"[His popularity] is increasing, you can tell by my customer base that it's increasing,\" Letterman said.\nPennsylvania State Sen. Jarrett Coleman, a Schnecksville-area Republican who previously served on the Parkland School Board, told Fox News Digital he hears from constituents often about the lack of optimism they have during the Biden years compared to the previous four.\n\"President Biden was recently in Lehigh County touting Bidenomics -- the funny thing about Bidenomics is if it was working the president wouldn't have to travel around the country convincing people it's working,\" Coleman said.\nThe Lehigh Valley and Schnecksville area as a whole has undergone a long-term economic shift itself, as the \"iron and coke; chromium steel\" that Billy Joel sang about in 1981's \"Allentown\" no longer emanates from the site of Bethlehem Steel.\nA casino now sits amid the rusting steelstacks, and communities like Schnecksville – which had nary a traffic light in the 1980s – see an influx of warehouses and new residential subdivisions that depict a transition within the once-agrarian region.\nColeman told Fox News Digital that the diverse, economically evolving environment, however, presents politicians with a representation of many parts of the electorate at once:\n\"It's clear by both presidential candidates coming to Lehigh County that they understand the importance of the Lehigh Valley and the importance its voters make,\" added Coleman. \"And how the Lehigh Valley is like a representative spread of the Commonwealth as a whole.\"\nColeman also suggested Trump has an \"affinity\" for Pennsylvania for many reasons, including, as he noted, sons Donald Jr. and Eric attended private school in nearby Pottstown.\n\"I believe Pennsylvania has a special place in his heart,\" he said.\nFox News Digital reached out for a comment on Trump's visit from local U.S. Rep. Susan Wild, D-Pa., but did not receive a response.",

            "summary": "Seven jurors have been selected and sworn in so far to serve on the jury for former President Trump's historic and unprecedented first criminal trial.\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has been charged by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. The charges are related to alleged hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all counts. He has blasted the trial as pure politics, a \"political persecution\" and maintains his innocence. The former president is expected to testify during his trial.\n\"I tell the truth,\" Trump said last week, when asked about his possible testimony.\nTrump is the first president in United States history to stand criminal trial.\nBy the end of jury selection on Tuesday, seven jurors had been selected and sworn in. The jury pool so far includes four men and three women, all living in New York City. Their professions included work in law, finance, nursing, technology and more.\nEleven more jurors are expected to be selected and sworn in over the coming days. Jury selection is set to resume Thursday at 9:30 a.m.\nHere is a look at each of the seven jurors so far.\nJuror #1 is a man who lives in West Harlem. He is originally from Ireland. He has no children and enjoys doing anything outdoorsy. He gets his news from the New York Times, Daily Mail, Fox News and MSNBC.\nWhen asked by Trump defense attorney Todd Blanche if he was aware Trump is charged in other cases and jurisdictions, and how that affects him, the man said, \"I don't have an opinion.\"\nJuror #2 is a woman who lives on the Upper East Side with her fiancé. She does not have children. She is a native New Yorker and works as an oncology nurse at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The woman has a masters' degree in nursing. Her fiancé works in finance in New York City. The woman said she enjoys spending time with her family and friends and taking her dog to the park.\nWhen asked, she said she gets her news from The New York Times, Google and Facebook.\nWhen asked by Trump's attorney what her opinion of Trump is, the woman said, \"I don't really have one, especially in a courtroom. He can be treated as anyone else.\"\n\"No one is above the law,\" she said.\nWhen pressed again on what opinion she walked into the courtroom with, the woman replied, \"I didn't even know I was walking into this… I am here for my civic duty.\"\nJuror #3 is a young to middle-aged Asian man who lives in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. The man said he grew up in Oregon and has been an attorney for five years practicing corporate law. The man said he enjoys hiking and running, and reads his news from The New York Times and Google.\nJuror #4 is an older, middle-aged man who lives on Manhattan's Lower East Side. The man was born in Puerto Rico, is self-employed and has worked as an IT consultant for approximately 10 years.\nThe man said he has been married for \"a long time,\" and has one child and two grandchildren. He said his wife is a writer, and his child works in sales and research.\n\"I have no spare time,\" he said, when asked about his hobbies. \"I guess my hobby is my family.\"\nThe man said he works with community non-profits and said he has previously served on a jury in a civil case, but he did not remember the verdict.\nHe said he gets his news from the New York Daily News, the New York Times and Google. He said he also listens to podcasts.\nAs for Trump, the juror said he finds him to be \"fascinating and mysterious.\"\n\"He walks into a room, and he sets people off one way or another,\" the juror said. \"I find that really interesting. Really, this guy can do all of this — wow. That's what I think.\"\nJuror #5 is a young Black woman. She said she is a Harlem native and has been a teacher of English Language Arts for eight years.\nThe woman was previously a caseworker at a juvenile detention center and now works at Kip New York City Charter Schools. She said she has a masters' degree in education.\n\"I'm creative at heart,\" she said, adding that she enjoys photography.\nThe woman said that she is not married and does not have children. Her mother was an administrative aide in the New York Police Department, and her godfather was an NYPD homicide detective.\nThe woman said she gets her news from Google and TikTok.\nShe was asked if Trump chose not to testify, whether she would hold that against him.\n\"I won't hold that against him,\" she said.\nShe explained that she has friends who have strong opinions on the former president but said she is not a political person and tries to avoid political conversations.\nShe did say, however, that she appreciates Trump's candor.\n\"President Trump speaks his mind, and I'd rather that than someone who's in office who you don't know what they're thinking,\" she said.\nWhen jurors were asked if they were aware Trump was charged in other cases than Bragg's, most jurors were. However, juror #5 raised her hand to indicate that she was learning of additional charges for the first time.\nJuror #6 is a young woman who lives in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. She described herself as a New Yorker.\nThe woman is a software engineer for the Walt Disney Company. She said she likes to dance.\nJuror #7 is a White man who lives on the Upper East Side. He is originally from North Carolina and is an attorney and civil litigator.\nThe man said he is married with two children, and his wife works in risk management for a bank. He said he enjoys spending time outdoors and with his family.\nThe man said he gets his news from The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, New York Post and the Washington Post.\nWhen asked if his career as a lawyer would impact his ability to serve fair and impartially, or whether his opinions would get in his way, the man said that he does have \"political views as to the Trump presidency\" and said there were likely Trump administration policies he disagreed with.\n\"I don't know the man and I don't have any opinions about him personally,\" he said.\nAs for his career as a lawyer, he said he does not have any opinions about Trump's character.\n\"I certainly follow the news,\" he said. \"I'm aware there are other lawsuits out there. But I'm not sure that I know anyone's character.\"",

I think this is going to be a key theme here is the fact, that the prosecution's witnesses are simply not credible people, whereas the actual facts here fully support President Trump because he did nothing wrong,\" he said.\nScharf said the defense team aims to \"focus on the facts\" to prove Trump \"did nothing wrong.\"\n\"This is a business records case. Those business records accurately reflected payments to one of President Trump's lawyers as legal retainer fees. Additionally, those records weren't actually entered by President Trump. He was busy running the country from the White House while all this was happening in Trump Tower in New York,\" he said.\n\"We believe the facts are absolutely on our side, that they're absolutely exonerative of the president and, as long as the jury focuses on the facts, as long as the jury can see through all the media coverage and all the sensationalism and focus on the actual facts at issue… we believe we have a winning case.\"\nScharf also insisted the case shouldn't be tried in New York during the height of election season, as the case is stealing the presidential candidate away from the campaign trail.\n\"We've moved to recuse the judge. We've moved for a change of venue,\" he added.\nThis comes as the unusual jury makeup has created a buzz among legal experts, something Scharf noted himself.\n\"There are a lot of aspects of this case that are highly, highly irregular, and we saw that play out with jury selection last week,\" he said.\n\"You saw a huge number of jurors being excused because because they admitted that they couldn't be fair and impartial and unbiased, as we expect of jurors,\" he continued.\nAmong the irregularities, two lawyers will sit on the panel of 12 jurors.\nThe move is considered \"unusual\" for both legal teams to allow and particularly \"very risky\" for the defense, according to Elliot Felig, former Manhattan district prosecutor, who also appeared on the show early Sunday.\nFelig speculated the defense hopes the two lawyers will swing the remaining jurors after Trump's team sets up a technical defense that, even if the jurors accept all the facts presented by the prosecution as true, it still fails to constitute a crime.\n\"It's an unusual case on so many levels but, for the defense, they're going to argue at the end that even if every single fact that the prosecution presented is accepted as truthful… they're going to say it still doesn't make out a crime. That's why they have two lawyers on the jury defense,\" he said.\n\"Both lawyers usually don't want lawyers on the jury. In this case, both sides consented to having two lawyers on the jury.\"\nScharf said he believes the presence of lawyers is among the least unusual aspects of the case.",

            "summary": "Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., said he was worried about the \"overindulgence\" of the Donald Trump hush money trial and suggested focusing on the former president could give him an electoral advantage.\nMSNBC host Jen Psaki asked the governor about a \"chorus\" of people who think the hush money trial is only helping Trump politically, which she said was driving her \"crazy.\" She questioned what Newsom might tell an undecided voter about why the case should matter to them.\nNewsom argued it should matter, but said Trump \"doesn't care if he's the hero or the heel, he just wants to be the star.\"\n\"When we are focusing on him, I do worry electorally that he has a slight advantage. And so, I am a little concerned about the overindulgence around the day-to-day. I get it, I totally get it. The consequential nature of a criminal trial is profound and outsized in some respect, but not more outsized than democracy, more outsized than Dobbs,\" he said, referring to the Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade.\nNewsom said the focus on Trump was also not more important than RFK Jr. gaining ballot access in Michigan, an important swing state.\n\"So, I tend to be in that camp, a little less is more, as it relates to our obsession and focus on putting any more bright lights on someone who seeks them, no matter how ill-conceived or ill-willed or ill-fated his current standing might be,\" Newsom said of Trump.\nPsaki opened the discussion by noting Trump would be forced to \"sit quietly through his criminal proceedings\" this week as jury selection was completed, and opening arguments are set to begin on Monday.\nTwelve jurors were seated on Thursday at the end of the third day of jury selection, and all alternate jurors had been selected and sworn in by Friday, Fox News Digital previously reported.\nPsaki also asked Newsom about RFK Jr.'s candidacy and if he was worried about him hurting Biden's chances.\n\"He is a Kennedy. We revere Kennedys. At least I do,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, common sense would dictate it's real. Jill Stein is real. Cornel West is real. We know that, those were determinative, those third parties, in these last elections.\"\nNewsom warned that if RFK Jr. gets on the ballot in other states, especially swing states, Democrats need to take it \"very, very seriously.\"\nNewsom told Psaki during the interview that he would be focusing a lot of his time on helping Biden win Arizona and Nevada, where he said abortion was going to play a big role.",

            "summary": "FIRST ON FOX -- Americans who rely on evening newscasts from ABC, CBS or NBC for information are likely unaware that elected officials going after former President Trump are Democrats, according to a new study from the Media Research Center.\n\"The network coverage of the Trump prosecutions routinely and fraudulently implies that they are nonpartisan public officials. It's Trump versus the New York Attorney General, or the Manhattan District Attorney. They're not just Democrats, they're elected Democrats, building a career on taking down Trump. Leaving that out of the story is irresponsible,\" NewsBusters executive editor Tim Graham told Fox News Digital.\nRich Noyes, contributing editor for MRC NewsBusters, led a team of analysts who reviewed \"NBC Nightly News,\" \"CBS Evening News\" and ABC's \"World News Tonight\" from January 1, 2023 through April 10, 2024. They found networks failed to inform viewers during at least 90% of coverage that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis, and New York Attorney General Letitia James are Democrats.\n\"It's as if the networks prefer to disingenuously portray the indictments and civil lawsuits as the work of nonpartisan career prosecutors, rather than as partisan attempts to use the court system to hobble the electoral prospects of the country's top Republican,\" Noyes said.\nBragg, last April, charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to alleged hush-money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign. Noyes wrote that \"Bragg isn't just a mainstream Democrat\" and that he is \"clearly on the far-left wing of the party,\" especially considering his ties to liberal billionaire George Soros.\n\"ABC's ‘World News Tonight' has aired 56 stories discussing Bragg's ‘hush money' case against Trump, yet sharp-eared viewers only once heard that Bragg was a Democrat — on February 26, 2024, when correspondent Aaron Katersky relayed how ‘a spokesman for Trump... called Bragg another deranged Democrat prosecutor,'\" Noyes wrote.\n\"That's still better than the ‘CBS Evening News,' which aired 48 stories discussing Bragg's case, none of which revealed that the District Attorney is a Democrat,\" he continued. \"'NBC Nightly News' was the most informative on this score, informing viewers that Bragg is a Democrat in 16 out of 59 stories, or about 27% of the time — still barely one-fourth of stories.\"\nBetween ABC, CBS and NBC, Bragg was labeled a Democrat 17 times out of 163 stories, according to the study.\n\"Bragg's partisanship was omitted from nearly 90% of evening news stories about his election-season indictments of the former President,\" Noyes wrote.\nThere has been even less rhetoric about AG James' partisanship, according to the study.\n\"Through April 10, ABC's ‘World News Tonight' has aired 44 stories mentioning James's suit against Trump and his businesses, yet only one — back on November 6 — identified the state Attorney General as a ‘Democrat,' in a fleeting on-screen graphic that was shown for less than two seconds,\" Noyes wrote.\n\"Similarly, the CBS Evening News produced 35 stories that discussed James's civil case, but only once did viewers learn about James's partisanship,\" he continued. \"Compared to its competitors, ‘NBC Nightly News' was again the most informative. The newscast discussed the civil case in 26 stories, seven of which mentioned James's party affiliation.\"\nBetween ABC, CBS and NBC, James was labeled a Democrat only nine times out of 105 stories, according to the study.\nIt was much of the same when evening newscasts covered scandal-plagued DA Willis, who wasn't labeled a Democrat once during 99 segments between ABC's \"World News Tonight\" and \"CBS Evening News,\" according to the study. NBC managed to identify Willis as a Democrat in eight out of 50 segments.\n\"Add it all up, and out of 149 evening news stories about the Georgia election case against Trump, a scant 5% revealed that Willis was a Democrat, vs. 95% that kept viewers in the dark,\" Noyes said.\n\"Clearly, the editorial choices made by these broadcast networks shows they are framing these cases as the actions of nonpartisan law enforcement officials — all of whom just happen to be Democrats,\" he continued. \"But if it were a leading Democrat who had been placed under the legal microscope by a trio of elected Republicans, does anyone think that the media would be so reluctant to even mention the partisanship of the prosecutors? Of course not.\"\nABC, NBC and CBS didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\nGraham feels things were much different back in the Clinton era.\n\"Anchormen like Dan Rather couldn't mention Kenneth Starr investigating the Clintons without saying ‘Republican independent counsel,' so that the first word could cancel the second,\" he said.\n\"The most obvious field for investigating media bias is scandals and scandal investigations. Under Trump, his scandals have always been much more ‘newsworthy' than his policies,\" Graham continued. \"Under Clinton, they would hype up his policies and complain that scandals were a waste of public resources and media air time.\"",

James questioned whether the company that posted the massive bond, Knight Specialty Insurance, could actually pay the bond if needed.\nThe court, though, ruled against James, deciding that the bond will stand.\nThe court decided the $175 million needs to be in cash — not in mutual funds or securities where the value can fluctuate. The court said Knight Insurance cannot trade or move the money, but said they will retain control of the account.\nThe court also ruled that Knight Insurance must provide a monthly financial statement to James showing the $175 million in cash, and decided that the agreement cannot change without approval from the court.\nThe hearing Monday lasted for approximately an hour.\nTrump attorneys are appealing the decision from New York Judge Arthur Engoron, which required him to pay $454 million after Engoron ruled Trump was liable for fraud.\nAn appeals court slashed that $454 million judgment to $175 million while Trump appeals Engoron's ruling.\nIf Trump loses his appeal, the former president may be liable for the full $454 million. His real estate portfolio may then be exposed to seizure by James.\nArguments in the appeal are set for September.\nThis is a developing story. Please check back for updates.",

But for some reason, Trump just doesn't present as old and feeble… And he kind of looks the same.\"\n\"Trump would destroy him in a live debate. He would destroy Biden in a live debate,\" British TV personality Piers Morgan said. \"How many live press conferences has Joe Biden done? I mean, there's a reason they don't put him in front of a large gathering of the media for a sustained period of time taking questions. There's a reason.\"\n\"Yeah, that's true,\" Maher said.\n93-year-old TV icon William Shatner, who Maher referred to fondly as the \"old wise one\" of the panel, pointed out that Biden doesn't actually have to \"answer\" the questions at the debate like he didn't in the 2020 debates.\n\"They're not really debates. Ever,\" Maher chimed in. \"We really haven't had debates. They're both on the stage, they ask a question, they say whatever they want, they talk over each other-\"\n\"Or in [Trump's} case, talk behind each other, Shatner quipped, alluding to Trump's 2016 town hall debate with Hillary Clinton.\n\"Right, Trump does that,\" Maher conceded before telling Shatner, \"We got to go on the road together.\"\nTrump has repeatedly called for debates against Biden though the president himself has yet to commit.\nSeveral news organizations, including Fox News, released a joint statement Sunday urging the presumptive Democratic and Republican presidential nominees to \"publicly commit.\"\n\"If there is one thing Americans can agree on during this polarized time, it is that the stakes of this election are exceptionally high,\" the organizations wrote. \"Amidst that backdrop, there is simply no substitute for the candidates debating with each other, and before the American people, their visions for the future of our nation.\"\nMeanwhile, Maher argued last month that Biden should limit his public appearances and revive his \"basement\" strategy after the president gave his State of the Union address.\n\"We said, 'Yeah, well he can't do what he did last time, because there was a pandemic, stay in his basement.' Yes, he can,\" Maher said. \"No one gives a s--- about that. The chattering classes will talk about it. And the public will be like, what do I care?! I don't want to watch this all the time anyway! I don't need to see him every day. He doesn't need to go around the country. Stay where you are. Every once in a while, make a speech like this.\"",

            "summary": "Former President Trump's campaign will not say whether it would welcome support from individuals who were caught on video chanting \"death to America\" during a recent anti-Israel rally in the 2024 battleground state of Michigan.\nA Dearborn crowd was led in chants of \"death to America\" and \"death to Israel\" by Michigan-based activist Tarek Bazzi during the International Al-Quds Day rally earlier this month.\nWhen asked by Fox News Digital whether the former president would be open to receiving support from those who engaged in the chants, Trump 2024 spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt called the chanters \"radical extremists.\"\n\"Crooked Joe Biden's weakness and his appeasement policies have strengthened our enemies abroad and emboldened radical extremists here at home. When President Trump is back in the White House, he will bring peace and unity through strength and make America Great Again,\" Leavitt said.\nLeavitt did not respond when asked if Trump would take support from those who took part in the anti-American and anti-Israel chants.\nThough many Muslim Americans tend to support Democrats, one activist in the area, Mike Hachem, has reportedly supported Trump in the past and has been working to lead the Abandon Biden movement in Dearborn.\nHachem is one of a handful of individuals behind the effort to not only convince the Arab community in Dearborn to ditch support for President Biden, but to switch their support to Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\nBiden's re-election campaign denounced the \"death to America\" chants in a statement to Fox News Digital last week.\nWhen asked if the president would court those agitators, Biden campaign spokesperson Charles Lutvak replied, \"No.\"\nBazzi's remarks were also denounced by the White House.\n\"The White House condemns these abhorrent and antisemitic remarks in the strongest terms,\" deputy press secretary Andrew Bates told Fox News Digital. \"As President Biden has said, America is the greatest nation on Earth and a beacon to the world.\"\nThe campaign initially limited its comments to the chants themselves, largely reciting the White House statement.\nBiden's campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt told Fox News Digital that the chants had been \"condemned\" by the campaign. Lutvak reiterated that the \"Biden-Harris campaign denounces these disgusting and antisemitic remarks.\"\n\"President Biden knows America is the greatest nation in the world. Full stop,\" Lutvak said.\nThe controversy surrounding the Dearborn rally comes amid the city's emergence as one of the key centers of resistance to Biden's re-election bid. During last month's Democratic primary in Michigan, more than 100,000 voters marked \"uncommitted\" on their ballots instead of supporting Biden as the party's nominee.\nThe voter hostility toward Biden is chiefly a result of the administration's stance on Israel, which is at war with Hamas after the terror group's Oct. 7 attack on the Jewish State. Though the White House has shown increasingly tepid support for the U.S. ally, many of those opposed to the Israeli offensive remain unsatisfied.",

            "excerpt": "The high court will hold arguments Thursday morning in what could determine Donald Trump's personal and political future",
            "summary": "In what may be the most closely watched case this term at the Supreme Court – involving the highest-profile appellant – former President Donald Trump has offered a sweeping argument for why he should not face trial for alleged election interference.\nThe high court will hold arguments Thursday morning in what could determine the former president's personal and political future. As the presumptive GOP nominee to retake the White House, Trump is betting that his constitutional assertions will lead to a legal reprieve from the court's 6-3 conservative majority – with three of its members appointed to the bench by the defendant himself.\nThe official question the justices will consider: Whether, and if so, to what extent does a former president enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office?\nThis is new territory for the Supreme Court and the nation. No current or former president has ever been criminally indicted.\nThe stakes could not be higher – both for the immediate election prospects, and the long-term effect on the presidency itself and the rule of law. But it will be the second time this term the high court will hear a case directly involving the former president.\nOn March 4, the justices unanimously ruled that Trump could remain on the Colorado primary ballot over claims he committed insurrection in the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riots.\nThe decision to intervene at this stage in the immunity dispute is a mixed bag for both Trump and the Special Counsel. The defendant wanted to delay the process longer – ideally past the November election – and Jack Smith wanted the high court appeal dismissed immediately so any trial could get back on track quickly.\nA federal appeals court had unanimously ruled against Trump on the immunity question.\n\"For the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant,\" the three-judge panel wrote. \"But any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as President no longer protects him against this prosecution.\"\nSmith has charged the former president with conspiracy to defraud the U.S.; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights.\nThose charges stemmed from Smith's investigation into Trump's alleged plotting to overturn the 2020 election result, including participation in a scheme to disrupt the electoral vote count leading to the subsequent Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot.\nTrump pleaded not guilty to all charges in August.\nIn its brief on the merits submitted this month, the Special Counsel told the high court that \"presidents are not above the law.\"\n\"The Framers never endorsed criminal immunity for a former President, and all Presidents from the Founding to the modern era have known that after leaving office they faced potential criminal liability for official acts,\" said the government.\nBut Trump's legal team told the high court, \"A denial of criminal immunity would incapacitate every future President with de facto blackmail and extortion while in office, and condemn him to years of post-office trauma at the hands of political opponents.\"\nHis lawyers added: \"The threat of future prosecution and imprisonment would become a political cudgel to influence the most sensitive and controversial Presidential decisions, taking away the strength, authority, and decisiveness of the Presidency.\"\nIn a series of supporting briefs, 19 GOP-controlled states and more than two dozen Republican members of Congress are among those backing Trump's legal positions.\nSome of the issues the court will have to consider:\nCan a former president ever be prosecuted for \"official acts,\" or does he enjoy \"absolute immunity?\"\nBy including the words \"whether and to what extent\" in its official question framing the case, the Supreme Court – in the eyes of many legal scholars – may be prepared to limit or narrow \"absolute immunity,\" at least in this case.\nBut court precedent may give Trump some protection – that former presidents should not face civil liability \"predicated on his official acts\" (Fitzgerald v. Nixon, 1982). Trump, of course, is facing criminal charges brought by the government. The question remains: Will the court now extend any implied civil protection to a criminal prosecution?\nWhat constitutes an official act of a president? Will the court distinguish between Trump's alleged election interference as clearly acting in his executive capacity, or was he acting in a purely political or personal capacity as an incumbent candidate?\nA federal appeals court that rejected Trump's arguments in a separate civil lawsuit alleging that he incited the violent Capitol mob with his \"Stop the Steal\" rally remarks on Jan. 6, 2021 concluded that \"his campaign to win re-election is not an official presidential act.\" Trump is making the same immunity claims in those pending lawsuits.\nJustice Clarence Thomas, in a separate 2020 case involving Trump financial records sought by New York prosecutors, wrote, \"This Court has recognized absolute immunity for the President from 'damages liability predicated on his official acts,' But we have rejected absolute immunity from damages actions for a President's nonofficial conduct.\"\nThomas cited the 1997 Clinton v. Jones case, which determined that a sitting president did not have immunity from civil suits over his conduct prior to taking office and unrelated to his office. Again, the current dispute involves a criminal prosecution, and the justices may weigh whether that deserves greater deference to the constitutional claims from both sides.\nWhat acts are within the outer rim of a president's constitutional duties?\nThe lower federal courts deciding the matter pointedly avoided addressing that issue, but the high court now has full discretion to take it up. Questions or hypotheticals from the bench may offer hints about how broadly the justices may want to explore the orbit of presidential authority, when weighing political or \"discretionary\" acts vs. duty-bound or \"ministerial\" acts.\nDuring January oral arguments before the DC-based federal appeals court, Trump's lawyer, John Sauer, suggested that if a president were to order Seal Team Six military commandos to assassinate a political rival, he could then be criminally prosecuted only if first found guilty by Congress through the impeachment process.\nGiven the stakes, the Supreme Court may compromise here and issue a mixed ruling: rejecting Trump's broad immunity claims while preserving certain vital executive functions, like the national security role of commander-in-chief. The big unknown is what side Trump's election-related conduct would fall, in the eyes of the nine justices.\nDo federal courts have any jurisdiction to consider a president's official discretionary decisions?\nOn this separation-of-powers question, Smith's team and others have cited the 1952 Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer case that limited a president's power to seize private property – even in a wartime emergency – absent any express congressional authorization. That landmark ruling curbing executive power also affirmed the judiciary's binding role to review a president's actions in office.\nWill the Supreme Court ultimately decide not to decide, and throw the competing issues back to the lower courts for further review?\nThe justices may get buyer's remorse and conclude that weighty questions were not fully considered at the intermediate appellate or trial court level. That could significantly delay any trial.\nOr they may let the trial play out first, and give both sides a chance to make their claims before a jury. Depending on the verdict, the Supreme Court would then likely revisit the immunity questions.\nDespite Trump's urging, the court pointedly chose not to address another lingering issue: whether the criminal prosecution violates the Fifth Amendment's ban on \"double jeopardy,\" since he was acquitted by the Senate in February 2021 for election subversion, following his second impeachment.\nTrump faces criminal prosecution in three other jurisdictions: He faces a federal case over his alleged mishandling of classified documents while in office; a Georgia case over alleged election interference in that state's 2020 voting procedures; and a New York fraud case involving alleged hush money payments to an adult film star in 2016.\nJury selection in the New York case began on April 15.\nBut the start of the election interference trial in Washington remains in doubt. Depending on how the court rules, proceedings might not get underway until later this summer, in early fall or perhaps much later.\nThere is one other factor to consider: Trump could win re-election and then, upon taking office, order his attorney general to dismiss the Special Counsel and all his cases. Neither side's legal team has yet to publicly speculate on that scenario.\nSo, Jack Smith's case is frozen for now.\nAnd while this appeal would normally be decided in late June at the end of the Court's term, it is being expedited – so a ruling could come sooner.\nIf the Supreme Court rules in the government's favor, the trial court will \"un-pause\" – meaning all the discovery and pre-trial machinations that have been on hold would resume.\nTrump's team would likely argue to trial Judge Tanya Chutkan that they need several months at least from that point to actually be ready for a jury trial.\nChutkan said in December that she does not have jurisdiction over the matter while it is pending before the Supreme Court, and she put a pause on the case against him until the justices decide the matter on the merits.\nA sweeping constitutional victory for the former president would almost certainly mean that his election interference prosecution collapses, and could implicate his other pending criminal and civil cases.\nBut for now, Trump may have achieved a short-term win, even if he eventually loses before the Supreme Court – an indefinite delay in any trial that may carry over well past Election Day on Nov. 5.",

            "summary": "\"Real Time\" host Bill Maher took a swipe at his corporate colleagues at CNN for the network's non-stop bashing of former President Trump, suggesting it has gotten \"boring\" even for a Trump hater like himself.\nCNN, which has long been plagued with dwindling viewership, has relied on Maher for content over the past several months, more recently deciding to air encore episodes of his HBO show on Saturday nights as both networks are owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.\nOn Sunday's installment of his \"Club Random\" podcast, Maher told former TV anchor Katie Couric that he doesn't trust \"anyone\" in the legacy media, including CNN.\n\"I don't trust that anyone is giving me the full story. Everyone is giving me their spin on the story, including the places that used to be, I thought, fairly neutral, like CNN and The New York Times, I think, used to be a lot more neutral-\"\n\"You think they're sort of more activists?\" Couric asked.\n\"Yes,\" Maher responded. \"You could always slant any story… My earliest memories of my father and me talking about something… I remember him telling me like… the bias comes through somehow, and I remember the examples he used. He said, like, 'If you say he squawked about it, as opposed to he said.' Then he said, Robert Kennedy, so this must have been before ‘68 when he was killed. I was definitely under 12. He said, 'Robert Kennedy, if you like him, he is dedicated. If you hate him, he is ruthless.' But it got worse.\"\n\"And it got to the point where each side thinks they have to load their issues because we can't really be trusted with both sides because the other side is so powerful and such an existential threat, they both think the other side is an existential threat. We just have to do everything we can - we can't trust them to make sure they have the one true and correct opinion,\" Maher continued.\nCouric appeared to defend the media, saying how \"things changed so dramatically\" because of Trump and blamed him for the erasure of \"decorum\" and a \"level of basic decency\" in this country, points that Maher agreed with.\n\"For a place like CNN, I have total sympathy with them for that,\" Maher said. \"It was an impossible choice. Either you pretend that this is just the other side of normal, left, right, Republican, Democrat, or you start calling him a liar… I think the world needs a great CNN, so I'll do everything I can to help that organization. And they still do some great stuff and have some great people. I still tune to it when something happens.\"\nAfter noting that CNN had gotten rid of their pro-Trump voices, Maher then pointed to the network's Trump town hall and how the live audience filled with Republicans and independents \"loved it\" while the network's anchors, and others in the media, hated it.\n\"Here's what people saw in America. They saw Trump killing it, killing it with the crowd. Then you cut to a panel of six people who all just do nothing but dump on him and call him a liar. And America goes, 'Oh, didn't you just see that we like him?'\" Maher said. \"The people loved him and what he was saying. Then you cut to a panel of six know-it-alls in Washington who just do nothing but talk about the negative. I'm all in on the negative. No one's been harder on Trump than me. I get it, and I'm bored with it. There's a different way to do this, I think.\"\n\"So what is it?\" Couric asked.\n\"Not to defend Trump, but to defend the people who still vote for him,\" Maher responded. \"Because what they see on the other side, to them, is even more dangerous. Because it's very closer to home. 'My kid is coming home from school, and he thinks he's a racist.' He's five. What have you been telling him? 'My son thinks maybe he's not a boy,' and maybe that's true, that happens. Those things are what they say, 'that's why I'm voting for Trump.'\"\n\"A conservative guy once said to me, 'What you don't get about Trump is we don't like him either.' Now, that's not true for all people. There are people who just love his dirty drawers, and they are dirty. Lots of people, it's like that. 'We don't like him. He's all that stands between us and madness.' That's their view. I would like that view presented. That view, not election deniers, but just try to understand why even the election-denying thing is not a deal breaker for these people. And I think they're wrong. But I don't hate them. And they're not stupid.\"\nCNN did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\nLast month, Maher similarly took aim at The New York Times for no longer being a \"great newspaper.\"\n\"What is annoying about it is that it's not just, just give me the facts,\" Maher said. \"There's way too much editorializing on the front page, the way the articles that are just supposed to be the fact kind of articles are slanted one way. And I'm not even necessarily for the other side! I just want someone to tell me the whole truth, not just like your version of it. Because you can lie by what you omit. And both sides do.\"",

A Democrat prosecutor, Alvin Bragg, is keeping the Republican nominee off the campaign trail for six weeks. That means Donald Trump isn't even allowed to attend his son Barron's high school graduation. If he tries to go, the judge will throw him in jail for that, too.\n...\nThe media doesn't even read their own polls. A New York Times poll says three quarters of Americans aren't even paying attention to these show trials. The people who are paying attention are the ones watching in the mainstream media, and those anchors won't even tell you the case has been brought by a Democrat and overseen by a Democrat donor judge, whose family is being paid by Democrats.\nYou know this because you watch Fox. You read. You do your own research. But the media thinks you're just a poor, dumb hillbilly, and you're just jealous of the smart Democrat lawyers who control the establishment.",
