            "title": "Biden's new Title IX rules protect LGBTQ students, but trans sports rule still on hold",

            "clean_url": "nbcnews.com",
            "excerpt": "The new rule makes 'crystal clear that everyone can access schools that are safe, welcoming and that respect their rights,' Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said.",
            "summary": "The rights of LGBTQ students will be protected by federal law and victims of campus sexual assault will gain new safeguards under rules finalized Friday by the Biden administration.\nThe new provisions are part of a revised Title IX regulation issued by the Education Department, fulfilling a campaign pledge by President Joe Biden. He had promised to dismantle rules created by former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who added new protections for students accused of sexual misconduct.\nNotably absent from Biden's policy, however, is any mention of transgender athletes.\nThe administration originally planned to include a new policy forbidding schools from enacting outright bans on transgender athletes, but that provision was put on hold. The delay is widely seen as a political maneuver during an election year in which Republicans have rallied around bans on transgender athletes in girls' sports.\nInstead, Biden is officially undoing sexual assault rules put in place by his predecessor and current election-year opponent, former President Donald Trump. The final policy drew praise from victims' advocates, while Republicans said it erodes the rights of accused students.\nThe new rule makes 'crystal clear that everyone can access schools that are safe, welcoming and that respect their rights,' Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said.\n'No one should face bullying or discrimination just because of who they are, who they love,' Cardona told reporters. 'Sadly, this happens all too often.'\nBiden's regulation is meant to clarify schools' obligations under Title IX, the 1972 women's rights law that outlaws discrimination based on sex in education. It applies to colleges and elementary and high schools that receive federal money. The update is to take effect in August.\nAmong the biggest changes is new recognition that Title IX protects LGBTQ students — a source of deep conflict with Republicans.\nThe 1972 law doesn't directly address the issue, but the new rules clarify that Title IX also forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. LGBTQ students who face discrimination will be entitled to a response from their school under Title IX, and those failed by their schools can seek recourse from the federal government.\nMany Republicans say Congress never intended such protections under Title IX. A federal judge previously blocked Biden administration guidance to the same effect after 20 Republican-led states challenged the policy.\nRep. Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina and chair of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, said the new regulation threatens decades of advancement for women and girls.\n'This final rule dumps kerosene on the already raging fire that is Democrats' contemptuous culture war that aims to radically redefine sex and gender,' Foxx said in a statement.\nThe revision was proposed nearly two years ago but has been slowed by a comment period that drew 240,000 responses, a record for the Education Department.\nMany of the changes are meant to ensure that schools and colleges respond to complaints of sexual misconduct. In general, the rules widen the type of misconduct that institutions are required to address, and it grants more protections to students who bring accusations.\nChief among the changes is a wider definition of sexual harassment. Schools now must address any unwelcome sex-based conduct that is so 'severe or pervasive' that it limits a student's equal access to an education.\nUnder the DeVos rules, conduct had to be 'severe, pervasive and objectively offensive,' a higher bar that pushed some types of misconduct outside the purview of Title IX.\nColleges will no longer be required to hold live hearings to allow students to cross-examine one another through representatives — a signature provision from the DeVos rules.\nLive hearings are allowed under the Biden rules, but they're optional and carry new limits. Students must be able to participate from hearings remotely, for example, and schools must bar questions that are 'unclear or harassing.'\nAs an alternative to live hearings, college officials can interview students separately, allowing each student to suggest questions and get a recording of the responses.\nThose hearings were a major point of contention with victims' advocates, who said it forced sexual assault survivors to face their attackers and discouraged people from reporting assaults. Supporters said it gave accused students a fair process to question their accusers, arguing that universities had become too quick to rule against accused students.\nVictims' advocates applauded the changes and urged colleges to implement them quickly.\n'After years of pressure from students and survivors of sexual violence, the Biden Administration's Title IX update will make schools safer and more accessible for young people, many of whom experienced irreparable harm while they fought for protection and support,' said Emma Grasso Levine, a senior manager at the group Know Your IX.\nDespite the focus on safeguards for victims, the new rules preserve certain protections for accused students.\nAll students must have equal access to present evidence and witnesses under the new policy, and all students must have equal access to evidence. All students will be allowed to bring an advisor to campus hearings, and colleges must have an appeals process.\nIn general, accused students won't be able to be disciplined until after they're found responsible for misconduct, although the regulation allows for 'emergency' removals if it's deemed a matter of campus safety.\nThe latest overhaul continues a back-and-forth political battle as presidential administrations repeatedly rewrite the rules around campus sexual misconduct.\nThe DeVos rules were themselves an overhaul of an Obama-era policy that was intended to force colleges to take accusations of campus sexual assault more seriously. Now, after years of nearly constant changes, some colleges have been pushing for a political middle ground to end the whiplash.\nThe Associated Press",

            "excerpt": "Census Bureau data shows K-12 enrollment continued its downward trajectory in 2022, and experts say it's more than just declining birth rates.",
            "summary": "More and more, parents are opting America's children out of public school.\nThe share of children ages 5 to 17 enrolled in public schools fell by almost 4 percentage points from 2012 to 2022, an NBC News analysis of Census Bureau data found, even as the overall population grew.\nNBC News' analysis found:\n87.0% of children were enrolled in public school in 2022, compared to 90.7% in 2012.\nIn Kentucky, the share of school-age children in public schools decreased by almost 8 percentage points.\nIn South Carolina, the share of children enrolled in public schools decreased by 7.4 percentage points.\nIn Alaska, enrollment decreased by nearly 7 percentage points. During the same period, the share of 5 to 17 year-olds enrolled in private schools increased by 2 percentage points, the Census Bureau data showed. Charter schools saw a similar increase, according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, a nonprofit group dedicated to advancing charter schools.\nEducators and researchers say the swing has been caused in part by laws that have targeted public schools while propping up alternatives.\n'[The rise in charter schools] is a thread of the larger campaign of privatization,' said Abbie Cohen, a Ph.D. candidate in UCLA's School of Education and Information Studies. 'Those two things are happening at the same time, and I don't think it's a coincidence.'\nPolicies that make private, charter and homeschooling options more available to families — dubbed 'school choice' by advocates — have expanded rapidly since 2022. Such policies grant families public funds for alternative schooling in the form of vouchers, tax-credit scholarships, refundable tax credits and more. In 2023, at least 146 school choice bills were introduced across 43 states, according to FutureEd, an education-focused think tank at Georgetown University.\nNineteen school choice laws were enacted last year in 17 states, including South Carolina and Florida, which have seen some of the most dramatic declines of students enrolled in public schools.\nAs part of the push for school choice, states are eliminating income limits and other eligibility requirements, allowing higher-income families to receive benefits. Eight states passed such laws or created such programs in 2023, FutureEd's data shows, bringing the total number of states with these programs — commonly referred to as 'universal school choice' — to 10.\nThough Kentucky has seen the most students leave public schools, it is one of 18 states without a school choice program, and the state doesn't fund charters. Homeschooling and 'microschooling,' where students are homeschooled together and may be supervised by someone other than their own parents, are increasingly popular alternatives. An EdChoice/Morning Consult poll reported that 15% of parents in Kentucky prefer homeschooling, compared to 9% of parents nationwide.\nRobert Enlow, the CEO of the nonprofit school choice advocacy group EdChoice, said he is 'agnostic' to which options are chosen, but believes the money should follow each student wherever they go.\n'Families are saying, ‘Let me have the resources that are due to me, that I get through taxes that are set aside for my kid, and then let me choose,'' Enlow said.\nAt the same time that states are pushing school choice programs, public schools — already dealing with declining enrollment — have faced budget cuts, teacher shortages, and laws and fights over what is taught in the classroom.\nMore than 20 states have considered bills since 2022 that would give parents more control over the curriculum in public schools, from granting parents access to course materials prior to classes, to banning instruction on sexual orientation and gender and allowing parents to opt their children out of any classes.\nOne state that has pushed such laws is Florida. The state has passed several parent rights laws since 2020, including changes to make it easier for parents to ban books from classes, a ban against discussing sexuality and gender identity in younger grades and a ban on teaching critical race theory in classes.\nFlorida's 5 to 17-year-old population has grown 9% since 2012, but NBC News' analysis found that its public school enrollment fell 7% during that span.\nAndrew Spar, the president of the Florida Education Association, the state's largest teachers union, said new laws have unclear directions and handcuff teachers' ability to instruct without fear of retaliation for what's discussed in class.\n'In Florida, there's so much micromanaging of our public schools, so many bureaucratic rules and laws that get in the way, that it becomes increasingly difficult for us to do our jobs,' Spar said. 'Teachers are vilified; they can't do their jobs.'\nCohen, from UCLA, said parents are unenrolling students from public schools when they either feel the curriculum is not teaching accurate history, or hope for more conservative changes in school policies and curricula. Her research found that funding cuts are among the policies 'fueling mistrust' in public schools and could be leading families to alternatives.\nThe states with the largest declines in public school enrollment also have the lowest per-pupil spending, Census Bureau data shows. Educators and researchers question whether public schools will bounce back from recent enrollment declines as districts experience a wave of financial struggles and closures.\n'Who is hurting the most are the students who have been most historically marginalized in society,' Cohen said. 'When more kids are leaving the public schools, that's less funding for the public schools and those who are left, are left with less.'\nCatherine Allen",

In it, Lúz makes history as the first queer Asian and Latina superhero, coming to the aid of her best friend, a fellow Latina superhero called La Borinqueña.\nMiranda-Rodriguez told NBC News that he initially got the idea to write La La as a person who has endometriosis from his wife, Kyung Jeon-Miranda, who also has endometriosis. Jeon-Miranda — who runs their charitable efforts through the La Borinqueña Grant Awards — was an integral part of writing scenes in which La La grappled with endometriosis flare-ups and doctor's visits.\n'Kyung came up with the idea of giving our protagonist Lúz endometriosis because she felt that with our comic books, we have already used the best tools to engage readers with social issues,' he said.\nAcclaimed actor Rosario Dawson, who has collaborated with Miranda-Rodriguez on several projects, also has endometriosis and has detailed her struggle with the condition and recently discussed it with Jeon-Miranda to help raise awareness about the condition.\nCharacters from 'Lúz La Luminosa' by Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez. Will Rosado and Christopher Sotomayor / Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez Miranda-Rodriguez said he's hopeful that La La Lúz's story can help spread awareness of endometriosis and be used as an educational tool to aid new patients' understanding of the disease. During the Puerto Rico Comic Con on March 29, Rosa Seguí Cordero, a candidate for the Puerto Rico Senate, expressed support for the new comic on social media.\nThe new comic features an afterword with more information about endometriosis by Idhaliz Flores, a professor at Puerto Rico's Ponce Health Sciences University who specializes in endometriosis research.\nFor Miranda, 'my hope is that this comic book may find its way into classrooms and possibly even health institutions, clinics, hospitals so that it can be used as a tool to educate young women around endometriosis.\"\nEmi Tuyetnhi Tran",

            "summary": "Four months after a contentious congressional hearing led to the resignations of two Ivy League presidents, Columbia University's president is set to appear before the same committee over questions of antisemitism and the school's response to conflicts on campus over the Israel-Hamas war.\nNemat Shafik, Columbia's leader, was originally asked to testify at the House Education and Workforce Committee's hearing in December, but she declined, citing scheduling conflicts.\nThe December hearing instead featured the presidents of Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, whose lawyerly responses drew fierce backlash and fueled weeks of controversy. The presidents of Penn and Harvard have since resigned.\nDuring a heated line of questioning at the December hearing, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., asked the university leaders to answer whether 'calling for the genocide of Jews' would violate each university's code of conduct.\nLiz Magill, the then-president of Penn, and Claudine Gay, then-president of Harvard, both said it would depend on the details of the situation. MIT president Sally Kornbluth said that she had not heard a calling for the genocide of Jews on MIT's campus, and that speech 'targeted at individuals, not making public statements,' would be considered harassment.\nAlmost immediately, the careful responses from the university presidents drew criticism from donors, alumni and politicians. Magill resigned shortly after the hearing. Gay stepped down in January, following an extended campaign that accused her of plagiarism.\nShafik is expected to testify Wednesday along with Columbia University board members. Tensions and accusations of hate and bias have roiled Columbia, like at its sibling colleges, but Shafik has the benefit of hindsight in preparing her remarks. In an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal Tuesday, Shafik emphasized the delicate balance between protecting free speech and fostering a safe environment for students on campus.\n'Calling for the genocide of a people — whether they are Israelis or Palestinians, Jews, Muslims or anyone else — has no place in a university community,' Shafik wrote. 'Such words are outside the bounds of legitimate debate and unimaginably harmful.'\nSince the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, tensions have run high on university campuses. Jewish students have said that their schools are not doing enough to address instances of antisemitism. Meanwhile, students who have organized in support of Palestinian rights say they have been disproportionately targeted and censored by campus administrations.\nColumbia, along with many other colleges and school districts, is the subject of a series of Department of Education investigations into antisemitism and Islamophobia on campuses. It has also been targeted by lawsuits from both sides. The New York Civil Liberties Union sued over whether the university singled out two pro-Palestinian student organizations when it suspended them from campus over protests in the fall. Groups of Jewish students have also filed suit, saying antisemitism on campus violates their civil rights.",

            "excerpt": "The University of Texas at Austin sparked controversy last week when it laid off nearly 60 employees to comply with Texas' new DEI ban earlier this month.",
            "summary": "Some 200 students at the University of Texas at Austin disrupted a virtual faculty council meeting conducted by university president Jay Hartzell on Monday to oppose the school's decision earlier this month to lay off nearly 60 employees who worked in diversity, equity and inclusion-related positions on campus.\nWhen Hartzell and other university officials logged on to the meeting, they were met with scores of students, all sharing a black background that read 'No DEI = Not Our Texas' in red letters.\n'We wanted to show them that we want transparency, we want communication from him, we want his support. We want him to address us and to clarify his questions about [State Bill] 17 compliance and the changes he's been sweeping through our campus,' Christian Mira, of UT Austin's Queer Trans Black Indigenous People of Color Agency, said of Hartzell. 'If he's going to claim that everything he does is for the students, it's on our shoulders, it's our burden to disprove that. We're not happy with the direction the university's going in.'\nIn a message to the school community on April 2, Hartzell announced that UT Austin would close its Division of Campus and Community Engagement and no longer fund programs or activities that support DEI, in accordance with SB 17, a Texas law passed last June that essentially bans DEI efforts at higher education institutions. On Monday, he confirmed reports that 57 employees who worked in DEI positions had been laid off, with eight moved from the positions back to regular teaching jobs. A spokesperson for the university, Brian Davis, confirmed the numbers and, when asked about specific allegations from students and faculty, referred NBC News to Hartzell's initial message to the university community.\nHartzell wrote in his initial message that the university had begun a 'multiphase process' to make changes required by the new law. As a result, UT Austin leaders have broadened some programs, redistributed others and closed DEI programs altogether.\nCritics of the layoffs said they were blindsided by the news and that Hartzell has not answered their many questions.\n'People are really frustrated. It feels really unfair,' Karma Chávez, the chair of the university's Mexican American and Latina/o Studies program, told NBC News. 'The folks that I've spoken to, I think, are mostly pretty angry. I think there's also a sense of feeling pretty disillusioned with the workplace.'\nChávez said that those impacted by the layoffs are mostly people of color. 'Largely those are Black and brown, queer and trans folks. It's been pretty intense. It really doesn't feel like the university has the back of anyone who used to do this kind of work,' Chávez said.\nThe department that was shuttered provided resources for 'those who may face the most significant challenges' in accessing education. In addition to layoffs, the university shut down several student support programs like Monarch, which helped undocumented students with college applications, financial aid and internships. The division also housed the Women's Community Center, previously called the Gender and Sexuality Center, and it is not on the school's list of programs to relocate, according to the Austin American-Statesman. The university's beloved Multicultural Engagement Center, which students have called a 'home away from home,' also shut down in January after SB 17 went into effect.",

            "excerpt": "Graham was among the earliest opponents of the Iraq war, saying it diverted America's focus on the battle against terrorism centered in Afghanistan.",
            "summary": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Former U.S. Sen. and two-term Florida Gov. Bob Graham, who gained national prominence as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks and as an early critic of the Iraq war, has died. He was 87.\nGraham's family announced the death Tuesday in a statement posted on X by his daughter Gwen Graham.\n'We are deeply saddened to report the passing of a visionary leader, dedicated public servant, and even more importantly, a loving husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather,' the family said.\nGraham, who served three terms in the Senate, made an unsuccessful bid for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, emphasizing his opposition to the Iraq invasion.\nBut his bid was delayed by heart surgery in January 2003, and he was never able to gain enough traction with voters to catch up, bowing out that October. He didn't seek reelection in 2004 and was replaced by Republican Mel Martinez.\nGraham was a man of many quirks. He perfected the 'workdays' political gimmick of spending a day doing various jobs from horse stall mucker to FBI agent and kept a meticulous diary, noting almost everyone he spoke with, everything he ate, the TV shows he watched and even his golf scores.\nGraham said the notebooks were a working tool for him and he was reluctant to describe his emotions or personal feelings in them.\n'I review them for calls to be made, memos to be dictated, meetings I want to follow up on and things people promise to do,' he said.\nGraham was among the earliest opponents of the Iraq war, saying it diverted America's focus on the battle against terrorism centered in Afghanistan. He was also critical of President George W. Bush for failing to have an occupation plan in Iraq after the U.S. military threw out Saddam Hussein in 2003.\nGraham said Bush took the United States into the war by exaggerating claims of the danger presented by the Iraqi weapons of destruction that were never found. He said Bush distorted intelligence data and argued it was more serious than the sexual misconduct issues that led the House to impeach President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s. It led him to launch his short, abortive presidential bid.\n'The quagmire in Iraq is a distraction that the Bush administration, and the Bush administration alone, has created,' Graham said in 2003.\nDuring his 18 years in Washington, Graham worked well with colleagues from both parties, particularly Florida Republican Connie Mack during their dozen years together in the Senate.\nAs a politician, few were better. Florida voters hardly considered him the wealthy Harvard-educated attorney that he was.\nGraham's political career spanned five decades, beginning with his election to the Florida House of Representatives in 1966.\nHe won a state Senate seat in 1970 and then was elected governor in 1978. He was re-elected in 1982. Four years later, he won the first of three terms in the U.S. Senate when he ousted incumbent Republican Paula Hawkins.\nGraham remained widely popular with Florida voters — winning reelection by wide margins in 1992 and 1998 when he carried 63 of 67 counties. In that latter election, he defeated Charlie Crist, who later served as a Republican governor from 2007 to 2011.\n'He blew me out of the water, and I came to know even more so why during the course of the campaign,' Crist said Tuesday night. 'I learned to respect him even more than I already had, and love him for the good, decent man that he was.'\nCrist, who has since switched parties and most recently served as a U.S. representative, said Graham was an influence on him.\n'I always felt that when he was governor, that he was trying to govern for the people of Florida — not in any way political or partisan — and I took that to heart and tried to, in some small way, emulate it,' Crist said.\nHouse Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi called Graham 'a patriotic American' and thanked him for his 'distinguished public service.' She highlighted his work on the inquiry into 9/11 and said he 'bravely opposed entry into the war in Iraq.'\n'He brought his love for his family and for his state of Florida to the Senate, where he served with immense dignity and courage,' she said in a statement Tuesday.\nEven when in Washington, Graham never took his eye off the state and the leadership in Tallahassee.\nWhen Gov. Jeb Bush and the Republican-controlled Legislature eliminated the Board of Regents in 2001, Graham saw it as a move to politicize the state university system. He led a successful petition drive the next year for a state constitutional amendment that created the Board of Governors to assume the regents' role.\nDaniel Robert Graham was born Nov. 9, 1936, in Coral Gables, where his father, Ernest 'Cap' Graham, had moved from South Dakota and established a large dairy operation. Young Bob milked cows, built fences and scooped manure as a teenager. One of his half-brothers, Phillip Graham, was publisher of The Washington Post and Newsweek until he took his own life in 1963, just a year after Bob Graham's graduation from Harvard Law.\nGraham was president of the student body at Miami Senior High School and attended the University of Florida, graduating in 1959.\nIn 1966 he was elected to the Florida Legislature, where he focused largely on education and health care issues.\nGraham got off to a shaky start as Florida's chief executive, and was dubbed 'Gov. Jello' for some early indecisiveness. He shook that label through his handling of several serious crises.\nAs governor he also signed numerous death warrants, founded the Save the Manatee Club with entertainer Jimmy Buffett and led efforts to establish several environmental programs.\nGraham pushed through a bond program to buy beaches and barrier islands threatened by development and started the Save Our Everglades program to protect the state's water supply, wetlands and endangered species.\nGraham also was known for his 408 'workdays,' including stints as a housewife, boxing ring announcer, flight attendant and arson investigator. They grew out of a teaching stint as a member of the Florida Senate's Education Committee and then morphed into a campaign gimmick that helped him relate to the average voter.\n'This has been a very important part of my development as a public official, my learning at a very human level what the people of Florida expect, what they want, what their aspirations are and then trying to interpret that and make it policy that will improve their lives' said Graham in 2004 as he completed his final job as a Christmas gift wrapper.\nAfter leaving public life in 2005, Graham spent much of his time at a public policy center named after him at the University of Florida and pushing the Legislature to require more civics classes in the state's public schools.\nGraham was one of five members selected for an independent commission by President Barack Obama in June 2010 to investigate a massive BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that threatened sea life and beaches along several southeastern Gulf states.",

            "summary": "RALEIGH, N.C. — The future of diversity, equity and inclusion staff jobs in North Carolina's public university system could be at stake after a five-person committee swiftly voted to repeal a key policy Wednesday.\nThe Committee on University Governance, within the University of North Carolina Board of Governors that oversees 17 schools, voted in less than four minutes to reverse and replace a policy related to DEI. The full board of 24 members is to vote on the matter again next month, and if approved, the repeal would take effect immediately.\nIf the policy is fully repealed, the UNC system could join other major universities in dismantling their diversity offices. Among the most notable, the University of Florida in Gainesville announced in a memo last month that it was scrapping its office and shifting its funding for faculty recruitment instead.\nUniversity of North Carolina Chapel Hill in 2023. Eros Hoagland / Getty Images file In Texas, universities saw major cuts in their diversity and inclusion staff in 2024 in compliance with a state ban signed into law last year. The state higher education board in Kansas was also to address a ban on diversity initiatives in hiring staff and accepting students Wednesday.\nAt least 20 states have seen Republican bill proposals seeking to limit diversity and inclusion programs in several public institutions such as universities.\nDiversity, equity and inclusion is defined by the American Psychological Association as a framework to guide 'fair treatment and full participation of all people,' especially those belonging to minority groups. It has become a recurring point of contention for conservatives who argue DEI programs are discriminatory.\nThe proposed policy change, first reported by The News & Observer of Raleigh, would impact a diversity, equity and inclusion regulation adopted in 2019. It defines the roles of various DEI positions — such as a system office diversity and inclusion liaison and diversity officers across the university system — and the establishment of a diversity and inclusion council made up of members representing each university, according to the policy.\nUnder the policy, the officers' responsibilities include assisting the chancellor with diversity policy and programming, in addition to facilitating training for students and staff.\nBut Andrew Tripp, senior vice president for the UNC System Office's legal affairs team, said the change would reaffirm 'the university's commitment to non-discrimination and institutional neutrality.'\nThe policy that could replace the existing regulation does not include the outlined responsibilities of DEI officers and liaisons, suggesting they may be eliminated. Other inclusion efforts such as tracking the university's diversity metrics and giving reports to university boards will continue, the replacement policy said.\nUNC-Chapel Hill — the system's flagship campus and whose website says has an office for diversity and inclusion with a 12-person staff — will review the policy change and work with the university system if implemented, spokesperson Kevin Best said in an emailed statement.\n'As the Board of Governors noted, equality of opportunity in education and employment is a long-standing commitment of the University of North Carolina as a core value in service to our vibrant and growing state,' Best said. 'As part of that mission, UNC-Chapel Hill will continue to welcome people from all walks of life with a variety of experiences and perspectives who come here to learn, work and live.'\nImmediately after the vote to repeal the diversity policy with no questions or discussion, the governance committee went into closed session, according to the agenda. Closed sessions are not subject to public record, according to state statutes.\nEfforts to dissolve university diversity efforts are a 'disservice' to students and create 'controversy and volatility,' former UNC System President Tom Ross said in a joint statement with Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper after the vote. Instead, Ross, who served as president from 2011 to 2016, said universities should celebrate diversity.\n'Republican legislative and university leaders who attack diversity at our public universities are failing in their duty to protect students while threatening our ability to recruit top scientists, researchers and innovators who power our economy,' Cooper said.\nHowever, conservative-leaning advocacy group Carolina Partnership for Reform said in a statement the new policy would 'go a long way toward rooting out DEI bureaucracies.'\nThe full UNC Board of Governors is scheduled to meet May 22-23 in Raleigh. Members of the board are elected to four-year terms by the state Senate and House of Representatives, which Republicans have controlled since 2011.\nRepublican House Speaker Tim Moore said fellow Republicans have expressed interest in taking up anti-DEI legislation in the session opening next Wednesday. He recently told reporters the legislature may allow the university boards to review their diversity policies first before introducing any bills.\n'It's still at the conversation stage,' Moore said.\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .",

Everett Leland Yager, who died in a training accident in California more than 70 years ago.\nYager's remains were collected from the accident site at the time and turned over to his family, who buried them in his hometown in Missouri. It's unclear how the jawbone made its way to Arizona, but experts believe a bird may have picked it up.\nCairenn Binder, assistant director of the Ramapo College IGG Center, said the school's summer bootcamp students worked with experienced researchers.\n\"This case was a lesson in expecting the unexpected, and a testament to the power of IGG education at Ramapo College of New Jersey,\" Binder said.\nA genetic profile was developed using genome sequencing and bioinformatics in May after a human identification center in Texas sent a sample to a forensics lab in Salt Lake City, Utah.\nThe bootcamp students took over the case in July and found a potential candidate within two days, turning over its case to the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office.\nYager's daughter provided a DNA sample last month, which was found to have a parent/child match with the genetic profile. The remains will be turned over to Yager's family.\nDoha Madani",

The deal also includes paid parental leave benefits, artificial intelligence provisions, and an improved residual in streaming.\nThe contract was set to expire on Friday, and writers were set to begin picketing next week if an agreement had not been reached.\nSesame Workshop lauded what it described as an 'industry benchmark' of a deal.\n'We value our writers and their significant contributions to the creative process, which are integral to our ability to deliver on our nonprofit mission,' a Sesame Workshop spokeswoman said.

'We want everyone to know that they deserve to feel safe and respected.'\nNeither the university nor MSU Police immediately responded to requests for further comment.\nIf only anti-LGBTQ bias were at play, Michigan's Attorney General Dana Nessel noted, it is not possible for prosecutors to charge the suspects with a hate crime. Existing Michigan state law does not prohibit intimidation, harassment, threats or harm based on an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity.\n'It's not an included class, under the Ethnic Intimidation Act,' she said, addressing reporters at an unrelated news conference on Tuesday.

            "excerpt": "An autopsy report details how Kaczynski, 81, was found dead in his solitary cell in June at the Federal Medical Center in Butner, North Carolina.",
            "summary": "Ted Kaczynski, the imprisoned domestic terrorist known as the 'Unabomber,' was diagnosed with rectal cancer in March 2021, and a month prior to killing himself in June 2023, 'was noted to be depressed and sent for psychiatric evaluation,' according to his autopsy report obtained by NBC News.\nKaczynski was 81, and a senior law enforcement official had said at the time that he had been diagnosed with cancer, although its type and severity were unclear.\nNow, 10 months after Kaczynski died and NBC News first filed a Freedom of Information Act request related to his case, his autopsy report offers new details into the health and final months of a man who, for two decades, waged a deadly bombing spree that killed three people and injured 23 others. It ended with his capture in the Montana wilderness in 1996; he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\nThe Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in North Carolina lists the cause of death as hanging, with a shoelace used as a ligature, at Kaczynski's solitary cell at the Federal Medical Center in Butner, northeast of Durham.\nKaczynski's death by suicide raises questions about whether it was preventable and why he had access to a shoelace, said Jack Donson, a retired longtime Federal Bureau of Prisons case manager and executive director of the Federal Prison Education and Reform Alliance, a nonprofit organization.\nIt's unclear whether Kaczynski's depression resulted in a suicide watch, which Donson said would include 24/7 direct supervision and removal of objects that could allow inmates to harm themselves. 'It's virtually impossible to stop anyone from harming themselves other than somebody on formal suicide watch,' he added.\nBut, he said, given Kaczynski's status within the BOP, 'it's somewhat surprising a high-profile inmate coming out of maximum-security was able to obtain shoelaces in a hospital environment to kill themselves — especially him.'\nThe 2019 suicide of wealthy financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in his BOP jail cell in New York resulted in an investigation that found a failure to monitor and other lapses, including ensuring that he had a cellmate as recommended.\nIn response to Kaczynski's death and whether it was avoidable, BOP officials declined to comment specifically about his case or the conditions of his confinement for 'safety and security reasons.' In general, the agency said, in cases of deaths by homicide or suicide, the BOP follows a protocol to preserve and document evidence 'needed to support subsequent investigation,' and there are also guidelines for suicide prevention and training at each facility.\nThe policy notes that inmates in detention or disciplinary segregation 'often may be at higher risk for suicidal behavior' and are 'monitored for signs of potential suicide risk.' It's unclear if Kaczynski had ever been monitored for suicide risk during his time at Butner.\nA Justice Department inspector general report in February found that the BOP had failed to prevent the deaths of 187 inmates who died by suicide over eight years, with 'numerous operational and managerial deficiencies' creating unsafe conditions. The report focused on deaths that appeared to likely be preventable and not ones that involved inmates who had more complex questions of medical care.\nAside from Kaczynski's rectal cancer diagnosis, which medical examiners said was at stage 4, his autopsy notes that he had a history of mental health disorders and was feeling depressed about a month before his death.\n'At around midnight on June 10, 2023, he was found to have hung himself from a handicap rail in his room with shoelaces,' the report says. 'He was initially pulseless, and resuscitation was initiated.'\nThere was a 'return of spontaneous circulation' before he was transferred to Duke University Hospital in Durham where his blood pressure remained low, according to the report. He was pronounced dead at 8:07 a.m.\n'The decedent was not on any prescription medications and had no prior suicidal ideations or attempts,' the report added. 'Federal Law Enforcement had no concern for foul play.'\nThe autopsy also noted that there was 'extensive injury' to Kaczynski's rib cage due to chest compressions and that his rectal cancer had spread to the liver and both lungs. He suffered 'massive blood loss' as the chest compressions caused 'lacerations of his severely diseased liver,' but the report said that was only caused by 'his own inciting actions of hanging himself, and thus the manner is appropriately suicide.'\nKaczynski, a Harvard-educated mathematician who railed against technology, planted homemade pipe bombs — targeting universities, an American Airlines flight and others — in a campaign from 1978 to 1995 that included three deaths and multiple maimings, federal prosecutors said. His notoriety as the 'Unabomber' came from an FBI code name stemming from his university and airline bombing targets.\nKaczynski had taunted officials with a rambling manifesto and was captured following one of the longest FBI manhunts in history. In 1998, while awaiting trial, authorities said Kaczynski had attempted to hang himself with his underwear and was placed on 24-hour suicide watch in jail. He insisted, however, that he wasn't mentally ill despite being diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic.\nTo avoid the death penalty, Kaczynski pleaded guilty to his crimes and was placed into the federal Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, a high-security facility that has held some of the nation's most wanted terrorists and criminal kingpins.\nIn March 2021, Kaczynski complained of rectal bleeding. He was transferred that fall from Florence to the Federal Medical Center in Butner for treatment for cancer, medical examiners said. He began biweekly chemotherapy until March 2023, 'when he refused any further treatments due to negative side effects and his poor prognosis,' they added.\nAn oncologist noted that he 'appeared depressed' about a month before his death.\nIf you or someone you know is in crisis, call 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.

Ye also contemplates targeting an elementary school and says that he wants to be famous,\" police said.\nInvestigators also found internet searches, drawings and documents \"related to mass threats of violence,\" according to the statement.\nPolice plan to provide more information about the case during a news conference Friday morning.\nPolice added that security had been increased at schools as a result of the investigation, particularly Thomas S. Wootton High School in Rockville, where Ye had attended in person before being sent to a string of psychiatric hospitals.\nAuthorities first learned of the document — which Ye called a 'memoir' — after being contacted by an informant named in court records only as \"Witness-One.\" The person spent time in a psychiatric facility with Ye, who said the memoir was a fictional account of a high school shooting.\nAccording to court records, the memoir opens with a disclaimer that says: \"This is not threat of violence, nor does it represent the author's beliefs.\"\nBut its content was enough to alarm authorities and court records allege Ye put at least five people at Wootton High School \"at a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury if the threat were carried out.\"\n\"It appears that the 'manifesto' has portions of fictional and non-fictional qualities and is based on reality with a plan of Threats of Mass Violence,\" officials said in court documents.\nYe allegedly wrote of wanting to shoot up his school with an AR-15, targeting the elementary school because little kids make easier targets, wanting to be famous and wanting to set the record for the most kills.\nHis internet searches included gun ranges 'near me' and searches about school shootings including Sandy Hook and Parkland, prosecutors said. He was also in a Discord chat group with others focused on glorifying school shootings, the charging document said.\nYe was hospitalized from December 2022 for threatening to \"shoot up school,\" and for having homicidal and suicidal ideations, according to court records. It was not immediately clear why Ye was released the next month as court records say it was determined he was still preoccupied with schools shootings, self-harm and explosives.\nYe had not attended school since the fall of 2022, a public school spokesman said, but had continued his education through a remote learning program.\nPatrick Smith",

            "summary": "Columbia University's president strongly denounced antisemitism during a Congressional hearing Wednesday, saying after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, 'the world changed, and so did my focus.'\n'Antisemitism has no place on our campus, and I am personally committed to doing everything I can to confront it directly,' President Nemat 'Minouche' Shafik told the Republican-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce. 'Israel was brutally attacked by Hamas terrorists and very soon it became clear that these horrific events would ignite fear and anguish across our campus.'\nShafik faced questions on her handling of antisemitism on campus after the Oct. 7 attack alongside two members of Columbia's Board of Trustees and the head of the university's antisemitism task force. She faced particular scrutiny for how the university handled faculty members who made comments about Hamas that were perceived as antisemitic.\nRep. Tim Walberg, R-M.I., grilled Shafik about Joseph Massad, a tenured professor in Columbia's Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies department who published comments in October calling Hamas' attack a 'stunning victory.'\n'I do condemn his statement. I am appalled by what he said,' Shafik responded. 'He has been spoken to.'\nThe hearing became particularly heated when Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., pressed Shafik on why Massad is still listed on Columbia's website as the chair of the academic review committee.\n'Do you have my commitment that he will be removed as chair today?' Stefanik asked Shafik, who said she would get back to Stefanik with the facts.\nStefanik also questioned Shafik about Mohamed Abdou, a visiting professor at the Middle East Institute at Columbia. She referred to an Oct. 11 post on Facebook in which Abdou wrote, 'Yes, I'm with the muqawamah (the resistance) be it Hamas and Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad but up to a point.'\nWhen asked about consequences, Shafik said Abdou 'will never work at Columbia again.'\nMinouche Shafik's testimony came after she declined a December request, citing scheduling conflicts. Tom Williams / CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images Her appearance in Congress came months after declining to testify at a December hearing, citing scheduling conflicts.\nThat hearing saw testimonies from the presidents of the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who all drew intense scrutiny for their responses to questions regarding antisemitism and hate speech on campus. Penn and Harvard's presidents have since resigned.\nWhen Shafik and her colleagues were asked by Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-OR, whether calling for the genocide of Jewish people violates Columbia's rules — the same question posed to Harvard, MIT and Penn's presidents — all answered 'yes.' She also asked Shafik about the chants 'by any means necessary' and 'intifada,' which Shafik said were distressing.\nAhead of her hearing, Shafik published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal about what she planned to speak about in Congress.\n\"Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, I have spent the most of my time addressing its aftershocks,\" Shafik wrote. \"It is hard to describe how difficult this has been, especially on a large, diverse urban campus with students from all over the world and a long tradition of political activism.\"\nThe university is currently being sued by five Jewish students and two student organizations after it suspended the student groups Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace last November. In March, Shafik confirmed that a \"number\" of Columbia students were suspended after allegedly participating in an unauthorized panel called \"Resistance 101\" that featured speakers who supported Hamas.\nEmi Tuyetnhi Tran",

            "summary": "The escalation of gang violence in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, has prompted hospitals to close, caused a shortage of medical supplies and forced medical workers to suspend urgent assistance for Haitians.\nAt St. Damien Pediatric Hospital, doctors, nurses and other staff are worried about shootings and kidnappings that are taking place around the corner.\n'Some of our hospital staff are scared and fear for their lives,' said Jennifer Rayno of Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos Haiti, which leads the fundraising effort for St. Damien.\nArmed groups have also directly assaulted hospitals and specifically targeted medical personnel in St. Damien, which is located perilously close to the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince, where armed groups aim their weapons at U.S. military attempting to fortify security and evacuate citizens.\nHaitian police stand guard on a street corner amid gang violence in Port-au-Prince on April 8. Clarens Siffroy / AFP via Getty Images The hospital serves children battling cancer and other chronic illnesses in a population largely grappling with poverty. 'We are the only center in the country that provides pediatric oncology care,' Rayno said.\nThe ongoing violence is worsening the already daunting task of providing critical medical care for residents in and around the Haitian capital, U.N. humanitarian officials told NBC News.\nIn recent weeks, armed groups raided two health care institutions, Delmas 18 Hospital and the Centre De Sante Saint Martin, and at least 10 pharmacies in the capital were looted.\nDespite support from the World Health Organization — which has provided medicine, medical supplies and fuel — La Paix University Hospital is another medical center facing considerable strain, especially due to the closure of Port-au-Prince State Hospital last month, according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\nInternational humanitarian agencies are struggling to deliver aid, too. UNICEF reported the looting of one of its containers at Port-au-Prince‘s main port in March, a cargo that carried vital maternal, neonatal and children's medical supplies, along with items crucial for early childhood development and education. In all, armed groups have taken over more than 260 containers with humanitarian aid at the port, severely impacting the delivery of essential goods.\nBruno Maes, UNICEF representative in Haiti, said the closure of health facilities due to security concerns has left only two functional surgical operating facilities in Port-au-Prince, creating significant challenges in providing medical care to the population, especially those wounded in the crossfire.\nPeople take cover from gunfire during clashes between police and gangs near the National Palace in Port-au-Prince on April 8. Odelyn Joseph / AP UNICEF aims to reach at least 650,000 children and women with primary health care services this year, emphasizing the need for flexible funding to protect vulnerable communities and build resilient systems for the future.\nHope for Haiti, a nonprofit that provides aid throughout the country, operates a clinic in Les Cayes, about 125 miles southwest from Port-au-Prince. Since the worsening of the crisis, Hope For Haiti's southern clinic, which serves more than 15,000 patients annually, has experienced an influx as people have fled the capital city.\n'Throughout southern Haiti, there is an alarming increase in the number of patients,' said Skyler Badenoch, CEO of Hope For Haiti. 'One of the factors causing this is people migrating from Port-au-Prince to the southern part of the country.'\nThe group's mobile clinics reach rural communities, but fuel has been hard to get, making it challenging for people to receive aid. 'Fuel is one of the hardest things to get right now, with gangs controlling 80% of the country,' Badenoch said. 'They've blocked off many ports, severely stymying the fuel supply.'\nFuel is not only a problem for the mobile clinics. St. Damien Hospital is also grappling with energy resources. 'Haiti runs on a power grid system and needs fuel to keep the generators on,' said Rayno.\nFredlyn Pierre Louis",

            "summary": "The fall of Saigon has been a commonly depicted subject across Western media, but the portrayal in the new HBO drama series 'The Sympathizer' — in which panicked families attempt to flee Vietnam under heavy fire — barely features any American GI. And that's no coincidence, cast members say.\nHoa Xuande, who plays the main character only known to viewers as 'the Captain,' and Sandra Oh, who plays his love interest, the sharp Sofia Mori, said that the show is meant to challenge dominant perceptions of the war. It reframes the narrative to center the plight of Vietnamese people who lived through it, rather than on the sacrifices of American soldiers.\n'Depictions of the evacuation, especially through the American media … is the GI soldiers pulling ‘helpless' Vietnamese people to the helicopters,' Xuande said. 'It's that savior complex that Americans have … that they're at the forefront of this story helping, Vietnamese people who couldn't apparently help themselves.'\nSandra Oh in The Sympathizer. Hopper Stone / HBO Oh added that the show, which premiered on Sunday on HBO and Max, serves as a 'major shift of perspective — and a perspective that has always been but has been sorely missing for five decades.'\nThe seven-episode series, based on Viet Thanh Nguyen's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, follows the Captain through his experiences as a spy for the North Vietnamese communists while serving in the South Vietnamese army as 'the General''s right-hand man.\nHis story — told through a series of flashbacks conjured by confessions he makes at a re-education camp in Vietnam — takes viewers through the end of the war to a new start in Los Angeles, where the Captain is tasked with keeping a close eye on the General's activity.\nThrough it all, the Captain, who is the son of a French priest and a Vietnamese villager, grapples with his conflicting convictions, identities and sympathies. Oh's character, a Japanese American feminist and advocate of 'free love,' further amplifies his multilayered beliefs. The story of war, the series shows, cannot be told through a simple binary.\nRobert Downey Jr. Hopper Stone / HBO To convey these ideas, Xuande said, it was necessary to involve a mostly Vietnamese cast.\n'Having a Vietnamese cast at the forefront of this, through their perspectives, it shows how we're actually in control of our narratives,' Xuande, the son of Vietnamese refugees, said. '[How] the things that we felt were just as traumatic as what the American soldiers felt and how we had just as deep and complex lives, and hopes and dreams as people who were trying to survive that part of the conflict.'\nShifting any U.S.-centric ideas of the war also meant injecting a frequent use of the Vietnamese language throughout the series, Oh said. She estimates that more than half of the show is done in Vietnamese, which she said helped to de-exoticize it and show the language used as elegantly as it truly is.\n'For the longest time you have again, an American perspective on all those war movies, right? So the only times that you hear Vietnamese is very, very limited. And even in the framing of those films. It's not understood,' she said. 'It's looked down upon so it gives the room for the freedom, or the allowance, for white people to make fun of the language, because it hasn't been normalized.'\nDuy Nguyen, Fred Nguyen Khan, Hoa Xuande in The Sympathizer. Hopper Stone / HBO For Oh, the way in which she refers to the war has also changed.\n'I've now started trying to change the way I even call the war — I say the ‘war in Vietnam,' because the Vietnam War implies that we were at war with Vietnam, as opposed to the war that was happening' on Vietnamese soil, she said.\nThe actors pointed out that it's no mystery why so many of Asian descent have had a difficult time reflecting on their cultural pasts and heritage, given the trauma embedded in many families' stories.\n'It takes a long time for one to be ready to see those images reflected back. How much do your your parents talk about it? They don't talk about it because it's so tough,' Oh said. 'But here it is now depicted finally, from the inside point of view. Maybe that's a step for a conversation to happen.'\nBut hopefully, the cast members say, the show can serve as a recognition. It's already prompted Xuande's parents to open up about their own experiences escaping to safety on a boat, the stars said.\n'I'm sure the wider Vietnamese diaspora who had experienced this struggle firsthand will watch something like this and it'll be cathartic to them in a way, whether they're able to express it or talk about to the kids or even just be able to feel like, these struggles and trauma are validated,' Xuande said.\nKimmy Yam",

            "summary": "NORRISTOWN, Pa. — Neil Makhija is on a mission.\nNeil Makhija is on a mission. As the county commissioner in charge of elections here in Pennsylvania's Montgomery County, he is determined to get as many people out to vote in November as he can. It's a big part of the reason he campaigned for the job.\n'I'm probably one of the first people to run for a county commissioner seat in Pennsylvania because of the role of administering elections,' said Makhija, 37, a Democrat who took office in January and previously taught election law at the University of Pennsylvania.\n'When this seat opened up, I thought this is a real place where we can make a difference, protect voting rights and really set the standard in Pennsylvania and for the country,' he added.\nBut to get more people to vote, Makhija realized he would need to get creative.\nThat's why on a Thursday in April, Makhija had gathered 16 Montgomery County voters at the county commissioner's office to present them with leather-bound certificates honoring a lifetime of civic duty.\nIt was the first Montgomery County Voter Hall of Fame.\nAfter official county business wrapped, Makhija and his two fellow commissioners stood in front of the room's imposing wooden desk to greet the honorees, who were found by combing through the county and state electoral records for voters who had cast ballots in the last 50 consecutive general elections. Makhija polled the room about how long they'd been voting. The oldest honoree had been voting since 1956.\n'Anybody got 1956 beat? This is like an auction,' Makhija joked.\nAs a photographer captured the moments, the honorees posed at the front of the room with the commissioners and their new certificates.\nThe mood was celebratory, but the mission behind the ceremony was serious.\nCentral to Makhija's efforts is understanding what makes people like honorees Alan and Rosemary Hinkle tick. The couple has voted in every election since 1972, when Alan was 21 and Rosemary was 18.\n'I think it's so important that in the midst of everything that's happening in politics, where people are cynical or disillusioned, that we actually recognize the people who are so committed to the system,' Makhija said.\nHe said he hopes that initiatives like the Hall of Fame will not only inspire other voters to turn out, but also inspire him to come up with new ways to make voting more accessible. According to NBC News polling going back to 2008, election enthusiasm is at an all-time low for a presidential contest.\nPennsylvania clinched the White House for Joe Biden in 2020 — thanks in large part to places like Montgomery County, a largely white, highly educated, wealthy suburb of Philadelphia that trends blue. Biden was able to expand his margin of victory in Philadelphia's surrounding counties — Montgomery, Bucks, Chester and Delaware — by more than 100,000 votes over what Democrat Hillary Clinton earned in 2016, offsetting gains former President Donald Trump made in the state's smaller counties.\n'We're the most courted voters in the whole country,' Makhija said. 'I think reminding people in our communities that we set the direction of the country will make a difference.'\nMakhija isn't just battling a lack of enthusiasm for the two candidates; he's also contending with a firehose of disinformation about the entire electoral system, just as so many other election workers are across the country.\nTrump has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that mail-in voting is a vehicle for widespread voter fraud. The former president also continues to push the baseless theory that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n'When you see them cheating, you get out there and start screaming,' Trump said at a rally in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, last weekend. 'The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020, and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election of 2024.'\nMakhija said claims like that cause 'fear and cynicism by design,' and he worries that it will cause voters of both parties to skip the ballot box in November.\n'When you challenge the whole system, people will rethink their participation,' he said.\nStill, Makhija expects the Republican nominee to continue to sow doubt about the validity of mail-in ballots, despite attempts from local GOP officials to embrace mail-in and early voting to match what's been an advantage for Democrats in recent years.\nTo that end, he's trying to build trust in the early voting system that will span across party lines. He's aiming to literally meet voters where they are by expanding election satellite offices for people who need to 'cure' their ballots — the process of allowing voters to fix their mail ballots with technical issues, such as an incorrect date or a missing signature, that otherwise may not be counted on Election Day. Makjiha also hopes to establish a mobile unit that would travel around the county to help people resolve any mistakes they made on their mail-in ballots.\n'Instead of throwing out their votes, we'll be trying to help voters cure ballots with technical errors for about 2,000 people in the last two weeks of the election,' he said.\nIn battleground Pennsylvania, every one of those votes will count — something Montgomery County's Hall of Fame inductees know all too well.\nThe Hinkels aren't sure which way they'll vote yet — but they say they are 'absolutely' decided on one thing: They'll be casting ballots in 2024.\n'If you don't want other people making the decision for you,' Rosemary Hinkle said, 'then you have to participate.'",

            "excerpt": "Legislation from Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Joni Ernst would launch a pilot program to help child care providers near military installations train and recruit staff members.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — As the country faces a shrinking supply of child care workers and higher costs of care, a bipartisan duo of senators is taking steps to address the shortage, specifically targeted at helping service members who face unique challenges trying to access reliable child care.\nSens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, will introduce the Expanding Child Care for Military Families Act on Thursday, proposing a first-of-its-kind Defense Department-led pilot program to help child care providers near military installations train, recruit and retain staff members. The goal would be to boost the availability of care, for both military members and local civilians, by increasing workforce development opportunities for workers in the industry, using the Defense Department's already existing resources.\n'We have a workforce shortage, and to the extent that people look at the challenges of family life in the military — child care is one of those challenges, and that's a deterrent for people to join the military. Anything we can do to address that is really important,' Shaheen said in an interview Wednesday.\nThe legislation would enable the Defense Department to enter into partnerships with both private and public child care centers on or near military installations and require it to participate in recruitment and retention programs for child care providers at participating centers.\nErnst, the first female combat veteran in the Senate, said the legislation is personal. 'As a mom and a new grandma, I know it takes a village to raise a child and that our military members need high-quality, affordable child care for their young ones,' she said. 'By boosting training and recruitment efforts, this bipartisan bill will ensure military kids are safe and loved while their parents diligently train and prepare to protect our nation.'\nSen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa. Samuel Corum / Getty Images file To further close the worker gap, the bill would also allow the Pentagon to work with AmeriCorps, a government agency for national service, to place its volunteers at participating child care facilities, and it would encourage the Pentagon to train and recruit military spouses to join the industry.\n'That's one of the biggest challenges right now,' Shaheen said of the staffing shortage. 'One of the reasons that's such a challenge is because the pay scale for child care teachers is so low, and often benefits are not provided for people, as well. So I think we need to think about all the ways that we can be creative to figure out how to get more people in the field.'\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, the federal government spent $24 billion to help keep child care facilities afloat, but the funding expired in September, leaving many providers who relied on it unable to make ends meet.\nA recent survey from the National Association for the Education of Young Children found that more than half of child care centers' directors and operators reported staffing shortages.\nCora Hoppe, the director of Rochester Child Care Center, a nonprofit center in New Hampshire that would partner with the Defense Department if the new bill passes, said the provider shortage is particularly felt among families of service members, who deal with frequent moves that bring a unique set of challenges for parents.\n'It can be harder for service members because of how far away [child care] can be from a base or if they don't have access to it on an active base,' Hoppe said in an interview Tuesday. 'It's just an extremely important partnership, because when you have uncertainty everywhere else, it's nice to have a certain partnership to help support you through that.'\nThe Rochester Child Care Center serves five to 10 military families at a given time and takes in military subsidies to help with expenses, but Hoppe said budgetary constraints and high operating costs recently caused her to have to let go of a quarter of her staff.\n'There's no wiggle room. There's absolutely none. I'm in the classroom constantly. I have workers call out because they have sick kids. It's all over the place,' she said.\nHoppe said that if she had access to additional resources from the Defense Department, she would have been able to hold on to her staff.\n'The DoD's backing would be huge, because then it would allow us to build our capacity,' she said.\n'Right now, we're all in silos. So to have a DoD program available, I think it could bring together more of the child care industry. It would bring us in less siloed positions and give us opportunities to work more together in order to collaborate to support these types of families.'\nShaheen, who has pushed for several measures to ease the burden for both parents and child care facilities, said she will continue to advocate for more accessible and affordable child care.\n'We've got to be flexible in thinking about how we respond to the child care needs of families, that we need to provide options. There's not a one-size-fits-all, and I think that's particularly true for military families,' she said.\n'I think this is an issue that there is no one magic silver bullet answer, and so we need to look at a whole variety of things. That's why this kind of a pilot program would be really helpful,' she said.\nKate Santaliz",

            "excerpt": "Matthew Rutledge, 62, resigned after a former Miss Hall's School student claimed he \"exploited\" her.",
            "summary": "A veteran teacher at an upper-crust Massachusetts boarding and day school for girls has resigned amid allegations that he groomed several students for sex during the 30-plus years he taught at Miss Hall's School.\nMatthew Rutledge, who is 62 and mainly taught history at the school in Pittsfield, was placed on administrative leave on March 27 and resigned days later after a former student came forward and reported him to the school administration for allegedly sexually abusing and exploiting her when she was a student and after she graduated, according to a letter the school sent to alumni on April 3.\nThat former student, Melissa Fares, disclosed that she reported Rutledge to the school in a post on April 8 to a private Facebook group of Miss Hall's School alumni.\nSince then, two other women have come forward with claims that Rutledge also preyed on them, said one of their attorneys, Eric MacLeish of MacLeish Law.\n'He was very good at exploiting girls,' MacLeish said.'\nJulia Heaton, the head of school at Miss Hall's School, released a statement Tuesday in response to the reports that two more former students were accusing Rutledge of sex abuse by stating that they are 'initiating a neutral, external investigation in response to the information we have received from the courageous women who brought their experiences to the attention of the School and broader community.'\nMacLeish, who is best known for representing hundreds of Catholic priests' sex abuse victims in Boston, said 'since Melissa came forward we've received calls from other women.'\nSo far, MacLeish said, three women have signed 'representation agreements' with him and another lawyer working on these cases, Kristin Knuuttila of Knuuttila Law, LLC.\nFounded in 1898 and located on a leafy campus in the Berkshires, Miss Hall's School is one of the first girls' boarding schools in New England. It's for girls grades 9 through 12 and for those who board there the tuition is about $60,000 a year.\nMiss Hall's School has a reputation as a progressive haven where young women can get a quality education. Its keynote speaker at the school's 125th anniversary dinner last year was Lucia Stoller Evans, a 2001 graduate of the school and a former actress who was one of the women who accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault.\nLast week, Heaton, who's been in her position for nearly a decade, told The Berkshire Eagle, which first broke the story about the accusations against Rutledge, that she was not aware of any other allegations against the former teacher.\nThen on Monday, Nancy Ault, president of the school's board of trustees, released a statement confirming that they have been in touch with lawyers 'representing three alums who have shared that former History teacher Matthew Rutledge sexually abused and/or engaged in other sexual misconduct with them between the years 2001-2010.'\nIn the letter she said that Rutledge 'was banned from campus and will not return.'\n'We are deeply saddened by this, and we commend these women for their extraordinary courage in coming forward,' Ault wrote on Monday.\nHeaton said the school has informed the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families about the situation and had also been in touch with the Berkshire District Attorney's Office. NBC News has reached out to both agencies for comment.\nFares, a freelance journalist who at one point worked for Reuters and was an intern at The New York Times, did not return a request for comment.\n'I made the decision to report to the School administration that Mr. Rutledge sexually abused and exploited me while I was his student,' Fares wrote. 'He used his power and control as a teacher (and as my advisor) to groom me for his own gratification.'\nShe added that on March 29 she spoke with another of Rutledge's alleged victims and they 'wept together' after sharing their experiences.\nFormer student Alison Cowie told NBC News there were rumors about Rutledge having inappropriate relationships with students when she attended the school from 1997 to 2000.\nWhile she didn't have any direct issues with him, Cowie said, 'I was warned that he had partnerships with some students and to stay away from him.'\nAnother former Miss Hall's School student, who asked to remain anonymous because she has family ties to the school, said she was aware of rumors that Rutledge had inappropriate relationships with students when she attended the school in the early 2000s. She said she took several of his classes and that he was an excellent history teacher.\n'Charismatic is the word that best describes him,' she said. 'We all knew he had a wife and kids, and that gave him an air of security. He was also very popular with the other teachers. But at the same time, we all knew he was very close to some of the girls.'\nRutledge could not be reached for comment. NBC News could not locate a working phone number and his only available email was through his account at the school. In addition to being a teacher, he served as an 'advisor, department chair, coach, and resident' at the school, Heaton wrote when she announced his resignation.\nAs for Fares, she wrote in her post that it was 'very difficult for me to be writing this post, but I strongly believe that it's necessary.'\n'No sister attending our School should ever be in danger again, and all voices ought to be heard,' Fares wrote.\nCorky Siemaszko",

'This is a chance for us to grow and educate people on breaking,' Jeffrey Louis (B-Boy Jeffro), told NBC Olympics. Louis, the fifth-ranked B-boy in the world, is considered a favorite for one of the remaining spots on the U.S. Olympic team.\n(B-Boy Jeffro), told NBC Olympics. Louis, the fifth-ranked B-boy in the world, is considered a favorite for one of the remaining spots on the U.S. Olympic team. Breaking joins other newer sports, including three that were added to the Olympic program for the first time at the 2020 Tokyo Games — surfing, skateboarding and sport climbing.\nAdding those sports to the official Olympics roster is an attempt by the International Olympic Committee to reach a younger audience, given that 'all four are easy to take up and participants form communities that are very active on social media,' according to the Paris Olympics.\nThe committee, known as the IOC, hopes millions of kids worldwide will be inspired to take up the sports themselves.\n'If we get it right, we can create something unstoppable,' Louis said. 'We can't let it pass us up again, because the first time breaking blew up, it fizzled out.'\nWhat is breaking? The dance-battle sport is 'characterised by acrobatic movements, stylised footwork and the key role played by the DJ and the MC (master of ceremonies) during battles,' according to the Paris Olympics.\nSome of the moves will have audiences wondering where the halfpipe is as athletes twist and turn like they should have boards under their feet.\nThe sport's techniques include top rock (standing footwork) and down rock (moves on the floor), power moves (twists and spins) and the freeze, when breakers freeze in poses while using their heads or hands for support.\nHow will it work? The breaking competition in Paris will be divided into two events — one for women and one for men — and they will take place Aug. 9 and 10 at La Concorde Urban Park.\nIn total, 16 B-boys or 16 B-girls will 'go face to face in spectacular solo battles,' according to the Paris Olympics.\nThe competitors will show off their best moves as they try to keep up with the beat of the DJ's tracks, improvising to stay alive in the dance battle with a combination of \"power moves,\" including windmills, the 6-step and freezes, according to the Paris Olympics.\nJudges will then vote, paving the way for the first breaking medalists in Olympic history.\nWho is on the U.S. Olympic breaking team? The U.S. will be represented by four breakers — two B-boys and two B-girls — who will compete in solo battles for the gold medal.\nSo far, two U.S. breakers have qualified: Sunny Choi (B-Girl Sunny) and Victor Montalvo (B-Boy Victor).\nFrom the Bronx to Paris It has been a decades-long battle to get breaking to the main stage.\nThe dance style, which has roots in hip-hop culture, originated at block parties in New York City in the 1970s, according to the Paris Olympics.\nLouis said the sport originated in a rec room in the Bronx, where 'a legendary DJ named Kool Herc debuted a new technique that centered around percussive ‘breaks' in songs. During these breaks, the crowd would start dancing, which became known as breaking, or breakdancing.'\nBy the 1980s, it was hitting the mainstream with groups like the Rock Steady Crew, the Dynamic Rockers and the New York City Breakers, who innovated new — and more complex — moves.\nIt gained wider visibility thanks in part to the 1983 movie \"Flashdance.\" While the film included only a few short breaking scenes — featuring the Rock Steady Crew — USA Dance said it inspired people around the world to try breaking. But the end of the '80s, it had fizzled.\nBreakers invited fellow dancers out of early retirement to jump-start the scene once again, according to USA Dance. International Battle of the Year, the first large-scale, formally judged breaking event, began in the '90s, which helped with the sport's revival and ushered in a new era of interest. Other international competitions also began in the decade, some of which remain active today.\nInternational resurgence Since then, \"breaking has evolved into a global cultural art form with many elements of sport,\" according to USA Dance.\nThe national organization says a number of breaking schools have opened across the U.S. in the last decade, providing spaces for a new, young generation of breakers to learn and hone the craft.\nThe World DanceSport Federation now governs the sport internationally and is recognized by the IOC as such.\nWhitney Carter, director of internally managed sports at the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, helped form Breaking for Gold USA, a group dedicated to getting breakers in the country ready for the world's biggest games, NBC Olympics reported.\n\"Now, the USA is a front-runner at the Olympics,\" Tyquan Hodac, USA Dance's breaking communications director, told NBC Olympics. \"We're the powerhouse.

            "summary": "MEXICO CITY — Giovanny Tovar left Venezuela five years ago in search of a job after his country came undone under the watch of President Nicolás Maduro. He now sells empanadas and tequeños in the streets of Peru's capital, where he pushes around a small cart outfitted with a deep fryer.\nTovar wants nothing more than to vote Maduro out of office. He sees an opportunity for change in July's highly anticipated presidential election but he won't be able to cast a vote. Neither will millions of other Venezuelan emigrants because of costly and time-consuming government prerequisites that are nowhere to be found in Venezuela's election laws.\n'I really don't understand why they put so many obstacles in the way of us exercising our vote,' Tovar said before offering the main reason emigrants suspect is behind the prerequisites: 'I really would like to vote but not to give the vote to Maduro.'\nVenezuelan Giovanny Tovar wants nothing more than to vote Maduro out of office. Martin Mejia / AP More than half of the estimated 7.7 million Venezuelans who have left their homeland during the complex crisis that has marked Maduro's 11-year presidency are estimated to be registered to vote in Venezuela. But of all the Venezuelans fanned out around the world, including those who emigrated before the crisis, government figures show only about 107,000 are registered to vote outside the South American country.\nAnalysts and emigrants assert people who left Venezuela during the crisis would almost certainly vote against Maduro if given the chance. Maduro, who became interim president in 2013 following the death of the fiery Hugo Chávez, is seeking a third term in office.\nVenezuelan law contemplates absentee voting, allowing citizens to vote at embassies and consulates. Interested voters must be properly registered with their foreign address and cannot be living in their host country illegally or seeking refugee or asylum status there.\nThe residency requirement alone reduces significantly the number of people who can register as the majority of emigrants lack legal status. During this year's registration period, which ends Tuesday, even those who have been granted temporary residency in host countries are being turned away by consular officials because the diplomatic outposts are demanding proof of permanent status.\n'Permanent Residence Documents issued by the host country' must show 'validity of ... at least 3 years from the current date' and 'must have been issued at least 1 year in advance,' according to a flyer outside the consulate in Colombia's capital, Bogota. But Venezuela's election law only calls for interested voters to 'have residency or any other status that denotes legality of stay' in a foreign country.\nPeru has granted Tovar temporary, not permanent, residency.\nFurther complicating matters for some interested voters is the requirement to have a Venezuelan passport, which is cost prohibitive and nowadays takes weeks to several months to process.\nMaria Cordova and her family, who moved to Mexico 18 years ago, participated in the October presidential primary for the opposition faction backed by the United States. That election was organized by a commission independent of Venezuela's ruling party-loyal National Electoral Council. The commission allowed interested voters like Cordova to register to vote online, eventually signing up more than 200,000 people around the world.\nWhen it came time to cast a ballot, Cordova traveled from Cancun to Mexico City, where primary organizers set up a voting center. Now, Cordova wants to vote against Maduro on July 28, but she hasn't received the passport she has been trying to renew since last year.\n'It is a plan with ulterior motives because in order to apply, you need to pay,' she said, referring to the passport renewal process.\nPolling suggests that Venezuelans overwhelmingly want to go to the polls and would trounce Maduro if given the chance.\nOfficial estimates show that about 36,000 of the 107,000 Venezuelans properly registered to vote abroad live in the U.S. They face an insurmountable obstacle: Consulates where they would typically cast their ballots are closed because Venezuela and the U.S. severed diplomatic relations after Maduro's 2018 re-election.\nThat contest was widely considered fraudulent and turned Maduro into a pariah. Hopes for a more democratic presidential election briefly went up when Maduro and the faction of the opposition behind the primary agreed in October to work together on electoral conditions that would level the playing field.\nAmong the issues both sides were expected to work on was updating the country's voting rolls. But this and other changes did not materialize after Maduro's government began to defy the spirit, if not necessarily the letter, of the agreement, including by blocking the presidential candidacy of opposition powerhouse Maria Corina Machado — who won the primary — arresting part of her staff and opening criminal investigations against primary organizers.\nChristopher Sabatini, a research fellow at the Chatham House in London, said the opposition may complain about the obstacles faced by emigrants, but it is unlikely to prioritize facilitating voting abroad given the remaining challenges it faces within the country.\n'There's still plenty of people within Venezuela that have never voted before, that have come of age, and engaging those people in the democratic exercise is sort of more of a priority for the opposition,' Sabatini said.\nMost people who have left Venezuela over the past decade settled in other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Colombia is home to the largest contingent of them, with more than 2.8 million living across the country.\nOne of the main barriers that Venezuelans there say they are facing is the refusal of consular officials to accept their Temporary Protection Permit — a document issued by the Colombian government that gives them access to the health care system, education and jobs — as proof of legal status.\nNicole García, a Venezuelan who is part of the grassroots group Venezuelans in Barranquilla, said the request for documents that most migrants do not have is a way in which consulates seek to limit participation and transparency in the election.\n'Consular officials are people who are part of the government or who are part of the regime,' she said.\nThe Associated Press",

            "excerpt": "84% of AAPI adults agree climate change exists, compared to 74% of the general U.S. population, new research says.",
            "summary": "Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in the United States are more likely than the overall adult population to believe in human-caused climate change, according to a new poll. It also suggests that partisanship may not have as much of an impact on this group's environmental views, compared to Americans overall.\nA recent poll from AAPI Data and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds 84% of AAPI adults agree climate change exists. In comparison, 74% of U.S. adults hold the same sentiment. And three-quarters of AAPI adults who accept climate change is real attribute it entirely or mostly to human activity. Among the general U.S. adult population surveyed in an AP-NORC poll in September, only 61% say humans are causing it.\nThe poll is part of an ongoing project exploring the views of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, whose views can usually not be highlighted in other surveys because of small sample sizes and lack of linguistic representation.\nScientists overwhelmingly agree that heat-trapping gases released from the combustion of fossil fuels are pushing up global temperatures, upending weather patterns and endangering animal species. Many scientific organizations have made public statements on the issue.\nIn terms of partisanship, the percentage of AAPI Democrats, 84%, who acknowledge climate change falls exactly in line with the share of Democrats overall in the September poll. The share of AAPI Republicans who believe there is a climate crisis is lower, but they somewhat outnumber Republicans in general, 68% versus 49%.\nAdrian Wong, 26, of Whippany, New Jersey, is registered as unaffiliated but leans Republican. A biology major in college, the Chinese American says the science behind climate change is indisputable.\n'I've probably done more or looked more into it than the average person has,' Wong said. 'It's to me clear that it's changing due to human activity, not natural shifts.'\nThere has been growing conflict within the Republican Party between those who insist climate change is a progressive-generated hoax and those — mostly younger generations — who say the issue cannot be ignored. GOP lawmakers, in general, refuse to consider measures like mandated lowering of carbon emissions. However, some consider that an untenable position long-term. American Conservation Coalition, the largest conservative environmental group in the nation, has said Republicans running for office cannot risk alienating people who care about climate change.\nWong is not surprised that AAPI conservatives like himself recognize that the climate is changing. He thinks they are more highly educated and more likely to be exposed to science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n'It wouldn't surprise me if they were more likely to have studied more and actually more likely to have studied in science and STEM-related fields rather than, say like, finance or something,' Wong said.\nWhile climate change is an afterthought to her parents, Analisa Harangozo, 35, of Alameda, California, worries a great deal about it. She has noticed a rise in 'crazy heatwaves and droughts and just like crazy weather in general' in the San Francisco Bay Area. She and her husband are teaching their sons — ages 7 and 4 — to take small steps to reduce their carbon footprint like composting, growing food and eating less meat. They're also trying to minimize their accumulation of household items.\n'I always second-guess myself, ‘Do I really need this?'' Harangozo said. 'Stuff will eventually end up in the landfill. So, we're really mindful with the products we buy, and whether or not they can be recycled or they're made from materials that are natural, like wood or what-not.'\nA registered independent with Democratic leanings, Harangozo is open to proposals from California Gov. Gavin Newsom and other state lawmakers to slash greenhouse gas emissions and invest in renewable energy.\n'I'm not knowledgeable enough to know what an attainable goal is,' she said. 'But, whatever it takes to actually make a difference, I'm all for it. I fully support.'\nKarthick Ramakrishnan, a public policy professor at the University of California, Riverside, and founder of AAPI Data, said the richness and detail of the data shows environmental groups need to consider reaching out to AAPI populations. They make up a relatively small share of the U.S. population — around 7%, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of 2021 census data — but their numbers are growing quickly.\n'Asian American and Pacific Islander voters are environmental voters,' Ramakrishnan said. 'Many of us still have an image in our minds of a particular kind of person maybe of a particular race, gender or age group. What we see here is across the board Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders care about the environment.'\nAsian American and Pacific Islanders may also have more of a stake in climate change because of connections to relatives abroad. China, considered one of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases alongside the U.S., vowed last year to reduce emissions. More Chinese companies are considering selling wind and solar power equipment in other countries. Around this time last year, Japan was preparing for another sweltering summer and risks of floods and landslides. That country has also pledged to curb emissions.\nHeavy rains swept across Pakistan last month, causing landslides and leaving over 36 people dead and dozens of others injured. In 2022, unprecedented rainfall and flooding in that country killed more than 1,700. In India, farmers are grappling with frequent cyclones and extreme heat. In southern India, the city of Bengaluru is seeing water levels running desperately low after an unusually hot February and March.\n'There's a fairly high level concern of what climate change means to low-income countries,' Ramakrishnan said. 'That sensitivity is either because people still have friends or family back in their home country or at least have some concern about what climate change does to other countries.'",

            "summary": "The New Yorkers who could decide Donald Trump's fate were vetted in real time on Friday by the former president's defense team.\nAs the potential alternate jurors were being questioned by prosecutors seeking to convict Trump of illegally paying hush money to a porn star, and by defense attorneys trying to keep him out of jail, a jury consultant hired by Trump's legal team was watching the candidates closely for telltale signs of possible bias while simultaneously feeding the defense attorneys her impressions.\nFollow along for live updates\nFollow along for live updates Meanwhile, a team of researchers working with the jury consultant were doing social media and other online searches to fill out the picture of every potential juror and sending that information to Trump's lawyers in the courtroom.\n'All this has to happen relatively quickly,' said veteran jury consultant Jo-Ellan Dimitrius of Dimitrius & Associates, who has been following the case and identified the firm working for Trump as Magna Legal Services.\nThe Philadelphia-based firm did not respond to a call from NBC News but court records show that Magna served as Trump's jury consultant when he was found liable for sexually abusing and then defaming writer E. Jean Carroll.\nIt was not immediately clear if the Manhattan District Attorney's office used its own jury consultant to vet jurors and a spokesperson for the agency did not return numerous phone calls from NBC News.\nBy midday, jury selection had been completed and Trump's first trial was heading for opening arguments.\nUsing jury consultants for vetting has become a fairly common practice.\n'In my experience, there's usually a consultant sitting behind the lawyers with a laptop who is feeding information to the lawyer doing the questioning of jurors,' Dimitrius said. 'They usually have the home office doing the social media checks and other searches because the primary role of the consultant in the courtroom is to listen and watch the jurors and give feedback to the lawyers.'\nSometimes the background checks of potential jurors are being done even before the questioning begins, Dimitrius said.\n'Generally on the morning of jury selection you get a list of potential jurors,' she said. 'So we will take an iPhone photo of the list and send it back to the office where they'll start their searches.'\nTampa-based jury consultant Michael Boucher of TCS, who has worked on a number of high-profile cases in New York City, like former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's failed libel case versus the New York Times, echoed Dimitrius.\n'In a case like this, we would set up a laptop on the podium and use a messaging app to stay in contact with the lawyers questioning the jurors,' Boucher said. 'Not only are you feeding the lawyer information, you are finding on the jurors online, you're trying to help guide the lawyer asking the questions. Lawyers, at times, sometimes get too far into the weeds and they need assistance so they can come up with follow-up questions.'\nAt the same time, Boucher said, 'We're watching the reactions of the other jurors waiting to be questioned and feeding that information to our legal team. That way, when the next potential juror steps up we already have a sense of where they stand.'\nBoucher said in his experience Manhattan jury pools tend to be sophisticated, well-educated and thoughtful. But cases involving polarizing figures like Trump or Palin 'sometime attract what we call 'motivated jurors,' with strong feelings either for or against\" them.\n'It's very hard to find anybody who doesn't have an opinion about Trump,' he said.\nNBC News Legal Analyst Danny Cevallos, an attorney who practices in New York and elsewhere, agreed.\n'In virtually every other case in the world, there's not a strong chance that the jurors have tweeted about the defendant or posted on social media,\" Cevallos said. \"This is the rare one-in-a-million case where there's a good chance all of us have retweeted or tweeted something about Donald Trump.\"\nRenato Stabile, managing director at Dubin Research & Consulting in New York City, said the ability to track social media has revolutionized the way juries get picked — and how jury consultants do their jobs.\n'Before you just had to rely on what jurors said in court, and I think lawyers depended a lot more on their experience and gut, and maybe unfortunately, stereotypes that were either correct or incorrect and their past experience,\" Stabile said. \"Now you just get such a better sense of what jurors are really all about based on the articles they're liking, what they're reposting.\"\nExamining social media is \"probably the most important part of jury selection,' said David Oscar Markus, a criminal defense attorney who, among others, successfully defended former Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum against charges of lying to the FBI.\n'Lots of folks will come into court and say, ‘Yes, of course, I can be fair,' or, you know, ‘I have feelings about this one way or the other, but I can put all those aside and give the prosecution and defense a fair shake',\" Markus said. \"But then, you know, once you see posts, even if they're old posts, they reveal sort of the jurors' true feelings.'\nLisa Rubin and Corky Siemaszko reported from New York City, Megan Lebowitz reported from Washington, D.C.\nLisa Rubin and Corky Siemaszko reported from New York City, Megan Lebowitz reported from Washington, D.C.\nLisa Rubin Megan Lebowitz Corky Siemaszko",

            "excerpt": "The agenda is heavy on economics and lighter on cultural issues, carrying echoes of FDR's New Deal. It omits some issues that lack Democratic consensus, like \"Medicare for All.\"",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Top House progressives will unveil a sweeping agenda Thursday to lay down a marker for the policies they'll push next year if Democrats win the 2024 election, from a higher minimum wage and strengthening antitrust laws to new federal benefits for seniors on Social Security and parents raising kids.\nThe Congressional Progressive Caucus agenda, first shared with NBC News, doubles as a blueprint of political advice for how it believes President Joe Biden can win over progressives and young voters who are uninspired by his re-election bid ahead of a rematch with former President Donald Trump.\n'If the progressive base is not excited and enthusiastic — and if they don't feel like we are trying to earn their votes and that they are important — then I think the horrific idea of a second Donald Trump presidency could become reality,' Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the progressive caucus chair, said in an interview. 'We cannot afford to let that happen. And we won't.'\nThe seven-point agenda is heavily focused on economics and lighter on cultural issues, carrying echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. It begins with provisions to boost the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour by 2028 and pass the PRO Act to strengthen unions, as well as other provisions, such as guaranteeing overtime pay. It includes policies to reduce the cost of living — by capping child care costs at 7% of income for all families; expanding Social Security benefits by closing tax loopholes; adding dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare; and enacting a series of policies to protect renters and make housing more affordable.\n2028 and pass the PRO Act to strengthen unions, as well as other provisions, such as guaranteeing overtime pay. It includes policies to reduce the cost of living — by capping child care costs at 7% of income for all families; expanding Social Security benefits by closing tax loopholes; adding dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare; and enacting a series of policies to protect renters and make housing more affordable. 'It's really about worker power and raising wages and lowering costs for poor people, middle-class Americans and the working people across this country,' Jayapal said.\nThe five other planks are investments in education, including universal pre-K and kindergarten; aggressive clean energy standards to tackle climate change; 'making our democracy work' with federal voting rights mandates, Washington, D.C., statehood and elimination of the Senate filibuster; taking on corporations and monopolies; and 'advancing justice' though abortion rights, pro-LGBTQ measures, pro-immigrant policies and setting national policing standards.\nThe agenda is also notable for what's not included. 'Medicare for All,' a rallying cry of the left for years, is excluded. Foreign policy issues like Israel and Gaza, which have sparked fiery pro-Palestinian protests across the country, are also kept out. Jayapal said that's partly because the caucus decided to make it a domestic-issue-only blueprint and partly out of pragmatism — to focus more on unifying issues for Democrats and steer clear of the ones that divide them.\n'The way we came to this agenda is to say that we were going to put into this agenda things that were populist and possible ... and affected a huge number of people,' she said. 'We haven't taken a position on particularly Israel and Gaza in the progressive caucus, and so that's not on here.'\nA supermajority of the 103 lawmakers in the caucus weighed in on the agenda, and 98% supported it, a spokesperson said.\nMuch of the agenda will have no realistic chance of passage unless Democrats sweep control of the White House, the House and the Senate this fall. And Jayapal emphasized that, in addition, Democrats would need 50 senators ready to pierce the 60-vote filibuster rule to get around likely GOP opposition. That would be a herculean task, as Democrats face a daunting map in 2024 Senate races, defending a slew of seats in purple and red states.\n'We are assuming that this is an agenda for a Democratic president with a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House,' Jayapal said.\nProgressives have had a rough two years, having been marginalized after Republicans took control of the House and steered the agenda rightward. Biden has broken with the left on issues like tougher asylum laws and crime. Some prominent Democrats, like Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, have eschewed the 'progressive' label as conservatives have found success in associating it with the left's most divisive ideas. Gallego, who is running for the Senate in his purple state, quietly left the progressive caucus. The caucus recently missed an opportunity to elect one of its members to a rare open Senate seat in deep-blue California, with two of them running and losing.\nStill, Jayapal said she believes that if Democrats win the 2024 elections, the progressive caucus will be well-positioned to advance the ideas in its new agenda, as it did with it opening bid that shaped two of Biden's signature laws, the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act. She has sought to institute changes to make the caucus more cohesive. It recently raised its dues for members.\nSome of the provisions in the new agenda represent items in Biden's 'Build Back Better' agenda that were left on the cutting room floor because of the thin majorities. Others could spark intraparty disagreements, including a far-reaching liberalization of the immigration system with a path to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally. Yet other pieces resemble popular causes that progressives want Biden to get behind, like expanding Social Security and legalizing marijuana.\n'We have to excite our base. We have to show them what the path forward is — not just say, ‘This is the most important election of your life, and we expect you to vote.' I don't think that's going to turn people out. And so I think this agenda, really, speaks to the needs of poor people, working people, progressives across the country who want us to make that case to them,' Jayapal said. 'We are not seeing the momentum that we would like to see. We're going to have a tough election. ... We know we're going to have to put together that progressive coalition. And I think this is the thing that allows us to say, ‘Look, here's what we're fighting for.''\nSahil Kapur",

            "excerpt": "Modi's supporters credit him with putting India on the global stage, while others say he has fanned a wave of Hindu nationalism and stifled basic freedoms.",
            "summary": "This week the world's biggest democratic election kicks off in India, as almost 970 million voters decide whether to give Prime Minister Narendra Modi a third term. The election will last six weeks after a campaign that has sprawled across India — and into the United States as well.\nModi's supporters credit him with putting India on the global stage and turning it into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. His critics, however, say Modi has fanned a wave of Hindu nationalism, cracked down on opponents, stifled press freedom and stoked religious tensions with Muslims and other minority groups.\nIn the weeks leading up to the election, which begins Friday, the overseas arm of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has enlisted members of the Indian diaspora in the U.S. to campaign on his behalf, either by phone calling friends and family in India or by traveling to India themselves.\nMany of the attendees at the event wore scarves of saffron, a color associated with the Hindu nationalist movement. Nathan Howard / Reuters More than 60 Modi supporters turned up to an event at the Potomac Community Center in Maryland last month, many of them wearing scarves of saffron, a color associated with Hindu nationalism.\nAt the event, leaders of the Overseas Friends of BJP listed what they saw as Modi's achievements since taking office in 2014: developments in infrastructure, pharmaceuticals, technology and education and, more recently, the inauguration of a grand Hindu temple on a contested holy site.\nAttendees were urged to use these as talking points to nudge friends and family in India to vote for Modi, and many stood ready to help.\n'Especially when they see me, that I'm from [the] United States, it carries a weight,' said Kanwaljit Soni, OFBJP's coordinator for the Sikh community, who was planning to travel to India to campaign ahead of the election, which runs from April 19 to June 1.\nIt's a familiar routine for him. During the last election, in 2019, he said, he spent three weeks in India traveling from village to village to encourage people to vote for the BJP.\n'I will be going to where my roots are in the different states,' he said.\nAware of the gargantuan task of defeating Modi, the fractured opposition has tried to consolidate into a single coalition by fielding a single candidate against the BJP. But many candidates have already switched to the BJP or backed out of the coalition.\n'It's no longer party versus party. It's a person against a person, and there is no other credible person with a national stature like Modi,' said Sanjoy Chakravorty, a professor of geography, urban studies and global studies at Temple University in Philadelphia and the author of 'The Truth About Us: The Politics of Information From Manu to Modi.'\nThe opposition has been further constrained by what it says are strong-arm tactics by Modi and his government. Dozens of opposition politicians have been jailed or are under investigation, and there were protests last month when Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of Delhi, was arrested in connection with corruption allegations that he denies.\nLast month, Modi's government froze the bank accounts of the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, in a tax dispute. The party said the move was politically motivated and hindered its ability to campaign.\nModi has said that India's democracy remains robust and that there is 'absolutely no discrimination.' His government says the Congress party fears a historic defeat and that its accounts were frozen because it failed to file tax returns for past donations.\nThe Congress party has also tried to mobilize support among Indian Americans with rallies across the U.S., arguing that India cannot afford a third Modi term.\n'Democracy is under an existential crisis in India right now and people are afraid to speak out,' said George Abraham, vice president of the Indian Overseas Congress.\nBut it is hard to compete with Modi, who experts say has built the narrative of being a 'great leader,' his face appearing everywhere in India from outdoor displays to vaccination certificates. That has extended abroad to the Indian diaspora in the U.S., which has never been more passionate about politics at home.\nModi's state visit to Washington last year drew a few hundred protesters, but thousands of South Asians also flooded the city's landmarks, either to support him or just to revel in the historic moment.\n'It's the convergence of the whole nation into a person,' Chakravorty said.\nAdapa Prasad, president of Overseas Friends of BJP, said the group aimed to reach almost 50,000 members of the Indian diaspora in the U.S., with the goal of helping Modi and the BJP secure a landslide victory.\nAnd Maryland was just the first stop.\nThe group planned to hold pre-election rallies in 20 U.S. cities, modeled after Modi's 'Chai Pe Charcha,' or 'discussions over tea' — televised programs in which he discusses various issues with citizens and top leaders.\nThere are an estimated 4.4 million people of Indian origin living in the U.S., making them the largest Asian American group, according to the Census Bureau. While many are U.S. citizens, barring them from voting in Indian elections, they may still have family links in India.\nFor those unable to travel to India, there is also the option of campaigning by phone, Prasad said.\nPeople who are 'sympathetic to BJP' will call their relatives in India and urge them to vote, he said.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a campaign rally in Mysuru, India, on Sunday.

Even though Modi's party received 37% of the votes in 2019, it won 303 out of the 543 seats.\nFlanked by almost a dozen party flags, supporters in Maryland chanted 'Victory of Mother India' and, 'This time, above 400' in Hindi, referring to the BJP's goal of securing more than 400 seats.\nCalling Modi a 'sensible leader,' Peeyush Uniyal, who is originally from the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand and now lives in Ellicott City, Maryland, said that 'especially from the development point of view, I think it becomes a no-brainer.'\nHe dismissed concerns about the rise of Hindu nationalism as 'overblown.'\nVirginia resident Upasana Dhankhar said it was her first time venturing into politics. 'It's the consistency of leadership,' said Dhankhar, a former professor of Indian history.\nShe moved to the U.S. in 2019, the same year Modi revoked the Indian Constitution's Article 370, which granted semiautonomous status to Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority region. The widely criticized move in the disputed territory was followed by the arrival of thousands of troops and a six-month communications blackout.\n'Resolving the Kashmir problem was a big thing,' Dhankhar said, mirroring an argument from a PowerPoint slide titled 'Article 370 SCRAPPED.'\nThe BJP's campaign in the U.S. was another way of revving up Modi's global fanbase, Chakravorty said.\n'The entire civilization is on the rise,' he said, 'and they want to be part of it.'\nMithil Aggarwal Megan Lebowitz",

            "summary": "Donald Trump — now a former president on trial — has sought to turn his legal peril into a boost for his presidential campaign, animating his supporters and attempting to sow doubt about the motives of his opponents.\nBut facing 34 counts of felony charges, Trump argued on the historic first day of his New York hush money trial that he is the victim of a criminal justice system weaponized against him.\nHe called it 'an assault' on the nation. And as the presumptive Republican nominee for president, repeatedly attacked the prosecution for waging \"election interference.\"\nIt is 'why I'm very proud to be here,' Trump said.\nThe former president intends to be involved at every level, to the extent possible, from court conferences to the jury selection process, his defense attorney Todd Blanche said.\n'President Trump wants to be present at everything,' said Blanche.\nFor much of the day, Trump was seated at the defense table flanked by his attorneys. At times, his voice could be heard in the back of the courtroom, though not what he was saying. Other moments saw Trump shut his eyes — drawing speculation about whether he was still awake, or lost in thought.\nHere is what happened during Monday's proceedings:\nJury selection About 500 New Yorkers arrived for day one of Trump's criminal trial over hush money payments for a process that will take days — and could take weeks — as the court works to weed out jurors who could be swayed by strong biases, or stealth jurors, who may be hiding theirs.\nQuestions like, 'Are you, or have you ever been a member of groups like the Oath Keepers, or ‘3 percenters,'' another far-right group, are used to narrow the pool. Other questions, say about a prospective juror's hobbies or educational background, are a less overtly political way to gauge a juror's potential fairness.\nBy the time the judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan, said he was ready to begin jury selection, about two hundred Manhattanites were in the courthouse waiting to find out if they would be selected.\nTrump was seated at the defense table as the first batch of 96 jurors were brought into the courtroom, filling the pews behind him. Their names, and those of any other prospective jurors, must be kept secret — except to the defense and prosecution.\nSpeaking to his lawyer, Trump gestured with his hands as Merchan discussed the handling of jury pool names. The defense and prosecution each received a copy of the potential jurors' names, which Merchan has said cannot in any way be duplicated and must be returned to the court. They also receive a copy of juror numbers.\nIt can be an intimidating process. More than half of prospective jurors from the first batch of 96 — at least 50 — were excused after saying they could not be fair and impartial. A further nine were excused when asked by the judge if there were other reasons for which they could not serve.\nHalf of the remaining pool of about 34, were called to start voir dire, where they would be queried by both parties, including on their media consumption habits. Trump appeared to track the process closely, reading along as it got underway.\nWitnesses Trump allegedly told his former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen to send porn star Stormy Daniels hush money during his run for president in 2016, a claim that is now at the center of the charges in this case. Prosecutors say this was part of a scheme to suppress negative stories about Trump in the lead-up to election day, which they argue should be charged as election interference.\nTrump has denied the charges, but prosecutors say he is going after those he claims are attacking him, including key witnesses in the case — and has made this a tactic.\n'The defendant himself has publicly embraced the public strategy of going after his perceived enemies,' prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said.\nDefending Trump, Blanche said the former president is the one facing attack by witnesses against him.\n'He is responding to salacious, repeated, vehement attacks by these witnesses,' Blanche said.\nInside the courtroom, large monitors showed a closed-circuit feed of the judge, defense and prosecution tables.\nIn court, Merchan read through a list of possible witnesses, name-checking members of Trump's family, including his children Donald Trump, Jr. and Ivanka Trump, wife Melania, and son-in-law Jared Kushner. The judge named longtime associates of Trump, such as Kellyanne Conway, Dan Scavino, and Rudy Giuliani, his bodyguard Keith Schiller, and White House aides John McEntee, Hope Hicks, and Madeleine Westerhout.\nThe risk of jail time Trump, who must be in the courtroom for every day of his criminal trial, has decried the case as a 'persecution like never before,' and on Monday while standing outside the courtroom argued that it constitutes 'an attack on a political opponent.'\nMerchan warned Trump that he risks jail time if he disrupts the trial, which will continue in his absence. Already, prosecutors are seeking to impose thousands of dollars in fines for three alleged violations of a gag order, including this morning.\nIf he fails to show up, a warrant could be issued for his arrest, an obligation that his campaign lambasted as 'Banana Republic tactics.'\nIt is a 'case that should never have been brought,' Trump said.\nThe trial could drag on for weeks, rerouting to New York a presidential campaign that otherwise could be making overtures to voters in some of the states Trump will need to win in November.\nHe resumed his criticism as the day came to a close, airing among his grievances a ruling by Merchan barring him from attending arguments at the Supreme Court on the question of whether he is entitled to presidential immunity, which he has raised in another of his criminal cases.\n'This is about election interference,' Trump said outside of the courtroom.\nHe lashed out on social media as well, posting articles on Truth Social that dismissed the case against him as 'politically driven' and reposting support from a range of defenders.\nLike in his other cases, Trump did not shy away from leveraging his latest legal entanglement for a campaign boost.\nA fundraising text message went out at the same time, thundering how he would 'never surrender.' Trump's fundraising has surged during moments of potential legal peril, delivering him a much-needed financial and messaging boost as he navigates the challenges of another White House run.\nOn the first day of his trial, Trump made the court case his pitch.\n'I JUST STORMED OUT OF COURT!' he hammered in the message. 'They think I'm finished but I'LL NEVER SURRENDER.'\nAdmissible or not? As prosecutors played evidence to the court that Trump's lawyers argued should not be admissible, Trump, seated at the defense table, watched along on a monitor. This included an excerpt from Trump's deposition in the E. Jean Carroll case where he defended his lewd comments in an \"Access Hollywood\" tape that surfaced in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, and remarks from a campaign rally late in that election cycle, where he showed concern over what he said were false accusations.\nJurors should know Trump's exact words, prosecutors argued. They also displayed tweets they said were evidence of Trump's pressure campaign on Cohen not to cooperate with prosecutors.\nMerchan reinforced a ruling that the \"Access Hollywood\" could not played to the jury — though it could be discussed — and barred prosecutors from introducing the deposition video about it.\nWhen prosecutors asked to introduce evidence about allegations of Trump's coordination with the National Enquirer to 'catch and kill' stories potentially devastating to his 2016 campaign, Trump's attorney dismissed it as a 'sideshow.' The judge ruled that it would be admissible.\nIn a win for the defense, Merchan denied a request by prosecutors to bring in other allegations against Trump of sexual assault. 'Complete hearsay,' he called them.\nMerchan gave Trump a twenty-four-hour deadline to enter final exhibits into evidence. 'You have 24 hours,' Merchan ordered. \"Whatever you don't identify in the next 24 hours, you will be precluded from using.'\nWhat's next? Merchan said he would wait to hear arguments next week on whether Trump violated his gag order by posting social media comments about witnesses in the case.\nLast week, Trump said he would \"absolutely\" testify in the trial, and tomorrow, the judge will conduct a hearing designed to ensure that this decision is well-informed. Known as a Sandoval hearing, it will delve into what could come up under cross-examination when Trump is on the witness stand.\nMerchan rejected a request that Trump be excused next Thursday in order to attend the Supreme Court's arguments on the immunity claim.\nIn another of his cases, Trump has argued to push back two filing deadlines on the basis that his attorneys will be overloaded with the New York trial over the coming six weeks. The request shows how the trial has become the latest opportunity for Trump's team to stall forward momentum on the legal charges against him.\nKatherine Doyle",

            "excerpt": "The Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association is urging lawmen to form posses, seize voting machines and investigate baseless claims of voter fraud.",
            "summary": "LAS VEGAS — A conference for a far-right sheriffs group this week drew a parade of felons, disgraced politicians, election deniers, conspiracy theorists and, in the end, a few sheriffs.\nThe Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, or CSPOA, met in Las Vegas' Ahern Luxury Boutique Hotel conference center to publicly counter reports of extremism within the group and set a course for the coming election — one that involves sheriffs' investigating what they claim, despite a lack of evidence, is rampant voter fraud.\nThe group sees sheriffs as the highest authority in the U.S., more powerful than the federal government, and it wants these county officers to form posses to patrol polling places, seize voting machines and investigate the Democrats and foreign nations behind what they claim is a criminal effort to rig the vote by flooding the country with immigrants who vote illegally.\nCritics of the group — including voting rights advocates and extremism researchers — fear the CSPOA's new focus will amount to interference and legitimize disinformation about U.S. elections.\nBut the event Wednesday, which starred MAGA celebrities speaking to a half-empty audience made up of few actual sheriffs, pointed to just how fringe the group's ideas are — and how what once seemed like a movement on its way into the mainstream has lost political pull.\nThe conference opened a little behind schedule; the Pledge of Allegiance was delayed when organizers couldn't find a flag. After he searched the conference center's rooms, Tom Hamner, a Colorado man who served over two years in prison for the felony 'interfering with law enforcement' on Jan. 6, 2021, came forward with the scarf from his wife's neck. It wasn't exactly a flag, but it was emblazoned with stars and stripes.\n'That'll work!' emcee Alex Newman, an Epoch Times contributor, said before he led the crowd of dozens in the pledge. A smooth jazz rendition of 'The Star-Spangled Banner' followed, sung by a Las Vegas man awaiting trial on multiple felony charges who is accused of fraudulently posing as a certified firearms instructor.\nI sat with a small group of reporters at a table marked 'reserved,' a section Newman and other presenters pointed to throughout the day when they invoked, in Donald Trump's style, the 'fake media.'\nWe, along with candidates and elected officials, were admitted gratis. Others paid $49 for the day, which included breakfast, a box lunch and a 'pizza party.' Sponsors staffed booths advertising unofficial Trump merchandise, supplements, prepper gear and various patriot-themed swag.\nCSPOA's finances aren't public. It charges for events like this conference, offers a $99 yearly subscription for access to weekly webinars and solicits donations. It has also provided training sessions in nearly a dozen states, where police and sheriffs earn continuing education credits toward professional requirements. Last year, the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement ended the practice in the state.\nTo the extent that the 13-hour day was structured, it was broken roughly in two: the first half dedicated to the issue of encroaching federal power and the second to election denial and conspiracy theories.\nThe morning's sessions were the group's bread and butter. Former Arizona sheriff Richard Mack founded the CSPOA in 2011 to advocate for the belief that sheriffs — who generally operate independently with little to no oversight and are accountable only to voters — are the ultimate arbiters and enforcers of the Constitution and must act as a check on tyrannical federal power.\nIts early focus was on gun laws and other tea party pet causes, including immigration, the Affordable Care Act and attention-grabbing standoffs between ranchers and the Bureau of Land Management. 'The greatest threat we face today is not terrorists,' Mack's website read in 2012. 'It is our own federal government.'\nAfter two terms as sheriff in an Arizona border county, Mack lost re-election. He sought elected office multiple times but failed in bids for sheriff of a different county, governor and seats in the U.S. House and Senate.\nThere are no public rolls today, but Mack claims 10% of the country's 3,000 sheriffs are members, along with 10,000 ordinary citizens.\nWednesday's event drew a little over 100 people by midmorning. Attendees took notes, nodded along and offered somber 'Amens' and boisterous 'Nos!' when called for.\nJared Bosley, a farmer in South Dakota, told of his fight with the state over a pipeline company surveying his land without his permission. Two convicted Jan. 6 rioters said they were 'political prisoners.' Former Rep. Steve King of Iowa, his legacy a history of racist remarks, railed against the World Health Organization, the World Economic Forum and 'ringleader' George Soros. Another disgraced former congressman, Steve Stockman of Texas, sobbed as he shared his story of serving time in a federal prison for fraud and sobbed again when he got to the part where Trump commuted his 10-year sentence.\nThe supportive crowd felt like 'a warm bath,' Stockman said, his arms stretched toward heaven.\nRichard Fleming, a cardiologist who in 2009 pleaded guilty to felony charges of health care and mail fraud, gave a lengthy presentation alleging the Covid vaccines were bioweapons. Radio show host Wayne Allyn Root thundered into the microphone promoting the 'great replacement,' a racist conspiracy theory. 'They want to replace American citizens who love this country,' Root bellowed.\nIt was nearly lunchtime when the first active sheriff spoke. Bob Songer, a CSPOA board member and the sheriff of Klickitat County, Washington, said he enforces only laws he determines to be constitutional and talked about his 'posse,' a group of 150 armed community volunteers he relies on for tasks like hunting cougars and courtroom security and keeps at the ready, as a potential militia. He offered a copy of his posse plan to sheriffs in the audience.\nDuring the break, as CSPOA volunteer Kenneth Hall sang an original song, 'I Back the Sheriff,' to the music of the Bob Marley tune, I asked Mack why there weren't more sheriffs at his conference. Mack said that didn't matter.\n'There's several candidates,' Mack said, noting the political signs littering the room. He said he hoped to draw a 'new generation' of sheriffs, but, pointing to 78-year-old Songer, he added, 'there's one, and he's one of the best sheriffs in America!'\nIndeed, there are politicians — or would-bes — who see the constitutional sheriffs group as an important bloc of support. Twenty or so candidates for local office in the crowd from Nevada, Utah, Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Georgia and Idaho spent the morning shaking hands and passing out cards.\nIt's a model that has proven effective. Trump depended on support from sheriffs in the White House and continues to rely on them at campaign events, as he did in 2016 and 2020. At a presentation in Grand Rapids, Michigan, this month, a half-dozen uniformed sheriffs stood in the background decked out in gold stripes and braided ropes as Trump railed against immigration and stood before a sign that read 'Stop Biden's Border Bloodbath.'\nAfter lunch, former sheriff Glenn Hamilton, who lost his 2022 re-election bid in Sierra County, New Mexico, regaled the audience with the time he deputized an entire church congregation to permit a gathering in violation of the governor's Covid rules. Hamilton referred to 'this old tool that's in our box called Posse Comitatus. Who's ever heard of this?' he asked.\nThe Posse Comitatus movement in the 1970s and '80s held up the county sheriff as the only true law enforcement officer and urged vigilantism through local posse groups. Latin for 'power of the county,' Posse Comitatus was preached and popularized by white supremacist William Potter Gale, but it dissolved in the wake of a spate of violence and highly publicized prosecutions.\nThe CSPOA has recently sought to distance itself from that history, the kind of messaging that may have resonated with not only tea partiers but also anti-government groups and militias and caused national hate tracking groups and Mack's Republican political opponents to label him a far-right extremist.\nMack and CSPOA leaders have consistently decried the label, but their ties with extremist organizations are well-documented. Mack was a keynote speaker at the first national conference for the far-right Oath Keepers in 2009 and sat on the militia group's board until at least 2015. The CSPOA's current CEO since 2022, Sam Bushman, operates Liberty News Radio, which has syndicated programs hosted by white supremacists. Bushman has hosted Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes on his show, 'Liberty RoundTable,' over a dozen times, including after the attack on the Capitol, for which Rhodes is serving an 18-year sentence for seditious conspiracy.\nA frustrated and defiant Bushman said it was that kind of negative publicity that had most likely caused the conference's biggest speaker, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, to bail. Without notice, Bannon hadn't shown up, he said. Bannon didn't respond to a request for comment.\nWith Bannon out, the biggest star was Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser and retired three-star general who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI but was pardoned by Trump. After he promoted a new film about himself that would be released the next day, Flynn took photos with attendees near the stage. Seeing an NBC News photographer, Flynn demanded to know whom he worked for, and when he identified himself, Flynn became incensed and yelled, 'You're a liar!' The organizers then moved Flynn to a room walled off by curtains and two guards.\nThe CSPOA has always been considered a fringe movement, but the pandemic offered a boost. Constitutional sheriffs were suddenly a viable solution to what a growing slice of the GOP saw as tyrannical lockdown orders, mask requirements and vaccination mandates. Similar constitutional sheriffs organizations began to pop up, including Pinal County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Lamb's Protect America Now and a pro-Trump think tank, the Claremont Institute's Sheriffs Fellowship.\nThe 2020 election offered another opportunity. Pushing unfounded claims of a stolen election, the CSPOA collaborated with True the Vote, the Texas-based election conspiracy theorist group behind '2000 Mules,' a widely panned and debunked film that claimed to reveal widespread ballot drop-box fraud.\nMack called the film a 'smoking gun,' and at its 2022 conference, the CSPOA called upon its members to launch investigations. But results have been lackluster.\nThe most notable investigation came from Barry County, Michigan, Sheriff Dar Leaf, who partnered with a pro-Trump lawyer bent on overturning Michigan's election results. Leaf's investigation, which has involved seizing election equipment and grilling local clerks, has seemingly only impeded a criminal case against three Trump supporters indicted last year on state charges related to their alleged tampering with voting machines. Leaf hasn't been charged with a crime.\nOnstage, Leaf, bespectacled and boyish, was giddy. The investigation had faced setbacks, he acknowledged, but he believed there would soon be justice.\n'I'm getting goose-bumpy here,' Leaf said. Later, he told me he didn't pay any attention to the criticism from state election and law enforcement officials or from the media: 'I just keep my head down.'\nAs the day wore on at the conference, the rails began to wear.\nTina Peters, a former Mesa County, Colorado, clerk facing multiple criminal charges related to a suspected security breach of her county's election system in 2021, and fresh off a home confinement for obstructing government administration in a separate case, took the stage wearing a large white lei. She is fighting the latest charges, with a trial scheduled for this summer. She had recently been to Hawaii, she said, and she offered a slideshow of photographic evidence that she suggested proved the recent deadly wildfires were the result of an intentional laser attack.\nAs Mike Lindell, MyPillow's founder and a sponsor of the CSPOA event, spoke — election denial and his prowess with the media and in business were his main topics — a blond woman in a robin's egg suit jacket walked up behind me and handed me a note: 'I would like to give you some first hand info that will be helpful to you reaching a conclusion on election fraud in NV.' The note passer, Susan Proffitt, later told me that the room was full of operatives, 'and they are doing their best to destroy us.'\nPizza was put out on long tables under heat lamps. The audience, halved from the morning, milled about. A couple of women took off their high heels. Several small groups were forming around the bar. There was still an awards ceremony, and Mack and Bushman had planned a news conference, though by the time it started the members of the media had gone.\nAs I left, I checked in with a man who had been sitting in the back, watching attentively. Jeffrey Kadlowec, a local architect, hadn't heard of CSPOA before and wasn't sure what to expect. 'I thought it would be more about law enforcement,' he said excitedly. 'I didn't expect it to be so, so radical.'\nBrandy Zadrozny",

After the first 96 prospective jurors were brought into a New York courtroom, Judge Juan Merchan asked if any of those assembled could not be 'fair and impartial.' More than half raised their hands and were excused from serving on the jury.\nThe jury selection process got off to a slow start because lawyers from both sides spent much of the day arguing over some of the more sensational evidence in the case. Prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office want to use material — including the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, headlines from the National Enquirer from the 2016 GOP presidential primary and the timing of Trump's alleged affair with another woman — to show why Trump was eager to bury negative stories about him during the 2016 presidential election.\nMerchan said prosecutors could use a transcript of the 'Access Hollywood' tape but not the tape itself. He also greenlit the request to show jurors Enquirer headlines and said he would allow testimony about the alleged affair.\nTrump, who spent much of the day seated at the defense table flanked by his attorneys, called the case 'an assault' on the nation and repeatedly attacked the prosecution for waging 'election interference.'

More Trump trial coverage: The scene outside the courthouse where Trump's trial was underway 'smacked of a Ringling Brothers production,' complete with a smattering of pro-Trump demonstrators and high-profile gawkers, including Nancy Pelosi's daughter who said 'I never miss a freak show,' senior politics reporter Jonathan Allen wrote in an analysis. Inside the courtroom, 'the solemn nature of the work ahead was evident.' Israel and Iran's longstanding conflict comes into full view Israel's war Cabinet convened yesterday to weigh its options for responding to Iran's unprecedented drone and missile attack. World leaders have urged restraint — and Israel could heed that call, four U.S. officials said.\nAccording to the officials, Israel's response will be limited in scope and will likely involve strikes against Iranian military forces and Iranian-backed proxies outside Iran. However, the U.S. assessment is based on conversations between American and Israeli officials that happened before Iran fired more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel on Saturday night, and the U.S. officials stressed that they have not been briefed on Israel's final decision . They also don't know when a response will happen; it could be any time, the officials said.\nhave not been briefed on Israel's final decision. They also don't know when a response will happen; it could be any time, the officials said. Whatever Israel decides, the stakes after Iran's attack could not be higher. In the eyes of some foreign policy hawks, the attacks could be perceived as a grave provocation that demands a furious rejoinder. Other analysts have warned that if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decides to hit back hard, it could plunge the wider Middle East into war.\nWhile Israel and Iran have been enemies since the late 1970s, the bitter conflict has long been confined to secret assassinations, audacious cyberattacks, nuclear sabotage and war-by-proxy.

NBC News found that at least 150 paid 'Premium' subscriber X accounts and thousands of unpaid accounts have posted or amplified pro-Nazi content on X in recent months, often in apparent violation of X's rules. The paid accounts posting the content all consistently posted antisemitic or pro-Nazi material. Examples included praise of Nazi soldiers, sharing of Nazi symbols and denials of the Holocaust.\nThe findings are the latest evidence of a flourishing Nazi network on X under Musk's ownership, where Nazi sympathizers are brought in from dark corners of the internet to a massive platform where they can pay to amplify their content.

            "summary": "PITTSBURGH — In the heart of one of America's most prominent historically Jewish neighborhoods, Dan and Baila Cohen keep the front entrance of their 70-year-old Judaica store locked during business hours.\nIt's not how they'd prefer it. But in light of Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack in Israel, Israel's ongoing military campaign in Gaza and tensions at home, they said, the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh told them they needed to be vigilant about who enters their business.\n'That's the reality of the world,' Dan Cohen said.\nIt's not the first time they've had to take additional safety precautions. The couple completed their purchase of Pinsker's Books and Judaica in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood in 2018 just days after a white supremacist gunned down 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue a few blocks away in the deadliest antisemitic attack in American history. But this time feels different.\n'Oct. 27 really unified' Squirrel Hill and Pittsburgh, Baila Cohen said of the Tree of Life massacre. 'Oct. 7 … really started polarizing the community itself, because that's when we started seeing much more of the infighting and conflicts.'\nConversations with more than 30 political strategists, activists and voters outlined how that tension has put Jewish voters in an unfamiliar spot ahead of the 2024 elections: on the front lines of the fight for control of the White House and Congress. Nowhere is that more apparent than in Pennsylvania, the swing state with the largest Jewish population — about 300,000 voting-age Jews in a state President Joe Biden won by roughly 80,000 votes in 2020.\nWhat's more, the congressional district that includes Squirrel Hill features a primary Tuesday that is among the first electoral tests of sentiment on both sides of the conflict in Gaza and concerns over rising antisemitism in the U.S. Democratic Rep. Summer Lee, a 'squad'-aligned progressive critical of Israel's handling of the war and one of the first lawmakers to call for a cease-fire last year, will face Bhavini Patel, an Edgewood Borough Council member who has painted Lee's advocacy as harmful to Biden's re-election chances and out of step with her district.\n'We have communities that are hurting. The Jewish community is one of them. And there are people who are … not going to agree 100% on everything that you say,' Lee said in an interview, adding she has been 'very clear and very upfront' about her cease-fire position. 'I have condemned Hamas. We've worked with the families of hostages; we've done everything that I think is necessary to do that. And at the end of the day, we disagree.'\nA dozen Jewish voters in the district who spoke to NBC News, whether supporting Lee or Patel, almost universally said their votes in November would be driven by issues beyond Israel, saying that the Jewish electorate isn't a 'monolith' and that democracy, abortion rights and the economy weighed heavily on them.\nMost Jewish voters in Squirrel Hill — and nationally — align with the Democratic Party. A Pew Research Center survey released this month found 69% of Jews leaning Democratic, while 29% aligned Republican.\nBut Republicans aren't looking for a massive defection. GOP strategists and Republicans involved in Jewish outreach expressed confidence that Democratic divisions over Israel will help move a small but potentially significant number of Jewish voters into their camp in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona. They pointed to surveys showing President Donald Trump's improved performance among Jews in 2020, compared with his 2016 race, as evidence of a slow shift that could continue.\n'Before Oct. 7, most candidates would say this issue is so messy. … It's not necessarily something that I want to focus on in my campaign,' said Tali deGroot, political director for the liberal Jewish group J Street. 'And I would have said, ‘Absolutely, this isn't a voting issue for people we poll year after year.' And it's too soon to tell if it's going to be a voting issue. But not talking about it is not an option.'‘Playing with fire' In Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, the war and its impact at home took center stage last week at a campaign event where Lee launched her 'Jews for Summer' coalition.\nLee talked about 'how our liberation is tied together,' whether 'in western Pennsylvania or the West Bank.' She spoke about how the district still needs 'deep healing' following both the Oct. 7 attack and the killing of Jews at Tree of Life. And she framed her primary as a covert Republican effort to divide a multiethnic, cross-religious support base by using splits over Israel.\n'There are people who have to convince you that the only reason why I could believe in peace is because I actually hate some of our neighbors, not because we love each other,' said Lee, who overcame significant spending by groups aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group, when she narrowly won her first congressional primary in 2022.\nIsrael didn't have the salience it does now. Lee has accused the Israeli government of committing 'war crimes,\" called for an end to unconditional military aid to the country and joined a handful of other progressives in mid-2022, before the Israel-Hamas war, who voted against a GOP-led resolution that said Israel wasn't 'a racist or apartheid state.' She has also condemned Hamas' attack and repeatedly spoken out against antisemitism.\nOn Saturday, she joined 36 Democrats and 21 Republicans in voting against an aid package to the country, which passed overwhelmingly. She and Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., were the only Pennsylvania members to vote against it.\nHer early call for a cease-fire is now largely in step with Democratic voters, but Jewish leaders have expressed unease with how Lee and some of her allies have discussed the issue. Last month, more than 40 Pittsburgh-area rabbis wrote in a letter, after an earlier meeting with Lee, that she has 'continued to use divisive rhetoric' that the group has at times 'perceived as openly antisemitic.'\nTheir letter didn't describe that rhetoric, but it said Lee opposed House measures to condemn antisemitism and criticized her calls for an 'unconditional cease-fire from one side,' which they said 'devalues the lives and beliefs of one group.' They also called on her to return campaign contributions 'from people who have voiced virulently antisemitic sentiments.' In February, Lee canceled an appearance before the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations amid backlash over other speakers' antisemitic and homophobic remarks, which she condemned.\nKaren Hochenberg, president of a local Democratic club that has endorsed Patel, said Lee has lost considerable support in the Jewish community, including hers. While Hochenberg aligns with Lee on many issues, she and others have been 'hurt' by some of her votes and actions, and she said she wished Lee had been more vocal about the Hamas attack.\n'Many Jews now are starting to question where are we on the road map of intersectionality,' Hochenberg said. 'Jews are starting to really take a look at how comfortable we are and if we're going to send candidates to Congress who's going to be there and have the voice of the Jewish community in mind, as well.'\nJeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgher leading a new Jewish voter group, said the pushback Lee faces isn't so much about Israel but about what he called an unwillingness to meet with constituents who don't share her views.\n'She finds the individuals who agree with her already who are anti-Zionist, who are extremist or fringe of the left of politics, and she will hold them up on a pedestal while spreading things' that, Kazzaz said, make local Jews 'less safe.'\nBut overall, Lee is looking stronger in her district now than in her first run, even to some opponents. AIPAC-linked groups aren't getting involved in her primary this time. Lee has framed her campaign around efforts to counter MAGA Republicans and bring federal dollars to the district.\nJonathan Mayo, a Squirrel Hill resident co-leading the Jews for Summer coalition, told NBC News he aligns with Lee's position on Israel but emphasized that he's not a single-issue voter.\n'It is so important to speak out and show that there are members of the Squirrel Hill Jewish community who still very much support Summer Lee,' he said.\nPatel, meanwhile, is framing her challenge to Lee around who offers Biden the most support, hitting Lee for not criticizing activists and groups calling for 'uncommitted' votes against the president in Tuesday's primary.\n'It's essentially playing with fire,' Patel said in an interview, arguing it could boost Trump.\nLee allies have countered that anti-Biden GOP megadonors support Patel's campaign. An outside group boosting Patel recently disclosed that it received an $800,000 donation from right-wing billionaire Jeffrey Yass. (Patel said she 'denounces' Yass, calling any focus on him a distraction.)\nLee has said she is supporting Biden in the fall. She's endorsed by congressional Democratic leadership and by Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has become arguably the most staunchly pro-Israel Democrat in Congress. And in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, Biden shouted out Lee as someone 'who had my back.'\n'We're going to make sure that the person who's sitting in the White House is not going to be replaced,' Lee said at her event on a recent Sunday.\nSeveral attendees said they were casting anti-Biden protest votes Tuesday. But most said they would support him this fall.\nOne of them, Harry Hochheiser, said Biden 'is the only legitimate choice' against Trump. He said the divisions opened up in the Jewish community over the war have been devastating.\n'I don't think any of us enjoy these divisions,' Hochheiser, a University of Pittsburgh professor and pro-Palestinian activist voting uncommitted in the primary but backing Biden against Trump, said of tensions in the Jewish community over Israel.\n‘More salient than it has been' The fight for Jewish votes in Pittsburgh is only part of a bigger landscape. Across Pennsylvania, Republican Dave McCormick has put Israel at the forefront of his campaign against Democratic Sen. Bob Casey. Nationally, groups in both parties are preparing for what they say could be the largest investment ever made to court the Jewish vote at the presidential level.\nBiden's handling of the war is the main flashpoint. Initially, he was more deferential to Israel. But as the death toll mounted in Gaza and left-wing blowback intensified at home, he has sharpened his criticism of Israeli leadership, pushed for increased humanitarian aid and ramped-up efforts to reach a cease-fire agreement. Still, he hasn't gone as far as his critics to his left would like.\nAs for whether Republicans can pick up voters disaffected by the Democratic divide over Israel, Mark Mellman, president of Democratic Majority for Israel, said it's 'mostly noise' but cautioned 'there is a serious chance' depending how the coming months play out.\nJewish voters have 'been extraordinarily appreciative of the support that President Biden and Democratic leaders have given Israel over the course of this conflict,' he said. 'I hear from some people that is beginning to change as people perceive some change in the positions of those Democratic leaders. But look … Biden has been extraordinary.'\nA 2021 Pew Research Center survey found a wide split in partisanship among Jewish voters depending on which movement they aligned with. Orthodox Jews favored Republicans over Democrats by 75% to 20%, while 70% of Conservative Jews and 80% of Reform Jews backed Democrats.\nSam Markstein, national political director at the Republican Jewish Coalition, said much of the Jewish vote is based in states where Republicans have no shot at all, contributing to the gulf in support between Republicans and Democrats. Pointing to an Associated Press VoteCast survey after the 2020 election that found Trump improved on his 2016 performance among Jewish voters, Markstein predicts the Republican Jewish Coalition will make its 'largest investment at the top of the ticket ever' this cycle to target Jewish voters in battlegrounds.\n'That's where you're going to see the most success this year,' he said.\nSome other surveys had more positive trends for Democrats. This month's Pew survey found the share of Jewish voters who align with Democrats has increased 8 points since 2020.\nDan Siegel, who led Jewish outreach for Biden's 2020 campaign, said Jewish voters' foremost concerns are similar to those of any other voting group: the economy, health care and education.\n'I do think [Israel] may be a little bit more top of mind. But I also think at the end of the day, elections are a binary choice,' Siegel said, predicting Jewish voters 'are going to want that strong, steady hand, not an authoritarian demagogue who is unwieldy at best in a crisis.'\nTrump, who strongly favored Israel as president, has offered limited commentary on the war. Speaking last month with Israel Hayom, an Israeli newspaper, Trump said, 'You have to finish up your war. You have to get it done. We have to get to peace. We can't have this going on.'\nBiden's campaign has zoomed in on recent comments Trump has made about Jewish voters; he said on Real America's Voice that 'any Jewish person who votes for Biden does not love Israel and, frankly, should be spoken to.'\nIn a statement, Karoline Leavitt, Trump's national press secretary, slammed Democrats for caving in 'to the demands of far-left Palestinian extremists.\"\nAsked about Trump's comments on the war, Markstein said he believed Trump 'was just giving voice to the frustration of … people [who] want this to be concluded, with Israel defeating Hamas and rescuing the hostages.' On Trump's remarks about Jewish voters, Markstein said Trump 'was just trying to say in a Trumpian way … why haven't they been more vocal in their opposition to what their own leaders of their party are doing?'\nBack in Pittsburgh, Kipp Dawson, a Jewish civil rights activist backing Lee, said she would be horrified by Trump's re-election and expressed hope that Lee would be able to bring skeptical Democrats back on board with Biden this fall.\n'My sense is that things are extraordinarily in flux in this country right now,' she said. 'The big issue for November is who's going to come out to vote.'\nAt Pinsker's, the Cohens declined to say whom they'd support in next week's primary or the general election, though they said a number of Jews in Squirrel Hill were eager to back Patel.\n'The Jewish community really feels that if they don't take the stand now, [U.S. support for Israel] is not going to be assured,' Baila Cohen said. 'Everyone's very interested in getting actively involved and being part of the political scene in a way that doesn't always play out.'\nAllan Smith Emma Barnett",
