            "excerpt": "The bid to oust Republican Rep. Scott Perry has centered on his involvement in Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",
            "summary": "CAMP HILL, Pa. — Democratic congressional candidate Mike O'Brien had only been knocking on doors in a leafy suburban neighborhood here for about 20 minutes when he came upon a house with a sign featuring his opponent's face in the window. He smiled.\n'WANTED for crimes against the CONSTITUTION,' the sign read. 'Scott Perry for Prison. Traitor. Insurrectionist. Criminal.'\n'That's one of the reasons why I'm running,' O'Brien, one of six Democrats vying to unseat Perry, a GOP congressman, told the couple who answered the door. 'You can't let Trump and Perry overthrow democracy under the guise of patriotism anymore.'\nIt's a message that Democrats, including President Biden, hope will resonate in places like Camp Hill, a middle-class suburb outside Pennsylvania's capital, Harrisburg. The area was once a Republican stronghold but has become more politically independent in recent years due to population growth and moderate Republicans alienated by Trump's norm-busting behavior.\nAdvertisement\nThe competitive Democratic primary here Tuesday offers a preview of how Democrats intend to make democracy a central issue in competitive races for seats such as Perry's, which could help determine control of the narrowly divided U.S. House. It also provides a glimpse of the case Biden will make in battleground states like Pennsylvania.\nBiden has said his reelection is above all else about preserving democracy, which he warns is under threat if Trump wins a second term. In his first campaign speech of 2024, on the day before the anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, Biden stood less than 100 miles from here in Valley Forge.\n'Whether democracy is still America's sacred cause is the most urgent question of our time, and it's what the 2024 election is all about,' he said.\nIt remains unclear whether voters will see it that way. Beyond the defense of democracy, Americans will be asked to weigh more tangible issues, including inflation, immigration and abortion. The age of the candidates — Biden is 81 and Trump is 77 — will also loom large in a presidential rematch that polls show many Americans didn't want.\nAdvertisement\nBut there's also reason to believe democracy as an issue will carry more weight than it did four years ago. This is the first presidential vote since Trump and his allies spread false claims about the 2020 election results, a violent mob besieged the U.S. Capitol to stop the certification of Biden's victory and Trump declared that he would be a 'dictator' — if only on 'day one' of his second term.\nSince the 2020 vote, there has been additional evidence that campaigns built on the defense of democracy can resonate in the Trump era. In his campaign for governor in 2022, Democrat Josh Shapiro eviscerated Republican Doug Mastriano, who played a key role in the effort to challenge Biden's win in Pennsylvania and paid to bus Trump supporters to Washington for the 'Stop the Steal' rally on Jan. 6. Shapiro ultimately beat Mastriano by 15 percentage points.\nDemocrats say a similar pitch will work in the 10th Congressional District race against Perry, who was a key liaison between House Republicans and the White House in efforts to overturn the election.\nAdvertisement\nThe House select committee investigating Jan. 6 found that Perry took part in White House meetings where strategies to try to undermine the transfer of power were discussed. He also pressed the Justice Department to investigate wild and unfounded claims that military satellites had been used to flip votes from Trump to Biden. After Trump supporters attacked the Capitol, Perry formally objected to the counting of Pennsylvania's electoral votes.\nIn 2022, the FBI seized Perry's cellphone as part of its investigation into attempts to thwart certification of the 2020 election. The Jan. 6 committee subpoenaed the congressman to testify, but he refused. He later denied assertions by former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson that he had asked for a preemptive pardon.\nNationally, Democrats see Perry, who is running for his seventh term in Congress, as one of their best shots at toppling a prominent election denier and are expected to invest heavily in trying to flip the seat.\nAdvertisement\nWhile most Republicans who voted against certifying the 2020 results represent safe red districts, Perry's district is more of a bellwether. Under the boundaries of the 10th District, Trump would have won by four percentage points over Biden. Shapiro won the district by 12 percentage points in 2020, while Perry won reelection by eight points. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the district 'lean Republican.'\nDemocrats say they can beat Perry this time with a stronger candidate and a more targeted message tying the congressman to extremism and Jan. 6, as Shapiro successfully did against Mastriano. Perry's campaign said it sees that as a fantasy.\n'They say insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result. Democrats tried and failed to make the events that followed the 2020 election an issue in the 2022 midterm elections. Congressman Perry earned reelection in 2022 by an even larger margin than he did in 2020 because the voters of south-central Pennsylvania know he is fighting for them each and every day,' said Matt Beynon, spokesman for the Perry campaign.\nSome public polling suggests that Democrats are significantly more worried about threats to democracy than other voters. A USA Today-Suffolk poll conducted in March asked respondents to choose the issue most important to them in their presidential vote. Among Democrats, 44 percent said threats to democracy were their top issue versus 20 percent of independents and 6 percent of Republicans. For Democrats, no other issue came close.\nA Washington Post-Schar School poll also conducted in March found that a majority of Americans were very or extremely worried about threats to democracy in the United States, including 58 percent of Democrats and 47 percent of Republicans.\nAdvertisement\nStephen Medvic, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College, said democracy is clearly a factor for voters in the Democratic primary. But he said he's skeptical of its power to move swing voters in the general election against Perry.\nThe Democratic nominee, he said, will have to 'connect a bunch of dots that this candidate had a role, and that Jan. 6 was a real threat and going forward that Trump and Perry would continue to put democracy at risk.'\nDemocrats are getting some help on that front from anti-Trump Republicans. A new group, Republicans Against Perry, placed a billboard this month on a major interstate through the district. The ad shows photos of Mastriano and Perry, both with red Xs over their faces.\nCraig Snyder, who served as chief of staff to then-Republican Sen. Arlen Specter, started the group and said he's received thousands of inquires from people who want to be involved.\nAdvertisement\n'When you look at the responses we've had, the people wanting to come to events, it's enough Republicans in the district to form a pro-democracy coalition,' he said.\nFirst, Democrats need to pick a candidate to run against Perry.\nO'Brien, a 42-year-old retired TOPGUN fighter pilot, said voters are most enthusiastic when he alleges that Perry, who is also a veteran, violated his oath of office to uphold the Constitution by siding with Trump after the 2020 election.\nAs O'Brien knocked on doors in the district one recent day, a couple in their 80s told him that they were deciding between him and Janelle Stelson, a longtime local TV news anchor whose name recognition has made her the presumptive front-runner in the race. O'Brien told them that his message is 'very focused on democracy and making sure that Trump and Perry aren't in a position to overthrow it again.'\nAdvertisement\nThe couple said they had long been registered Republican but recently became Democrats because of their deep aversion to Trump. Electing him again, Kathy Vollmer, 83, said, 'would be like vindicating him.' Her husband, Phil Vollmer, 85, chimed in, saying, 'Perry's an idiot. Trump is dangerous.'\nStelson was also a longtime registered Republican but switched to become a Democrat in January 2023. If she can convince traditional Democrats to vote for her in the primary, she said she thinks her past political affiliation will help her win over the independents and Republicans needed to beat Perry.\nWalking through a suburban neighborhood in York County one recent day, Stelson said Perry's role in Jan. 6 is part of her message. 'He tried to overturn all of our votes,' she said.\nBut she's also focusing heavily on reproductive rights and Perry's support for legislation that would make it federal law that life begins at conception.\nAdvertisement\nHours before the last debate of the primary, O'Brien went to get a fade at the barbershop in Harrisburg he frequents. Inside, over the low hum of razors, he debated politics with owner Johnny Butler, a registered Democrat who said he has backed Trump because he finds the former president to be authentic — even if he's lying.\nButler said issues such as inflation are on his mind as he makes his choices for 2024. Asked if he was worried that Trump would attempt to subvert democracy, Butler said that 'it's impossible' because of the Constitution.\nLater that night, Butler was in the debate's audience to support O'Brien, who was the only candidate on the stage to mention democracy in his opening and closing remarks. In their questions, the moderators didn't bring it up.",

Both districts are located just outside Detroit and are heavily Democratic, with the previous Democratic incumbents each having won by over 25 percentage points in 2022.\nThe lower chamber has been tied 54-54 between Democratic and Republican lawmakers since November, when two Democratic representatives vacated their seats after winning mayoral races in their hometowns. Democrats previously held a majority in both chambers along with control of the governor's office.\nAdvertisement\n'These special elections will determine who controls the House here in Michigan and set the tone for November, when we will decide whether Democrats hold on to the state House,' said Michigan Democratic Party Chair Lavora Barnes.\nDemocrats flipped both chambers in the 2022 midterms while maintaining control of the governor's office to win a trifecta for the first time in 40 years. They moved quickly to roll back decades of Republican measures and implement the party's agenda in their first year, including overhauling the state's gun laws.\nSince the House deadlocked, Republicans have pushed to pass legislation they say is bipartisan, such as a government transparency package, which would open the Legislature and governor's office up to public record requests. But very little legislation has been passed. Democrats have been unwilling to accept a joint power-sharing agreement proposed multiple times by Republican House Leader Matt Hall over the past few months.\nAdvertisement\nIf both Democratic candidates win Tuesday, the party will regain control through the end of the year, with each seat in the House up for reelection in November. Either party would need to win both seats to gain a majority.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nXiong is a Macomb County commissioner who was endorsed in the primary by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Her opponent, Singer, ran for the seat in 2022 and lost to former state Rep. Lori Stone by 34 percentage points.\nIn the 25th, Herzberg, a Westland City Council member, will take on Powell, a veteran who has said in his campaign that he would support less government, less regulation and lower taxes. Former Rep. Kevin Coleman, a Democrat, won the district by 26 percentage points in 2022.\nMichigan Republican Party Chair Pete Hoekstra said Republicans still 'forced the candidates and Democrat committees to spend money to protect these seats.'\nAdvertisement\n'Win or lose, I'm more convinced than ever that Republicans are motivated and the Democrats are not,' Hoekstra said in a statement sent to The Associated Press.\nAfter Tuesday's special elections, lawmakers are expected to turn their focus to a state budget with a self-imposed July 1 deadline. Whitmer used her January State of the State speech to propose an $81 billion budget that would provide free community college for all high school graduates and preschool for 4-year-olds.\nIn recent months, Democrats have also considered expanding the state's hate crime law and enacting a comprehensive school safety package spurred by the 2021 mass shooting at Oxford High School. A majority in the House would let them more easily move those proposals.",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Some Democrats are entertaining the prospect of coming to House Speaker Mike Johnson's rescue should Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., force a vote seeking his ouster, though it will likely depend on his ability to deliver an emergency aid package focused on Ukraine and Israel.\nDemocratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has suggested that Democrats would help Johnson if the speaker faced retribution from within his own party for holding votes on the $95.3 billion package. But he's also encouraging his colleagues to take a wait-and-see approach to apply maximum leverage.\n'Do not box yourself in with a public statement,' Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark, the No. 2-ranking House Democratic leader, told colleagues in a closed-door session Thursday, according to a person familiar with the private remarks.\nAdvertisement\nStill, Johnson's future been a much discussed topic on Capitol Hill — even more so after Republican leadership on Thursday floated the possibility of changing the House rules to make it easier for a speaker to withstand a challenge from members of their own party. With or without the rule change, Johnson may need Democratic support to remain as speaker if Greene or someone else forces a vote.\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., said if the aid package makes it over the finish line, 'I think a lot of people are not going to want to punish him for doing the right thing.'\nGreene has threatened to try to oust Johnson and warned that advancing funding for Ukraine would help build her case that GOP lawmakers should select a new speaker. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., tweeted this week that he told Johnson during a closed-door Republican conference meeting that he would be co-sponsoring Greene's motion. Massie suggested Johnson 'should pre-announce his resignation' and give Republicans time to select a successor.\nAdvertisement\nThe vast majority of Republicans are distancing themselves from Greene's effort, wary of repeating the chaos the House endured last fall when eight Republicans joined with Democrats in removing then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., from the post. It's likely that Johnson would not need a large number of Democratic lawmakers to help him remain in the speaker's office, but it would depend on how many Republicans voted to remove him.\nRep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., said that if Johnson would put the Senate-passed measure on the floor, 'I would do what I had to do to make sure he does not lose his job for that.' Johnson made the decision to take the Senate measure and break it into three separate bills. He's also added a fourth bill focused on national security priorities.\nBreaking up the package into parts gives lawmakers the ability to vote against military assistance to Ukraine or Israel without tanking the entire measure.\nAdvertisement\nJohnson said he has not asked a single Democrat to 'get involved in that at all' when asked about a possible motion to vacate.\n'I do not spend time walking around thinking about the motion to vacate,' Johnson said. 'I have a job to do here and I'm going to do the job, regardless of personal consequences.'\nRep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., said he would consider voting present during a speaker vote if Johnson allowed the Ukraine aid to be voted on.\n'Why in the world would I want to go along with Marjorie Taylor Greene if Mike Johnson just gave us a vote I've been advocating for for more than six months?' Boyle said. 'I think a number of Democrats would be in the same position — not necessarily a vote for him, but just make clear this is a Republican issue and we're not going to aid and abet Marjorie Taylor Greene to cause even more chaos.'\nAdvertisement\n'I hope he will have some sort of conversation with Hakeem, but either way, yes, I'm one of those who would save him if we can do Israel, Taiwan, Ukraine and some reasonable border security,' said Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas.\nOther Democrats said helping Johnson must come as part of a package deal. They said he shouldn't expect Democratic support just by putting the Senate-passed package up for a vote. He'll need to have coordinated with Jeffries as well.\n'We're just not going to go and bail out one of the most conservative Republican speakers in American history. But what Kevin McCarthy failed to do is even entertain a conversation to try to make a deal. Democrats were ready to deal. Kevin McCarthy refused to,' said Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass. 'If Speaker Johnson cares about doing the right thing as well as keeping his job, then he ought to make a deal with Democrats.'\nAdvertisement\nRep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., said there is a 'powerful instinct' among Democrats that it's not their job to rescue Johnson from the chaos in his party. But he's willing to help Johnson on the motion to vacate if he were to 'do the right thing' on the aid package and coordinate that with Jeffries.\n'I will defer to getting things done as opposed to tying myself up in partisan knots, but it's going to be Hakeem who decides how we act,' Himes said. 'We're not going to let the Republicans sort of chip off a number of us. This will be negotiated with our leadership.'\nRep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, said he's unlikely to help Johnson and is not sure how long the speaker would be around anyway if he has to rely on Democratic votes to continue on the job.\n'I've listened to what Mr. Jeffries said and I won't rule it out, but I'm inclined to vote as I normally would. I am very concerned about how long he's delayed Ukraine. We count the days. They count the lives lost,' Doggett said.\nAdvertisement\nAnd then there are scores of Democrats who are in the hard 'no' camp.\nRep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., for example, said there was no way he would vote to keep Johnson as speaker.\n'I think his worldview is very dangerous. I think there's no scenario where I'm going to reward someone like that, who allows this level of chaos to happen in the House.'\nAnd Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., also is a hard no on helping Johnson, calling it a well-intentioned idea that is fundamentally flawed.\n'Bad on guns, bad on gays, bad on abortion and bad on voting rights,' Connolly said. 'He litigated the overturning of the (2020) election. He didn't just vote the wrong way. He signed up for a lawsuit. That's who you want to save? Go home and explain that to Democrats.'\nMassie warned that if Democrats help Johnson stay on a speaker, 'they would doom him, they won't save him.'\n'It's not a stable situation if a Republican speaker is speaker only by virtue of Democrats fighting for him,' Massie said.\n___",

            "excerpt": "Rep. Summer Lee's criticism of Israel's response to the Oct. 7 attacks initially set her apart. But the Israel-Gaza war has shifted U.S. public opinion.",
            "summary": "PITTSBURGH — Rep. Summer Lee, a freshman Democrat who faces a primary challenge Tuesday from an opponent who has characterized her as extreme on foreign policy, was one of the first members of Congress to criticize Israel's military response to the Oct. 7 attacks in which Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages.\nLee, a member of the 'Squad' of lefty Democrats, called for a cease-fire a little over a week after the attack and suggested Israel was guilty of 'blatant human rights violations.'\nThat reaction initially set Lee apart from many in her party. But as Israel has continued its retaliatory assault on Hamas-run Gaza, U.S. public opinion has shifted. Approval of Israel's military actions among Democrats nationwide dropped from 36 percent in November to 18 percent in March, according to a recent Gallup poll.\nAdvertisement\nSome in this community, which is home to the Tree of Life synagogue, the site of the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history, have come around to their congresswoman's position.\nLee made 'some missteps with the Jewish community' in the early days after Oct. 7, making statements that some people here viewed as sympathetic only to Palestinians, Annie Weidman said as she shopped for Passover groceries this weekend.\nIn the months that followed, Lee 'calmed down her rhetoric,' said Weidman, 63. 'And I do understand her position of being very much for the Palestinian people because it's really, really awful, and I totally get it.'\n'Everybody has sort of moved to her position rather than the other way around,' Weidman, who voted early for Lee, added later.\nSince October, some 34,000 Palestinians, including 13,000 children, have been killed in Gaza, according to local health authorities. And although the House of Representatives approved a new tranche of aid for Israel on Saturday over the objections of 58 members, including Lee, top Democratic leaders, including President Biden and Sen. Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), have sharpened their criticism of the Israeli government in recent weeks.\nAdvertisement\n'What we're seeing slowly but surely is not voters catching up to the Squad — it is other Democratic politicians catching up to where voters have been for months,' said Usamah Andrabi, the communications director for Justice Democrats, which works to elect liberals to Congress and has supported Lee's reelection campaign.\nBoth Lee and her opponent, Edgewood Borough council member Bhavini Patel, dispute the idea that Tuesday's election is primarily about the war. But voters here volunteer their thoughts on the topic without prompting. In Squirrel Hill, home to Patel's campaign office, lawn signs bearing her name appear frequently next to ones reading 'we stand with Israel.'\nPatel has continued to criticize Lee's position on the conflict.\n'She's clearly picked a side in this situation and completely disregards her entire district,' Patel said in an interview Saturday. 'I think it's important that any call for a cease-fire should acknowledge that hostages are still being held,' she added.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Lee first ran for this seat two years ago, pro-Israel outside groups, including Democratic Majority for Israel and a PAC associated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) spent heavily in an attempt to defeat her, holding her to a 1,000-vote victory in the primary.\nBut neither the AIPAC-affiliated group nor Democratic Majority for Israel have intervened in this year's primary, according to the most recent federal campaign finance filing data. Asked about the race, an AIPAC representative said the group is 'already involved in several races, and we will be engaged in additional campaigns where we can have the greatest impact.' A representative for DMFI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nInstead, the Moderate PAC, a group backed by Republican megadonor Jeffrey Yass, has intervened in the race, airing television ads attacking Lee for 'opposing Biden' as images of pro-abortion-rights protests and the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection played on-screen.\nAdvertisement\nPatel has denounced Yass and said that she considers herself 'a principled progressive Democrat,' but Lee and her allies have worked to make the billionaire's involvement in the race a liability for Patel. At a Sunday rally with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), supporters of Lee waved black-and-yellow signs reading 'Move, Yass! Get out of the way' and 'Stop Republican billionaires.'\nOcasio-Cortez characterized the Moderate PAC's involvement as 'an attempt to purchase and buy the seat back.' Attendees booed as she mentioned Yass and AIPAC. She stressed the importance of showing the world and 'the people in that big White House' that Lee 'is not alone,' and reminded voters that Tuesday's primary is the first of several challenges to members of the Squad, including Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri.\nVoters here frequently bring up their faith when describing their vote, and religious leaders have expressed strong opinions about the candidates. Last fall, 40 Pittsburgh rabbis and cantors wrote an open letter denouncing Lee for being one of only nine Democrats to vote against a resolution avowing support for Israel and condemning Hamas. In a follow-up letter in March, many of the same rabbis and cantors accused her of using 'divisive language, which, at times, we have perceived as openly antisemitic.'\nAdvertisement\nIn Squirrel Hill, home to a politically active and sizable Jewish community, the 14th Ward Independent Democratic Club, a local group that's not formally affiliated with the party, endorsed Patel this year after backing Lee two years ago.\n'Some people are not interested in combating antisemitism, and they're not interested in hearing and talking with and representing the Jewish community in the same way they necessarily are other communities,' said Jeremy Kazzaz, a member of the club's board and the president of the Beacon Coalition, a recently launched organization that aims to provide 'voter education on issues of concern to the Jewish American community' and that has endorsed Patel.\nBut the city's religious communities are far from united behind either candidate.\n'This has been a very, very painful couple of years for the Pittsburgh Jewish community,' said Jared Magnani, 55.

It consists of nearly every Democrat and about half of Republicans.\nThe pattern was reinforced this weekend with a vote to pass Ukraine aid, but it has played out over and over again this Congress with the passage of major pieces of legislation.\nThe Republican majority has been unable to unite around must-pass bills and has thus repeatedly relied on Democrats to push bills past the finish line.\nAdvertisement\nThis weekend's vote on $60 billion for Ukraine: 112 Republicans opposed it.

(Forty-six Democrats opposed it.)\nThe group of Republicans who have joined with Democrats is slightly different each time, but the pattern is the same. What holds the coalition together is a desire to avoid government shutdowns and, in the case of the Ukraine and FISA votes, a commitment to traditional national security priorities.\n'House Democrats have risen to the occasion. President Biden has risen to the occasion. Traditional conservatives led by Speaker Mike Johnson have risen to the occasion,' House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said, touting the bipartisan coalition ahead of Saturday's passage of four national security bills.\nPresident Biden has risen to the occasion.

Democrats also control the Senate and the White House.\nAdvertisement\nSome hard-right House Republicans have tried to ignore that reality. They defeated procedural rules, a tactic that was nearly unheard of until this Congress. They kicked out one speaker and are threatening another for daring to pass bills with big bipartisan majorities.\n'This is a sellout of America,' said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who is leading the effort to depose Johnson from his job as speaker.\nRep.

The House turned a portion of the Ukraine funding — the 20 percent that goes directly to the Ukrainian government — into a loan, and the House passed a fourth bill that seizes Russian assets and would ban TikTok if it isn't sold by its Chinese parent.\nAdvertisement\nWhile the House passed the four parts separately, the bills are combined into one in the Senate. It will hold a vote Tuesday at 1 p.m. to move on the measure.\nThe earlier package received 70 votes in February. The vote tally this week should be similar.\nWhat happens next on that effort to oust Johnson\nThe House adjourned for the week without Greene trigging her motion to remove Johnson from the speakership. She continues to insist that she will do it but hasn't provided a timeline.\nBased on her comments, it appears she doesn't have widespread support beyond the definitive other two Republicans who have signed on: Reps.

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats could end the impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday before arguments even begin.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is expected to call votes to dismiss two articles of impeachment against Mayorkas after senators are sworn in as jurors midday, a move that could scuttle the trial and frustrate Republicans who have demanded that House prosecutors be able to make their case. Democrats appear to be united in opposition to moving forward.\nThe House narrowly voted in February to impeach Mayorkas for his handling of the U.S.-Mexico border, arguing in the two articles that he 'willfully and systematically' refused to enforce immigration laws. House impeachment managers appointed by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., delivered the charges to the Senate on Tuesday, standing in the well of the Senate and reading the them aloud to a captive audience of senators.\nAdvertisement\nThe entire process could be done within hours on Wednesday. Majority Democrats have said the GOP case against Mayorkas doesn't rise to the 'high crimes and misdemeanors' laid out as a bar for impeachment in the Constitution, and Schumer probably has enough votes to end the trial immediately if he decides to do so.\nSchumer has said he wants to 'address this issue as expeditiously as possible.'\n'Impeachment should never be used to settle a policy disagreement,' Schumer said. 'That would set a horrible precedent for the Congress.'\nAs Johnson signed the articles Monday in preparation for sending them across the Capitol, he said Schumer should convene a trial to 'hold those who engineered this crisis to full account.'\nSchumer 'is the only impediment to delivering accountability for the American people,' Johnson said. 'Pursuant to the Constitution, the House demands a trial.'\nAdvertisement\nOnce the senators are sworn in on Wednesday, the chamber will turn into the court of impeachment, with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington presiding. Murray is the president pro tempore of the Senate, or the senior-most member of the majority party who sits in for the vice president.\nExactly how Democrats will proceed on Wednesday is still unclear. Impeachment rules generally allow the Senate majority to decide how to manage the trial, and Schumer has not said exactly what he will do.\nSenate Republicans are likely to try to raise a series of objections if Schumer calls votes to dismiss or table. But ultimately they cannot block a dismissal if majority Democrats have the votes.\nIn any case, Republicans would not be able to win the support of the two-thirds of the Senate that is needed to convict and remove Mayorkas from office — Democrats control the Senate, 51-49, and they appear to be united against the impeachment effort. Not one House Democrat supported it, either.\nAdvertisement\nWhile most Republicans oppose quick dismissal, some have hinted they could vote with Democrats.\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said last week he wasn't sure what he would do if there were a move to dismiss the trial. 'I think it's virtually certain that there will not be the conviction of someone when the constitutional test has not been met,' he said.\nAt the same time, Romney said he wants to at least express his view that 'Mayorkas has done a terrible job, but he's following the direction of the president and has not met the constitutional test of a high crime or misdemeanor.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe two articles argue that Mayorkas not only refused to enforce existing law but also breached the public trust by lying to Congress and saying the border was secure. The House vote was the first time in nearly 150 years a Cabinet secretary was impeached.\nAdvertisement\nSince then, Johnson has delayed sending the articles to the Senate for weeks while both chambers finished work on government funding legislation and took a two-week recess. Johnson had said he would send them to the Senate last week, but he punted again after Senate Republicans said they wanted more time to prepare.\nHouse impeachment managers previewed some of their arguments at a hearing with Mayorkas on Tuesday morning about President Joe Biden's budget request for the department.\nTennessee Rep. Mark Green, the chairman of the House Homeland Security panel, told the secretary that he has a duty under the law to control and guard U.S. borders, and 'during your three years as secretary, you have failed to fulfill this oath. You have refused to comply with the laws passed by Congress, and you have breached the public trust.'\nAdvertisement\nMayorkas defended the department's efforts but said the nation's immigration system is 'fundamentally broken, and only Congress can fix it.'\nOther impeachment managers are Michael McCaul of Texas, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Ben Cline of Virginia, Andrew Garbarino of New York, Michael Guest of Mississippi, Harriet Hageman of Wyoming, Clay Higgins of Louisiana, Laurel Lee of Florida, August Plfuger of Texas and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.\nAt a press conference with a group of Republican senators after the articles were delivered, the impeachment managers demanded that Schumer move forward with their case.\n'The voice of the people is very clear,' said McCaul, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 'Secure the border and impeach this man, this criminal.'\nIf Democrats are unable to dismiss or table the articles, they could follow the precedent of several impeachment trials for federal judges over the last century and hold a vote to create a trial committee that would investigate the charges. While there is sufficient precedent for this approach, Democrats may prefer to end the process completely, especially in a presidential election year when immigration and border security are top issues.\nAdvertisement\nAt a trial, senators would be forced to sit in their seats for the duration, maybe weeks, while the House impeachment managers and lawyers representing Mayorkas make their cases. The Senate is allowed to call witnesses, as well, if it so decides, and it can ask questions of both sides after the opening arguments are finished.\n___",

Alabama has one of the earliest candidate certification deadlines in the country which has caused difficulties for whichever political party has the later convention date that year.\n'We want to make sure every citizen in the state of Alabama has the opportunity to vote for the candidate of his or her choice,' Democratic Sen. Merika Coleman, the sponsor of the Senate bill, told the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nAdvertisement\nThe issue of Biden's ballot access has arisen in Alabama and Ohio as Republican secretaries of state warned that certification deadlines fall before the Democratic National Convention is set to begin on Aug. 19. The Biden campaign has asked the two states to accept provisional certification, arguing that has been done in past elections. The Republican election chiefs have refused, arguing they don't have authority, and will enforce the deadlines.\nDemocrats proposed the two Alabama bills, but the legislation moved out of committee with support from Republicans who hold a lopsided majority in the Alabama Legislature. The bills were approved with little discussion. However, two Republicans who spoke in favor of the bill called it an issue of fairness.\nRepublican Rep. Bob Fincher, chairman of the committee that heard the House bill, said this is 'not the first time we've run into this problem' and the state made allowances.\nAdvertisement\n'I'd like to think that if the shoe was on the other foot, that this would be taken care of. And I think that Alabamians have a deep sense of fairness when it comes to politics and elections,' Republican Sen. Sam Givhan said during the committee meeting.\nTrump faced the same issue in Alabama in 2020. The Republican-controlled Alabama Legislature in 2020 passed legislation to change the certification deadline for the 2020 election. The bill stated that the change was made 'to accommodate the dates of the 2020 Republican National Convention.' However, an attorney representing the Biden campaign and DNC, wrote in a letter to Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen that it was provisional certification that allowed Trump on the ballot in 2020, because there were still problems with the GOP date even with the new 2020 deadline.\nAllen has maintained he does not have the authority to accept provisional certification.\nAdvertisement\nSimilarly, in Ohio, Attorney General Dave Yost and Secretary of State Frank LaRose, both Republicans, rejected a request from Democrats to waive the state's ballot deadline administratively by accepting a 'provisional certification' for Biden.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIn a letter Monday, Yost's office told LaRose that Ohio law does not allow the procedure. LaRose's office conveyed that information, in turn, in a letter to Democratic lawyer Don McTigue. LaRose's chief legal counsel, Paul Disantis, noted it was a Democrats who championed the state's ballot deadline, one of the earliest in the nation, 15 years ago. It falls 90 days before the general election, which this year is Aug. 7.\nOhio Senate Democratic Leader Nickie Antonio said she is waiting to hear from the Democratic National Committee on how to proceed. One of her members, state Sen. Bill DiMora, said he has legislation for either a short- or long-term fix ready to go when the time comes.\n___",

            "excerpt": "Republicans will argue that Democratic senators dispensing with the trial of the homeland security secretary shows they aren't serious about the border. But they were again undercut by their own.",
            "summary": "In early February, congressional Republicans made a conspicuous choice. They decided to kill a bipartisan Senate deal that included tough border security measures. Instead, they pressed forward with what was essentially a messaging exercise: impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\nThe confluence of events was telling. Even by the accounts of several Republicans, their party preferred attacking the Biden administration over the crisis at the border to actually doing something about it.\nTwo months later, Mayorkas's impeachment is dead. The Senate dispatched with the trial quickly Wednesday afternoon shortly after finally receiving a pair of articles of impeachment against Mayorkas from the House.\nIt was predictable that the Democratic-controlled Senate would do this. But Republicans hope it will, at the very least, make Democrats look bad — as if they aren't interested in holding accountable a man who Republicans say is responsible for the chaotic border.\nAdvertisement\nAnd will it make the Democrats look bad?\nThere is no question the border is a major liability for President Biden. Mayorkas isn't exactly a sympathetic character, either; a recent poll showed that independents dislike him by a 2-to-1 margin.\nBut the GOP's impeachment effort was troubled from the start — in ways that sharply undercut the claim that Democrats are derelict in shrugging off an impeachment trial. Even many Republicans said Mayorkas's actions weren't impeachable, and the party wound up lacking complete unity in both chambers in historic ways.\nThere was, of course, the remarkable initial vote in which the GOP-controlled House somehow failed to impeach Mayorkas. Three House Republicans voted against it, and a Democrat whom the GOP didn't expect to be present returned to leave the GOP one vote shy. The GOP ultimately succeeded a week later, by one vote.\nAdvertisement\nFast-forward to Wednesday, and the GOP was again unable to keep its membership united. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) moved to vote on whether the articles against Mayorkas were unconstitutional — basically that they weren't high crimes or misdemeanors, per the Constitution's required standard. On the first article, Mayorkas's alleged 'willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law,' Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) voted 'present.'\nIt appears to be the first time in modern history that a senator from the impeaching party didn't vote with the party against dismissing charges. Republican senators were united in opposing such a motion in the 1999 Bill Clinton impeachment — even as 10 later voted to acquit Clinton — and Democratic senators were also united in opposing a motion to dismiss Donald Trump's post-Jan. 6 impeachment charges three years ago.\nSimilarly, it's the first time every senator from the president's party voted to dismiss the charges. A lone Democrat voted against dismissing Clinton's charges in 1999, and five Republicans voted against dismissing Trump's in 2021.\nAdvertisement\nThe handful of GOP defections undersell just how much concern there was about what their party was doing. Several GOP senators who voted against dismissing the charges nonetheless previously labeled the whole thing a waste of time. They said the House hadn't shown Mayorkas actually did anything impeachable. They said Mayorkas was basically just carrying out the administration's policy.\nThose senators can perhaps justify their votes against dismissing the charges by saying the Senate should hold an actual trial if the House impeaches. But it's also evident that such a trial might well have resulted in a remarkable number of defections on the impeaching party's side — if the GOP senators stayed true to their past comments about Mayorkas.\nAdvertisement\nOf course, the intricacies of Congress — and whether an alleged offense is technically impeachable or just bad — are generally of little concern to the American people. So Republicans will point to this as evidence that Democrats aren't taking the border seriously and hope the American people care about it.\nbad — are generally of little concern to the American people. So Republicans will point to this as evidence that Democrats aren't taking the border seriously and hope the American people care about it.\nWhat we can say right now is that it's not clear Americans care or can be made to care that much. That poll mentioned above, from the Economist and YouGov shortly after Mayorkas's impeachment, showed Americans approved of it 43 percent to 25 percent — a pretty large margin. And as mentioned, the poll also showed Mayorkas was unpopular.\nBut it also showed 4 in 10 Americans didn't even have an opinion of him — reflecting how few people were tuning in to the whole thing. And we don't have other good polling on this, in large part because it doesn't seem to have penetrated as a story.",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — House Speaker Mike Johnson says he is sending impeachment charges against Alejandro Mayorkas to the Senate on Tuesday, forcing senators to convene a trial on the allegations that the Homeland Security secretary has 'willfully and systematically' refused to enforce existing immigration laws. But the proceedings may not last long.\nWhile the Senate is obligated to convene a trial under the rules of impeachment once the charges are walked across the Capitol, Democrats are expected to try to dismiss or table the charges before the arguments get underway.\nMajority Democrats have said the GOP case against Mayorkas doesn't rise to the 'high crimes and misdemeanors' laid out as a bar for impeachment in the Constitution, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., likely has enough votes to end the trial immediately if he decides to do so. The proceedings will not begin until Wednesday.\nAdvertisement\nOpening the Senate for the week, Schumer said he wants to 'address this issue as expeditiously as possible.'\n'Impeachment should never be used to settle a policy disagreement,' Schumer said. 'That would set a horrible precedent for the Congress.'\nSenators will be sworn in Wednesday as jurors, turning the chamber into the court of impeachment. The Senate will then issue a summons to Mayorkas to inform him of the charges and ask for a written answer. He will not have to appear in the Senate at any point.\nWhat happens after that is is unclear. Impeachment rules generally allow the Senate to decide how to proceed.\nRepublicans have argued there should be a full trial. As Johnson signed the articles Monday in preparation for sending them across the Capitol, he said Schumer should hold a trial to 'hold those who engineered this crisis to full account.'\nAdvertisement\n'Senator Schumer is the only impediment to delivering accountability for the American people,' Johnson said. 'Pursuant to the Constitution, the House demands a trial.'\nThe House narrowly voted in February to impeach Mayorkas for his handling of the border. House Republicans charged in two articles of impeachment that Mayorkas has not only refused to enforce existing law but also breached the public trust by lying to Congress and saying the border was secure. It was the first time in nearly 150 years a Cabinet secretary was impeached.\nSince then, Johnson has delayed sending the articles to the Senate for weeks while both chambers finished work on government funding legislation and took a two-week recess. Johnson had said he would send them to the Senate last week, but punted again after Senate Republicans said they wanted more time to prepare.\nAdvertisement\nSouth Dakota Sen. John Thune, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, has said the Senate needs to hold a full trial where it can examine the evidence against Mayorkas and come to a final conclusion.\n'This is an absolute debacle at the southern border,' Thune said. 'It is a national security crisis. There needs to be accountability,' he said.\nSchumer could call a vote to table the charges and end the trial as soon as Wednesday. Before a vote to dismiss, though, a group of House managers — members who act as prosecutors and are appointed by the speaker — will walk the articles across the Capitol and deliver the impeachment charges to be read on the Senate floor.\nHouse Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green, a Tennessee Republican who is one of the impeachment managers, said earlier this month that he believes Democrats 'have failed to meet the moment when it comes to ending this crisis and resolving the chaos at our borders.'\nAdvertisement\n'Conducting an impeachment trial represents a unique opportunity to correct course,' he said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nOther impeachment managers appointed by Speaker Johnson are Michael McCaul of Texas, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Ben Cline of Virginia, Andrew Garbarino of New York, Michael Guest of Mississippi, Harriet Hageman of Wyoming, Clay Higgins of Louisiana, Laurel Lee of Florida, August Plfuger of Texas and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.\nAfter the jurors are sworn in, Senate Republicans are likely to try to raise a series of objections if Schumer calls a vote to dismiss or table, an effort to both protest and delay the move. But ultimately they cannot block a dismissal if majority Democrats have the votes.\nWhile most Republicans oppose quick dismissal, some have hinted they could vote with Democrats.\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said last week he wasn't sure what he would do if there were a move to dismiss the trial. 'I think it's virtually certain that there will not be the conviction of someone when the constitutional test has not been met,' he said.\nAdvertisement\nAt the same time, Romney said he wants to at least express his view that 'Mayorkas has done a terrible job, but he's following the direction of the president and has not met the constitutional test of a high crime or misdemeanor.'\nIn any case, Republicans would not be able to win the support of the two-thirds of the Senate that is needed to convict and remove Mayorkas from office. Democrats control the Senate, 51-49, and they appear to be united against the impeachment effort. Not a single House Democrat supported it, either.\nSen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is facing a tough reelection bid in Ohio, called the impeachment trial a 'distraction,' arguing that Republicans should instead support a bipartisan border compromise they scuttled earlier this year.\n'Instead of doing this impeachment — the first one in 100 years — why are we not doing a bipartisan border deal?' he said.\nAdvertisement\nIf Democrats are not able to dismiss or table the articles, they could follow the precedent of several impeachment trials for federal judges over the last century and hold a vote to create a trial committee that would investigate the charges. While there is sufficient precedent for this approach, Democrats may prefer to end the process completely, especially in a presidential election year when immigration and border security are top issues.\nIf the Senate were to proceed to an impeachment trial, it would be the third in five years. Democrats impeached former President Donald Trump twice, once over his dealings with Ukraine and a second time in the days after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. The Senate acquitted Trump bothtimes.\nAt a trial, senators would be forced to sit in their seats for the duration, maybe weeks, while the House impeachment managers and lawyers representing Mayorkas make their cases. The Senate is allowed to call witnesses, as well, if it so decides, and can ask questions of both sides after the opening arguments are finished.\nMayorkas told reporters last week he was not focused on the Senate proceedings. In a twist, he'll be testifying about his budget request Tuesday to the same House committee that led the impeachment effort.",

            "summary": "President Biden and the Democratic groups allied with his campaign continue to demonstrate an enormous cash advantage over Donald Trump's presidential effort with nearly six months until the election.\nDown the ballot, new Federal Election Commission filings from the first quarter of 2024 show a leading Democratic super PAC outpacing its GOP counterpart in the battle for the Senate.\nDemocrats' hopes of maintaining control of the U.S. Senate — where they have a slim 51-49 majority — has long looked like difficult because the 2024 map is far more favorable to Republicans. Democrats are trying to defend 23 seats in the Senate — including three held by independents who caucus with Democrats — while Republicans need to hold just 11. The Democratic Party's task is complicated by the fact that they are all but certain to lose the seat of retiring Sen. Joe Manchin III, a conservative Democrat in deep-red West Virginia\nAdvertisement\nDemocratic groups are pouring resources into Ohio and Montana to help incumbent Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester defend their seats in states Trump carried in 2016 and 2020. Democrats are also defending their Senate seats in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada — states that are key to the presidential race — as well as Michigan, where Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow is retiring. Both Michigan and Arizona are open seats.\nThe Senate Leadership Fund, which supports Republicans, posted strong numbers in the first quarter of the year — raising $26 million, nearly doubling their cash on hand ($59.5 million). But Senate Majority PAC, an independent group associated with Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, outperformed its Republican counterparts — raising nearly $38.9 million during the quarter and ending the three-month period with $92 million in cash on hand. Senate Majority PAC has reserved $239 million in ads to defend seats in seven states.\nCongressional Republicans have expressed concerns about their ability to hold to the party's slim House majority in November. Those fears have been amplified in recent weeks by Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's threat to try to oust Speaker Mike Johnson over a Ukraine funding dispute, as well as the looming departure of Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), who will vacate his seat at the end of the week Gallagher's exit will leave Republicans with a one-vote majority — their smallest in decades.\nAdvertisement\nThe Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC which is supporting Republican House candidates across the country, reported raising $18.8 million in the first quarter and ended the period with $68.6 million in cash. House Majority PAC, which backs Democrats, will not file its report until April 20. But the group has said it raised $37 million with its affiliated organization House Majority Forward in the first quarter — demonstrating its advantage over CLF.\nBiden maintains his cash edge over Trump\nThough reports filed Monday continued to show Biden's huge cash advantage over Trump, they also offered a partial picture of the big money flowing into a new Trump super PAC, Right for America, which raised $13 million in the first quarter and spent nothing. The major donors to the committee were Ike and Laura Perlmutter, who donated $10.1 million, and Anthony Lomangino, the Palm Beach-based chairman and founder of Southern Waste Systems who gave $1.1. million.\nAdvertisement\nThe leadership PAC that Trump has primarily used to pay his legal fees, Save America, will not file its next report until April 20. But Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, spent $1.7 million on legal fees in the first quarter through another committee, Make America Great Again PAC. That group also spent $400,000 on 'document hosting' fees that are often related to discovery in legal cases. Trump spent more than $55 million on legal fees in 2023, creating a strain on overall fundraising effort as he fights criminal charges in four cases.\nThe Biden campaign announced earlier this month that it raised more than $90 million in March and that broader Biden effort had about $192 million in cash at the end of the month — more than double what their rivals are holding in their war chest. Reports from some Biden committees, alongside Democratic super PACs, showed the generosity of top Democratic donors such as megadonor James Simons, who gave $2.5 million each to Future Forward super PAC and Senate Majority PAC in the first three months of the year. He was joined by businessman Fred Eychaner, Kenneth and Jennifer Duda, and others in writing seven-figure checks to Future Forward, which raised $20 million in the first quarter of the year and has promised to spend $250 million on ads supporting Biden.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nOne notable donor to Biden's effort was David Ellison, the CEO of Skydance Media, who gave the maximum of $929,600 to the Biden Victory Fund in the first quarter. David Ellison is the son of Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, who has backed Trump in previous cycles and donated millions of dollars in the 2024 cycle to committees that were supporting South Carolina GOP Sen. Tim Scott when he ran unsuccessfully for the GOP nomination.\nAdvertisement\nBy comparison, the Trump campaign and the RNC said they raised $65.6 million in March and ended the month with about $93 million in cash. Trump is raising money jointly with the Republican National Committee after his contested primary race for the GOP nomination, and has immersed himself in the effort to close the gap with Democrats in recent months. Trump's new joint fundraising committee with the RNC, Trump 47 Committee, brought in $23.6 million, and nearly all of it in the month of March.\nPrior to a Palm Beach fundraiser this month that the Republican National Committee said raised more than $50.5 million, Trump held frequent calls with donors and kept close tabs on which donors had written a check for the maximum of more than $800,000. The money from those checks is divided among Trump's campaign, Save America, the RNC and more than three dozen state party committees.\nTrump's fundraising efforts appear to be paying off. The Trump 47 committee collected checks totaling more than $800,000 from Robert Mercer, the billionaire hedge fund magnate; Linda McMahon, the former professional wrestling executive who served as Trump's head of the Small Business Association; Casino mogul Phil Ruffin; Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, and his wife Suzanne; and Joe Ricketts, who is the founder of TD Ameritrade.\nThe Trump 47 committee collected checks totaling more than $800,000 from Robert Mercer, the billionaire hedge fund magnate; Linda McMahon, the former professional wrestling executive who served as Trump's head of the Small Business Association; Casino mogul Phil Ruffin; Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, and his wife Suzanne; and Joe Ricketts, who is the founder of TD Ameritrade.\nSenate GOP self-funded candidates spend big\nThough some Democratic incumbents posted an impressive total in hotly contested Senate races, Republicans have fielded several wealthy candidates who can fund their own campaigns including Tim Sheehy in Montana and Eric Hovde in Wisconsin, both of whom are backed by Trump.\nAdvertisement\nHovde, a banking executive who is challenging Baldwin, reported Monday that he had raised $9 million in the first quarter of this year — including $8 million that he loaned to himself. At the end of March, he reported $5.35 million in cash to Baldwin's more than $10 million. Baldwin raised $5.4 million over the first three months of the year and spent $3.1 million.\nTim Sheehy, the former Navy SEAL challenging Tester in Montana, loaned another $500,000 to his Senate campaign — bringing the total that he has loaned to his campaign to $1.45 million so far this cycle. The Republican candidate, who owns an aerial firefighting business, has been at the center of controversy in the Montana race after The Washington Post detailed the inconsistent accounts he has given over the years about his war wounds.\nSheehy reported $1.9 million in cash on hand at the end of the third quarter after raising $3 million and spending about $2.4 million. The Montanans for Tester reported raising $8 million during the quarter; spending $6.4 million and ending the three month period with about $12.6 million in cash on hand.\nMegadonors make a play in key Senate races\nKen Griffin, one of the biggest donors to the Republican Party who ultimately put money behind the super PAC supporting Nikki Haley in her battle against Trump, is turning his attention to Senate and House races.\nAdvertisement\nGriffin donated $10 million to newly formed super PAC, Maryland's Future, at a moment when former governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, is making a play for the Senate seat in a blue state.\nHogan upended the race when he made a surprise entrance earlier this year, and a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released in March showed him leading his Democratic rivals by double-digits. Several Democrats — including Rep. David Trone (D-Md.) and Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks — (D) are facing off in the May 14 primary for the seat that is being vacated by retiring Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.). Trone loaned his campaign another $18.5 million in the first quarter and reported less than a $1 million in cash. Monday's reports show that Trone has now loaned more than $41.7 million to his campaign.",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — House congressional leaders were toiling Thursday on a delicate, bipartisan push toward weekend votes to approve a $95 billion package of foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, as well as several other national security policies at a critical moment at home and abroad.\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson this week set in motion a plan to advance the package, which has been held up since October by GOP lawmakers resistant to approving more funding for Ukraine's fight against Russia. As the Republican speaker faced an outright rebellion from his right flank and growing threats for his ouster, it became clear that House Democrat Leader Hakeem Jeffries would have to lend help to Johnson every step of the way.\n'This is a very important message we are going to send to the world this week, and I'm anxious to get it done,' Johnson said earlier Wednesday announcing his strategy.\nAdvertisement\nThe growing momentum for a bipartisanship dynamic, a rarity in the deeply divided Congress, brought rare scenes of Republicans and Democrats working together to assert U.S. standing on the global stage and help American allies. But it also sent Johnson's House Republican majority into fresh rounds of chaos.\nJohnson's Republican leadership team, seizing on the opportunity to outflank hardline conservatives with Democratic support, raised the idea of quickly changing the procedural rules to make it harder to oust the speaker from office.\nThe idea being floated would be to tuck a rules change into the emerging national security package that would raise the threshold on the so-called 'motion to vacate' vote that right now can be called by any single lawmaker to remove the speaker.\nUltra-conservatives reacted with fury, angrily confronting Johnson on the House floor in a tense scene.\nAdvertisement\n'If he wants to change the motion to vacate, he needs to come before Republican conference that elected him and tell us of his intentions,' said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a top ally of Donald Trump, who is leading the campaign to oust him.\nGreene said if Johnson goes through with his plan, 'he's going to prove exactly what I've been saying is correct: He is the Democrat speaker.'\nFollowing the exchange with Johnson on the House floor, Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican who instigated the ouster of Rep. Kevin McCarthy as speaker last year but has so far refrained from joining Greene's effort, said it was pushing him towards also wanting Johnson out as speaker.\n'It's my red line now,' added Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Colorado Republican. 'I told him there's nothing that will get you to a motion to vacate faster than changing the threshold.'\nAdvertisement\nAt the same time, one floor above the turmoil in the House chamber a rare image of bipartisan statesmanship was on display as the procedural Rules committee began debate launching the steps needed to push the foreign aid package forward toward weekend voting.\nThe Republican chairmen of the powerful Appropriations and Foreign Affairs committees alongside their top Democratic counterparts spoke in evocative language, some drawing on World War II history, to make the case for ensuring the U.S. stand with its allies against aggressors.\nChairman Michael McCaul of the Foreign Affairs Committee cast this as a 'pivotal' time in world history, comparing the current images of people fleeing the conflict in Europe to the situation in 1939 as Hitler's Germany rose to power.\n'Time is not on our side,' he told the panel.\nAdvertisement\nThe top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Greg Meeks of New York, followed through on McCaul's urgency: 'The camera of history is rolling.'\nJohnson is trying to advance a complex plan to hold individual votes this weekend on the funds for Ukraine, Israel and allies in the Asia-Pacific, then stitch the package back together.\nThe package would also include legislation that allows the U.S. to seize frozen Russian central bank assets to rebuild Ukraine; impose sanctions on Iran, Russia, China and criminal organizations that traffic fentanyl; and potentially ban the video app TikTok if its China-based owner doesn't sell its stake within a year.\nWhile Johnson is trying to remain close to Trump, and positioning the national security package as a way to assert U.S. strength in the world in the mold of Ronald Reagan-era Republicans, that puts the speaker politically at odds with the anti-interventionists powering the former president's bid to return to the White House.\nAdvertisement\nEarlier, behind closed doors, Democratic leaders huddled with their caucus to discuss the foreign aid package and the extent to which they would help advance it through the procedural maneuvers in the Rules committee to bring it to the floor.\nDemocratic Whip Rep. Katherine Clark told reporters after the meeting that Democrats were 'open to helping.'\n'This is a moment in history where we need to ensure that at long last we are bringing this critical aid to Ukraine to the floor,' she said.\nRarely, if ever, does the minority party help the majority through the procedural hoops, particularly at the House Rules committee or during the various floor votes before final passage. It would be a level of bipartisanship unseen in this Congress, even as Republican leaders watched their own priority bills defeated on procedural votes by their own members.\nAdvertisement\nBut given the high stakes of the moment for Ukraine, Israel and other allies, and the inability of Johnson to marshal enough Republican support, the speaker will have no other choice if he intends to see the national security package to passage.\nYet Democrats were also trying to apply maximum leverage as Johnson's job comes under threat.\nPrivately, Clark advised rank and file lawmakers not to divulge their positions on whether they would vote to help defeat a motion to vacate Johnson as speaker, though a handful of Democrats have already publicly said they would likely do so.\n'Do not box yourself in with a public statement,' Clark told them according to a person familiar with the remarks.",

            "excerpt": "The House's ludicrous impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas died a swift death in the Senate.",
            "summary": "MAGA House Republicans would rather do anything but their jobs. They would rather indulge right-wing media consumers with baseless impeachments, motions to vacate the speaker's chair (again!), fruitless hearings and parroting Russian propaganda. None of these activities serves the interests of the voters; none improves U.S. national security. For these minions of Donald Trump, chaos and paralysis appear to be the goal. Fortunately for the country, Democrats have figured out how to short-circuit the antics and humiliate Republicans.\nMy Post colleague Aaron Blake described the Republicans' impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for his handling of the U.S.-Mexico border as 'troubled from the start — in ways that sharply undercut the claim that Democrats are derelict in shrugging off an impeachment trial.' Additionally, Blake wrote, many Republicans admitted that 'Mayorkas's actions weren't impeachable' and that 'the party wound up lacking complete unity in both chambers in historic ways.'\nProblems started in the House. The Republicans' star legal witness and an even smattering of House and Senate Republicans conceded that there was no constitutional basis for impeaching Mayorkas. Jonathan Turley, a frequent Trump legal defender, readily acknowledged, 'I don't think they have established any of those bases for impeachment. ... The fact is, impeachment is not for being a bad Cabinet member or even a bad person. It is a very narrow standard.' Republicans never remotely reached the constitutional standard of 'high crimes and misdemeanors.'\nAdvertisement\nIn February, not long before announcing his retirement, Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal that 'incompetence doesn't rise to the level of high crimes or misdemeanors.' He added that 'if we are to make underenforcement of the law, even egregious underenforcement, impeachable, almost every cabinet secretary would be subject to impeachment.' When the impeachment vote came, Gallagher's irrefutable reasoning drew only two other Republican 'no' votes.\nIn the Senate on Wednesday, few expected the impeachment to go anywhere. Several Republicans openly disparaged the effort. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) affirmed there was no constitutional basis for Mayorkas's impeachment, yet voted against dismissing the unconstitutional measure for fear of creating a bad precedent(!). Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) voted 'present' on one of the two groundless articles:\nOn a point of order that the Article I charges were unconstitutional because they do not rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors, I voted present. I did so because the allegations outlined in Article I — that Secretary Mayorkas, by executing the policies of the Biden administration, committed high crimes that rose to the level of impeachable offenses, needed real debate and deliberation. We were not afforded the opportunity to debate the constitutionalities of the charges in Article I, so I was not in good conscience able to vote in the affirmative or against.\nShe most certainly could have determined the charge did not meet the standard of 'high crimes and misdemeanors,' but a solid display of independence on an impeachment vote was, perhaps, too much to ask.\nAdvertisement\nIn any event, Democrats — including moderates such as Sens. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) and Jon Tester (Mont.) — were in no mood to indulge Republicans. Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) understood that conducting a full-blown trial would give undeserved credence to the House's stunt. 'The charges brought against Secretary Mayorkas fail to meet the high standard of high crimes and misdemeanors,' he said. 'To validate this gross abuse by the House would be a grave mistake and could set a dangerous precedent for the future.'\nFollow this author Jennifer Rubin 's opinions\nFollow this author\nJennifer Rubin\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nIn dismissing the articles of impeachment with a party-line vote, Senate Democrats ignored crocodile tears from the likes of Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) — who voted against the most meritorious impeachment in history following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot — that dismissing an impeachment before trial would create a bad precedent (unlike letting an insurrectionist off the hook?). Schumer deserves credit for nipping in the bud the GOP-controlled House's abuse of power.\nWhen Republicans blatantly lie, disregard their oaths and — to borrow a phrase — weaponize government, Democrats have an obligation to call them out. That entails refusing to take Republican antics seriously. When hearings and investigations obviously lack good faith, the Democrats can uphold the stature of Congress by simply walking away and refusing to play these games.\nAdvertisement\nFor good measure last week, the incomparable Rep. Jamie Raskin (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, took a verbal sledgehammer to Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.), derided even by his own side for utterly failing to come up with anything remotely incriminating in his strictly partisan impeachment inquiry into President Biden:\nHere's that full exchange between Reps. Jamie Raskin and James Comer on Wednesday 👀 pic.twitter.com/Qtl9A7aILn\n— The Recount (@therecount) April 18, 2024\nThe inquiry has been repeatedly and thoroughly discredited. Even now, Comer cannot figure out what 'crime' he is investigating. And further still, Comer cannot admit failure.\nRaskin's tongue-lashing does more than provide emotional satisfaction to Democrats fed up with reckless Republican antics (although no one should dismiss the value of an occasional dollop of Schadenfreude). In a media environment in which Comer's farce is, in some corners, treated as though it were a legitimate oversight hearing, Democrats must go out of their way to draw bright lines.\nAdvertisement\nDemocratic partisans often find fault with their politicians for being 'too nice' or 'lacking a killer instinct.' Whatever the merits of their past complaints (e.g., leaving the filibuster in place), they should acknowledge that Democratic lawmakers — especially those in the minority of a chaotic, feckless House — have learned a thing or two over the past couple of years.",

            "excerpt": "Polls show both Democrats and Republicans are concerned about the state of democracy — but for very different reasons.",
            "summary": "Take a look at polling data and you might get the impression that there is a glorious, bipartisan consensus that our democracy is in trouble and needs nurturing. In reality, there are profoundly dissonant chords in the democracy chorus.\nStart with the seemingly good news: A New York Times/Sienna poll from fall 2022, for example, found that 71 percent of Americans agreed that 'democracy is currently under threat.' There was hardly a wisp of difference across party lines: 74 percent of Democrats agreed, but so did 72 percent of Republicans and 71 percent of independents. Kumbaya, my lord!\nSuch data has encouraged conservatives to dismiss the effort of Democrats, starting with President Biden, to insist that in the 2024 election, 'democracy is on the ballot.' The Wall Street Journal's Holman W. Jenkins Jr., for instance, recently referenced a February NBC News poll showing Biden and Donald Trump essentially tied on the issue of who would best protect democracy — 43 percent of voters preferred Biden, 41 percent picked the former president. He concluded, 'pollsters find Trump voters every bit as concerned about democracy as Biden voters.'\nAdvertisement\nIf only that were true. In reality, only on one side of politics is democracy a voting issue, and the other would render our system less democratic by making it harder for voters to cast ballots.\nThat Times/Sienna poll was instructive here. It asked voters what concerned them more about elections: 'that some people will cast votes illegally' or that 'some eligible voters won't have a fair chance to vote.'\nThe country split right down the middle: 46 percent worried about illegal voting, 48 percent about voter suppression. That's because partisans were entirely at odds: 82 percent of Republicans were more concerned about voters casting illegal ballots while 76 percent of Democrats were more concerned about voters not getting a fair chance to vote.\nThis divide has led to radically different voting policies, state by state, depending on which party holds sway. The Post's Patrick Marley reported that in Michigan, controlled by Democrats, voting will be easier in 2024 than it was in 2020, whereas North Carolina, where Republicans hold a veto-proof legislative majority, has erected new barriers to the ballot box.\nAdvertisement\nAnd during his recent pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago to earn kudos from Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) pitched a federal bill to require proof of citizenship from those who would register to vote. Since Trump believes that any election he loses must have been rigged, Johnson's effort must have warmed the former president's heart.\nFollow this author E.J. Dionne Jr. 's opinions\nFollow this author\nE.J. Dionne Jr.\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nThis is not some honest disagreement about whether voting should be easier or harder. New barriers to voting and voter purges are being rationalized to solve problems that don't exist because there is no evidence — zip — that fraud is a problem in our system.\nNoncitizen voting in federal and state elections is already illegal everywhere, and studies by the Brennan Center for Justice concluded that 'votes by non-citizens account for between 0.0003 percent and 0.001 percent of all votes cast.' A separate Brennan Center report estimated incident rates for overall voter fraud between 0.0003 percent and 0.0025 percent.\nAdvertisement\nWhen someone offers policy changes based on claims devoid of any factual support, it's fair to suspect that something other than solving a real problem is motivating their proposals. On this, the Times/Sienna poll provided an important clue: It found that while 95 percent of Democrats said Biden was the 'legitimate winner' in 2020, only 31 percent of Republicans said this. Their objection is to the outcome, not the process.\nBear in mind that the voting changes introduced to make it easier to vote during the pandemic — simpler early and mail voting, widely available ballot drop boxes and the like — produced by far the largest numerical turnout in our history. Holding a successful election in a health crisis was a great victory for democracy and, by the way, the emergency reforms helped Trump get 11.2 million more votes in 2020 than he got in 2016. Yet Republicans seem eager to roll back participation.\nThe acid test of whether both sides are equally concerned about an issue is the degree to which it motivates their respective electoral coalitions. And here, the data is unambiguous: Democracy is a core concern for Democrats in a way it is not for Republicans. It's not even close.\nAdvertisement\nIn a March Quinnipiac poll, voters who listed preserving democracy as the most urgent issue facing the country favored Biden over Trump in a head-to-head matchup by 85 percent to 12 percent. That's because 32 percent of Democrats listed preserving democracy as the campaign's most important issue; only 5 percent of Republicans did.\nIn his book 'Democracy and Its Critics,' the legendary political scientist Robert A. Dahl argued that democracy was inspired by 'the vision of people governing themselves as political equals, and possessing all the resources and institutions necessary to do so.' Tearing down barriers to participation is more consistent with this goal than erecting them.",

T.J. Shope and Shawnna Bolick sided with 14 Democrats in the Senate on Wednesday in changing rules to let a repeal proposal advance after the deadline for hearing bills had passed. Proponents say the Senate could vote on the repeal as early as May 1.\nIf the proposed repeal wins final approval from the Republican-controlled Legislature and is signed into law by Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, the 2022 statute banning the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy would become the prevailing abortion law.\nAdvertisement\nThe move by the Senate came after Republicans in the Arizona House, for the second time in a week, blocked attempts on Wednesday to bring a repeal bill to a vote. One Republican joined 29 Democrats in the Arizona House to bring the repeal measure to a vote Wednesday, but the effort failed twice on 30-30 votes.\nThe state's near-total ban, which predates Arizona's statehood, permits abortions only for saving the woman's life and provides no exceptions for rape or incest. It carries a sentence of two to five years in prison for doctors or anyone else who assists in an abortion.\nLast week, the Arizona Supreme Court drastically altered the legal landscape for terminating pregnancies in the state, concluding the 1864 law can be enforced and suggesting doctors can be prosecuted under the statute.\nThe debate in the House over whether to allow a vote on the repeal proposal was much fierier than in the Senate. Members from pro-life groups packed the House's gallery and gave a standing ovation after efforts to bring the repeal bill to a vote was defeated.\nAdvertisement\nHouse Speaker Ben Toma said those wanting to repeal the law were demanding action too soon, noting the court decision to revive the law came only a week ago. He said the only way he would bring the repeal bill to a vote would be if his fellow Republicans wanted it.\n'We have deeply held beliefs,' Toma said. 'And I would ask everyone in this chamber to respect the fact that someone wants to believe that abortion is in fact the murder of children.'\nDemocratic Rep. Alma Hernandez of Tucson said Republicans are failing to act on a matter of great importance to Arizonans. 'This is what we are arguing about right now: whether or not we should overturn something that is archaic, something that is going to really impact women in Arizona,' Hernandez said. 'And yet we want to talk about a process or the right process.'\nAdvertisement\nRep. Matt Gress, the Phoenix Republican who joined with Democrats in trying to bring the repeal measure to a vote, said the 160-year-old law doesn't reflect the values of most people living in the state.\n'We need to get that taken care of and get it taken care of as soon as possible,' Gress said. 'I think the eyes of the nation are on Arizona.'\nIn a statement, Hobbs, who supports a repeal of the law, said, 'Republican extremists in the House have yet again failed to do the right thing. In just one week living under this new reality, women, doctors, and healthcare providers have already begun to feel the devastating effects of living under a total abortion ban. We cannot go on like this.'\nThe Center for Arizona Policy, a longtime backer of anti-abortion proposals before the Legislature, released a statement saying, 'Today was a victory for life, even if only temporarily. Most pro-life lawmakers kept their promise today to protect the unborn and their mothers and not repeal Arizona's pre-Roe law.'\nAdvertisement\nThe Civil War era law had been blocked since the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision guaranteed the constitutional right to an abortion nationwide.\nAfter Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022, then-Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, persuaded a state judge to lift an injunction that blocked enforcement of the 1864 ban. Brnovich's Democratic successor, Attorney General Kris Mayes, urged the state's high court to hold the line against it.",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — With rare bipartisan momentum, the House sidelined hard-right conservatives and prepared Friday to push a $95 billion national security aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies over a key procedural hurdle, closer to passage.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson had spent the past 24 hours making the rounds on conservative media working to salvage the wartime funding, particularly for Ukraine as it faces a critical moment battling Russia, but also for his own job as the restless right flank threatens to oust him over the effort.\n'There's a lot of misinformation about what we're doing here and why,' Johnson told the conservative host of The Mark Levin Show.\n'Ukrainians desperately need lethal aid right now. ... We cannot allow Vladimir Putin to roll through another country and take it,' he said about the Russian president's invasion of Ukraine. 'These are very serious matters with global implications.'\nAdvertisement\nAfter months of delay, the House worked slowly but deliberately once Johnson made up his mind this week to plough ahead. President Joe Biden sent a swift endorsement of the speaker's plan and, in a rare moment, Donald Trump, the Republican presumed presidential nominee who opposes most overseas aid for Ukraine, has not derailed the speaker's work.\n'The world is watching what the Congress does,' the White House said in a statement. 'Passing this legislation would send a powerful message about the strength of American leadership at a pivotal moment.'\nIn an extremely rare step, the members of the House Rules Committee joined forces late Thursday in a near midnight vote, the four Democrats giving their support on a procedural step, to push past the Republican majority's three hardline holdouts to send the package to the House floor for debate on a 9-3 vote. It was a moment unseen in recent House memory.\nAdvertisement\nJohnson will need to rely on Democrats again Friday to clear the next procedural vote and turn back amendments Republicans have offered that could kill the package. One from hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene would reduce spending for Ukraine to zero.\nGreene has filed the 'motion to vacate' the speaker from office, and has drawn at least one other Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky as a co-sponsor. It could launch a bid to evict Johnson from the speaker's office, should she call it up for a vote, much the way Republicans booted Kevin McCarthy from the position last fall.\nWith one of the most narrow House majorities in modern times, Johnson can only afford to lose a single vote or two from his Republican ranks to pass any bill. That dynamic has thrust him into the arms of Democrats as he searches for votes to pass the package.\nAdvertisement\nWithout his Republican majority fully behind him, Johnson cannot shape the package as the ultra-conservatives demand lest he lose Democratic backing. It has forced him to leave behind tough security measures to clamp down on migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border and other priorities.\nAt best, Johnson has been able to carve up a Senate-passed version of the bill into separate parts, as is the preference among House Republicans, and the final votes will be on distinct measures — for Ukraine, Israel and Indo-Pacific allies.\nThe package would also include a fourth provision that includes many Republican priorities that Democrats endorse, or at least are willing to accept. Those include proposals that allow the U.S. to seize frozen Russian central bank assets to rebuild Ukraine; impose sanctions on Iran, Russia, China and criminal organizations that traffic fentanyl, and potentially ban the video app TikTok if its China-based owner doesn't sell its stake within a year.\nAdvertisement\nPassing each bill, in votes expected Saturday, will require Johnson to form complicated bipartisan coalitions on each, with Democrats for example ensuring Ukraine aid is approved, but some left-leaning progressives refusing to back military aid for Israel over the destruction of Gaza.",

            "excerpt": "Two new high-quality polls show Robert F. Kennedy Jr. taking more votes from Trump than Biden. And they're not the only polls to suggest a changing dynamic.",
            "summary": "It's been something approaching an article of faith on the left and in some corners of the media that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. poses a spoiler threat to President Biden's reelection.\nIt's never been quite clear that'll be the case, though, particularly given that Kennedy is much more popular among Republicans than Democrats.\nAnd now, there are growing signs that Kennedy and his fellow third-party candidates might not cost Biden after all. Indeed, they — and particularly Kennedy — could actually pull more from Trump.\nTwo new high-quality polls since Sunday bear this out.\nThe latest is from Marist College on Monday. It shows Biden at 51 percent and Trump at 48 percent in a national head-to-head contest. But when you factor in third-party candidates — Kennedy, Green Party candidate Jill Stein and independent Cornel West — Biden's lead goes to five percentage points, larger than the poll's 3.6-point margin of error.\nAdvertisement\nMarist has long been one of Biden's better polls. But that's his best showing in a high-quality poll for many months.\nAn NBC News poll Sunday showed a similar dynamic. While Biden trailed by two points head to head (44-46), he led by two points (39-37) when the question included the third-party candidates.\nBoth NBC results are within the margin of error, but the key here is the four-point shift toward Biden when you include third-party candidates. That's something we really haven't seen before.\nAnd a big reason for the shift is Kennedy. He takes twice as much of his support from voters who had previously picked Trump in the head-to-head question (15 percent of those voters) than those who had picked Biden (7 percent). Biden cedes more votes than Trump to Stein, but Kennedy is a larger factor given that he's been pulling more votes throughout the race.\nAdvertisement\n(That poll is also merely the latest to show Kennedy's image among right-leaning voters is vastly superior to his image among left-leaning ones. While Republicans like him 40 percent to 15 percent — a plus-25 split — Democrats dislike him 53-16 — a negative-37 split.)\ndislike him 53-16 — a negative-37 split.)\nThe Marist poll shows Kennedy pulling only slightly more from actual Republicans (10 percent) than Democrats (8 percent). But it suggests he's pulling more from Trump-leaning independents.\nWhile Biden and Trump are tied at 49 percent among independents in the head-to-head, Biden leads 34-30 among independents when you include third-party candidates.\nAs in the NBC poll, Kennedy pulls more from Trump head-to-head voters (17 percent) than Biden voters (11 percent).\nWhile these are perhaps the most compelling recent polls to suggest Kennedy and the broader third-party impact aren't hurting and could even help Biden, they're not the only ones:\nAdvertisement\nAll of it paints a picture of a dynamic situation with the third-party candidates.\nBiden has probably suffered more among them in the past because Democrats are less enthusiastic about his candidacy than Republicans are about Trump's. In addition, both Stein and West are clearly to Biden's political left, and Kennedy at the very least has a name that could resonate with more casual left-leaning independents.\nBut what generally happens as a general election proceeds is that voters gravitate toward the two major-party candidates because they actually have a shot at winning, and third-party candidates fade.\nPerhaps what we're starting to see is voters who don't like Trump migrating from flirting with third-party candidates to going for Biden. Perhaps Kennedy's far superior image among right-leaning voters or his tendency toward Republican-friendly conspiracy theories is starting to register. Or — though it's early to say this with any certainty — perhaps Trump's personal problems surrounding his first criminal trial are starting to have more of an effect.\nAdvertisement\nIt's a battle that is far from over, particularly given that both sides are likely to spend the next six-plus months trying to attach Kennedy to the other side's politics. Biden appeared last week with members of the Kennedy family who have distanced themselves from their relative's campaign. And at least some Republicans are starting to worry about the Kennedy impact and fight back, attacking the candidate they once boosted when Kennedy was challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination.",

He takes over for Mark Jefferson, who left in February to serve as executive director of the Tavern League of Wisconsin.\nIverson, a graduate of Wisconsin Lutheran College, most recently worked as regional political director for the Republican National Committee. He previously worked on campaigns in Wisconsin for U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil. In 2020, Iverson was the state director for Trump Victory, a joint operation of the Trump campaign and the RNC.\nAdvertisement\nIt was in that role following Trump's narrow loss in Wisconsin in 2020 that Iverson told other operatives two days after the election to support claims that Trump had actually won. His comments came as Trump's campaign was suing in other battleground states and preparing to request a recount of the two largest Democratic counties in Wisconsin.\nBiden defeated Trump by nearly 21,000 votes in Wisconsin in 2020, a result that has withstood independent and partisan audits and reviews, as well as lawsuits and the recounts Trump requested.\n'Here's the drill: Comms is going to continue to fan the flame and get the word out about Democrats trying to steal this election. We'll do whatever they need (inaudible) help with. Just be on standby in case there's any stunts we need to pull,' Iverson said in the recording of a meeting two days after the November election that was obtained by The Associated Press.\nAdvertisement\nWisconsin was a big part of Trump's victory in 2016, when he smashed through the Democrats' 'Blue Wall' in the Upper Midwest, and his campaign fought hard to keep the swing state in his column four years later before his loss to Biden. Wisconsin is one of a few battleground states this year that could go either way in the rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'At the end of the day, this operation received more votes than any other Republican in Wisconsin history,' Iverson said in the 2020 recording. 'Say what you want, our operation turned out Republican or DJT supporters. Democrats just got 20,000 more than us, out of Dane County and other shenanigans in Milwaukee, Green Bay and Dane. There's a lot that people can learn from this campaign.'\nIverson's comments came after Trump sued in other states and before be brought a case in Wisconsin seeking to overturn his loss. The Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected that case in December 2020.\nAdvertisement\nWisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming said in a statement that he was 'thrilled' with the hiring of Iverson.\n'His wide breadth of experience and ability will prove crucial for us winning in November,' Schimming said in a statement. 'Wisconsin will decide the 2024 race. Andrew Iverson is the right man for the job in this pivotal election.'\nIn addition to the presidential race, Wisconsin has a high-profile U.S. Senate race pitting Democratic incumbent Sen. Tammy Baldwin against Republican businessman Eric Hovde.",

            "excerpt": "Mark Houck's campaign to unseat Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in Pennsylvania's GOP primary could offer hints about swing-district party sentiment in a heated presidential election year",
            "summary": "NEW HOPE, Pa. — Mark Houck makes a potent appeal to conservative Republicans in this corner of eastern Pennsylvania when he describes his arrest and subsequent acquittal on federal charges that he pushed a Planned Parenthood volunteer outside a Philadelphia abortion clinic.\nThe account has become a staple of Houck's first-time bid for the U.S. House in suburban Philadelphia, a central battleground of the 2024 election, from the presidency on down.\n'I'm telling you this because this is how I became a target of the federal government — the weaponization of the government,' he said at a meeting last week of the New Hope Solebury Republican Club.\nHouck's campaign to unseat fourth-term Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in Tuesday's primary could offer hints about swing-district Republican sentiment in one of the most volatile White House races in years.\nAdvertisement\nWith few truly competitive House seats in play, the 1st Congressional District that Fitzpatrick represents is one of 16 districts nationwide that Democrat Joe Biden carried in the 2020 presidential election where voters also sent Republicans to Washington. By comparison, five seats won that year by Donald Trump, then the incumbent and now his party's presumptive 2024 nominee, are now held occupied by a Democrat.\nThe Republicans' House majority is so slim that Democrats need to flip just four seats in November to retake control. That makes the 'Biden 16' a significant group of competitive seats and they could go a long way in determining whether the next president has a friendly or hostile House next year.\nFifteen of those seats are in states that Biden won in 2020. The exception is Nebraska's 2nd District, represented by GOP Rep. Don Bacon. There are five seats in California, four in New York, two in Arizona and one apiece in New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia.\nAdvertisement\nSeveral of the 'Biden 16' are like Fitzgerald, winning year after year by tightrope-walking between challengers in primaries and general elections. Nine of them won a first term in in 2022, when Republicans took control of the House for the first time in four years.\nIn the fall, many will face the same Democrat they beat last time, sometimes narrowly.\nThe Fitzpatrick-Houck winner will face Democrat Ashley Ehasz, a former Army helicopter pilot who is uncontested in her primary. Fitzpatrick, a former FBI supervisory agent who beat Ehasz by 10 percentage points in 2022, is outraising Houck and Ehasz by millions of dollars, combined.\nBefore November, several others among the 'Biden 16' must beat back primary challenges from the conservative wing of the GOP.\nIn Nebraska, Bacon is facing perhaps his strongest primary test yet. If he wins, he will take on the same Democratic opponent, state Sen. Tony Vargas, whom he defeated two years ago by fewer than 3 percentage points.\nAdvertisement\nBacon has been a vocal supporter of sending more military aid to Ukraine, something opposed by his primary opponent, second-time congressional candidate Dan Frei.\nFrei, who contends the GOP base is fed up with Bacon, accuses the incumbent of flouting campaign promises by voting to increase spending and for bills that do nothing to stem the flow of immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.\nNearly all of the 16 races are considered toss-ups.\nRepublicans intend to hammer home a message about lax border security and high inflation under Biden. Democrats are warning that Republicans will pursue a national abortion ban as Democrats invoke an issue that has consistently worked in their favor at the ballot box since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022.\nAdvertisement\nNorth Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, chair of the House Republicans' campaign arm, said the 'Biden 16' have formed strong identities in their districts and are emphasizing local issues.\nHudson said Biden's unpopularity and presidential turnout models are increasingly giving an edge to Republicans, with the GOP attracting more working-class voters who more likely to vote in presidential elections and help flip these districts to Trump.\n'The presidential turnout dynamics actually favor Republicans,' Hudson said in an interview. 'And then if you look, state by state, where our battlegrounds are, the presidential turnout is going to help us.'\nWashington Rep. Suzan DelBene, who leads the House Democrats' campaign arm, said Democrats will highlight what they say is the chaos at the highest levels of government when Republicans are charge of the House and Trump is in the White House. They will say Trump is a threat to democracy and Republicans are extremists and hypocrites who voted against major spending bills under Biden and then tried to take credit for the projects that landed in their districts.\nAdvertisement\nVoters 'want folks who are there to govern,' DelBene said in an interview. 'They're not looking for extremism. And so all we have to do is make sure that voters are aware of what they're doing. ... Holding them accountable for their actual votes, even though their rhetoric sometimes tries to be more moderate.'\nIn Pennsylvania, Houck's bid to unseat Fitzpatrick, who is backed by some labor unions and business groups, has a visceral feel that some Republicans say resonates with them.\nAt the Solebury Republicans' meeting on the grounds of a luxury hotel and wedding venue, Houck unwound the story of his arrest, describing federal agents with guns drawn as they descended on his Bucks County home in 2022.\nThey arrested him, in connection with the incident outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Philadelphia. Houck defended his actions, saying he acted to protect his 12-year-old son from abusive comments made by the clinic volunteer. The trial ended in an acquittal in 2023, and Houck, who runs a Catholic ministry group, said he began fielding requests to run for office.\nAdvertisement\nHouck's story struck a chord with Rose Cipriano, who came to hear him speak. Her husband picked up a Houck yard sign and Cipriano, who had previously supported Fitzpatrick, said Houck has changed her mind in the approaching primary.\n'I'm looking for fresh ideas, and I'm willing to take a chance and vote for him on Tuesday,' Cipriano said 'I've known his story since it happened, and I support him.'\nHouck's campaign echoes Trump's own defense against the criminal cases against him. It centers on the slogan 'Faith Family Freedom' while Houck talks about defunding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the federal departments of Agriculture, Education and Justice, calling them all unconstitutional.\nHouck has raised more campaign cash than any previous Fitzpatrick primary challenger. But he is well behind Fitzpatrick's fundraising and name recognition in a county where his brother previously held the congressional seat.\nAdvertisement\nFitzpatrick has the support of the county party and the backing of police and fire unions, whose large campaign signs endorsing him crop up every two years.\nBob Brooks, president of the Pennsylvania Professional Firefighters Association, said Fitzpatrick represents blue-collar workers like his union members.\n'And, if there was more blue-collar legislators, I think they would find more support from firefighters,' Brooks said in an interview. 'We support those who support us, and Brian has supported us on many levels.'\nRepublicans at the Solebury meeting encouraged Houck to stay involved in party politics.\nHouck said he will back Fitzpatrick in the general election if Fitzpatrick wins the primary but won't campaign for him, put off by what he said was Fitzpatrick failure to check on Houck's family after his arrest. Fitzpatrick didn't respond to interview requests.\nCipriano said she is disappointed in Fitzpatrick but said the stakes are too high for the party to be divided in November. She pledged to support Fitzpatrick should he win the primary.\n'I am behind the Republican Party 100%,' she said. 'So whoever's running, from the top down, gets my support.'\n___",

Ruben Gallego , who's running for the seat that Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I) is relinquishing, raised $7.5 million and had $9.6 million on hand.

She's running for the seat that Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow is vacating. On the Republican side, former congressman Mike Rogers — who won Trump's endorsement last month and is the National Republican Senatorial Committee 's pick — raised nearly $1.1 million and had nearly $1.4 million on hand. Former Republican congressman Peter Meijer , raised about $315,000 — including $80,000 he loaned his campaign — and had about $244,000 on hand.\nMontana: Democratic Sen. Jon Tester raised $8 million and had nearly $12.7 million on hand. That's a lot — especially in Montana. Tim Sheehy , a Republican who has Trump's endorsement, raised $3.1 million — including $500,000 he loaned his campaign — and had $1.9 million on hand.\nNevada: Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen raised $5 million and had $13.2 million on hand. Sam Brown , the Army veteran whom the NRSC is backing, raised $2.4 million and had $2.3 million on hand. Jeff Gunter , Trump's former ambassador to Iceland, who is running against Brown in the Republican primary, raised nearly $2.9 million — $2.7 million of which he loaned his campaign — and had nearly $2.6 million on hand. Jim Marchant , a former state assemblyman, raised $49,000 and had $51,000 on hand.\nOhio: Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown raised $12.1 million and had nearly $16 million on hand. Bernie Moreno , who won the Republican primary last month, raised nearly $3.7 million — including $1.5 million he loaned his campaign — and had less than $1.8 million on hand after dispatching two primary rivals.\nPennsylvania: Democratic Sen. Bob Casey raised nearly $5.7 million and had $11.9 million on hand. Republican Dave McCormick , the former hedge fund executive running against Casey, raised nearly $5.4 million — including nearly $1 million he loaned his campaign — and had $6.2 million on hand. (Casey and McCormick's reports cover three more days than the others because of a filing deadline quirk.)\nWisconsin: Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin raised $5.4 million and had nearly $10.3 million on hand.

Most Republicans are expected to back it includes humanitarian aid for Gaza, which Democrats want.\nA rare coalition of Democrats and Republicans — 316 — voted overwhelmingly to pass the procedural measure, known as a rule, to advance the four-part legislation Friday morning. In a sign of how tenuous this move is for Republicans, more Democrats — 165 — voted for the rule than Republicans — 151.\nAdvertisement\nThis is a pivotal moment for Johnson who has held the speaker's gavel for nearly six months as he has had to navigate infighting among Republicans over disparate views on policy and tactics. But Relying on the support of Democrats could cost Johnson his job as speaker of the House as at least two Republicans — Reps.

Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a senior member of the party and chair of the Appropriations Committee, said, 'I'm so proud of members on both sides of the aisle'\nAdvertisement\nRules Ranking Member Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said he is pleased the series of bills will advance despite his 'deep, deep problems about the unconditioned aid to Israel.

Most of the money goes to U.S. weapons manufacturers to build back depleted U.S. weapons supply and about 20 percent of that goes directly to the country in the form of a loan. The president can cancel Ukraine's debt, however, after November 15, 2024.\nAdvertisement\nA second bill would provide about $17 billion in offensive and defensive weapons for Israel as well as just over $9 billion in humanitarian aid for Gaza and elsewhere.

He had received a tremendous amount of pressure from different factions of his conference — with the anti-Ukraine faction loudly and publicly threatening Johnson's job while the pro-Ukraine funding faction quietly lobbied him behind the scenes.\nUltimately, Johnson decided to advance funding to Ukraine, defending his decision Tuesday as 'the right thing' to do. But he wasn't able to muscle it through relying on just Republican votes with his slim majority, having to depend instead on a significant number of Democrats as 55 members of his conference didn't back Friday morning's procedural measure. More than three dozen Democrats defected, most of them the most liberal in the caucus.\nDemocrats stepped in. They didn't provide the votes Friday morning for the procedural vote until it became overwhelmingly clear Republicans could not pass the rule on their own. 'We won't let it fail,' one senior Democratic aide said.\nAdvertisement\nDemocrats have been signaling they would support Johnson but they withheld an outright announcement, wanting to ensure that they weren't going to be forced to take votes on overtly political amendments as well as ensure the bill was structured so that funding for Ukraine would actually pass.\nDemocrats first sin that they'd help Johnson came as the clock approached midnight Thursday. The four Democrats on the Rules Committee provided their votes, a rare bipartisan move in the partisan Rules Committee, to allow the legislation to advance to the House floor as three far-right Republicans, Massie, Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) and Chip Roy (R-Texas), bucked their party by voting against it. It was the first time Massie has opposed a rule in committee since he was put there by former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).\nUkraine funding has deeply divided a dysfunctional Republican Party and some Republicans are urging Johnson to be more forceful and seize control of the House and his party. Republicans from the conservative Main Street Caucus, one of the GOP's five ideological groups, urged Johnson to penalize members who block regular order and vote 'no' on rules, according to multiple Republicans.\nAdvertisement\nBut Johnson refused Thursday to raise the number of Republicans needed to threaten his job — known as a 'motion to vacate,' which for now can be brought by just one Republican.\nGreene told reporters Thursday that she would 'absolutely' move forward with her motion if Johnson attempts to raise the threshold required to oust him.\nIntraparty tensions are reaching a boiling point. A verbal altercation erupted on the House floor Thursday morning when Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.) got into a heated argument, aggressively daring members of the Freedom Caucus to introduce their measure to oust Johnson and calling Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) 'tubby,' according to a person who witnessed the argument. Gaetz responded by asking Van Orden if he has an IQ over 40, a Gaetz spokesperson said.",

            "excerpt": "The House has voted much needed aid for Ukraine and others. But can the U.S. be relied on beyond this?",
            "summary": "In a world full of instability and threats — autocracy, terrorism, cross-border aggression — the question confronting endangered countries is: Can we count on the United States? Should we? From Ukraine to Taiwan to Israel, governments have been asking. Indeed, the uncertainty extends well beyond those directly embattled countries to other traditional U.S. allies such as Japan, South Korea and Europe.\nThe reasons for this uncertainty are many, but all trace to one main source: a sense that the United States' own post-World War II bipartisan foreign policy consensus is fraying around the edges. That challenge was both exposed and accelerated by the rise of Donald Trump and a selfish, simplistic, 'America First' ideology in the Republican Party. Parallel to that, the progressive wing of the Democratic Party increasingly questions the U.S.-Israel relationship, as well as long-standing commitments to other Middle East partners such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\nFor now, U.S. allies can breathe easier, thanks in large part to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and his willingness — albeit much too belated — to resist far-right forces in his own party at the risk of his position. With his support and skillful management of the legislative process, large majorities of the House got an opportunity to work their will, which was to support $95 billion in aid to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and others in the Indo-Pacific. (Crucially, the package includes not only $17 billion to help Israel defeat Hamas and hold off Iran and its proxies, but also $9 billion in humanitarian aid, much of it destined to help Palestinian civilians.) President Biden can soon sign the legislation.\nAdvertisement\nThe Ukraine measure is by far the most important of the three, since the country faces the most immediate threat. It is low on ammunition and under relentless Russian military pressure that might lead to major losses or even defeat. The $60.8 billion worth of assistance will provide Ukraine with much-needed artillery shells and air-defense assets, without which it might not be able to withstand President Vladimir Putin's bid to subjugate a neighbor, likely followed by similar aggression against others.\nA core U.S. interest — Europe's security — is at risk. Though it's unconscionable that 112 of the 214 GOP representatives voting were 'nays' on the Ukraine aid (all 210 Democrats who voted were 'ayes'), the House's top Democrat, Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), was right to acknowledge that 'traditional conservatives, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, have risen to the occasion.' Mr. Jeffries, too, rose to the occasion by allowing Democrats to vote for a procedural rule that advanced the measures. He intimated that Democrats would help Mr. Johnson if he faced a far-right revolt over Ukraine. This deft hint at what would have been a remarkable bipartisan rescue of a GOP speaker seems to have helped ultimately defuse Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's (R-Ga.) threats to unseat Mr. Johnson.\nThis is a historic moment. A de facto bipartisan coalition government has maintained U.S. global credibility. Yet it feels more like an inflection point than a conclusion. The world, and the United States, are changing. It is changing so fast, in fact, that part of what happened over the weekend was a vote to force eventual Chinese divestment of TikTok or an outright ban. This cellphone app, which 150 million Americans, generally young people, use for information and entertainment, barely existed a decade ago. Now U.S. politicians from both parties regard it as a possible means for the People's Republic to exercise malign influence over U.S. public opinion.\nAdvertisement\nMore conflict over foreign policy priorities, both between and within the two parties, seems inevitable. Mr. Trump has suffered a setback but still controls the GOP. Progressive Democrats are far from done pressing their case against unconditional aid to Israel; 37 of them voted against helping Israel this time, in rare agreement with 21 right-wing Republicans, albeit for different reasons.\nFollow this author Editorial Board 's opinions\nFollow this author\nEditorial Board\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nU.S. alliances endure, but the stage is set for a recalibration of their terms. This is not necessarily a bad thing, if the result is to place these commitments on a more sustainable basis, politically and financially. U.S. allies in Europe and Asia can indeed contribute more to their own defense; Israel can take concerns about the war in Gaza's human costs more effectively into account.",

            "excerpt": "House Speaker Mike Johnson is leaving uncertain his plan for advancing wartime aid for Ukraine",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — House Speaker Mike Johnson left uncertain his plan for advancing aid for Israel and Ukraine on Monday, keeping the future of the funding in doubt as lawmakers returned to Washington for a crucial week of foreign policy work.\nIran's missile and drone strike against Israel over the weekend put renewed pressure on House Republicans to act on a national security package that would send military support to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. But after mulling for two months how to advance such a package through the political divides in the House, Johnson has revealed little of his strategy, including whether he will try to push the funding for Israel separately or keep it packaged with the aid for the other U.S. allies.\nAs the House has struggled to act, conflicts around the globe have escalated. Israel's military chief said Monday that Israel will respond to Iran's weekend missile strike. And Ukraine's military head over the weekend warned that the battlefield situation in the country's east has 'significantly worsened in recent days,' as warming weather has allowed Russian forces to launch a fresh offensive.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden, hosting Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala at the White House, called on the House to take up the funding package immediately. 'They have to do it now,' he said.\nSenior Republicans were also growing impatient after Johnson had offered them assurances that he would bring Ukraine aid to the floor. Many have expected him to make that move before the House takes a recess next week. But with no plan set, time was running short for Johnson, who is learning the job of speaker as he goes.\nThe speaker planned to huddle with his fellow House Republicans on Monday evening. But the meeting will be filled with lawmakers strongly opposed on Ukraine: Republican defense hawks, including the top lawmakers on national security committees, who want Johnson to finally take up the national security supplemental package as a bundle, are pitted against populist conservatives who are fiercely opposed to continued support for Kyiv's fight at all.\nAdvertisement\nAhead of the meeting on Monday, Johnson revealed little on his decision after saying over the weekend that he would bring Israel aid to the floor this week. Johnson has expressed support for aiding Ukraine, but ignored questions from reporters on Monday about whether he would bundle funding for the two nations together. The House was also preparing this week to take up a series of bills aimed at sanctioning Iran.\n'The House must rush to Israel's aid as quickly as humanly possible, and the only way to do that is passing the Senate's supplemental ASAP,' said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\nMeanwhile, the White House would 'oppose' a standalone bill that only addresses aid for Israel, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Monday. Democratic leaders are pressuring Johnson to take up a Senate-passed bill that would provide a total of $95 billion for the U.S. allies, as well as humanitarian support for civilians in Gaza and Ukraine.\nAdvertisement\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries pledged in a letter to lawmakers to do 'everything in our legislative power to confront aggression' around the globe, and he cast the situation as similar to the lead-up to World War II.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'The gravely serious events of this past weekend in the Middle East and Eastern Europe underscore the need for Congress to act immediately,' Jeffries said. 'We must take up the bipartisan and comprehensive national security bill passed by the Senate forthwith. This is a Churchill or Chamberlain moment.'\nDuring a private meeting last week, two senior Democrats, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker emerita, and Rep. Steny Hoyer, the former No. 2 leader, encouraged their Democratic colleagues to sign on to a discharge petition that could force the House to vote on the Senate aid package.\nAdvertisement\nPelosi and Hoyer told the Democratic lawmakers that even if they oppose the bill, they could still sign the discharge petition to at least push the package to the floor -- and then vote against it later. The leaders' message was confirmed by two people familiar with the private meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it.\nSo far, 195 lawmakers have signed on to the discharge petition, about a dozen shy of the majority needed to force action on the floor. Many of the progressive Democrats holding out from signing the petition are against U.S. aid to Israel due to the Netanyahu government's assault on Gaza that has killed thousands of civilians.\nOn the right, the House Freedom Caucus said Monday that it opposed 'using the emergency situation in Israel as a bogus justification to ram through Ukraine aid with no offset and no security for our own wide-open borders.'\nAdvertisement\nThe political divides on foreign aid have so far flummoxed Johnson, who rose from the lower ranks of House leadership to become speaker after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was abruptly ousted late last year.",

            "excerpt": "Louisiana is awaiting a decision from three federal judges that could affect the balance of power in Congress — and the fortunes of two prominent state politicians",
            "summary": "NEW ORLEANS — Politics and race are both factors in a pending court challenge of Louisiana's new congressional maps. How much weight each carries is a major question before three federal judges whose ruling could affect the balance of power in the next Congress.\nAt issue is a congressional map that was approved this year with the backing of the state's new governor, Jeff Landry — to the consternation of at least some of his fellow Republicans.\nThe map creates a new mostly Black congressional district in Louisiana, at the expense of a white Republican incumbent, Rep. Garret Graves, who backed another Republican in the governor's election last fall. Given voting patterns in Louisiana, a mostly Black district would be more likely to send a Democrat to Congress.\nTwelve self-described non-African American voters argued in a lawsuit that the new mostly Black district constitutes illegal 'textbook racial gerrymandering.'\nAdvertisement\nNot so, argue the new map's backers. Politics, they argue, was the major influence in drawing the new district boundary lines. They say the new map protects most incumbents and draws together Black populations in a way that will comply with the federal Voting Rights Act, giving Louisiana, which is roughly one-third Black, a second majority Black district among six.\nThey also pointed to Republican backers of the plan, who said during legislative debates in January that they wanted to safeguard four GOP-held House districts, including those of House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise.\nThat the new map put Graves in political peril by placing him in the new mostly Black district is further evidence race wasn't the sole motivating factor, the map's backers said in briefs and in testimony last week at a hearing in Shreveport.\nAdvertisement\n'We all know that one of the main reasons it was drawn the way it was, was because Gov. Jeff Landry wants to get rid of Congressman Graves,' state Rep. Mandie Landry, a New Orleans Democrat who testified at the hearing, said in a social media post. Landry is no relation to the governor.\nState Sen. Cleo Fields, a Black Democrat from the Baton Rouge area who served in Congress in the 1990s, has already declared his candidacy in the newly configured district.\nWhatever the three judges decide will likely be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. It's unclear when the judges will rule, but time is growing short. State election officials say they need to know the configuration of the districts by May 15 to prepare for the fall elections.\nThe controversy in Louisiana, as in other states, arose because new government district boundary lines are redrawn by legislatures every 10 years to account for population shifts reflected in census data. Louisiana's Republican-dominated Legislature drew a new map in 2022 that, despite some boundary shifts, was favorable to all six current incumbents: five white Republicans and a Black Democrat. Then-Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, vetoed the map but the majority-Republican Legislature overrode the veto, leading to a court challenge filed in Baton Rouge.\nAdvertisement\nIn June 2022, Baton Rouge-based U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick issued an injunction against the map, saying challengers would likely win their suit claiming it violated the Voting Rights Act. As the case was appealed, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an unexpected ruling in June that favored Black voters in a congressional redistricting case in Alabama.\nDick sided with challengers who said the 2022 map packed a significant number of voters in one district — District 2 which stretches from New Orleans to the Baton Rouge area — while 'cracking' the remaining Black population by apportioning it to other mostly white districts.\nIn November, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals gave the state a January deadline for drawing a new congressional district. Landry, who was the state's attorney general when he was elected to succeed the term-limited Edwards, called a special session to redraw the map, saying the Legislature should do it rather than a federal judge.\nAdvertisement\nThe new map does not resemble the sample maps that supporters of a new majority Black district had suggested earlier, which would have created a new district largely covering the northeastern part of the state.\nThe new mostly Black district crosses the state diagonally, linking Shreveport in the northwest to parts of the Baton Rouge area in the southeast. And while its backers hail the creation of a new majority Black district, the plaintiffs say it results in 'explicit, racial segregation of voters.'\nThe judges hearing the case are U.S. District Judges David Joseph and Robert Summerhays, both nominated to the court by former President Donald Trump; and Judge Carl Stewart of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, nominated by former Democratic President Bill Clinton.",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden will accept endorsements from at least 15 members of the Kennedy political family during a campaign stop in Philadelphia on Thursday as he aims to undermine former President Donald Trump and marginalize the candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nKerry Kennedy, a daughter of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, niece of former President John F. Kennedy and sister of the current presidential contender, will deliver the endorsements of Biden, his campaign announced.\nThe decision to highlight the Kennedy family endorsement more than six months from Election Day is an indication of how seriously Biden's team is taking the threat of the long shot bid potentially using his last name's lingering Democratic magic to siphon off support from the president.\nBoth Democrats and Republicans worry that Kennedy's candidacy could spoil their respective presumptive nominee's campaigns. Biden was using the event, which caps a three-day campaign swing in a battleground state critical to his reelection effort, to also sustain the pressure on Trump.\nAdvertisement\n'I can only imagine how Donald Trump's outrageous lies and behavior would have horrified my father, Robert F. Kennedy, who proudly served as Attorney General of the United States, and honored his pledge to uphold the law and protect the country,' Kerry Kennedy will say, according to prepared remarks. 'Daddy stood for equal justice, human rights and freedom from want and fear. Just as President Biden does today.'\nThe endorsement was hardly a surprise, as the prominent Democratic family has been vocal that they don't see eye to eye politically with Robert Kennedy Jr., who started as a protest primary challenger to Biden in the Democratic party and now is running as an independent. Biden last month hosted more than 30 members of Kennedy's extended family at the White House for St. Patrick's Day, with family members posing with the president in the Rose Garden and Oval Office.\nAfter the formal endorsement, Biden and members of the Kennedy family were set to meet with supporters at a campaign event, and members of the Kennedy clan were planning to make calls to voters and knock on doors on Biden's behalf.\nAdvertisement\nSeveral notable members of the family were not endorsing, including U.S. Ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy and nonprofit leader Maria Shriver, which the Biden campaign said was due to their nonpolitical professional roles.\nRobert Kennedy Jr. has spoken publicly in the past about disagreeing with his family on many issues, but maintains it can be done in 'friendly' ways. After a Super PAC supporting his campaign produced a TV ad during the Super Bowl that relied heavily on imagery from John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential run, Robert Kennedy Jr. apologized to his relatives on the X social media platform, saying he was sorry if the spot 'caused anyone in my family pain.'\nThe Democratic National Committee has separately hired a communications team to combat the appeal of third-party candidates, Kennedy first among them. The DNC also filed a recent Federal Election Commission complaint against Kennedy's campaign, charging that it coordinated too closely with an affiliated Super PAC to get his name on the presidential ballot in some states.\nAdvertisement\nKennedy is also viewed warily by the Trump campaign, which is fearful that he could also pull the GOP voters they need to defeat Biden in November. While Trump has released a recent video saying, 'If I were a Democrat, I'd vote for RFK Jr. every single time over Biden,' he has also sometimes criticized Kennedy, including suggesting that he is more 'radical left' than the incumbent president.\nThe Kennedy family endorsement is a capstone on three days of campaigning in Pennsylvania.\nIt was an opportunity for Biden to reconnect with his roots, starting on Tuesday in Scranton, where he lived until he was 10 years old. He swung by his childhood home, a three-story colonial that his family rented, and reminisced about attending Mass at St. Paul's.\nHe seemed reluctant to leave town the next day, stopping for coffee before heading to the airport. 'It's good to be back in Scranton,' the president said when a customer welcomed him.\nBiden's next stop was Pittsburgh, where he called for higher tariffs on steel and aluminum from China to protect U.S. industry from what he called unfair competition.\nBut even that event involved some nostalgia, as Biden recalled an endorsement from the steelworkers when he was 'a 29-year-old kid' from Delaware running for U.S. Senate.",

            "summary": "In their first televised primary debate, Rep. David Trone and Prince George's County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks each sought to position themselves as the Democratic Party's best chance of defeating the state's popular, two-term former Republican governor in November.\nWith similar stances on key issues such as education and reproductive rights, the leading Democrats in the race for U.S. Senate emphasized contrasting experience in making their pitch to primary voters — all while agreeing on the stakes. The race is one of a handful of contests across the country with the power to determine control of the chamber in November, which Democrats currently hold by a razor-thin margin.\nTrone, a multimillionaire founder of Total Wine & More, highlighted his record in Congress, his business experience and a challenging upbringing over the course of an hour-long live program on Fox45 and WJLA7. Alsobrooks, who was previously Prince George's state's attorney, pointed to her own experiences as a woman and mother, her criminal justice background and her record leading the state's second-most populous county.\nAdvertisement\nTrone swiftly declared victory in a news release after the debate. Alsobrooks hailed her 'standout performance.' Each claimed momentum heading into the next phase of the contest.\nAs May 14 approaches, attention is building on what had largely been seen as a sleepy contest for a reliably blue seat until Hogan launched a surprise bid two months ago. Endorsements are flying, yards signs are popping up and airwaves are thrumming with campaign messaging — and money.\nThis week alone saw the liberal super PAC Fight Corporate Monopolies launch the cycle's first negative ad, swiping at Trone's business practices and comparing him to former Republican president Donald Trump. On Wednesday, Hogan deployed a nearly $1 million television ad buy half bankrolled by national Republicans eager to flip the open Senate seat red.\nAdvertisement\nNational dollars are flowing into a contest that had been largely shaped by Trone's deep pockets. He has loaned his campaign at least $41.7 million since the start of the primary race, campaign finance records show.\nAlsobrooks, an underdog in the race, according to recent polls, repeatedly focused attention on Trone's fortunes and interrogated his argument that self-funding helps insulate him from special interests — repeating a line of attack she and her surrogates have raised about him 'buying' the seat.\nDuring the debate, she took aim at contributions Trone has made in a personal capacity and through his company, Total Wine & More, to conservative leaders such as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) who have worked to quash abortion access.\nThat fact, she said, contrasts with a record of giving that Trone has touted. He helped establish an abortion clinic in Western Maryland near the border with West Virginia after that state effectively shut down the procedure.\nAdvertisement\n'He cannot claim credit for the good his company does and distance himself from the bad that it does,' Alsobrooks said.\nTrone, in turn, swatted at her accusations by insinuating her interests would lie with companies that have supported her campaign, referencing by name Exxon, Pfizer and Cigna.\n'When you take the money … then they must expect something [of politicians],' Trone said. 'They're not charities.'\nAlsobrooks has brought in more individual contributions than any other candidate so far, and filings show she has just under $3.2 million on hand. Still, Alsobrooks's performance Friday carried extra weight in a race with lopsided resources at a time when she is seeking to boost name recognition.\nPolls released over the past six weeks show Trone consistently leading her, and Hogan, who left office last year with high favorability ratings, leading them both.\nHogan has maintained that he is an underdog in a state where registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans 2 to 1. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll conducted in March found that while Hogan is better known than Trone and Alsobrooks, he faces a crosscurrent Democrats hope to exploit: Maryland voters said by a 20-point margin that they prefer Democratic control of the U.S. Senate.\nHogan was out front in a poll released this week by FOX45 News, the Baltimore Sun and the University of Baltimore and conducted by OpinionWorks. The results show Trone leading Alsobrooks, 49 percent to 28 percent.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Trone on Friday detailed a bipartisan spirit he said helped him compete with Hogan, Alsobrooks took the opportunity to question a record of political giving to the man he hopes to beat. In 2014, eight of Trone's businesses gave $30,000 to Hogan in an effort to help him get rid of campaign debt, The Post reported.\n'What we don't need is a Larry Hogan donor trying to take on Larry Hogan in the fall,' Alsobrooks said.\nAmong the sharpest jabs Friday was an exchange on endorsements, with Trone noting he had secured the support of prominent politicians from the county Alsobrooks represents.\nOn Thursday, he received an endorsement from Aisha Braveboy (D), the Prince George's County state's attorney who holds Alsobrooks's former position. Democratic Prince George's County Council members Krystal Oriadha and Edward Burroughs III — both of whom have endorsed Trone and been critical of Alsobrooks in the past — were in the studio Friday, at times huddling around Trone during commercial breaks.\nAdvertisement\n'The folks that really matter the most are those that know you the best,' Trone said. 'Prince George's County supports us. The list goes on and on and on.'\nAlsobrooks has picked up Democratic heavyweights from the local to the federal level. Among her supporters are Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Rep. Jamie Raskin and former Prince George's county executive Rushern Baker IV.\nThe pair didn't spar over topics such as the Israel-Hamas war, on which they both agree that Hamas should be defeated, a cease-fire is needed and that hostages must be released. They also said cities should have access to federal data currently withheld from the public to enhance law enforcement's ability to trace guns and quell crime.\nand that hostages must be released.

Hogan said he would not vote for a national abortion ban, but he also said he would not take a position on hypothetical legislation that would codify Roe v. Wade .\nRoe v. Wade.\nCracks in their positions appeared when asked about repealing the death penalty.\nAlsobrooks supported the death sentence of a man convicted of killing four people including two children when she was Prince George's state's attorney, a panelist noted. But as the federal government reconsiders the death penalty, Alsobrooks noted that she, too, has evolved on the issue.\nMarylanders have decided that the death penalty is no longer the law of the land in Maryland, 'and I agree with Maryland voters,' Alsobrooks said. I can tell you that I would also not support the death penalty on the federal level. … Having said that, what I believe is that anyone who harms a child or who murders a child in particular deserves the stiffest penalty available to that person. And right now in Maryland, that penalty is life without parole.\nIn his rebuttal, Trone emphasized his steadfast opposition to it. 'It's clearly cruel and unusual punishment, and it's clearly racist,' he said.\nEarly voting in Maryland's Democratic and Republican primaries begins May 2.",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The House is preparing in a rare Saturday session to approve $95 billion in foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies, Democrats and Republicans joining together behind the legislation after a grueling months-long fight over renewed American support for repelling Russia's invasion into Ukraine.\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson — putting his job on the line — relied on Democratic support this week to set up a series of votes on three aid bills, as well as a fourth that contains several other foreign policy proposals. If the votes are successful, the package will go to the Senate, where passage in the coming days is nearly assured. President Joe Biden has promised to sign it immediately.\nPassage through the House would clear away the biggest hurdle to Biden's funding request, first made in October as Ukraine's military supplies began to run low. The GOP-controlled House, skeptical of U.S. support for Ukraine, struggled for months over what to do, first demanding that any assistance be tied to policy changes at the U.S. southern border — only to immediately reject a bipartisan Senate offer along those very lines.\nAdvertisement\nReaching an endgame has been an excruciating lift for Johnson that has tested both his resolve and his support among Republicans, with a small but growing number now openly urging his removal from the speaker's office. Yet congressional leaders cast the votes as a turning point in history — an urgent sacrifice as U.S. allies are beleaguered by wars and threats from continental Europe to the Middle East to Asia.\n'The only thing that has kept terrorists and tyrants at bay is the perception of a strong America, that we would stand strong,' Johnson said this week. 'And we will. I think that Congress is going to show that. This is a very important message that we are going to send the world.'\nStill, Congress has seen a stream of world leaders visit in recent months, from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, all but pleading with lawmakers to approve the aid. Globally, the delay left many questioning America's commitment to its allies.\nAdvertisement\nAt stake has also been one of Biden's top foreign policy priorities — halting Russian President Vladimir Putin's advance in Europe. After engaging in quiet talks with Johnson, the president quickly endorsed Johnson's plan this week, paving the way for Democrats to give their rare support to clear the procedural hurdles needed for a final vote.\n'It's long past time that we support our democratic allies in Israel, Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific and provide humanitarian assistance to civilians who are in harm's way in theaters of conflict like Gaza, Haiti and the Sudan,' House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said at a news conference Friday.\nVoting on the package is likely to create unusual alliances in the House. While aid for Ukraine will likely win a majority in both parties, a significant number of progressive Democrats are expected to vote against the bill aiding Israel as they demand an end to the bombardment of Gaza that has killed thousands of civilians.\nAdvertisement\nAt the same time, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has loomed large over the fight, weighing in from afar via social media statements and direct phone calls with lawmakers as he tilts the GOP to a more isolationist stance with his 'America First' brand of politics. Ukraine's defense once enjoyed robust, bipartisan support in Congress, but as the war enters its third year, a bulk of Republicans oppose further aid.\nAt one point in the months-long slog to get Ukraine assistance through Congress, Trump's opposition essentially doomed the bipartisan Senate proposal on border security. This week, Trump also issued a social media post that questioned why European nations were not giving more money to Ukraine, though he spared Johnson from criticism and said Ukraine's survival was important.\nStill, the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus has derided the legislation as the 'America Last' foreign wars package and urged lawmakers to defy Republican leadership and oppose it because the bills do not include border security measures.\nAdvertisement\nJohnson's hold on the speaker's gavel has also grown more tenuous in recent days as three Republicans, led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, supported a 'motion to vacate' that can lead to a vote on removing the speaker. A few more were expected to soon join, said Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who is urging Johnson to voluntarily step aside.\nThe speaker's office has been working furiously to whip up support for the bill, as well as for Johnson. It arranged a series of press calls in the lead-up to the final votes on the package, first with Jewish leaders, then with Christian groups, to show support for the speaker and the legislation he is bringing to the floor.\nAri Fleischer, a former White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, said it was about time the United States 'did something to support Israel, fight Vladimir Putin and stand up to China.'\nAdvertisement\n'Coming together like this is a refreshing reminder of the old days when foreign policy had bipartisan support,' he said.\nThe package includes several Republican priorities that Democrats endorse, or at least are willing to accept. Those include proposals that allow the U.S. to seize frozen Russian central bank assets to rebuild Ukraine; impose sanctions on Iran, Russia, China and criminal organizations that traffic fentanyl; and legislation to require the China-based owner of the popular video app TikTok to sell its stake within a year or face a ban in the United States.\nStill, the all-out push to get the bills through Congress is a reflection not only of politics, but realities on the ground in Ukraine. Top lawmakers on national security committees, who are privy to classified briefings, have grown gravely concerned about the situation in recent weeks. Russia has increasingly used satellite-guided gliding bombs — which allow planes to drop them from a safe distance — to pummel Ukrainian forces beset by a shortage of troops and ammunition.\nAdvertisement\n'I really do believe the intel and the briefings that we've gotten,' Johnson said, adding, 'I think that Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed.'\nA former ambassador to Ukraine under President George W. Bush, John Herbst, said the months-long delay in approving more American assistance has undoubtedly hurt Ukrainian troops on the battlefield.",

Kennedy, niece of former President John F. Kennedy and sister of the current presidential candidate, called Biden 'my hero,' saying — without mention of her brother — that the family wanted to 'make crystal clear' their support for reelecting Biden.\nBiden, who keeps a bust of Robert F. Kennedy in the Oval Office, said the endorsements were 'an incredible honor.'\nGoing on to describe family debates he said his father orchestrated among his children, Kennedy said Sunday night that the exercise showed him a respectful way to take opposing positions with people he cares about without taking it personally.\n'I debated them with information and passion and not to hate each other because we disagreed with each other,' he said. 'I love my family, either way.'\nAdvertisement\nKennedy — who mentioned Biden's Oval Office RFK bust, as well as his relatives currently working both in the Biden's administration and on his own presidential campaign — made his remarks in Michigan, where last week, the campaign secured access to the general election ballot. In front of the suburban Detroit theater ahead of the performances, several dozen protesters opposed Kennedy's appearance, with signs aiming to align Kennedy with former President Donald Trump.\nKennedy has spoken publicly in the past about disagreeing with his family on many issues, but maintains it can be done in 'friendly' ways. After a super political action committee supporting his campaign produced a TV ad during the Super Bowl that relied heavily on imagery from John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential run, Kennedy Jr. apologized to his relatives on the X social media platform, saying he was sorry if the spot 'caused anyone in my family pain.'\n'I love my family. I feel that they love me,' he said Sunday. 'And I wish the same thing would happen for all of our country, where we disagree with each other without hating on each other.'\n___",

Still, Hogan would have to overcome attacks on his positions on key issues like abortion access, which did not play as prominent a role in his campaigns for governor but will be front and center in a year when Marylanders will also be asked to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.\nRecords show Hogan's campaign is already drawing support from national GOP players, including from the National Republican Senatorial Committee and political action committees affiliated with more than a dozen sitting Republican senators, and from prominent Republican donors like Harlan Crow, the Texas billionaire who was thrust into headlines because of his close relationship with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\nHogan's campaign is already drawing support from national GOP players, including from the National Republican Senatorial Committee and political action committees affiliated with more than a dozen sitting Republican senators, and from prominent Republican donors like Harlan Crow, the Texas billionaire who was thrust into headlines because of his close relationship with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\nAdvertisement\nHogan's potential challengers are already using his donors to draw a distinction between the popular Republican and the Democrats he may face in the general election.\n'As we look towards November, it's no surprise Larry Hogan is raising money from MAGA donors to try and pad his coffers,' said Ford, the Alsobrooks campaign spokeswoman. 'Angela will defeat him.'\nOther congressional races in Maryland are also drawing in substantial funds. In the Democratic primary for the 3rd Congressional District, former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn has raised more than $3.7 million since announcing his campaign in January. His top opponent, state Sen. Sarah K. Elfreth (D-Anne Arundel) raised $915,685 since the start of her campaign. The candidate with the third-highest fundraising total was state Sen. Clarence K. Lam (D-Howard), who raised $639,868.\nAdvertisement",

            "summary": "The House came together Saturday to pass a sweeping $95 billion foreign aid package, a rare moment of bipartisan cooperation in the closely divided chamber. But the move only intensified infighting among House Republicans, who split sharply on the strategy to deliver assistance to foreign allies including Ukraine and Israel.\nIn social media posts and TV interviews afterward, House Republicans took aim at one another — in unusually sharp terms — over the events that led up to the vote. Ultimately, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) had to rely on a majority of Democrats to push through the most controversial piece of the package — $60 billion in aid to Ukraine for its war against Russia — in a gamble that could cost him his speakership.\n— in unusually sharp terms — over the events that led up to the vote. Ultimately, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) had to rely on a majority of Democrats to push through the most controversial piece of the package — $60 billion in aid to Ukraine for its war against Russia — in a gamble that could cost him his speakership.\n'It's my absolute honor to be in Congress, but I serve with some real scumbags,' Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Tex.) said Sunday on CNN's 'State of the Union,' calling out two GOP colleagues — Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.) and Bob Good (Va.) — who have broken with Johnson and voted against other legislation proposed by the GOP majority.\nAdvertisement\nGaetz and Good have also endorsed Gonzales's primary challenger, something Johnson has warned members against doing. Gonzales's CNN comments prompted a third hard-line GOP colleague, Rep. Eli Crane (Ariz.), to announce his support for Gonzales's opponent, Brandon Herrera, a gun enthusiast with a large YouTube following.\nMost House Republicans have grown weary of colleagues who consistently vote against legislation that must be addressed rather than work to seek compromise within the party. Since eight Republicans voted with all Democrats to oust then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), more pragmatic Republicans have become irate at the 'no' bloc of the conference and encouraged GOP leadership to punish those members.\nof colleagues who consistently vote against legislation that must be addressed rather than work to seek compromise within the party.

But in voting against conservative measures they do not believe go far enough, other Republicans say, hard-liners are weakening Johnson's hand in negotiations because the conference is not united around a set of demands.\nBut in voting against conservative measures they do not believe go far enough, other Republicans say, hard-liners are weakening Johnson's hand in negotiations because the conference is not united around a set of demands.\nAdvertisement\nThe hard-line bloc has long objected to considering further Ukraine aid without legislation to secure American borders. In a nod to such demands, Johnson proposed voting on a border security bill Saturday that largely mirrors a tough conservative proposal House Republicans passed last year. But in protest of Johnson's foreign aid proposal, three hard-liners on the House Rules Committee — GOP Reps. Chip Roy (Tex.), Ralph Norman (S.C.) and Thomas Massie (Ky.) — prevented the bill from being considered under rules that would require only a simple majority for passage.\nOther Republicans urged Johnson to still put the bill up for a vote under rules that would require two-thirds of the House for passage. The measure fell short.\n'Those who voted to fund Ukraine's borders instead of America's KNEW for certainty that the separate (unattached to Ukraine) border security was going to die in the Senate, and are now dying for cover — so they're casting blame,' Roy said after the vote on X. 'Own it.'\nAdvertisement\nRep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) shot back at Roy on X, saying the 'isolationist Republicans' were standing in the way of at least forcing Senate Democrats to take a politically difficult vote on border security.\non border security.\nRep. Dan Bishop (R-N.C.) came to Roy's defense.\n'After each sellout, once the fury of Republican voters sets in, the self-serving lies begin,' Bishop said in his own post directed at Barr.\nMassie told Barr, a fellow Kentucky Republican, to 'quit blaming conservatives for your votes.'\nThe intraparty fights have spilled over on to the campaign trail, where Gaetz has taken the lead in ignoring Johnson's warnings and campaigning against GOP colleagues. Gaetz visited San Antonio last month to hold a rally with Herrera where he bashed Gonzales and pushed for a more aggressive GOP conference.\nThere is no love lost with Gonzales.\nAdvertisement\n'Matt Gaetz, he paid minors to have sex with him at drug parties,' Gonzales claimed Sunday, referencing allegations against Gaetz that the Department of Justice investigated but declined to prosecute last year.\nbut declined to prosecute last year.\nThe House Ethics Committee is still investigating Gaetz, who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and said Sunday on X that Gonzales was 'laundering lies on CNN.'\nGonzales also targeted Good for his support of Herrera, apparently referencing a report by Jewish Insider that cited instances of Herrera posting videos 'replete with imagery, music and jokes about the Nazi regime and the Holocaust.'\n'Bob Good endorsed my opponent, a known neo-Nazi,' Gonzales said. 'These people used to walk around with white hoods at night; now they're walking around with white hoods in the daytime.'\nAfter Gonzales's CNN interview, Herrera objected to the congressman's characterization of him as a 'neo-Nazi,' writing on X: 'This is the death spiral ladies and gentlemen. He has to cry to his liberal friends about me, because Republicans won't listen anymore.'\nAdvertisement\nFor Johnson, the infighting looms over his fate as speaker.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) had promised to try to remove Johnson from the speakership if he moved Ukraine aid, but she held back in hopes that her colleagues hear from angry constituents before returning to Washington.\nMassie, who co-sponsored Greene's resolution to oust Johnson, said he hopes Johnson resigns and predicted that if he does not, someone could trigger a 'motion to vacate' even though much of the Republican conference does not want to devolve into chaos again.\nIn a tense Tuesday evening meeting with Johnson and several rank-and-file Republicans, Gaetz told the speaker that if he moved ahead with his foreign aid plan that GOP colleagues would seek to oust him. He also threatened others in the room, saying the far-right bloc would target them on social media and campaign against them.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, some GOP critics of the hard-line faction have advocated for leadership to take harsher measures against the bloc.\nLast week during a meeting with the speaker and lawmakers of the conservative Main Street Caucus, who prioritize governing, conversations revolved around how to punish members based on what could improve House functions. Several members suggested removing the three hard-liners — Roy, Massie and Norman — who sit on the House Rules Committee.",

            "excerpt": "A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 45% of U.S. adults say they have become more concerned about climate change over the past year",
            "summary": "Like many Americans, Ron Theusch is getting more worried about climate change.\nA resident of Alden, Minnesota, Theusch has noticed increasingly dry and mild winters punctuated by short periods of severe cold — symptoms of a warming planet.\nAs he thinks about that, future generations are on his mind. 'We have four children that are in their 20s,' the 56-year-old truck driver and moderate Democrat said. 'It's like, what's our grandkids' world going to be like?'\nA new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 45% of adults in the United States say they have become more concerned about climate change over the past year, including roughly 6 in 10 Democrats and one-quarter of Republicans.\nPresident Joe Biden's signature climate change policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, was intended to address some of those fears, investing billions in incentives for consumers and businesses to move toward clean energy sources. Biden has pointed to this climate agenda as a major presidential success during his run for reelection. But the poll suggests that although the law has already affected some Americans, it's not widely known among the general population — and may not be the electoral boost Biden is looking for.\nAdvertisement\nAbout one-quarter of Americans say tax credits for renewable energy projects such as wind power have benefited people like them so far, with similar numbers for incentives for companies to manufacture clean energy technologies in the U.S. rather than abroad, tax credits for individuals to add solar panels to their homes, or subsidies and tax credits for electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances like heat pumps. Those numbers are fairly substantial for a law that passed less than two years ago, where the benefits largely hinge on big-ticket purchases like cars or home improvements.\nPromoting electric vehicles has also been a major focus for the Biden administration, and 15% of U.S. adults say electric vehicles have had a good impact on them personally.\n'I totally agree with the act because it's done so many things for people,' said Charles Lopez, a 65-year-old liberal Democrat from the Florida Keys. 'They help everybody ... I'm not ready for a full electric, but I'll get there when there's enough charging stations.'\nAdvertisement\nBut the people who have benefited from the law are disproportionately Democrats. And while only about 1 in 10 U.S. adults think the individual tax credits and subsidies have hurt people like them, those provisions of the law aren't yet registering with the majority of Americans — roughly one-quarter say those credits haven't made a difference to people like them. Nearly 4 in 10 in each instance don't know enough to have an opinion about them.\n'I still think that, as much as we'd like for them to be implemented in a way that we can actually see results, it's not really happening in my eyes,' said Sandra Sherman, a 62-year-old resident of Vero Beach, Florida, who identifies as a liberal Democrat. 'With solar panels, although it seems like a really good idea, I see very few people in the area in Florida that I live in that actually have them.'\nGenerally, U.S. adults also aren't confident the IRA will have an impact even in more time. The poll found that only between 23% and 35% of U.S. adults say the law's key components will eventually help address climate change. About 2 in 10 think the main provisions of the law will make no difference in addressing climate change, and about one-third don't know enough to say.\nAdvertisement\n'A lot of the public feeling on it is, ‘well something needs to be done,' but not necessarily knowing what needs to be done or not even necessarily having strong feelings about what needs to be done,' said David Weakliem, a University of Connecticut professor emeritus.\nBiden still has an advantage over his opponent, former President Donald Trump, when it comes to climate change generally. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults and two-thirds of Democrats have 'a lot' or 'some' trust in Biden on climate change. That includes 29-year-old Jaime Said, a moderate Republican.\nBiden has 'talked about it more and he has mentioned a few plans of things he wants to do. So even if he doesn't do them, at the very least he's thinking about them. That's kind of headed in the right direction,' Said, a medical student in Panama City, Florida, said.\nAdvertisement\n'I know already, right off the bat, (Trump is) not going to address it much,' Said added. 'That's why I don't have too much faith in him doing anything about it.'\nOnly about 3 in 10 say they have 'a lot' or 'some' trust in Trump with regard to addressing climate change.\nBut one of Biden's major pitches for the IRA — that it will help the American economy and U.S. workers — doesn't seem to be resonating. According to the poll, only about 2 in 10 Americans say the law has done more to help the U.S. economy, while about one-quarter think it's done more to hurt the economy, and about half think it either made no difference or don't know enough to say.\nAnd broadly, a majority of Americans say the federal government is currently doing 'too little' to address climate change. They generally agree it's important for the government to support climate solutions. About half say it's extremely or very important to limit the use of products and technologies that harm the environment, and nearly half say it's important for the government to pass stricter environmental laws and regulations. About 4 in 10 say it's important for the government to build a national network of public charging stations for electric vehicles, which is another Biden administration priority.\nAdvertisement\nMost say it's extremely or very important for the federal government to invest in new, environmentally friendly technologies, and most, like 38-year-old Julio Carmona, a health program associate who lives in Stratford, Connecticut, and identifies as a moderate Democrat, say the same about enforcing current environmental regulations.\n'We can all do our part when it comes to saving energy, recycling and all those other things,' said Carmona. 'But if the big corporations aren't doing it, I think that, for me, would be where the government should start.'\n___\nThe poll of 1,204 adults was conducted April 4-8, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

            "summary": "A bill to provide additional U.S. aid to Ukraine could move one step closer to House passage on Wednesday — but not without a major boost from Democrats who would have to join Republicans to push it through.\nAnd that action would likely prompt hard-line Republicans, who stridently oppose Ukraine aid, to make good on their threats to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) from his leadership position at some point in the future.\n'Democrats will not be responsible for this bill failing,' House Appropiations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) said when asked Thursday if Democrats will support the rule.\nInstead of a complex four-part plan he floated this week, Johnson now intends to try to pass five bills — one each for aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Indo-Pacific allies, as well as a GOP wish list of foreign policy priorities and a fifth stand-alone bill to address widespread Republican demands to strengthen the southern U.S. border. GOP leadership announced that the House would stay in session until Saturday to consider the bills.\nAdvertisement\nThe foreign aid bills closely mirror a Senate package and if they pass, would likely be sent to the Senate for passage.\nJohnson's plan has thrown an already bitterly divided Republican conference into further turmoil. Late Wednesday night, the House Rules Committee recessed without advancing the border bill because three GOP committee members — Reps. Chip Roy (Tex.), Thomas Massie (Ky.) and Ralph Norman (Okla.) — were poised to sink the vote.\nOn Thursday morning, Roy, Norman and other members of the House Freedom Caucus were defiant, insisting they would do everything they could to stymie Johnson's bills during a procedural vote later that day.\n'We voted against it in rules, which is supposed to be a no-no,\" Norman said. \"But the fact is our country is at stake... and we're not gonna run away from it, not now, not ever, as long as we're up here.'\nAdvertisement\nJohnson's gambit to pass five individual bills is already blowing up on the speaker, whose six-month-old hold on the gavel is being threatened by a promise by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) to invoke a 'motion to vacate' to topple Johnson if he puts Ukraine aid on the floor, something to which many hard-right Republicans object.\nLate Wednesday, Greene described the Ukraine bill as 'an inflated fantasy idea invited by Mike Johnson' while Roy echoed the argument many Republicans have made: that the United States needs to secure its border with Mexico before worrying about Ukraine.\nLate Wednesday, Greene described the Ukraine bill as 'an inflated fantasy idea invited by Mike Johnson' while Roy echoed the argument many Republicans have made: that the United States needs to secure its border with Mexico before worrying about Ukraine.\n'Declaring a historic moment doesn't necessarily make it so,' Roy said.\n'Declaring a historic moment doesn't necessarily make it so,' Roy said.\nAt a Wednesday evening news conference, Johnson was visibly emotional when asked about why he had opted to try to pass the foreign aid package at this moment.\nAdvertisement\n'Listen, my philosophy is you do the right thing and you let the chips fall where they may. … If I operated out of fear over a motion to vacate, I would never be able to do my job,' he said. 'This is a critical time right now. … I can make a selfish decision and do something that's different. But I'm doing here what I believe to be the right thing.'\nGreene said Wednesday night she wouldn't interrupt the process on the aid package by bringing up the move to oust Johnson. But she also refused to commit to doing so afterwards.\nThe stakes are indeed high for the speaker as he works to navigate a bitterly divided Republican conference. Some members are loudly opposed to Ukraine aid without first securing the U.S. border, while others believe that aid, along with money for Israel, is a critical national security priority; in addition, some Republicans question the speaker's leadership style. For Johnson, it's a Catch-22: Consider aid to Ukraine, and a move to wrest his gavel is bound to follow.\nAdvertisement\nDemoralized Republicans exited a four-hour meeting of Johnson and his allies Tuesday night, before the release of the latest proposal, having failed to chart a path on foreign aid that would be carried by Republicans instead of reliant on Democrats. Multiple people familiar with the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal dynamics, said the session enlightened them and Johnson about the consequences of moving the foreign aid package: It could all lead to his ouster from the job.\n'The battle lines were very clear at the end,' one Republican said. 'It was very clear [the motion to vacate] will be brought if the speaker's plan proceeds.'\nEven so, Johnson acted, telling Republicans in a text to colleagues Wednesday morning that after 'significant Member feedback and discussion' this week, the House would move ahead with his plan, with some significant changes. He released the text of legislation on aid for Ukraine, Israel, Indo-Pacific allies, border security, and other foreign policy priorities Wednesday.\nAdvertisement\nBut in signs of trouble late Wednesday, the House Rules Committee failed to approve the border security bill because three Republicans on the panel — Reps. Chip Roy (R-Tex.), Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), and Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) — refused to support it, meaning the panel adjourned without action. Democrats have no interest in backing the GOP border proposal.\nThe three separate bills that fund military aid for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan largely mirror the $95 billion Senate-passed national security supplemental. The House legislation turns a portion of the aid, the money sent directly to Ukraine, into a loan and is endorsed by former president Donald Trump. It also includes just over $9 billion in humanitarian aid for Gaza, the West Bank, Ukraine and other places in need, which Democrats have demanded as a condition of any support from them.\nJohnson signaled Wednesday evening that there would probably be an amendment to the package to strip the humanitarian aid, which he said he has 'concerns' with.\nAdvertisement\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) called Wednesday evening for Republicans to put the foreign aid package on the floor, but didn't commit Democratic support for the measures.\n'The time has come for the House of Representatives to act and act decisively,' Jeffries said. 'We can either confront Russian aggression in defense of democracy or we can allow the pro-Putin extreme MAGA Republicans to appease' the Russian leader.\nJeffries said Democrats will 'evaluate' the process and the final product, including amendments, before making a determination about how to move forward.\nNonetheless, the speaker's proposal received a major boost from President Biden on Wednesday afternoon. Biden said he 'strongly' supports the proposal and encouraged the House and the Senate to swiftly send it his way.",

According to one lawmaker who received such a call and spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, Lake made it clear that she 'understands [the pre-Roe ban] will be bad for her and for Trump.' They discussed how Arizona is essential for Trump to secure the presidency, the lawmaker said. Trump lost the state to President Biden in 2020 by only 10,457 votes.\nThe dilemma facing Republicans on abortion has grown even more acute since last Wednesday, when Trump said Arizona's abortion ban goes too far and promised it would be 'straightened out' by 'the governor and everybody else.' Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee who has bragged about his role in the overturning of Roe, made a similar promise about a pending six-week abortion ban in Florida, even as he has argued the abortion issue should be left to the states.\nthe abortion issue should be left to the states.\nAdvertisement\nTwo Republicans in the Arizona House of Representatives and two in the Senate would have to join all of both chambers' Democrats to repeal the ban, which could take effect as early as June 8 without legislative action.

One received what they described as 'threats' from a leading state antiabortion advocate.\n'This is the most difficult decision that I've made in the eight years that I've been there,' said Rep.

Alex Kolodin (R), who sees the 1864 law as a victory for the party's core ideological position as well as a major humanitarian triumph.\nAdvertisement\nSeveral GOP lawmakers and operatives said Trump's comments could ease the decision to vote for a repeal for some Republicans who were on the fence, granting them permission to go against their values for a better chance at securing victory in November.\n'It gave them cover,' said one prominent Arizona Republican who supports the repeal and spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss internal party dynamics. Trump's statements would have been even more helpful, the person added, if some antiabortion members were not 'virtue signaling' about the pre-Roe ban and 'trying to force everybody to be pilloried for representing their constituents.'\nSome Republican resistance to the state Supreme Court ruling emerged almost immediately. Soon after the court made its decision on April 9, several GOP lawmakers issued statements condemning the move, including Gress, Bolick and Sen. T.J. Shope — who all hail from districts that could be competitive in November.\nAdvertisement\nBolick, who is married to an Arizona Supreme Court justice, urged fellow Republicans to 'find common ground of common sense' and 'repeal the territorial law.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nGress made a similar argument on the House floor last Wednesday, after he moved to suspend the chamber's rules to bring forward the motion to repeal the law — a maneuver that surprised and angered many of his Republican colleagues. When he was shut down by the GOP majority, the Democrats erupted into chants of 'Shame, Shame, Shame!'\n(Bolick did not respond to a request for comment. Gress declined to comment.)\nGress declined to comment.)\nAlmost all of the GOP lawmakers who are now considering a repeal voted in the spring of 2022 — before Roe was overturned — for a law that banned abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy and included an explicit endorsement of the 1864 ban, specifying that the new 15-week law would not preclude the near-total abortion ban from taking effect if the U.S. Supreme Court acted.

'They had the ability to not vote for this law in the first place.'\nHobbs and her team have talked to key GOP lawmakers about the repeal effort, assuring them she would sign repeal legislation if it passes, according to people familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose private deliberations.\nSome Republicans started to recognize the shifting political winds soon after Roe was overturned — especially after voters in conservative Kansas voted overwhelmingly to protect abortion rights in August 2022. In Arizona, Gress sent out mailers ahead of the midterms that year saying he opposed the pre-Roe ban, despite sponsoring several bills during his time in the legislature designed to recognize a fetus as a person.\nsaying he opposed the pre-Roe ban, despite sponsoring several bills during his time in the legislature designed to recognize a fetus as a person.\nAdvertisement\nSome Republicans maintain that a vote to repeal the 1864 law would not be at odds with their antiabortion beliefs because they are trying to be strategic about choosing a path forward that would prevent the most abortions. Democrats are trying to get an initiative on the November ballot that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution and allow the procedure to the point of fetal viability, or about 24 weeks. These Republicans argue that supporting the repeal could demonstrate they are attuned to voter sentiments while lending credibility to GOP opposition to the ballot measure.\n'What's going to save the most lives? That's what Republicans are struggling with,' said Dunn, the GOP representative. 'You do not want to vote for something that moves it from a zero ban to … 15 weeks. … But if we don't remove it, you're going to force this ballot measure that's going to be almost guaranteed to win.'\nThe Democratic-led ballot initiative is a major concern for Arizona Republicans.\nAdvertisement\nOn Monday, the House GOP general counsel circulated a PowerPoint presentation outlining the party's strategy to combat the abortion referendum likely to appear on the Arizona ballot in November, provided the measure is backed by the necessary number of signatures and clears all possible challenges from antiabortion advocates.\nprovided the measure is backed by the necessary number of signatures and clears all possible challenges from antiabortion advocates.\nThe presentation was sent to all House members — not just Republicans — and was promptly shared with reporters.\nIt outlined a plan to add another abortion referendum to the ballot that would allow the procedure only up until six weeks of pregnancy, before many people know they're pregnant, or 15 weeks.

            "excerpt": "Larry Hogan has transformed Maryland's sleepy Senate race into a top-tier contest in the fight for the Senate majority",
            "summary": "STEVENSVILLE, Md. — Andy DePaola welcomed Larry Hogan to his family's restaurant with a big smile and a handshake. The warning came a few minutes later.\nDePaola, the 64-year-old namesake of DePaola's Bagel and Brunch here in Maryland's conservative Eastern Shore, whispered to a reporter that Hogan better avoid disparaging former President Donald Trump.\n'I'm a Trumper,' DePaola said as Hogan posed for pictures and made small talk with the excited breakfast crowd on a recent Friday morning. 'I think Larry would be better off if he kept how he felt about Trump under his breath.'\nThe brief exchange during a weeks-long bus tour illustrates a stark political reality for the popular Republican former governor, who has single-handedly transformed Maryland's sleepy Senate race into a top-tier contest in the national fight for the Senate majority. Hogan, who was perhaps the most outspoken anti-Trump Republican governor in the nation, can ill afford to lose any pieces of his delicate and diverse political coalition.\nAdvertisement\nHe's hoping to become the first Republican in more than 40 years to win a Senate seat in this deep-blue state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1 statewide, with much of the Democratic support in Baltimore and the suburbs of Washington. Over the next six months, Hogan will have to fend off political threats from all sides.\nAs Trump loyalists eye the 67-year-old businessman with skepticism, Democrats are counting on abortion rights to make Hogan's historic challenge even harder. But the R after his name may ultimately prove the most serious liability for Hogan in a state Trump lost by 33 points four years ago.\nIf Hogan wins Maryland's open Senate seat, Republicans would almost certainly claim the majority in the U.S. Senate — and with it, the power to control the agenda and judicial nominations for the next two years, at least.\nAdvertisement\nIn an interview, Hogan confirmed that he would caucus with Republicans in Washington, despite his concerns about Trump's grip on the party. He also vowed not to leave the GOP after the election, even if Trump returns to the White House.\n'I'm a real Republican,' Hogan told The Associated Press, noting that he does not identify with Trump's 'Make America Great Again' movement.\nWhen pressed to explain his concerns about MAGA, and whether he views Trump as a threat to U.S. democracy, Hogan parsed his words carefully.\n'I think certainly there has been some threats,' Hogan said. 'But you know, I think that's not what this campaign is really all about.'\nMeanwhile, Hogan's opponents on the left are only just beginning to organize as Democrats wade through their own nomination process. While Hogan faces token opposition in the GOP, Democrats will pick Hogan's general election opponent next month.\nAdvertisement\nOn Tuesday, a coalition of labor, immigration and progressive groups gathered in the state capital to criticize the former governor for using his veto powers to block legislation to increase abortion access while undermining other Democratic priorities, including health care, environmental protection and education funding.\nThe anti-Hogan event was a reminder that voters in his gubernatorial elections may have been more willing to overlook party affiliation than they will be in a Senate contest that could tilt the balance of power in Washington toward Republicans.\n'Despite him claiming to be a moderate, we know his actions show that he's a staunch Republican,' said 1199 SEIU political director Ricarra Jones, who slammed Hogan's veto of legislation to increase the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour.\nAdvertisement\n'The Senate race in November is bigger than just Maryland,' she continued. 'A Republican-dominated Senate would pursue a drastically different agenda, one that could unwind years of progressive achievements and reshape Maryland's policy landscape in ways that could take generations to reverse.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nMeanwhile, Hogan is trying to avoid divisive political disputes as he reintroduces himself to Maryland voters during a low-profile 'Back to Work' bus tour across the state.\nPerhaps the nation's most vocal anti-Trump Republican governor while in office, Hogan barely mentions Trump's name unless asked about him. He's just as eager to ignore abortion, even though Maryland is among the states that will vote on an abortion referendum this fall — a winning issue for Democrats in red and blue states alike where ballot questions have appeared since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022.\nAdvertisement\nDemocrats suggest he would support a federal abortion ban, but Hogan insisted in an interview that he would not.\nHe also said he strongly supports in-vitro fertilization and would introduce legislation to protect the practice, an apparent attempt to clarify his position after he declined to say in an Axios interview last month whether he would support such federal protections.\nHe also said he 'would consider voting for' a Maryland ballot measure this fall that would preserve abortion rights, although he argues that it's unnecessary.\nHogan said abortion doesn't comes up much on the campaign trail. He predicted it wouldn't be 'a deciding issue' in the election.\nAsked about the issues that matter most to him, Hogan said he's most focused on ending the divisiveness in Washington, followed by the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, crime and the economy.\nAdvertisement\nBut Hogan largely avoided talking politics at all on his weekend bus tour, preferring to connect with voters on a personal level. He was eager to jump behind restaurant counters to chat with the kitchen staff or pose for pictures welcoming small business owners. And voters, regardless of their party affiliation, embraced him enthusiastically at nearly every stop.\nLanda Mitchell, a 46-year-old old African American woman from Hanover, Maryland, flagged down the governor as he toured small business booths at a weekend boat show. She had met him years ago at a fundraiser for the homeless.\nMitchell said she's not a Republican, but she'd likely vote for Hogan.\n'He's not far right wing. He's over there, but he's not far far over there,' Mitchell said with a laugh, adding that she's not sure whether she'll support President Joe Biden this fall because of the state of the economy. 'I'm far from a Trump supporter, but I go into the grocery store today and I cry.'\nAdvertisement\nCaroline County Sheriff Donald Baker, who welcomed Hogan on a tour through his office, said he also appreciates the former governor's strong support for law enforcement, noting that the sheriff's office didn't get a single applicant for a recent job posting.\n'It's gonna be a tough road for him to navigate,' Baker said of Hogan's political challenge. 'If anybody can do it, I believe Larry Hogan can do it. Why? Because he is a middle-of-the-road kind of guy. He knows how to work with people.'\nAnd as Democrats fight to link him to Trump's Republican Party, Hogan will take pains to distance himself from Trump — but not too far.\n'We don't want to alienate Trump voters,' Hogan told the AP. 'We need Trump voters. And we need a lot of Biden voters. Maryland is tough.'\nBut he doesn't expect Trump or any other MAGA celebrities to campaign in Maryland on his behalf in the coming months. He said he's not sure if he'll even attend this summer's Republican National Convention, where Trump will formally become the GOP presidential nominee; Hogan skipped Trump's last two nominating conventions as well.\n'I don't think Trump would help me at all. I ran 46 points ahead of him,' Hogan said, noting that Trump lost Maryland in 2020 by a bigger margin than any other state in the nation. 'I don't think he needs to campaign in Maryland.'\n___",

He pushed to turn the Ukraine aid into a loan, prompting Republicans to include a loan requirement in Saturday's legislation, with some caveats.\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on X that he was 'grateful' to the House, 'both parties, and personally Speaker Mike Johnson for the decision that keeps history on the right track.'\nAdvertisement\nJohnson, who has evolved on the issue of Ukraine, was defiant in his decision to move ahead on funding the foreign ally in a bipartisan manner even though there were 'critics of the legislation.'\n'It is not a perfect piece of legislation.

'\nHouse Republicans have become increasingly wary of sending money to Ukraine, arguing that U.S. funds are better spent on domestic issues such as controlling the southern border. Johnson also advanced a harsh bill to crack down on immigration at the southern border, but it failed after three hard line Republicans rejected a procedural motion in the House Rules Committee.\nAdvertisement\nJohnson took a risk by moving forward on the aid package, aware that it could trigger Greene to expedite consideration of her motion to toss him aside.

And maybe the people here don't want to admit it, but it's pretty darn obvious to me he's not going to get there.'\nWhen asked Saturday if he believed he would still be speaker by November, Johnson simply said, 'Yes.'",

Other GOP lawmakers have openly complained about Johnson's leadership.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'You are seriously out of step with Republicans by continuing to pass bills dependent on Democrats,' Greene wrote on the social platform X. 'Everyone sees through this.'\nIn an effort to satisfy conservatives, Johnson said he would hold a separate vote on a border security package that contains most of a bill that was already passed by House Republicans last year. But conservatives quickly denounced that plan as insufficient. Rep. Chip Roy of Texas called the strategy a 'complete failure.'",

Glenn Youngkin and leading Virginia Democrats are heading into the unknown territory of a state budget do-over.\nweek, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and leading Virginia Democrats are heading into the unknown territory of a state budget do-over. Youngkin and the Democratic-controlled legislature struck an 11th-hour truce on Wednesday to avert a standoff that could have triggered a state government shutdown and tarnished Virginia's stellar bond rating. While most of the attention was on the budget they set aside that day, legislators also sent a host of bills back to Youngkin after stripping them of his amendments, which in some cases had rewritten, delayed or gutted the measures.\ndelayed or gutted the measures.\nNow Youngkin must decide whether to sign the bills in their original form, let them become law without his signature or veto them. That means certain Democratic priorities — including bills to promote safe gun storage by parents of school-age children, ensure access to contraception and end tax breaks for Confederate heritage groups — could remain on the table over the next month as Youngkin and legislators try to hammer out a deal on a two-year state spending plan.\nAdvertisement\nYoungkin has so far signaled willingness to negotiate on only one of those bills, one that would allow slot machine-style 'skill games' in convenience stores across the state, and had bipartisan support. He is widely expected to veto most of the rest, extending a record-smashing spree that had him nixing more bills in one year — 153 — than the 120 that the previous record-holder, Democrat Terry McAuliffe, issued in his four years as governor.\nand had bipartisan support. He is widely expected to veto most of the rest, extending a record-smashing spree that had him nixing more bills in one year — 153 — than the 120 that the previous record-holder, Democrat Terry McAuliffe, issued in his four years as governor.\nWhat's less clear is whether those anticipated vetoes could upset the fragile peace between Youngkin and Democratic leaders as they try to hammer out a budget deal in time for a May 13 special session. Continued haggling over skill games also could have an impact on budget talks.\nYoungkin and Democrats had been at each other's throats for the past month over the budget and other bills, lobbing harsh rhetoric on social media and in rival statewide tours. Youngkin kicked things off in March by skewering the bipartisan spending plan as a 'backward budget' and the rhetoric only cranked up from there, with House Speaker Don L. Scott Jr. (D-Portsmouth) lambasting 'Pretending Glenn' in a video released on the eve of Wednesday's reconvened session.\nlambasting 'Pretending Glenn' in a video released on the eve of Wednesday's reconvened session.\nAdvertisement\nYoungkin and legislators said they called a time out on the budget to cool partisan passions.\n'I think there's a real path for us to move forward and find common ground,' Youngkin said at a bill signing Thursday.\nSenate Majority Leader Scott A. Surovell (D-Fairfax) said he was ready to move forward with budget talks even as he expects Youngkin to kill many of the bills sent back to him.\n'If the governor holds true to form — unless he's found a new spirit of conciliation — there's probably going to be another couple dozen vetoes,' he said in an interview Thursday.\nStill, it's not hard to imagine tensions bubbling up when the veto pen comes out again to put the last nail in certain Democratic priorities.\nNot 24 hours before they called their time out, Scott sharply criticized Youngkin for amending bills to close tax loopholes for Confederate heritage groups. Youngkin's proposed changes would essentially kick the can down the road — requiring that the bills be voted on again next year and calling for a study.\nAdvertisement\n'The governor doesn't have the courage just to veto it,' Scott, the first African American to serve as Virginia House speaker, told a small gathering of reporters Tuesday afternoon. 'He waters it down to nothing. Dude, show who you are. Veto the bill. We're not giving you a break. We're going to reject those amendments and send it back and you can veto it and show us that you stand with the Confederacy.'\nIn the same gathering, Scott also lambasted Youngkin's rewrite of the skill games legislation as overly aggressive.\nScott flatly dismissed one particular amendment to the bill — prohibiting the games within a 35-mile radius of casinos and other gambling venues, which would exclude them from most of the state's population centers — as 'a dumb idea.'\nYoungkin's office declined to comment on Scott's remarks.\nAdvertisement\nThe governor said Thursday that he was willing to negotiate on the skill games bill — specifically noting the 'perimeter policies,' a reference to the 35-mile provision as well as a requirement that they be located more than 2,500 feet — little under a half mile — from any K-12 school, day-care center or house of worship.\nYoungkin did not rule out delving into other areas of the bill. Offering to negotiate any aspect of it is extraordinary at this point in the legislative calendar. Any changes would have to be written into the budget or handled in an entirely new bill, which could be introduced during the special session if rules are drawn to allow for its consideration.\nSkill games — which look and operate much like video-style slot machines but are said to involve an element of skill — were one of the hardest-fought issues of the session. Advocates called them a lifeline for mom-and-pop convenience stores while critics warned they would turn corner stores into mini casinos.\nAdvertisement\nThe General Assembly ultimately sent an industry-friendly measure to Youngkin, whose amendments amounted to a wholesale rewrite calling for stricter oversight, capping the number of machines at 20,000 statewide, giving localities the authority to ban the machines and imposing a 35 percent tax on game revenue. Lobbyists on opposing sides have said the wording on the tax was unclear and could amount to a 45 percent tax.\nSen. Aaron R. Rouse (D-Virginia Beach), who sponsored the skill games bill, said he does not see it as a bargaining chip in budget negotiations, but he senses an opportunity for some changes.\nThere are lots of unknowns as Youngkin and a handful of legislative leaders — from both parties and both chambers — prepare to hammer out differences in the amount of taxing and spending to include in the two-year state spending plan. The way out of their stalemate won't be entirely clear until early May, when the state's next revenue report clarifies how large of a budget surplus might be available to spend on priorities.\nAdvertisement\n'All of that is yet to be determined as we start our work. We'll take it into consideration,' House Appropriations Chairman Luke E. Torian (D-Prince William) said Friday.\nStaff for the House, Senate and governor will begin meeting next week and then the principals will get together after April 29, Torian said. That will give the elected officials 'a breather' and a chance to clear their schedules, he said.\nThat will give the elected officials 'a breather' and a chance to clear their schedules, he said.\nAmong the bills sent back to Youngkin for him to veto, sign or allow to become law without his signature:\nVirginia Beach charter change\nBoth the House and Senate rejected Youngkin's proposed amendment to a charter change for the city of Virginia Beach, with one of the measure's sponsors saying the governor is trying to interfere with the city's self-governance. The state's most populous city changed its method for electing city council members in 2022, switching from candidates running for citywide, at-large seats to a system of 10 districts and one at-large mayor. The new plan produced the most diverse city council in Virginia Beach's history.\nAdvertisement\nBut it requires a charter change to become permanent, and Youngkin's amendment would block the charter change unless the General Assembly approved it again next year. Supporters, including the NAACP, say the delay is unacceptable because the city faces council elections this fall. Del. Kelly K. Convirs-Fowler (D-Virginia Beach) on Wednesday questioned why Youngkin would intervene, noting that for the past 30 years, governors have always deferred to the wishes of a locality when it comes to charters.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'The governor is trying to override the will of the people,' Convirs-Fowler said. The charter change had passed the House of Delegates by a required two-thirds margin and was unanimously approved in the Senate.\nAccess to contraception\nThe House and Senate also rejected Youngkin's proposed amendments to two pairs of bills aimed at ensuring people have access to contraceptives. One pair of identical bills — HB609 and SB237 — would put a right to obtain and use contraception into Virginia law. Youngkin proposed changing the bill to simply express the sentiment of the legislature that people have access to contraception under federal law, which contraception advocates said would have no meaning if federal law changed. 'The governor basically gutted the entire bill and just made it into a [policy] statement,' said Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi (D-Chesterfield), who sponsored the Senate measure. The House and Senate both simply 'passed by' the proposed amendment, leaving them to die without a vote.\nThe House and Senate both simply 'passed by' the proposed amendment, leaving them to die without a vote.\nAdvertisement\nThe other pair of identical bills — HB819 and SB238 — would require health insurance plans to provide coverage of contraceptives. Youngkin proposed changing those bills to carve out an exception for nongovernmental plan sponsors with a religious or ethical objection to contraception. Del. Candi Mundon King (D-Prince William), who sponsored the House version of that bill, objected that Youngkin's change would create 'a vague, broad exception to this bill that has the potential to actually leading to less people having access to contraceptives.' The House voted 15-84 to reject Youngkin's change. The Senate rejected Youngkin's change to its version of the bill on a party-line vote.\nSafe firearms storage",

If so, sign up here. You can also hear Aaron's Campaign Moment podcast weekly on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.)\nThe big moment\nA former president of the United States is on criminal trial for the first time in American history as of this week. It's been a long time coming.\nAnd while the early proceedings in Donald Trump's Manhattan 'hush money'/election-interference case have been somewhat sleepy — quite literally if you're Trump — the stage is being set for one of the most consequential legal clashes in American political history. As a quick reminder: The case has to do with hush money payments Trump's lawyer made to an adult-film actress to keep her quiet weeks ahead of the November 2016 election and whether he falsified business records to cover it up.\nAdvertisement\nYou can read the blow-by-blow of all the significant legal maneuverings during jury selection from Monday, Tuesday and Thursday.\nAs for the politics? Here are my early thoughts.\nTrump's antics threaten to boil over, with major political — and societal — implications.\nTrump's antics threaten to boil over, with major political — and societal — implications.\nThe verdict is obviously important, for reasons we'll get to. But how we get there could also reverberate greatly.\nThe trial is quickly shaping up to be the culmination of Trump's years-long assault on a justice system that has long scrutinized him. And there's increasing reason to believe the situation could get ugly:\nWe're already seeing how all of this could matter. A juror whose biographical details were aired by media outlets — and scrutinized by Watters — raised concerns Thursday, citing how people were able to identify her. (Jurors in the case are being kept anonymous.) She was dismissed from the panel.\nThe play here is obvious. Trump wants to make clear that he will make life hard for anybody who might help deliver an adverse verdict. And Trump will push limits in ways that leaves the judge in the case with some very difficult decisions; imagine a situation in which the judge feels compelled to actually jail Trump. (As has been noted, Trump's actions probably wouldn't be tolerated by basically any other defendant.)\nAdvertisement\nTo the extent this can be turned into a circus, perhaps people will dismiss it. Or perhaps it will draw even more interest and people will see in Trump's actions what they previously found unappealing in him.\nAmericans by and large don't buy into Trump's claims that this is a 'witch hunt,' as I wrote this week. But even some who don't believe that do harbor some concerns about the process, and this case in particular . Trump is now forcing the issue in a major way, and how Americans regard the legal process and his conduct could matter greatly.\neven some who don't believe that do harbor some concerns about the process, and this case in particular. Trump is now forcing the issue in a major way, and how Americans regard the legal process and his conduct could matter greatly.\nThis case is less of a threat than the others. But.\nThis case is less of a threat than the others. But.\nThis case is objectively the one that Americans are the least concerned about. A poll this week showed just one-third thought Trump had broken the law — double-digits less than in his other three indictments. And about the same number regard the charges as 'very serious.'\nAdvertisement\nBut voters are also being reminded about a situation they have overwhelmingly found to be unsavory. About 8 in 10 said Trump at least did something wrong when the 2016 hush money payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels were first in the news back in 2018. And polling has shown as many as 7 in 10 say it's a crime to pay someone to remain silent about an issue that could affect an election (which is basically the substance of the charges).\nAlso, even that Associated Press-NORC poll showed 50 percent of voters said a conviction in this case would render Trump unfit for office. Just 29 percent said it wouldn't matter.\nWe've also seen in polls that a potentially decisive number of Americans say they'd flip their votes if Trump is convicted of a crime. Whether that would hold — and on this case, specifically — is a huge question.\nAdvertisement\nDemocrats' hands-off approach could be tested.\nDemocrats' hands-off approach could be tested.\nThere is a remarkable asymmetry in the political debate over Trump's criminal trial. While Trump and his allies are all over it, Democrats and the Biden campaign are basically ignoring it.\nAbout the closest the Biden campaign has come to weighing in was a news release this week which slyly included the words 'stormy' and 'hush' and alluded to Trump nodding off. But it was about abortion.\nThis is all in keeping with Democrats' general approach to Trump's criminal cases. While Republicans have leaped to decry things such as Trump's indictments and the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022 — often before they know much of anything about the situations — Democrats have generally been content to merely say that 'no one is above the law' and leave it at that.\nAdvertisement\nBut that's going to be tested moving forward. The legal system is limited in how it can defend itself, with litigators and judges generally letting their work and courtroom remarks speak for themselves. And at some point, you'd think Democrats would want to drive home Trump's behavior at the trial and how it's symptomatic of his chaotic presidency.\nOf course, they also might not want to bet too heavily on the outcome of a trial the American people haven't shown they're overly concerned about.\nA momentous — and somewhat counterintuitive — poll\nOne of the most consequential facets of the 2024 election is how Americans have warmed to Trump's first term. Call it 'amnesia' or anything else, but it's a significant factor. To the extent people continue to remember the grass being greener, that's likely to weigh significantly on who wins in November.\nAdvertisement\nBut it will apparently only take Trump so far.\nA new Yahoo News/YouGov poll provides some interesting findings on this front. It finds 49 percent of people retrospectively approve of Trump's presidency — higher than that number was at virtually any juncture of his actual presidency — and just 40 percent approve of President Biden's. Voters were more likely by double digits to say Trump accomplished things than that Biden did. And asked to choose directly whether they were better off under Trump or Biden, voters chose Trump 45 percent to 34 percent.\nAnd yet! The poll shows the race deadlocked — 44-44 in a head-to-head, and 42-42 if you include third-party candidates.\nPart of that imbalance is probably polarization and Democrats not being enthusiastic about Biden's presidency — but still opposing Trump. But it's logical to think it might also owe to Trump's legal problems and other personal factors.\nWhatever the case, it's worth keeping an eye on — particularly if Democrats can, in fact, drive home what voters disliked about Trump before and drive the above numbers down.",

Mitt Romney (R-Utah) — has said he plans to vote against a full trial. Several others who have been critical of the impeachment have yet to stake out their position, including Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska).\nAdvertisement\nThe two impeachment articles, which charge Mayorkas of 'willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law' and breach of the public trust, will be delivered to the Senate after a ceremonial walk across the Capitol.

It's unclear whether Schumer will move to table or dismiss the case, a maneuver that requires 51 votes to pass.\nJohnson responded Tuesday to Schumer's remarks, calling him the 'only impediment to delivering accountability for the American people.'\nAdvertisement\n'Pursuant to the Constitution, the House demands a trial,' Johnson added.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nSenate Republicans are divided on how to best influence the process, with some promising to stage procedural roadblocks to prevent a quick dismissal and try to hold Democrats accountable for the record-breaking levels of migration at the southern U.S. border.

            "summary": "MADISON, Wis. — The Republican candidate in Wisconsin's closely watched U.S. Senate race emphasized this week that he doesn't oppose elderly people voting after initially saying that 'almost nobody in a nursing home' is at a point in life where they are capable of voting.\nEric Hovde faces Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin in the race that is essential for Democrats to win in order to maintain their majority in the Senate. A Marquette University Law School poll this week showed the race is about even among likely voters.\nBaldwin and Democrats have been attacking Hovde over comments he first made April 5 on a Fox News radio show about nursing home voting. Who can vote in a nursing home, and how they cast their ballots, has been a hot issue in Wisconsin since 2020 when supporters of former President Donald Trump alleged that people were voting illegally.\nAdvertisement\nNo charges were brought, and President Joe Biden's victory over Trump has withstood a nonpartisan audit, numerous lawsuits, a partial recount and a review by a conservative law firm.\nBut Hovde has been raising the issue of nursing home voting when discussing what he said were problems with the 2020 election.\n'We had nursing homes where the sheriff of Racine investigated, where you had 100 percent voting in nursing homes,' Hovde said.\nThat claim of 100% voting in nursing homes, first made by former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman in a discredited report, has never been verified. Voting data has shown that participation in nursing homes across the state was much lower than 100%.\n'If you're in a nursing home, you only have a five, six-month life expectancy,' Hovde said last week on the 'Guy Benson Show.' 'Almost nobody in a nursing home is in a point to vote.'\nAdvertisement\nBaldwin, in reaction to Hovde's comments, said last week that 'thousands of Wisconsinites live in nursing homes.'\n'Eric Hovde does not have a clue what he's talking about,' she said on MSNBC.\nIn two subsequent interviews this week, when asked to clarify his comments in the wake of Democratic criticism, Hovde accused his opponents and the media of 'political hits.'\n'They tried to say I didn't want elderly people to vote,' Hovde said Monday on WISN-AM. 'I don't even know how they came up with that.'\nHovde reiterated that his issue was based on reports of people who questioned how their severely ill relatives in nursing homes had voted.\nRacine County Sheriff Christopher Shmaling, a Trump backer, said in 2021 that the families of eight residents told investigators they believed their love ones did not have the capacity to vote but ballots were cast for them.\nAdvertisement\nHovde this week said 'a large percentage' of nursing home residents 'are not in the mental capacity to (vote).'\nBut he said that does not mean he thinks elderly people should not be allowed to vote.\n'I think elderly should absolutely vote,' he said Wednesday on WSAU-AM.\nNursing home voting became a focus for Trump supporters following his narrow loss in Wisconsin in 2020.\nState law requires local election clerks to send so-called special voting deputies to nursing homes to give residents an opportunity to vote.\nThe Wisconsin Elections Commission, in a bipartisan 5-1 vote in March 2020, determined that poll workers could not be sent into nursing homes to help with voting due to a safer-at-home order issued by Gov. Tony Evers early in the COVID-19 pandemic. The order came at a time when nursing homes were severely limiting who could come into their facilities, often not even allowing immediate family members inside.\nAdvertisement\nAn audit by the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau determined that the elections commission broke the law when it told clerks not to send or attempt to send deputies into nursing homes.\nSchmaling, the sheriff and a Trump backer, called for criminal charges against the commissioners who voted not to send in voting deputies. But the Racine County district attorney declined to charge, citing lack of jurisdiction. The Milwaukee County district attorney also declined to charge two commissioners in his county, saying there was a lack of evidence that a crime was committed.",

They are alleged to have approached members of the European Parliament and offered them money to promote Russian propaganda.\nU.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a hidden campaign to influence the 2016 race in favor of Donald Trump over Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton, with Russian operatives hacking Democratic emails and facilitating their release in the run-up to the election.\nMore recently, they concluded that Putin had authorized influence operations in the 2020 election aimed at denigrating Joe Biden, boosting Trump, undermining confidence in the vote and exacerbating social divisions in the U.S. Trump and Putin have dismissed such findings.\nAdvertisement\nAsked which politicians might have been bribed in Europe, De Croo said: 'I don't want to be in a position where I have information about political opponents. If that were the case, it would not be a good thing. That could undermine the credibility of everything our security services are doing.\n'There is someone who is trying to influence, and there are people who allow themselves to be influenced, and when there is money involved, we must be able to take action,' he said at the summit, which is the last such meeting planned before the elections.\nDe Croo said that while the money had changed hands outside of Belgium, the political influence was happening in his country. Belgium currently holds the EU's rotating presidency and is home to the bloc's institutions as well as the headquarters of NATO.\nAdvertisement\nHe and Fiala want their partners to beef up the mandate of Europe's anti-fraud agency and the EU public prosecutors' office.

            "summary": "RICHMOND — Democratic leaders and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) remain at loggerheads as Virginia lawmakers return to the state Capitol on Wednesday to take action on the budget and other bills the governor has proposed changing, barreling toward a June 30 deadline to adopt a two-year spending plan or begin shutting down the state government.\nDemocrats have said repeatedly in recent days that they are in no mood to compromise with Youngkin, who welcomed the legislature's budget in March by calling it 'backward' and going on a tour around the state proclaiming how misguided it was. Since the governor unveiled a package of 233 proposed amendments on April 8 that essentially rewrote the spending plan the General Assembly passed with bipartisan support, Democrats who control both chambers of the legislature have reacted angrily.\n'We passed [an] on-time, structurally sound, balanced budget, which is required of us by the constitution,' House Speaker Don L. Scott Jr. (D-Portsmouth) said Tuesday in remarks to a small group of reporters. 'The governor immediately then began to run a campaign against the budget, a full-fledged campaign. … He's not a middle-ground, bipartisan governor. He has been an extreme — I call him MAGA-in-disguise — governor.'\nAdvertisement\nOn Tuesday, Scott debuted a sharp message of his own with an ad on social media, touting elements of the General Assembly's budget and urging residents not to 'let Pretending Glenn shut down the government.' Scott said his message was different from Youngkin's because it was aimed at setting the record straight about what the legislature's budget would deliver for the state.\na sharp message of his own with an ad on social media, touting elements of the General Assembly's budget and urging residents not to 'let Pretending Glenn shut down the government.' Scott said his message was different from Youngkin's because it was aimed at setting the record straight about what the legislature's budget would deliver for the state.\nA spokesman for Youngkin declined to comment on the ad or Scott's remarks.\nThe most likely outcome Wednesday, according to interviews with several lawmakers on both sides of the aisle: Democrats reject all of Youngkin's major proposals and send their budget back to him. He then could become the first governor in modern Virginia history to veto an entire budget. Youngkin would probably call a special legislative session so lawmakers could start all over, racing to get a budget plan finished before the new fiscal year starts July 1.

'This is new territory for us all, and it should be interesting. This place never fails to surprise.'\nIn addition to his proposed budget changes, Youngkin issued a record 153 vetoes — more in one year than the 120 the next most veto-heavy governor, Democrat Terry McAuliffe, issued in his entire four-year term. Democrats said over the past few days that they probably don't have enough Republican support to muster the two-thirds majorities needed to override those vetoes, which included legislation to create a legal market for recreational marijuana, raise the minimum wage, and prevent other states where abortion is illegal from extraditing someone who has or performs the procedure legally in Virginia.\n120 the next most veto-heavy governor, Democrat Terry McAuliffe, issued in his entire four-year term.

He proposed eliminating the Assembly's plan to expand the sales tax to digital downloads — an idea that Youngkin initially proposed — and in return offered to retreat from his own insistence on tax cuts, which were dead anyway because lawmakers left them out of the budget.\nAdvertisement\nHe also said he would accept the legislature's plan to increase spending in several key areas, including providing 3 percent pay raises in each of the next two years for public school teachers and state employees, increasing funding for higher education and boosting the state's contribution to the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority, though at a lower level than the General Assembly approved. Youngkin argued that Virginia can afford those expenditures without raising taxes.\nAs if to underscore that point, the administration released a monthly revenue estimate Tuesday evening that showed tax collections up and the state surging toward a surplus of funds. As of March, state coffers are on track for a surplus of more than $1 billion for the year, Youngkin's office said.\nevening that showed tax collections up and the state surging toward a surplus of funds.

His plan for Metro, for instance, boosts the state's contribution by tapping into federal dollars that had been set aside for localities in Northern Virginia — an approach several Democrats said was not acceptable.\nDemocratic leaders who accuse Youngkin of divisive rhetoric and aggressive treatment of their bills see him as punishing them for rejecting his plan to build a $2 billion, publicly financed arena in Alexandria for the Washington Wizards and Capitals.

Surovell (D-Fairfax) told The Washington Post on Monday.\nAdvertisement\nSurovell characterized Youngkin's amendments as not just aggressive but also as a misreading of his role in government. 'The governor seems to approach governor's amendments as if he's an actual member of the legislature,' he said, noting that Youngkin had essentially rewritten the budget and introduced new concepts to some bills after it was too late to vet them through the 'committee process and take broad input into whether it's good policy or not.'\nOne example: complex legislation to allow slot machine-like 'skill games' in convenience stores that Youngkin drastically rewrote, suggesting amendments that effectively ban the games in many metropolitan areas.\nSome Democrats have fanned the rhetorical flames. In addition to Scott's digital ad, Senate Finance and Appropriations Chairwoman L. Louise Lucas (D-Portsmouth), who often mocks Youngkin on X, last week posted cartoon images of the governor giving up on the arena, which she dubbed the 'Glenn Dome,' and 'tax cuts for the rich.'

Amendments to bills are a bit more complicated.\nIf a simple majority of both chambers approves all amendments on a bill, it becomes law as amended with no further action. If legislators approve some or none of the amendments, the bill goes back to Youngkin with only the amendments they have accepted for him to sign or veto. The governor gets the last word, since the General Assembly does not get another chance to override him.\nBut the legislature can head off a potential veto by taking a second vote on a bill after rejecting some or all of the governor's amendments. A legislator would have to make a motion to enroll the bill as law 'notwithstanding the governor's [anticipated] veto.' If that motion wins a two-thirds vote in both houses, the measure becomes law.\nAdvertisement\nTwo bills that could be ripe for a challenge, according to several legislators: the skill-games bill that the governor rewrote, and a measure that would allow localities to impose a 1 percent local sales tax to fund school construction, a bipartisan bill that Youngkin vetoed.\nBut reconciling the positions staked out by both sides on the budget is going to take more time than is available in Wednesday's session, even if it extends for more than one day, said Stanley, the Republican senator.

He predicted one change: The new budget might find ways to spend about $100 million freed up by Youngkin's vetoes.\n'It's not going to get any better,' Deeds said of the next spending plan. 'It could get worse from his perspective.'\nThe Virginia Constitution gives the legislature 10 days to take up the governor's vetoes and amendments, but it is rare for the reconvened session to extend beyond one day.

The California Retailers Association said it's challenging to quantify the issue in California because many stores don't share their data.\nAdvertisement\nCrime data shows the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles saw a steady increase in shoplifting between 2021 and 2022, according to a study by the non-partisan Public Policy Institute of California. Across the state, shoplifting rates rose during the same time period but were still lower than the pre-pandemic levels in 2019, while commercial burglaries and robberies have become more prevalent in urban counties, the study says.\nThe ballot measure would create harsher penalties for repeat shoplifters and fentanyl dealers. Shoplifters would be charged with a felony, regardless of the amount stolen, if they have at least two prior theft convictions. It also would create a new drug court treatment program for those with multiple drug possession convictions, among other things. More than 800 people died from fentanyl overdoses in San Francisco last year, a record for the city.\nCalifornia's approach to crime is poised to be a major political issue in November's election. Beyond the ballot measure, Democratic San Francisco Mayor London Breed faces a tough reelection bid against competitors who say she's allowed the city to spiral out of control. Meanwhile, Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price faces a recall election, and Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón faces a challenger who has criticized his progressive approach to crime and punishment.\nAdvertisement\nTop Democratic state leaders, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, have repeatedly shut down calls to repeal Proposition 47. Newsom argued California already has tools to sufficiently go after criminals and urged lawmakers to bolster existing laws and go after motor vehicle thefts and resellers of stolen merchandise. Lawmakers have introduced a slew of bills aiming to tackle retail theft and online resellers.\nThe ballot measure campaign, which has raised at least $5.4 million as of early April, is mostly funded by large retailers. It has received $2.5 million from Walmart, $1 million from Home Depot and $500,000 from Target. The measure also has support from district attorneys and more than 30 local elected officials — including Breed and San Jose's Democratic mayor.\nLana Negrete, vice mayor of Santa Monica and a business owner, said she's considering closing down her family's two music stores in the area after nine smash-and-grabs in the last four years. Negrete, a Democrat, said she voted for Proposition 47 and supported its progressive approach, but the measure has allowed for some criminals to skirt punishments while businesses are hurting.\nAdvertisement\n'Nobody's being held accountable,' Negrete said. 'We've been robbed by the same person more than once, and that person, under the current structure and criminal justice system now, is walking the streets free.'\nHer 52-year-old family business has lost more than $300,000 in merchandise loss and building repairs in the last few years, Negrete said. Some have advised Negrete start hiring armed security.\n'We teach music lessons to children, I don't need to have a guard in front of my store,' she said. 'That's not how it was when we started this business, and it's sad to see it go that way.'",

Both state offices are overseen by Democrats.\nAdvertisement\nSmith submitted his resignation to Turning Point Action on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about it publicly. Smith also publicly ended his reelection campaign.\nSmith did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn a statement, the first-term lawmaker said the allegations against him were 'silly' and part of a 'coordinated attack' by Democrats and 'those unhappy with my politics.'\nSmith is aligned with some of the most conservative members of the Arizona House — sometimes referred to as the 'Freedom Caucus' of the larger Republican caucus — and he has previously derided signature verification work by local election officials as 'a joke.' During his time with Turning Point Action, Smith worked to support the candidacies of conservatives who spread false information about elections. At a rally in Washington on Jan. 5, 2021, Smith tweeted a photo of himself speaking to 'thousands of patriots.' In that since-deleted tweet, he urged followers: 'Don't get comfortable' and to 'fight like hell.' The next day, as Congress met to certify the 2020 election results, the U.S. Capitol came under attack.\nAdvertisement\nSmith said the prospect of costly and public fallout from the allegations shaped his decision to drop out of the race.\n'The recommendation I received most was that I bow out and live to fight another day,' Smith said in a statement posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. 'I might be confident of victory, but all it would take is a judge believing any one person, and all would be lost. … To be better protected in the future, if and when I run again for something, I'll rely exclusively on the online signature system, and eliminate paper petitions from my campaign. Then no one can make up any stories.'\nThe complaint alleges that Smith submitted multiple pages that contain dozens of forged signatures that he claimed to have collected, and it contained images of two of those pages.\nAdvertisement\nSmith's withdrawal drew immediate reaction from members of his own party, some of whom faced death threats and harassment for upholding the will of voters — and Republican losses — during the 2020 and 2022 elections.\nMaricopa County Supervisor Clint Hickman (R), who lives in Smith's district west of Phoenix, cast Smith as a hypocrite. Hickman rejected attempts by Trump to talk to him in the weeks after the then-president narrowly lost the 2020 election. Hickman has faced death threats, protests at his home and threats against his family. On Thursday, he called on Smith to resign from office.",

            "summary": "Six months after a deadly mass shooting by an Army reservist, Maine lawmakers this week passed a wide-ranging package of new gun restrictions.\nThree months after a fatal school shooting, Iowa lawmakers this week passed legislation allowing trained teachers and staff to carry guns on school property.\nTwo states. Two tragedies. Two different approaches to improving public safety.\n'We live in two different Americas, in essence,' said Daniel Webster, a health policy professor affiliated with the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions.\n'We see terrible acts of gun violence; no one wants them, of course,' Webster said. 'But we see this through different lenses.'\nLegislatures in about 20 states already have passed measures this year to expand gun rights or restrict access to firearms. Dozens more proposals are pending. The divide continues a trend seen last year, when more than half the states enacted firearms legislation, with Democrats generally favoring more limits and Republicans more freedoms for gun owners.\nLIMITS ON GUNS IN MAINE\nMaine has a tradition of hunting and gun ownership. But after an Army reservist killed 18 people and wounded 13 others in Lewiston, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills called for a variety of new laws aimed at preventing dangerous people from possessing guns and strengthening mental health services.\nAdvertisement\nBefore adjourning its 2024 session early Thursday, lawmakers approved measures imposing a 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases, expanding background checks on private gun sales and criminalizing sales to certain prohibited people. They also passed a ban on devices that convert semi-automatic firearms into rapid-firing weapons like machine guns, and enhanced an existing law that allows judges to temporarily remove guns from people during a mental health crisis.\nA gun safety coalition praised it as a significant step forward in response to constituents' concerns after the Lewiston shooting. But Republican state Sen. Lisa Keim criticized colleagues for 'using the tragedy to advance legislation' that had been unable to pass previously.\nGUNS IN IOWA SCHOOLS\nIn Perry, Iowa, a school principal and sixth-grade student died and several others were wounded when a 17-year-old student opened fire in January.\nAdvertisement\nA 2021 state law already allowed schools to authorize individuals to carry firearms, though some districts have not done so because of concerns about insurance coverage.\nThe legislation given final approval Monday by the Republican-led Legislature builds upon the prior law by allowing teachers and staff who undergo gun safety training to get a professional permit to carry guns in schools. If they do, they would be protected from criminal or civil liability for use of reasonable force.\nThe legislation also requires large school districts to station a police officer or private security guard at each high school, unless the school board votes not to do so. Most of those school districts already have security staff.\nDIVERGING STATE LAWS\nRepublican-led legislatures in Kentucky, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee and Utah also passed measures this year that would expand the ability of some people to bring guns into schools. A bill passed in Wyoming allots $480,000 to reimburse schools for the cost of training employees to carry guns on school property.\nAdvertisement\nLouisiana and South Carolina, led by Republican lawmakers and governors, each enacted laws allowing people to carry concealed guns without a permit. The National Rifle Association, which supported the measures, said similar laws now exist in 29 states.\nBy contrast, the Democrat-led Delaware Legislature passed legislation requiring people wanting to buy a handgun to first be fingerprinted, undergo training and obtain a state permit.\nNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, signed a pair of new laws imposing restrictions. One sets a seven-day waiting period to purchase firearms — more than double the three-day period required by the federal government for a background check.\nAnother new law in New Mexico prohibits carrying firearms within 100 feet (30 meters) of polling places, with an exemption for concealed-carry permit holders. Voting site restrictions on guns now exist in about one-third of the states and Washington, D.C., according to the gun-violence prevention group Giffords.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBUCKING PARTY TRENDS\nNot all new gun policies diverge along partisan lines.\nAdvertisement\nRepublican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin this year vetoed 30 gun-related bills passed by the Democratic-led General Assembly that he said would have trampled on constitutional rights. Yet Youngkin also signed some gun restrictions: One bans devices that convert semi-automatic handguns into automatic weapons. Another allows felony charges against parents who let a child have access to a firearm after being notified the child poses a threat of violence.\nWhile signing several gun rights measures, Republican Gov. Mark Gordon of Wyoming also vetoed legislation that would have allowed people to carry concealed guns in public schools and government meetings. Gordon cited concerns the bill could have exceeded the separation of powers provision in the state constitution.\nAnd in some cases, high-profile shootings have prompted lawmakers to avoid taking action on proposals they might otherwise have considered.\nAdvertisement\nMissouri's Republican-led House had been prepared to debate bills exempting guns and ammunition from sales taxes and allowing people with concealed-carry permits to bring guns onto public transportation. But after the deadly shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl celebration, House Majority Leader Jon Patterson said those bills would not be brought up this year.\n___",

            "summary": "NEW YORK — Donald Trump plans to visit New York's Harlem neighborhood Tuesday after spending his second day in a lower Manhattan courtroom as a criminal defendant.\nTrump was expected to stop by Sanaa Convenient Store, a tiny bodega that sells chips, sodas and other snacks. Trump aides said the former president and current Republican nominee chose the store because it has been the site of a violent attack on an employee. He will also highlight consumer inflation under President Joe Biden, aides said.\nThe visit would be Trump's first campaign appearance since his criminal hush money trial began, making the presumptive GOP nominee the first former president in U.S. history to stand criminal trial.\nTrump will be confined to the courtroom on most days, dramatically limiting his movements and his ability to campaign, fundraise and make calls. Aides have been planning rallies and other political events on weekends and Wednesdays, the one weekday when court is not supposed to be in session. Plans also include local appearances Trump can make after court recesses each day.\nAdvertisement\nTrump's stop in Harlem demonstrates the former president's determination to amplify familiar campaign arguments even within the strictures of being a criminal defendant.\nIn July 2022, Jose Alba, a clerk at the store in Hamilton Heights, a heavily Hispanic section of Harlem, was attacked by 35-year-old Austin Simon. The resulting altercation, captured on surveillance video, ended with Alba fatally stabbing Simon. Alba was arrested and charged with murder but the Manhattan district attorney dropped the charges within weeks, saying they could not prove Alba had not acted in self-defense.\nOn another evening in August 2022, according to the New York Post, owner Osamah Aldhabyani was in the store when a customer entered and an altercation between the two ensued. The customer was arrested, the newspaper reported.\nAdvertisement\nBefore his arrival, Trump's campaign distributed materials to journalists criticizing Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for his handling of the stabbing case, including the weeks Alba spent jailed at Rikers Island without bail. Bragg oversees the office now prosecuting Trump.\nThe former president's local appearance also affirms his intentions to campaign in his home state, even though New York remains overwhelmingly Democratic. In 2020, Biden garnered more than 60% of the vote in the state and ran up even wider margins in New York City. Trump insists he can win New York in November anyway, and he has mused about holding rallies in the South Bronx and Queens, where the former president was born and grew up, and even Madison Square Garden.\n'I may rent Madison Square Garden,' he said in an interview with Breitbart News. 'That's the belly of the beast, right?'\nAdvertisement\nThat would be a prohibitively expensive proposition, particularly as his campaign has worked to save cash as it confronts a fundraising gap with Biden.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'You know, the president is very keen on New York,' Chris LaCivita, Trump senior campaign adviser, told The Associated Press last month as he talked up the campaign's efforts to put more states in play. Still, LaCivita laughed when asked whether he agrees. 'I don't get out in front of the boss. I do what the boss says. The boss drives,' he said.\nTrump has argued that the ongoing influx of migrants to the city, where he grew his real estate empire and became a tabloid fixture, has made New Yorkers more willing to vote for him since his 2020 loss to Biden. The city has struggled to house the new arrivals, putting many up in city hotels.\n'I think we have a chance. New York has changed a lot in the last two years,' he told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo. 'The people of New York are angry. People that would have never voted for me because I'm a Republican — I mean they're Democrats ... I think they're going to vote for me. So I think we're going to give New York a heavy shot.'\nAdvertisement\nTrump cited the 2022 New York governor's race, when Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul prevailed over Republican former Rep. Lee Zeldin — but by a much tighter margin than usual for her party's statewide nominees.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a top Trump ally, said Monday that Trump will be campaigning all over the state while he's forced to be on trial in New York.\n'He's going to make the best out of this,' she said, adding that 'Democrats in New York and the judge and everyone, they're really going to regret it.'\nAt the least, Trump, long a famous figure for New Yorkers, showed Tuesday that he can still turn heads in the city.\n'Papito Trump is coming. Yeah!' said one passerby ahead of the former president's arrival.\nLesandra Carrion, 47, who lives in the neighborhood, came out to see the former president when she heard he might be visiting.\nAdvertisement\nShe said she doesn't agree with everything Trump says or does but declared that 'he speaks the truth.' Carrion cited the rising migrant population and strained city resources. 'I think that he will make a difference,' she said of Trump.\nAs for his troubles at the courthouse at the south end of Manhattan, Carrion was dismissive. 'He's going to beat that,' she said. 'We all make mistakes at the end of the day. But he's the truth and light. I feel that God is in him.'",

            "summary": "There are few issues in American politics as fraught and contested as the war in Gaza. While that's been true for months, tensions have been particularly acute this week: The conflict itself escalated with Israel striking targets in Iran late Thursday, while protests against Israel's military action in Gaza led to a tumultuous scene at New York's Columbia University.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nIt's worth stepping back from the extreme manifestations of the debate and, instead, considering how Americans broadly view the conflict. Recent polling offers insights: Americans are more likely to say they sympathize with the Israeli people than they are to say the same of the Palestinian people, but they've also grown more skeptical of the Israeli military effort. Most Americans say humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza should be maintained or increased; a third say that military aid to Israel should be decreased.\nGallup asked Americans their view of the Israeli action in November and last month. Half of respondents said they supported the action five months ago; now fewer than 4 in 10 do. That support is heavily concentrated among Republicans, two-thirds of whom approve of the military action. Even among Republicans, though, that support has fallen since November.\nMeanwhile, polling from YouGov in November and this month shows that support for a cease-fire has increased, albeit subtly. About two-thirds of Americans say they support a cease-fire at least somewhat, and just under half of them strongly support one. More than three-quarters of Democrats say they support a cease-fire at least somewhat; so do a majority of Republicans.\nThe recent YouGov poll, conducted for the Economist, also asked whether military aid to Israel and humanitarian aid to Palestinians should be increased or decreased. A plurality of respondents said humanitarian aid should be increased; a plurality also said that military aid should be decreased. There's a wide partisan split here, too, with Republicans diverging from both Democrats and independents in their views.\nA CBS News poll conducted by YouGov and published over the weekend considered the question of how the United States should react if Iran struck Israel — which it subsequently did. The poll showed plurality support for standing by Israel without taking direct military action, the position adopted by the Biden administration. Here again Republicans were more aggressive, with a third supporting direct U.S. action against Iran. Only a quarter of respondents overall took that position.\nThat CBS poll also posed several questions meant to gauge support for possible actions by the U.S. government. Three options had the support of at least 6 in 10 respondents: sending humanitarian aid to Israelis and Palestinians and fostering a diplomatic resolution. Only among Republicans was there more support for providing weapons to Israel than providing humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza.\nYouGov polling has also tracked where American sympathies lie in the conflict. Both in October polling, conducted soon after the brutal attack by Hamas that triggered Israel's military action, and this month, more respondents said they sympathized with Israelis than Palestinians. Since October, though, those sympathies have shifted toward the Palestinians, most significantly among Democrats. Republicans overwhelmingly side with the Israeli people.\nWhen respondents were asked to indicate their level of sympathy for each side, Israelis again engendered more sympathy overall. Democrats were more likely to say they sympathized strongly or at least somewhat with the Palestinian people than they were to say the same of the Israeli people, though three-quarters offered at least some sympathy for the Israeli people. Among Republicans, about half offered at least some sympathy for the Palestinian people.\nThe partisan divides apparent above are inextricable from what's unfolding in response to the war. This week, the president of Columbia University appeared before a House Republican-led committee on Capitol Hill focused on antisemitism at the school. When the school subsequently called in police to dislodge pro-Palestinian protesters conducting a sit-in on campus, the political right praised the move.",

The occasion offers the former president a fresh chance to amplify claims that his multiple pending indictments are an establishment conspiracy to take him down — and, by extension, squelch the voters who first elected him eight years ago.\n'They want to keep me off the campaign trail,' Trump insisted earlier this week in Harlem, where he visited a neighborhood convenience store and addressed a throng of media outside. Rather than pursue violent criminals, he alleged, 'They go after Trump.'\nAdvertisement\nThe event Saturday also underscores the importance of North Carolina, a presidential battleground that Trump won by 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020. That was the closest margin of any state that Trump won. Saturday will be the second time in as many months that Trump has come to the state.\n'The presidential race is going to run through North Carolina,' said Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, in a recent interview.\nNorth Carolina is one of seven states that both the Trump and Biden campaigns have said they will dedicate significant campaign resources to winning. Trump has insisted he wants to widen the map, even into his native New York, which is heavily Democratic. Most Republicans, though, agree that Trump will have a difficult path to an Electoral College majority if Biden were to win North Carolina's 15 electoral votes. Trump tacitly acknowledged North Carolina's status by tapping then-state Republican Chairman Michael Whatley to lead his campaign's effective takeover of the Republican National Committee.\nAdvertisement\nThere is no precedent for the kind of campaign Trump now has to run — in North Carolina and nationally.\nWith opening arguments of his trial expected Monday, Trump will be confined to the courtroom for the foreseeable future, limiting his ability to see voters, fundraise and make calls. Biden, conversely, spent multiple days this week campaigning in Pennsylvania, another key battleground. Trump aides have promised weekend rallies and events on Wednesdays, the one weekday Trump's trial is expected to be in recess. The former president's campaign also has promised additional weeknight appearances around New York, as in Harlem.\nThat schedule adds pressure for Trump to maximize his limited opportunities to reach voters and command media attention beyond his indictments.\nIn North Carolina, Biden's campaign already has hired statewide leadership and field organizers for offices across the state. That's on top of state party staff that began an organizing program last year ahead of municipal races and looking to this year's statewide races – including an open governor's race since Cooper is barred from seeking a third term.\nAdvertisement\n'We needed to build energy on the ground early,' said state Democratic Chairwoman Anderson Clayton, noting that the last Democratic presidential nominee to win North Carolina — Barack Obama in 2008 — had organized the state in a hotly contested primary campaign that ramped up the previous year.\nMatt Mercer, spokesman for the North Carolina Republican Party, countered that veteran GOP staffers have been working in the state since the 2020 election cycle. Mercer said the GOP, from Trump to volunteers, will stress a family-first message around the economy and public safety.\nVoters, Mercer said, 'understand the importance of what those messages mean to them in their daily lives' and are 'fed up' with Biden, 'whether it's with sky high inflation, the open southern border or the migrant crime crisis.'\nAdvertisement\nTrump will be joined Saturday by North Carolina Republican gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson, whom Trump has endorsed and called 'Martin Luther King on steroids.' Robinson is the first Black lieutenant governor of the state.\nCooper won the governor's office narrowly in 2016 and 2020, swaying just enough swing voters even as Trump carried the state in each of those presidential contests.\nThe governor argued that Biden's record — low unemployment, rising wages, stabilized inflation, infrastructure and green energy investments — will resonate with a geographically and demographically diverse state.",

            "excerpt": "Biden has longstanding ties to the family of the only other Catholic president, sharing politics and tragedy.",
            "summary": "Growing up in a proud Irish Catholic middle-class family, Joe Biden's family idolized the Kennedys. They saw the Kennedys — successful, wealthy, attractive Irish Catholics — as the embodiment of the American Dream. Biden says Robert F. Kennedy Sr., whose bust sits in the Oval Office, inspired him to become a public defender and ultimately run for office.\n'The Kennedys were, as a group, the people he patterned his life after,' said former senator Ted Kaufman (D-Del.), who was Biden's longtime chief of staff and remains his close friend. 'Not just his political life, but his life.'\nSo when the Kennedy family rallied behind Biden last week in Philadelphia with a full-throated endorsement of his reelection campaign, pointedly choosing him over one of their own — Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running as an independent — it was not just politically helpful. It was a hugely personal victory for Biden, too.\nAdvertisement\nPrivately, Biden told aides that Thursday was one of the best days of his campaign, according to people familiar with his comments who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. The event included more than a dozen members of the extended Kennedy family, including six of Kennedy Jr.'s siblings, and Biden was particularly moved when they said the president was the candidate carrying on their family's legacy.\nPublicly, Biden was visibly touched by the fulsome endorsement by Kerry Kennedy, his rival's sister.\n'That was the most meaningful introduction I've ever gotten in my life, other than when my sister introduced me,' Biden said Thursday after her introduction.\nThe Kennedy family hopes their endorsement will help Biden politically. Kennedy Jr.'s independent presidential campaign threatens to siphon votes from Biden, increasingly worrying Democrats that he could meaningfully hurt the president's chances of defeating Donald Trump. The outcome could hinge on a few thousand votes in key states, and many Democrats say they lost the White House in 2000 and 2016 due to such third-party insurgencies.\nAdvertisement\nInside the Kennedy family, Kennedy Jr.'s quixotic campaign has been painful, people familiar with their discussions said. Initially, when he was challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination, his family was frustrated — and made clear that they stood with Biden — but largely ignored the candidacy publicly. They were unconcerned about Kennedy Jr.'s impact on the election, since Biden was almost certain to defeat him the Democratic nomination.\nBut as an independent candidate who is winning ballot access around the country, members of the family have grown increasingly concerned about his ability to influence the election — and damage their family's legacy.\n'Nearly every single grandchild of Joe and Rose Kennedy supports Joe Biden,' Kerry Kennedy said in her introduction of Biden. 'That's right, the Kennedy family endorses Joe Biden for president.'\nAdvertisement\nShe later directly compared Biden to her father, the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-N.Y.).\n'Daddy stood for equal justice, for human rights and freedom from want and fear,' she said, 'just as President Biden does today.'\nThe Kennedy family occupies an unusual place in the U.S. political imagination. President John F. Kennedy was a youthful, charismatic president who energized a generation of Americans until his shocking assassination in 1963. His brother Robert, a more tortured figure, was seen by many Democrats as the embodiment of tragic idealism after his own assassination in 1968 as he campaigned for president.\nScandal has also followed the family, and while members of the next generation have also won political office, none have ascended to the heights of political and cultural influence of their parents. Yet the Kennedy mystique persists for many Democratic voters, especially older ones.\nAdvertisement\nThat backdrop is one reason the candidacy of Kennedy Jr. has thrown such a twist into the current presidential campaign. The son and namesake of the revered senator has embraced controversial, unfounded claims on everything including vaccines and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol — rattling many Democrats and, it seems, some of his own family members.\nSeveral of those relatives have had pointed conversations with Kennedy Jr. about his candidacy, but to no avail, and many close to him say they do not believe he will drop out of the race. That understanding fueled the family's desire to join in a public endorsement of Biden, the people familiar on their conversations said.\n'This has not been easy for anybody, and I think what shouldn't be lost on anybody is despite the framing of the event, that was not an easy thing for anybody to do given the dynamics of this race,' former congressman Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.), a grandson of the elder Robert F. Kennedy who now serves as Biden's special envoy for Northern Ireland, said in an interview. 'But it was an important thing to do.'\nAdvertisement\nHe, like other members of his family, declined to comment directly on his uncle's presidential campaign. A number of the candidate's family members have condemned Kennedy's comments on vaccines and other matters, but they have been careful not to frame their endorsement of Biden as an explicit rebuke of their relative. Instead, they say it is a reflection of their belief there are only two possible outcomes in November: Biden wins, or former president Trump wins.\n'Given the reality that we're in, there are only two people that have the ability to win this race,' Joe Kennedy said. 'There's only two parties that have the structures in place to be able to win this race. So any additional candidate in that dynamic is taking support away from one side or the other.'\nFor his part, Kennedy Jr. has not commented on his family's endorsement since the event occurred. Before his siblings gathered with Biden, however, he wrote on social media, 'I hear some of my family will be endorsing President Biden today. I am pleased they are politically active — it's a family tradition. We are divided in our opinions but united in our love for each other.'\nAdvertisement\nAt 81 years old, Biden has found that his own path — involving both enormous political success and immense personal tragedy — in some ways mirrors that of the Kennedy family.\nAfter being steeped in Kennedy lore as a child, Biden found solace in the family's embrace when he faced the death of those closest to him. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate in 1972, and before he was even sworn in, Biden's wife and daughter were killed in a car crash. His sons Beau and Hunter were injured, and Biden considered relinquishing his seat to take care of them.\nBut Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), along with other colleagues, convinced Biden to stay. Kennedy helped Biden set up his Senate office, becoming a mentor and close friend.\n'I know the president is somebody that has a deep value on family and puts a big premium on loyalty, and when you are there for somebody at their most vulnerable, he remembers it,' Joe Kennedy said about his family's connection with Biden. 'It's that relationship that I think has had a huge impact on members in both families, particularly for an older generation. They've gone through immense loss, too, and so has he, so there's a commonality there.'\nIn addition to Joe Kennedy, many other Kennedys work in Biden's administration: Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of President John F. Kennedy, is ambassador to Australia; Victoria Reggie Kennedy, Edward Kennedy's widow, is the ambassador to Austria; Katherine Kennedy Townsend, one of Kennedy Jr.'s siblings who stood onstage with Biden, previously worked in Biden's Labor Department as an adviser on retirement and pension issues. (The two ambassadors cannot engage in political activity and were not included in Thursday's endorsement event).\nThat Philadelphia rally, which was largely spearheaded by Joe Kennedy and Kerry Kennedy, came after family members made clear they wanted to publicly endorse the president. It took months to organize, given the family's sprawling size. While there was some discussion of holding the event in Massachusetts, the Kennedys' traditional home, family members decided against it because most of them no longer live in the state.\nAdvertisement\nThey Kennedys also wanted to campaign in a battleground state, and after the rally, some of then went door-knocking and met with Biden campaign volunteers in Philadelphia.\nThis month, nearly 50 members of the Kennedy clan gathered at the White House for the annual St. Patrick's Day celebration, staying for a private tour of the Oval Office and posing for a photo with Biden in the Rose Garden. Biden and many of the Kennedys shared the photo on social media, the first implicit rebuke of Kennedy Jr.'s campaign by his family members.\nof the Kennedy clan gathered at the White House for the annual St. Patrick's Day celebration, staying for a private tour of the Oval Office and posing for a photo with Biden in the Rose Garden. Biden and many of the Kennedys shared the photo on social media, the first implicit rebuke of Kennedy Jr.'s campaign by his family members.\nBut during that visit, just as in Thursday's event, Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign did not explicitly come up, family members said.\n'A lot of what was going in the Oval Office, people were talking to him about President Kennedy being there, and my father, and where he put the bust and why he likes to look at the bust of my father when he is making difficult decisions,' Kathleen Kennedy Townsend said.",

            "summary": "Donald Trump is picking up his fundraising pace even as he fights criminal charges in four cases and appeals a nearly half-billion dollar civil fraud judgment against him in New York. But his legal expenses continue to be a tremendous burden on his campaign and its allied groups, the latest campaign finance records show, accounting for 26 percent of the spending in March by his political committees.\nNew Federal Election Commission filings released Saturday show that Save America leadership PAC, a Trump-aligned group he has used to pay some of his lawyers, took in $5 million during March and racked up $4.6 million in legal bills for Trump and some of his associates. Throughout this election cycle, Save America has spent the most on legal bills among the groups in Trump's orbit.\nTrump's political committees have spent at least $16.7 million on legal bills so far this year, and owe another $900,000 to various firms as of the end of March, bringing his overall legal fees since starting his campaign to around $86 million.\nAdvertisement\nThose costs have continued to siphon money away from the main super PAC supporting Trump, MAGA Inc., which agreed to refund $60 million to Save America last year. They transferred $52.25 million in 'contribution refunds' back to the leadership PAC in 12 installments that began last May. MAGA Inc. made another transfer of $5 million back to the leadership PAC in March, accounting for almost all of Save America's money flowing in, new reports show.\nFEC reports do not require candidates or their leadership PACs to disclose what legal matters each lawyer or law firm handled when they report payments to those firms.\nStill, there are signs that Trump's efforts to portray his legal troubles as unjust attacks are convincing grass-roots donors to keep giving to his campaign. The FEC data show that at one key moment in the civil fraud case, for example — March 22, when he was being asked to post a bond of several hundred-million dollars to keep New York authorities from seizing his assets — donations to his campaign spiked. A New York appeals court panel later said that former president Donald Trump would be allowed to post a reduced bond of $175 million.\nAdvertisement\nOn March 22, Trump wrote an all-caps post on his Truth Social platform claiming that he had almost $500 million in cash, 'a substantial amount of which I intended to use in my campaign for president.' He claimed in the post that the judge in the case was trying to take that money away from him. (Trump's attorneys had said in a March 18 court filing that he was unable to finance an appeal bond of more than $450 million to cover the judgment in the business fraud case.)\nIt was his best fundraising day since his mug shot was taken in Fulton County, Ga., in August. In the last half of March, after clinching the Republican nomination, Trump has averaged over $1.2 million a day via the online fundraising platform WinRed.\nCampaign finance records filed this week show that the joint Trump fundraising effort with the Republican National Committee is raking in big checks, with key donors giving the maximum of more than $800,000. But the GOP nominee's available cash at the end of March still trailed far behind what Biden and allied Democratic groups had stashed.\nAdvertisement\nHere are some other key takeaways from the latest filings:\nA vice-presidential windfall for Kennedy\nNicole Shanahan's personal wealth was one of her chief assets when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. chose her as his running mate for his long-shot independent bid for the White House. FEC records show that Shanahan helped to replenish Kennedy's campaign treasury a day after joining the ticket on March 26 — donating $2 million to the campaign. The money is a much-needed infusion that could bolster Kennedy's efforts to get on the ballot in as many states as possible. As a candidate, Shanahan can donate an unlimited amount of money to the campaign.\nBefore joining the ticket, Shanahan had donated the maximum of $6,600 to Kennedy's campaign. Her venture firm, Planeta Management LLC gave $500,000 in July to Common Sense PAC, another outside group supporting Kennedy. Planeta Management LLC also gave $4 million in January to American Values 2024, a super PAC supporting Kennedy — money that helped pay for a pro-Kennedy ad during the Super Bowl.\nPlaneta Management LLC also gave $4 million in January to American Values 2024, a super PAC supporting Kennedy — money that helped pay for a pro-Kennedy ad during the Super Bowl.\nDemocrats tout financial advantage as they seek House control\nReports filed to the FEC this week showed the Democrats extending their fundraising advantage well beyond the presidential race to many key areas in the battle for control of the House and Senate.\nto many key areas in the battle for control of the House and Senate.\nAdvertisement\nThe Republican National Committee, which was struggling to raise cash throughout the GOP primary, doubled its cash on hand, ending March with $22 million in cash. But the Democratic National Committee still has double that amount in its war chest — reporting $45.2 million in cash at the end of March.\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, which is focused on House races, had nearly $56 million in cash on hand at the end of March, significantly less than the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which had $71.1 million in cash.\nThe other influential groups involved in the competitive House races are also raising money at a fast clip on both sides of the aisle. The GOP-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC reported that it had nearly $68.6 million in cash to spend on key races at the end of March, while the House Majority PAC reported $63.2 million in cash remaining at the end of the period in filings on Saturday.\nAdvertisement\nThough Senate Republicans are facing a much more favorable map and managed to recruit several wealthy contenders in key races, some of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents are amassing huge war chests. That group includes Sen. Jon Tester (Mont.), who had nearly $12.7 million in cash at the end of March; and Sen. Sherrod Brown (Ohio), who had nearly $16 million in cash at the end of the period. Both are defending seats in states that Trump won in 2016 and 2020.",

Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nIt's a small sample size, certainly, but the point is useful to consider: For all of the buildup of presidential politics and the years-long conversation centered on the determination of the most powerful person in politics, that conversation has been awfully repetitive recently. And, as polling from NBC News suggests, Americans are not enthusiastic about engaging in it once again.\nOn Sunday, the network published the results of a national poll that asked respondents, among other things, to evaluate how interested they were in the election on a scale from 1 to 10. Fewer than 2 in 3 selected 9 or 10 — lower than any similar measurement by NBC's pollsters this late in a presidential election year since at least 2008.\nAmong Republicans, 70 percent indicated they were very interested in the election. Among Democrats, only 65 percent. Among independents? Fewer than half.\nThis isn't terribly surprising. It is consistently the case that independents — generally meaning independents who tend to vote for one party or the other and independents who don't — are less politically engaged and less likely to vote. Comparisons of national polling conducted by the Pew Research Center with Census Bureau estimates of the electorate show how much of the nonvoter pool in each recent election has been made up of independents.\nIn 2016 and 2020, at least two-thirds of partisans voted, according to this analysis. About 6 in 10 independents who lean toward a party did, while about half of non-leaning independents cast ballots.\nAdvertisement\nBut there's an important asterisk this year: Those less likely to vote are also much more likely to support Trump.\nYou can see it in the NBC News data. Biden leads by nine points with those who voted in 2020 and 2022. Among those who voted in neither of those elections? Trump leads by 22 points .\n22 points.\nIt shows up elsewhere, too. The Harvard Youth Poll released last week found a single-digit gap between Trump and Biden among all Americans under 30 — but a nearly 20-point lead for Biden among those most likely to vote.\nThe youth vote is interesting in part because it overlaps with independent voter identification. Lots of independent voters are young voters and vice versa, so apathy among independents correlates to apathy among younger voters. It's also interesting because — revisiting the point made at the start of this article — voters 29 and younger have never been able to vote for a non-Trump Republican for president.\nResearch by University of Pennsylvania political scientist Dan Hopkins published by 538 earlier this month used an Associated Press poll conducted by NORC, previously the National Opinion Research Center, to compare support in the general election with voting frequency. The same pattern prevailed: Those who vote less often are more likely to back Trump — including among the Black and Hispanic voter pools that have been a focus of attention since 2020.\nThis suggests that Gallup's finding that young and non-White voters were shifting right over the past few years might be a function of less politically engaged people.\nViewing the same point through a different lens: Pew's analysis of recent voting habits shows that Black and Hispanic voters are also more likely to have not voted in recent elections.\nThis sets up a weird dynamic. The Washington Post reported earlier this month that some Democratic groups were balking at registering younger voters — usually a solid party constituency — out of fears they might be adding Trump voters to the pool. The expected pattern in which Democrats benefited from higher turnout might, this year, be inverted.",

The dismissal of its lawsuit was filed in federal court in the District of Columbia. Chip Babcock, a Houston-based attorney representing the news outlet, confirmed the case had been resolved but said he was unable to disclose any of the settlement terms.\nAdvertisement\nSmartmatic was an odd target for the conspiracy theorists because use of its voting technology and software was so limited. It was used only in Los Angeles County, a Democratic stronghold in a state that was not a presidential battleground and where Trump did not contest his loss.\nBut the company has for years also provided voting services in Venezuela, and that created a springboard for phony claims that a foreign company was involved in a vast conspiracy to flip the election from Trump to Democrat Joe Biden. Smartmatic also has active lawsuits against Fox News and the conservative outlet Newsmax over similar complaints. Fox has said it had a First Amendment right to air claims about an election that were being promoted by prominent figures.\nLast year, on the eve of a trial, Fox News agreed to pay $787 million to settle a defamation lawsuit filed by a much larger voting technology company, Dominion Voting Systems, which claimed the network and its hosts spread false claims that its equipment helped rig the election against Trump.

            "summary": "The U.S. government may lose between $233 billion and $521 billion to fraud each year, according to a rough, first-of-its-kind federal estimate released Tuesday.\nBut the author of that report — the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office — simultaneously cautioned that its new figure is incomplete and imprecise because of a lack of reliable data and the inherent challenge in uncovering sophisticated schemes to steal federal funds.\nThe watchdog, known as GAO, computed its estimate by studying the federal budget between the 2018 and 2022 fiscal years, spanning the Trump and Biden administrations and the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, when Democrats and Republicans alike provisioned historic aid that scammers repeatedly targeted.\nWith the aid of a complicated economic model, GAO computed that fraud in past years may have reached as high as 7 percent of federal spending, with the highest spikes likely coinciding with the past abuse of coronavirus relief funds.\nAdvertisement\nThe GAO did not pinpoint fraud in specific federal programs, and it stressed its analysis could not be used to predict future federal losses. But it still presented its staggering finding as a stark warning to Washington, where the federal debt has surged this year to more than $34.5 trillion.\nCiting the country's fiscal health as 'unsustainable,' the report called for significant reforms that 'can reduce the loss of federal dollars and help improve the federal government's fiscal outlook.'\nEven before its release, though, the GAO report drew sharp, rare rebukes from the White House Office of Management and Budget, which raised significant concerns with its methodology in a formal letter released alongside the analysis Tuesday.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nJason Miller, the deputy director for management at OMB, stressed the fraud estimate is 'not based on analysis of estimated losses by individual federal programs,' but rather, is a government-wide figure derived from a 'simulation model.'\nAdvertisement\nMiller pointed to the GAO's own acknowledgments that it lacked the proper data to pinpoint the full extent of waste, fraud and abuse in some federal programs. And he said its release would 'create confusion and promote misleading generalizations that have no factual connection' to federal spending.\nThe new report is still likely to rile Capitol Hill, where fiscal hawks from both parties have long lamented the scourge of federal waste, fraud and abuse — even if they have done very little to address the root causes of the problem. Repeatedly, the GAO has asked Congress to adopt some basic reforms that might improve federal spending data and bolster the government's ability to spot scams, but Democrats and Republicans often have ignored the requests.\nThe GAO's indictment arrives one week after the White House joined Senate Democrats in unveiling new legislation that would crack down on fraud targeting federal programs. The $1.3 billion bill would deliver on President Biden's two-year old request by investing new resources toward fighting identity theft, aiming to ward off scammers who use real Americans' information to obtain government benefits they do not deserve.\nAdvertisement\nIdentity theft long has dogged the government, but it emerged as one of the most costly, devastating scourges during the coronavirus pandemic. Criminals repeatedly relied on real Americans' stolen information to bilk government programs that were supposed to help Americans who were out of a job or businesses at risk of closing their doors.",

            "summary": "One presentation of the rise of Donald Trump focuses on the anti-establishment backlash that the Republican Party experienced during the presidency of Barack Obama. The tea party was one manifestation, and Trump's appearance as a presidential candidate in 2015 did attempt to leverage that frustration with establishment Washington.\nMore important, though, was the overlap between that anti-establishment sentiment and the embrace of outright false claims about political subjects. Part of the frustration with Republican leaders was that their actions and rhetoric were increasingly divergent from the rhetoric on Fox News and on fringier upstarts like Breitbart. Trump was both unattached to D.C. respectability and immersed in the fringe-right vernacular, and that's what he presented to Republican primary voters.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nThis was the origin of the idea that Trump speaks frankly while others don't. It wasn't that he was honest; far from it. It was that he said the things that his supporters were hearing from (dishonest) actors elsewhere because he didn't care about being seen as dishonest. His supporters saw this as unusual honesty, when it was in fact the opposite.\nAdvertisement\nTrump's dishonesty has been relentless ever since, often infecting his allies and his party. But he retains a perception of honesty and frankness among his supporters because they dislike and distrust those pointing out his dishonesty — his opponents, the media, etc. Trump is granted the benefit of the doubt, despite being perhaps uniquely undeserving of it.\nOver the weekend, CBS News published the results of a poll conducted this month by YouGov. It focused on views of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, but included a telling question related to the point above.\nRespondents were asked to evaluate whether they viewed different sources of information about the war in Ukraine as trustworthy. Overall, only two sources were viewed as more trustworthy than not: the military/Pentagon and journalists and media operating in the war zone. Every other presented option was underwater, with more people saying they viewed them as untrustworthy than as trustworthy.\nAdvertisement\nIn part, that was because of broad skepticism from independents, who are generally more likely to indicate distrust when asked such questions. Only the military was viewed as more trustworthy than not on net among independents.\nBut it was also because, among Republicans, the only broadly trusted source of information about the war was … Donald Trump.\nPresident Biden was viewed as trustworthy by four times as many Democrats as deemed him not trustworthy. That was a similar ratio to other sources of information: the military, the State Department, the media. Among Republicans, though, only Trump earned that level of confidence. They were 58 points more likely to say they trusted Trump as a source of information than to say they didn't. The next closest source of information was the military, where the gap was only 20 points.\nAdvertisement\nSome of this is performative, a presentation by Republicans that they agree with Trump and don't agree with others on the specific issue of Ukraine. But, certainly, a substantial amount isn't. If the military says that Ukraine is at risk of being overrun by Russia in the absence of more support, and Trump says this is just neoconservative warmongering, a lot of Republicans are going to nod along with Trump.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBy itself, acceptance of this view of Ukraine is a demonstration of the triumph of Trump's politics. In separate questions, CBS News also asked whether the United States had a responsibility to do something about Ukraine or to defend democracy broadly. That latter idea would have been uncontroversial among Republicans 20 years ago. Now, fewer than half of Republicans say the United States has a global responsibility to defend democracy.\nInterestingly, the support among Democrats for defending Ukraine and democracy comes despite Democrats being more likely to say they don't remember the Cold War — largely because Democrats skew younger than Republicans.\nAdvertisement\nThe Trumpian resurrection of 'America First' leveraged hostility to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to broadly undermine the idea that the United States should retain its traditional alliances. This idea used to sit mostly on the right-wing fringe, too, but both Afghanistan and Americans' general uninterest in foreign policy made it a valuable position for Trump to embrace. That it also empowers the autocrats he seems to want to befriend and emulate is a reward on its own.\nThat initial CBS News poll question shows the extent to which dishonesty has become embedded in the expectations of Trump's party and his base of support. As was the case after the 2020 election, it can create friction in those places where his world intersects with the real world.\nOn Friday, for example, the judge overseeing his case in New York chastised Trump's attorneys.\nAdvertisement\nHe felt compelled, New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan wrote, to express his 'continuing and growing alarm over counsel's practice of making serious allegations and representations that have no apparent basis in fact — or at least are unsupported by a legitimate basis of knowledge.'\nWell, Trump's attorneys have to translate Trump's dishonest presentations into something palatable for the American legal system. This is hard to do. It is much easier for Trump to simply immerse in his own dishonesty and pull his supporters in with him.",

In Chicago and Seattle, protesters blocked the entrance to those cities' international airports, forcing travelers and flight crews to walk to airline terminals or potentially miss their flights. In San Francisco, police had to use welding equipment to free demonstrators from the Bay Bridge after they had locked themselves together with pipes.\nThe chaos unfolded as the United States is heading into a sensitive time related to the presidential election. Both Biden and former president Donald Trump will appear at their parties' nominating conventions this summer, and both events appear poised to draw a large number of demonstrators. This summer also marks four years since protests exploded nationwide following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\nformer president Donald Trump will appear at their parties' nominating conventions this summer, and both events appear poised to draw a large number of demonstrators. This summer also marks four years since protests exploded nationwide following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\nAdvertisement\nAlready, members of Congress, college administrators, and some big-city mayors have started more closely controlling who gets into their events to try to minimize disruptions. Some colleges, including the University of Michigan, are now expressly warning students they could face expulsion if they disrupt end-of-the-semester campus events.\nAt least so far, the pro-Palestinian protests have been relatively small compared to the Black Lives Matter demonstrations in 2020. Analysts also caution there are historical limits to how large a social movement can grow when the matter at hand is not taking place in the United States or directly involves American troops.\nBut with pro-Palestinian protest organizers vowing Monday's action was just the beginning of more direct engagement, analysts now believe that the demonstrations are almost certain to add even more unpredictability to this year's political calendar.\nAdvertisement\n'If this continues for another six months, I would expect that the types of tactics deployed do escalate and we do see more extreme protests,' said Omar Wasow, assistant professor in political science at the University of California, Berkeley, who has extensively studied protest movements since the civil rights era. 'There will become a more militant faction, that advocates for more extreme tactics.'\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, one organizer of Monday's demonstrations in California suggested just that.\n'Today is proof that people are going to fight and keep escalating until there is a permanent cease-fire,' said Sha Wiya Falcon, who participated in a demonstration that shut down a freeway in Oakland.\nAnalysts note that the pro-Palestinian movement is now a sprawling network of groups, many of which have different views about what tactics are acceptable or effective. Many of the groups also have a diffuse leadership structure — or no leader at all — and that can make it especially hard to predict the movement's next steps. During the civil rights era, Wasow noted, there was a more cohesive group of leaders who set guideposts for what sort of tactics could be used at different moments in time.\nor effective.

Of 14 protests and movements studied from 2017 through 2021, Pons concluded that only the Black Lives Matter demonstrations in 2020 'increased votes for Democrats.'\nprotest movements in general do not factor in Americans' political considerations at the ballot box.

'The fact the protests will take place so close to a presidential election could imply that the administration will be more likely to pay attention.'\nWasow agrees, saying one lesson from the civil rights era is that protesters' 'more extreme tactics' tend to be more influential 'with the elites' who are trying to guard against upheaval.\n'When protesters use extreme tactics, they might lose the public but nevertheless they get to signal to leaders who then want to manage the issue,' Wasow said. 'So, in that way, more extreme tactics might hurt you at the ballot box, … but they also could help you get policy responses from leaders.'\nAdvertisement\nThe evolution of the pro-Palestinian protest is occurring as public opinion about the Israel-Palestinian conflict has shifted.\nIn late March, Gallup released a poll indicating 55 percent of Americans disapproved of Israel's military operation in Gaza, while 36 percent approved. Just 18 percent of Democrats now approve of the action, down from the 36 percent of Democrats who approved of it in November.\nBut analysts caution pro-Palestinian demonstrators may undermine popular opinion if the public feels that demonstrators are undertaking too radical of protest tactics.\nRobb Willer, a professor of psychology and sociology at Stanford University, has done research that shows 'extreme tactics reduce popular support for social movements.' Willer said public support begins shifting away from movements that engage in 'property destruction, physical harm to other people or major disruption to day-to-day life.'\nAdvertisement\nBlocking access to major airports or highways, as pro-Palestinian protesters did Monday, would generally fall into the category that could result in backlash from the public, Willer said. Those tactics, however, tend to increase media attention, so some activists consider the trade-off to be worth it.\n'We call it the activist dilemma,' Willer said. 'They are really good at getting you media attention … so different movements, at different stages of mobilization, may have a different calculus of whether the trade-off is worth it.'\nKhalil Abualya, a second-generation Palestinian American who has helped organize some low-profile demonstrations at the University of Mississippi, worries about internal disagreements within the pro-Palestinian movement.\ninternal disagreements within the pro-Palestinian movement.\nAbualya believes that over the past six months Americans have become more familiar and sympathetic with the Palestinian cause.

'There are real-life consequences to everything we do.'\nStill, Abualya sees some value in making Biden feel uncomfortable.

'Because when you don't have a voice, you're nobody.'\nMississippi is among the 26 states that remove voting rights from people for criminal convictions, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\nMississippi's original list of disenfranchising crimes springs from the Jim Crow era, and attorneys who have sued to challenge the list say authors of the state constitution removed voting rights for crimes they thought Black people were more likely to commit.\nAdvertisement\nUnder the Mississippi Constitution, people lose the right to vote for 10 felonies, including bribery, theft and arson. The state's previous attorney general, a Democrat, issued a ruling in 2009 that expanded the list to 22 crimes, including timber larceny and carjacking.\nIn 1950, Mississippi dropped burglary from the list of disenfranchising crimes. Murder and rape were added in 1968. Attorneys representing the state in one lawsuit argued that those changes 'cured any discriminatory taint,' and the conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals court agreed in 2022.\nTo have voting rights restored, people convicted of any of the crimes must get a pardon from the governor or persuade lawmakers to pass individual bills just for them, with two-thirds approval of the House and Senate. Lawmakers in recent years have passed few of those bills, and they passed none in 2023.\nAdvertisement\nTwo lawsuits in recent years have challenged Mississippi's felony disenfranchisement. The U.S. Supreme Court said in June that it would not reconsider the 2022 5th Circuit decision.\nThe same appeals court heard arguments on the other case in January and has not issued a ruling.\nIn March, the Republican-controlled Mississippi House voted 99-9 to pass a bill that would have allowed automatic restoration of voting rights for anyone convicted of theft, obtaining money or goods under false pretense, forgery, bigamy or 'any crime interpreted as disenfranchising in later Attorney General opinions.'

In response to questions Wednesday, Hill told The Associated Press she blocked it because 'we already have some processes in place' to restore voting rights person by person.\nAdvertisement\nRep.

Zakiya Summers, a Democrat from Jackson, served as an election commissioner before winning a House seat in 2019. She said a constituent called her upset one year because he went to his longtime precinct and his name had been removed from the list of registered voters. Summers found out the man had been convicted of a disenfranchising felony.\nDemocratic Sen. Hillman Frazier of Jackson filed a bill to restore the man's voting rights, and the Legislature passed it. But Summers said some 55,000 Mississippians with felony convictions remain disenfranchised.\n'It shouldn't matter if you have a relationship with your legislator that you can get your voting rights restored,' Summers said.",

            "summary": "PHILADELPHIA — The symbolic mix of soul food and Palestinian dishes had been eaten to conclude the Ramadan fast, and remarks from Palestinian Americans about the war in Gaza had just wrapped up at the Masjidullah community center when Suad Islam stepped to a microphone seeking some political advice.\n'This presidential election is very disappointing. Is there a candidate that you would suggest that we vote for? Because I don't know any Muslim that could vote for Biden,' said Islam, who is Black and a lifelong Philadelphia resident. 'Who should we vote for? I'm just very disappointed.'\nIslam, who has lived in Philadelphia since the 1970s, has voted in every election since she was 18, almost always for Democrats. She picked President Biden over former president Donald Trump in 2020, and even volunteered at a polling place. But she said she cannot fathom punching a ballot for Biden again, not with more than 33,000 dead in Gaza, many of them fellow Muslims.\nAdvertisement\n'The economy, the crime rate. I want to cry every time I go to the gas station,' Islam said in an interview, ticking off the things that are on her mind as she mulls voting in November. 'It's just a whole bunch of stuff that's going on. It's disappointing. But of course, this war is at the top of my list.'\nAs the Gaza war enters its seventh month, some Black Americans say Biden's handling of the conflict makes them question whether he deserves a second term, according to interviews with nearly two dozen voters, opinion leaders and activists working through a political and moral conundrum in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\nFor some, the conflagration 6,000 miles away has already changed their vote, edging out domestic concerns such as the economy, inflation and crime. Others say the war in the Middle East, which has already cost thousands of lives and has a region on the brink of famine, mirrors other tragedies afflicting people of color — and that Biden's support for what they see as a moral disaster should have consequences at the ballot box.\nshould have consequences at the ballot box.\nAdvertisement\nStill others see the biggest threat as something else entirely: another Trump presidency.\nWhere these voters ultimately land could play an outsize role in who occupies the White House next year. Pennsylvania is one of a handful of battleground states that both Republicans and Democrats see as pivotal to winning the presidency. In 2020, Biden won the state by just over 80,000 votes, including a 4-to-1 margin in heavily Black Philadelphia. But there are signs that the coalition that elected him is fragmenting.\nIn a nod to the importance of the state and its largest, most diverse city, Biden has been to Philadelphia more than 20 times as president — more than anywhere else except his hometown of Wilmington. Biden is spending most of this week in Pennsylvania: two days in Scranton, where he was partially raised, a day in Pittsburgh and Thursday in Philadelphia.\nAdvertisement\nBut even while he visits their city, some Black Philadelphians are focused on how his policies are playing out half a world away.\n'I want the president to get it right because it's right. That's the first reason, but beyond that, there is a political ramification if he does not get it right,' said Rev. Mark Tyler, the senior pastor of Mother Bethel AME Church, who is planning to attend the Democratic National Convention this summer. He said he's lost count of the number of conversations he's had with parishioners about the Middle East conflict.\n'And to think that this (conflict) is not going to have an impact on Black voters in particular, who connect with this story in a way that maybe other Americans cannot — it would be a mistake to think that it won't be a problem going into November,' Tyler said.\nAdvertisement\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas militants rampaged through the Israel-Gaza border fence and killed 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and took 250 others hostage. In response, Israel has commenced a military campaign that has devastated much of the enclave while severely restricting humanitarian aid.\nComplicating matters, last weekend Iran launched a salvo of rockets and drones into Israel in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian consulate in Syria. Most of the weapons were shot down by Israel and its allies, but the episode has raised fears of a broader conflict.\nSupporters of Israel reject the notion that its incursion into Gaza is racist or mirrors American racial dynamics. Rather, they say, the 150-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict is rooted in a territorial dispute between two groups with historical ties to the same land. The country's backers also note that Jews themselves have been victims through history, and giving them a safe haven is a central reason for Israel's existence.\nAdvertisement\nBut as the Gaza war has raged on, Biden and other Democrats have faced protesters at virtually all of their public events, over the Palestinian death toll. In Scranton on Tuesday, after Biden gave a campaign speech on tax policy, the president's motorcade was met by protesters chanting, 'Biden Biden, you can't hide. We charge you with genocide,' and 'Welcome home, Scranton Joe — make sure Gazans have a home also.' Demonstrators also shouted at Biden as he visited his childhood home.\nIn several states, Muslims and Arab Americans have organized movements urging members of their communities — as well as people of color, liberals and others dissatisfied with Biden's support of Israel — to choose 'uncommitted' in Democratic primaries, an effort that notched more than 100,000 votes in Michigan.\nFor seven months, organizers in Philadelphia have been stoking a similar movement in advance of Pennsylvania's April 23 Democratic primary. They contend that Israel's military onslaught resembles other racist oppression that called for a global moral response: Jim Crow in the American South, or apartheid in South Africa.\nAdvertisement\nThat sentiment has resulted in a growing link between Black and Arab American activists.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBlack Americans 'have been struggling through this for many, many years,' said Osama Al-Qasem, who directs the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. 'They understand what we're going through, and therefore they empathize and sympathize and support our struggle, as well. So the built-in relationship becomes a hub we leverage.'\nBiden has made racial justice a central tenet of his administration, and as his reelection campaign intensifies he has highlighted the strides Black Americans have made during his presidency. Putting Trump back in the White House, he and his surrogates argue, would stymie that progress.\nBiden has stressed that he needs Black voters to help put him in the White House again. but recent polls have shown declining support among the demographic, particularly in battleground states that will probably swing the election.\nSome 92 percent of Black voters picked Biden over Trump in 2020. A Wall Street Journal poll of swing states, however, found that 57 percent of Black men planned to vote for Biden in the 2024 election, while 30 percent said they were likely to vote for Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.\nAdvertisement\nSimilarly, 11 percent of Black women in the 2020 poll said they would 'definitely' or 'probably' vote for Trump, compared to 6 percent of Black women who voted for him in 2020.\nBiden's campaign announced in August that it was spending $25 million to reach key voters in battleground states, including what it called the largest and earliest investment in Black media for a reelection campaign in history. Those ads highlight Biden's efforts to close the racial wealth gap and note that he has presided over the lowest Black unemployment rate in history.\nIn addition Biden launched a pair of ads last month aimed at Black voters in battleground states, touting his administration's pandemic relief checks and its successful effort to cap the price of insulin at $35 a month.\n'At both the national and state level, this campaign is committed to engaging with Black voters earlier and more often than any other campaign to date,' Kellan White, a senior adviser in Pennsylvania for Biden-Harris 2024 and a Philadelphia native, said in a statement.\nBiden's defenders say critics have a dangerously myopic view of the conflict in the Middle East, and that efforts to turn Black voters away from Biden will play directly into the hands of Trump, who would be far worse for both Black Americans and Palestinians.\nAdvertisement\nBiden is handling the Gaza war as best he can, they add. 'You can't solve the problem of the Middle East as a purist or idealist,' said Marshall Mitchell, a pastor at Salem Baptist Church of Abington, a Black church in Montgomery County, Pa. 'They don't understand the power of quiet diplomacy. And they're going to force a hand, and then you won't be able to turn Pennsylvania back.'\nAt the mosque and community center where Islam voiced her electoral concerns, many who came to learn about the Palestinian cause acknowledged that it was just one of the issues that would affect Black voters' decisions.\nSalima Suswell, leader of the Black Muslim Leadership Council and one of the organizers of the cross-cultural event, said she feels a connection to the suffering of those in Gaza who share her faith. But she said she also understands that it may be difficult for people to sublimate their own self-interest to make a political point, even on such a searing issue.\n'Some folks feel that there are domestic issues that require priority, like gun violence in a city like Philadelphia, where Black Muslim children are being murdered,' Suswell said. 'So many people feel like we need a cease-fire right here in our city. And to some level, there is some frustration also with people who feel that Trump is a huge threat to our community.'\nSuswell was one of a handful of Muslim leaders invited to the White House this month to discuss the war in Gaza and other issues. She has also hosted events in her hometown aimed at helping Black Philadelphians understand the plight of Palestinians and what the community can do to influence U.S. policy.\nOthers are disenchanted with the notion that they must choose between two parties whose policies toward Israel may not be substantively different.\n'I think there's a recognition that neither the Democrats nor Republicans are really representing our interests. They're not representing Black interests. They're not representing the interests of poor and working-class folks,' said Melina Abdullah, who recently became the running mate of third-party presidential candidate Cornel West.\nIn 2015, she and other founding members of Black Lives Matter issued a statement of solidarity with Palestinians. 'We don't have to take a lesser-of-two-evils approach,' Abdullah said. 'Lesser of two evils is still evil.'\nIn contrast, Rahima Abdullah, 67, a lifelong Philadelphia resident, said the events of the past six months have not deterred her desire to vote for Biden. Voting 'uncommitted' or staying home 'is a vote for Trump,' she added.\n'I just feel like we've got to do it,' she said of voting for Biden. 'And then we've got to pray.'\nScott Clement and Yasmeen Abutaleb in Washington contributed to this report.\nScott Clement and Yasmeen Abutaleb in Washington contributed to this report.",

            "summary": "Sixteen years ago, the most illustrious members of the Kennedy clan gathered on a stage at American University and bestowed their benediction on a first-term senator from Illinois who was running for the Democratic presidential nomination as an underdog against the establishment favorite.\n'I feel change in the air. What about you?' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) thundered before an electrified crowd of thousands. Alongside the family patriarch was his son Patrick (then a Democratic congressman from Rhode Island) and his niece Caroline, who the day before had declared in a New York Times op-ed that then-Sen. Barack Obama would be 'a president like my father.'\nThat January 2008 event consciously invoked the passing of the torch to a new generation, the metaphor made indelible in John F. Kennedy's 1961 inaugural address. And it gave a badly needed boost to Obama's prospects against the Democratic front-runner, Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.), herself part of a political dynasty in the making. Though Clinton had the backing of several lesser-known members of the extended Kennedy family, its star power was solidly behind Obama.\nAdvertisement\nThat day, as the only reporter allowed backstage, I had a close vantage for it all. It was hard not to think back on that moment on Thursday as Kennedys gathered on a stage in Philadelphia to formally announce their support for President Biden in an attempt to protect their family's legacy from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the crackpot conspiracy theorist running an independent presidential campaign.\nTake a moment to think about how much has changed for the family since 2008. What struck me most then was the sight of the preternaturally composed Obama, moments before the event, choking back his tears. His own father had come to this country from Kenya as part of a program assisted by the Kennedy family foundation.\n'I gotta admit, I had to clamp it down a little bit,' the future president acknowledged to me later, when I brought up the emotion I had witnessed. 'That was powerful stuff. When you see Ted, Caroline, Patrick together, and I think about the role they played in shaping my values and ideals and what I believe about America, the connection to my father traveling to Hawaii and meeting my mother. ... It brings things full circle.'\nAdvertisement\nWhat no one could know then was that this would be one of the final high points for the Kennedys' collective influence in modern electoral politics.\nFollow this author Karen Tumulty 's opinions\nFollow this author\nKaren Tumulty\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nTed Kennedy would live but another 19 months, struck down by brain cancer before he could see Obama deliver on his cherished goal of health-care reform. Patrick would leave Congress in 2011 to devote his energies to the cause of mental health. Caroline, who was briefly under consideration to be appointed to the U.S. Senate seat from New York that Clinton had vacated to become secretary of state, would instead later serve as Obama's ambassador to Japan.\nWith fewer and fewer Americans having any memory of the Camelot years, it should surprise no one that the Kennedy magic is not what it once was. But this election cycle brought a new and dark coda to the family.\nAdvertisement\nRFK Jr. has exploited the dimming Kennedy aura, frequently citing his slain father and uncle. His last name has taken him into the low double digits in the polls — not enough to win any electoral votes, much less win the election, but potentially enough to tip the balance to former president Donald Trump against Biden in some of the states that will matter most in November.\nThe prospect of a Kennedy helping to put Trump back in the White House has horrified his relatives, three of whom — including Caroline, currently ambassador to Australia — serve in the Biden administration.\nOnstage with Biden on Thursday were six of RFK's siblings. They never mentioned their brother directly at the Philadelphia gathering, but the target of the rebuke was clear.\n'President Biden has been a champion for all the rights and freedoms that my father and uncle stood for,\" younger sister Kerry Kennedy declared. 'That's why nearly every single grandchild of Joe and Rose Kennedy supports Joe Biden. That's right. ... The Kennedy family endorses Joe Biden for president.'",

The governing center-right Croatian Democratic Union won the most votes but not enough to rule alone. Although it finished second, Milanović's Social Democratic Party is also trying to muster a coalition in the 151-member parliament.\nMilanović made a surprise announcement that he would run for prime minister just hours after calling the election for April 17. The Constitutional Court later warned him that he had to resign first, a warning that he ignored.\n'The Constitutional Court established that with his statements and behavior the president ... brought himself in the position that he can neither be the prime minister-designate of the future government nor the future prime minister,' said the ruling.\nAdvertisement\nMilanović has insisted that he had not violated Croatia's top law by openly supporting the opposition during the campaign and saying he would become the new prime minister. He has accused the current Prime Minister Andrej Plenković of widespread corruption.\nThe showdown between Croatia's two top politicians has dominated the vote, which is also seen as the test ahead of the election for the European parliament in June.\nMilanović is critical of EU policies over the war in Ukraine. If he were to form a government, that could potentially open space for stronger pro-Russia influence in the country, akin to Hungary and Slovakia.\nOfficials results of Wednesday's vote has shown that Plenković's HDZ won 61 parliamentary seats while the SDP got 42. The far-right Homeland Movement has emerged as a potential kingmaker with 14 seats.\nAdvertisement\nThe Constitutional Court said that Milanović could not now become prime minister even if he resigned as president to take up the new post.

Newsom's political action committee, Campaign for Democracy, is paying for the ad as part of its focus on abortion rights.\nAdvertisement\n'This is happening in real time,' Newsom said of Republican-led attacks on abortion access.

'Our response must be in real time to be more assertive and proactive.'\nThe emergency legislation would expedite the licenses of Arizona abortion providers to let them treat their patients in California. It will be introduced in the statehouse this week through the legislature's women's caucus, Newsom added.\n'We're now doing that as it relates to being a good neighbor, not just to those that seek reproductive care and reproductive freedom, but also to our neighbors, particularly in Arizona,' he said. 'We've got some ideas to help those that seek to get their care in California to have their back as well.'\nIn a statement to The Washington Post, Brandon Richards, a spokesman for Newsom, said the governor's office has worked closely with California state lawmakers to 'quickly and effectively' respond to the Arizona Supreme Court's decision.\nAdvertisement\nRichards did not provide details on how quickly this emergency legislation could become a law, but said additional details will be shared in the coming days.\nNewsom's office worked alongside Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs (D) and Attorney General Kris Mayes (D) to develop a plan that would expedite Arizona abortion providers' abilities to provide reproductive care to their constituents in California.\nA near-total abortion ban first enacted in 1864 is expected to go into effect in Arizona as soon as June 8 if the state legislature does not intervene .

But, like other Democratic leaders nationwide, Newsom said he doesn't believe Trump when he says he won't sign a national abortion ban.\n'He's a liar,' Newsom said. 'He'll say whatever he needs to say on any day of the week.'\nKaroline Leavitt, press secretary for Trump's campaign, shot down his claim.\nAdvertisement\n'President Trump has repeatedly said he will not sign a federal abortion ban and has long been consistent in supporting the rights of states to make decisions on abortion,' Leavitt said in a statement, adding Newsom and Democrats were 'out of touch' with most Americans on their stance on the issue.\nDuring his MSNBC appearance, Newsom said he's focusing on neighboring Arizona and Nevada — swing states — electorally, arguing that both states 'will play, potentially, an outsized role in this election.' The California governor, widely seen in the Democratic Party as a likely 2028 presidential contender, said he will campaign there on the issue of abortion, hoping that the two states will help deliver a presidential win to Biden and help Democrats keep the Senate.",

Council were asked a practical question at a forum: Following a contentious redistricting process that stretched Ward 7's border further west across the Anacostia — adding thousands of residents in the process — what shared traits could help unify neighborhoods on both sides of the river?\n'What I've found is, whether you live in Hillcrest or Hill East, we all want the same things. Quality schools, safe streets, and, most importantly, a government that works,' said Wendell Felder, a Ward 7 advisory neighborhood commissioner who's held several roles in District government.\n'Everybody wants to be able to call their council person and get a real person on the line,' said Ebony Payne, a neighborhood commissioner on the western side of Ward 7.\nAdvertisement\nThe redistricting, coupled with longtime Democratic council member Vincent C. Gray's announcement in December that he would not seek reelection, has transformed the political landscape in Ward 7. But no one from the crowded field has emerged as a clear front-runner, even as those in the district say it's an important time for them to have a decisive leader. Ward 7, they say, has struggled with crime and lagging economic development and education indicators. And it stands to be affected the most by the debate over the future of the RFK Stadium complex.\n'This is why the race is so polarizing: The stakes are tremendous,' said Delia Houseal, 1st vice chair of the Ward 7 Democrats and an advisory neighborhood commissioner. 'Ward 7 is either second [to last] or last in a lot of different indicators, whether those are health-related indicators, social-related indicators, education-related indicators, crime-related indicators — the list goes on and on and on.

And Felder is among the most politically wired candidates as the former chairman of the Ward 7 Democrats.\nIn such a packed field, even the campaign signs seem to be competing for attention along Ward 7's key intersections and corridors. Making matters more interesting, three of the candidates have similar-sounding names, leading to some talking-point shticks to help voters remember who they are, as if in a radio jingle.\n'My name is Ebony Payne, and I'm running for D.C. Council — that's Ebony with a ‘Y,'' Payne said in a video advertisement released Thursday, aiming to distinguish herself from Thompson and, perhaps to a lesser extent, former Ward 7 neighborhood commissioner Ebbon Allen.\ncommissioner Ebbon Allen.\nAdvertisement\nOthers in the race include Villareal ‘VJ' Johnson, who served five terms as a neighborhood commissioner in the ward; Denise Reed, who worked in the office of former D.C. Council Chairman David Clark; Nate Fleming, who won elected office previously as the District's 'shadow representative' in the U.S. House to Congress and was a legislative director for the council; and small business advocate Roscoe Grant.\nPayne has raised nearly $180,000 since November, including matching funds from D.C. taxpayers, and has also outspent her opponents, helping her keep pace with other top candidates that observers note have longer track records of service in the community. Thompson, for her part, raised more than $160,000 with matching funds; Felder, Rasheed and Brown also have a notable fundraising edge over the remaining candidates.\nPatricia Stamper, an advisory neighborhood commissioner in Deanwood, called this year's Ward 7 campaign a 'generational race,' believing that in such a period of transition for the ward, whoever pulls off the win could shape the community's agenda for years to come. If you ask Stamper, that person should be Thompson or Felder, the two she believes have the strongest track records of service in the ward and whom she has supported with donations this year.\nAdvertisement\nLisa Rice, a Ward 7 advisory neighborhood commissioner, said she was rooting for Rasheed or Brown, even though as an independent she wouldn't be voting in the primary. She said she liked the fire they brought in challenging Gray four years ago, a more difficult campaign against an incumbent, and appreciated their approach to public safety and the root causes of crime, showing they'd given the issue 'deep thought.'\nBut Rice, who is leading a ballot initiative to bring ranked-choice voting and open primaries to D.C., said a top concern was that the winner of the Democratic primary could end up advancing with very limited support.\nWith so many platforms for voters to consider, others have wondered whether an endorsement from Gray could shake up the race, or offer clarity for those who might be struggling to choose.\nhave wondered whether an endorsement from Gray could shake up the race, or offer clarity for those who might be struggling to choose.\nAdvertisement\nChuck Thies, Gray's spokesman, said the outgoing council member hasn't decided whether he will back a candidate, but said he's watching the debates virtually and consulting with those who have been paying close attention to the race — including Thies, who says he reports back to Gray after attending candidate events.\nThies, a longtime political consultant, said he thinks it's a contest between Rasheed, Felder, Thompson and Payne — calling the latter two candidates' first name similarities a 'disaster' of a campaign hurdle. ('The first thing people should know is my name is Eboni-Rose, not Ebony,' Thompson later told The Washington Post).\nThies called Felder the closest to an 'establishment' candidate in the field because of his previous roles in the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development and as a community relations rep for Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D). But there was a catch, he said, that has caused some trouble for him: Felder told the ACLU in a recent questionnaire that he would advocate for Congress to overturn legislation passed by the D.C. Council if he disagreed with it.\nAdvertisement\nFelder faced immediate backlash online after the ACLU's questionnaire published, creating easy fodder for critics and awkward positions for some of his baffled supporters. He sought to clarify his remark later in statements posted to social media, adding that he would first 'pursue amendments or revisions' to legislation he didn't like. 'However, if a bill's reversal is necessary to safeguard the well-being and rights of D.C. residents, I would not hesitate to urge Congress to intervene,' Wendell said in the April 7 statement. 'This action, although significant, underscores the broader issue of D.C.'s need for statehood — an issue I have tirelessly advocated for.'\nApril 7 statement. 'This action, although significant, underscores the broader issue of D.C.'s need for statehood — an issue I have tirelessly advocated for.'\nBut at the forum in Hill East a week later, Felder addressed the questionnaire once again in his closing statement: 'I just want to clear the record: under no circumstances do we support [congressional interference],' he said, adding that it was a 'reflective response to a hypothetical question.'\nOther candidates have taken shots at Payne as the race has heated up, painting her as the big-money candidate but a relative newcomer to Ward 7 politics. At a March forum, Rasheed homed in on an ad that Payne released calling for harsher penalties for people who kidnap dogs, questioning why she was focusing on dogs when people were dying; Payne said dog-nappings were traumatic for dog owners as well. Felder took aim at the ubiquity of Payne's campaign materials around the ward, questioning if her expenditures were adequately documented.\nAdvertisement\n'I think you're just upset that I'm running a better campaign than you,' Payne retorted.\nThe Hill East forum was tamer by comparison, illustrated by an area of consensus. When the 10 candidates were asked to raise their hand if they thought Bowser's fiscal 2025 budget proposal was 'good,' none of them did.\nHaving spent weeks collecting signatures and knocking on doors, candidates had no problem identifying areas of concern shared across the ward. While Ward 7's neighborhoods are somewhat less starved for commercial development than in years past, many residents are keenly aware that their economy still lags behind most other sectors of the city, from the median income to the unemployment rate, as the cost of housing has skyrocketed across the region. And the candidates have been pressed repeatedly on their proposals to drive down crime and rapidly improve traditional public schools facing declining enrollment.\nAdvertisement\nIn the 2021-2022 school year, according to data compiled by the D.C. Policy Center, less than half of all students who live in Ward 7 attended school within the ward — the lowest percentage among all eight wards. Several candidates tied the ward's literacy rates to its poor economic outcomes: According to last year's statewide assessments, just 19 percent of students in Ward 7 traditional public and charter schools are proficient in reading — compared with 71 percent in D.C.'s more affluent Ward 3.\nAsked at the Hill East candidate forum how he would try to strengthen Ward 7's schools, Brown, a former high school math teacher, said the city's leaders have spent time debating who should have control over the school system instead of focusing on needed improvements. He also said school funding levels and the allocation of resources should be determined by the individual needs of each school, community and its students — a line that drew applause.\n'I'm of the belief we should take politics out of the school system and allow our teachers, faculty, staff and administrators the opportunity and autonomy to teach what's important to our students on a daily basis,' Brown said. 'Not politicians, and not anyone else who has ulterior motives.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThompson, the school board president, has said she does not support mayoral control 'as it exists today,' believing that parents have a difficult time advocating for and resolving concerns about their children's education in the existing government structure, which does not allow the State Board of Education to change policy.\nAnd amid citywide concerns about truancy, Thompson emphasized the need for children to have safe passage to school: 'I have a lot of access to kids as the state board president, and they've told us that they actually do not feel safe traveling to school, and they used to get to do it online during the pandemic so why should they go?'\nWhen Payne, Thompson, Brown, Rasheed and Felder were asked if they supported a professional football stadium at the RFK complex, Rasheed was the only one to fully raise her hand — although she has said she would not prioritize taxpayer funds for the stadium itself. Felder equivocated, repeating a call to create a task force composed of the stadium's surrounding neighborhoods. Payne, who told residents that her opposition to an NFL stadium at RFK is 'a big reason why I'm running,' called Felder out at a separate candidate forum later that day, asserting that he hadn't been clear on his position on the stadium.\n'What I've come to know as a leader, I don't make decisions that may impact thousands of lives until I have all the facts,' Felder said in response to Payne's challenge. 'And where we are with the stadium, we're not there yet.'\nMidway through the Hill East forum, D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) grabbed a seat, hoping to get an early read on who might join him on the council.

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The first criminal trial facing former President Donald Trump is also the one in which Americans are least convinced he committed a crime, a new AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll finds.\nOnly about one-third of U.S. adults say Trump did something illegal in the hush money case for which jury selection began Monday, while close to half think he did something illegal in the other three criminal cases pending against him. And they're fairly skeptical that Trump is getting a fair shake from the prosecutors in the case — or that the judge and jurors can be impartial in cases involving him.\nStill, half of Americans would consider Trump unfit to serve as president if he is convicted of falsifying business documents to cover up hush money payments to a woman who said he had an affair with her.\nAdvertisement\nWhile a New York jury will decide whether to convict Trump of felony charges, public opinion of the trial proceedings could hurt him politically. The poll suggests a conviction could hurt Trump's campaign. Trump enters a rematch with President Joe Biden as the first presumptive nominee of a major party — and the first former president — to be under indictment. A verdict is expected in roughly six weeks, well before the Republican National Convention where he will accept the GOP nomination.\nTrump has made the prosecutions against him a centerpiece of his campaign and argued without evidence that Biden engineered the cases. That argument helped him consolidate GOP support during the Republican primary, but a conviction might influence how many Americans — including independent voters and people long skeptical of Trump — perceive his candidacy.\n'Any conviction should disqualify him,' said Callum Schlumpf, a 31-year-old engineering student and political independent from Clifton, Texas. 'It sets a bad example to the rest of the world. I think it misrepresents us, as a country, as to what we believe is important and virtuous.'\nAdvertisement\nYet, a cloud of doubt hangs over all the proceedings. Only about 3 in 10 Americans feel that any of the prosecutors who have brought charges against Trump are treating the former president fairly. And only about 2 in 10 Americans are extremely or very confident that the judges and jurors in the cases against him can be fair and impartial.\n'It's very obvious political persecution,' said Christopher Ruff, a 46-year-old political independent and museum curator from Sanford, North Carolina. 'I'm no fan of Trump in any way, shape or form. Didn't vote for him, never will. But it's obviously all political.'\nConsistent with AP-NORC polls conducted over the past year, the new poll found that about half of Americans say Trump did something illegal regarding the classified documents found at his Florida home, and a similar share think he did something illegal regarding his alleged attempt to interfere in Georgia's vote count in the 2020 presidential election. The poll also found that nearly half of Americans believe he did something illegal related to his effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\nAdvertisement\nProsecutors in New York will argue that Trump falsified his company's internal records to hide the true nature of a payment to his former lawyer, Michael Cohen. Cohen alleges he was directed by Trump to pay adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 one month before the 2016 election to silence her claims about an extramarital affair with Trump.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to the 34-count indictment and denied any affair with Daniels.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe poll found that 35% of Americans say Trump has done something illegal with regard to the hush money allegations. Slightly fewer, about 3 in 10, think he did something unethical without breaking the law. Fourteen percent think he did nothing wrong at all. Those numbers haven't shifted meaningfully in the year since he was first charged in the case.\nRepublicans are much less likely than Democrats and independents to say Trump committed a crime in the hush money case.\nAdvertisement\n'He's done nothing wrong,' said Louie Tsonos, a 43-year-old sales representative and Republican from Carleton, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. 'Because Trump has a lot of money and fame, they want to destroy his reputation. Or at least they are trying to.'\nFewer than one in 10 Republicans say Trump did something illegal in the case, while 4 in 10 Republicans think he did something unethical but did not break the law. About 3 in 10 Republicans, like Tsonos, say he did nothing wrong.\nBy contrast, about 6 in 10 Democrats and roughly 3 in 10 independents believe he did something illegal.\nMonica Brown, a Democrat from Knoxville, Tennessee, thinks Trump did something unethical, though not illegal, in the New York criminal case under way. But a conviction would ruin his credibility to serve as president, she said.\nAdvertisement\n'I don't believe any president – whether it's Donald Trump or anyone else – should have a criminal conviction on his record,' said Brown, a 60-year-old veterinary technician and social worker. 'Even if it's related to something like hush money, what respect are they going to get from anyone? Citizens of the country or world leaders, they aren't going to respect you.'\nNearly 6 in 10 Republicans say they would consider Trump fit to be president even if he were to be convicted of falsifying business documents in the hush money case. About 8 in 10 Democrats say Trump would not be fit to serve in the event of a conviction. About half of independents think he would be unfit to serve, with 22% saying he would be fit and 30% saying they didn't know enough to say.\n'I don't think any of that stuff has any relevance to his ability to lead this country,' said Jennifer Solich, a Republican from York, Pennsylvania, and retired nuclear engineer who believes Trump would be fit to serve if convicted in the New York case. 'There may be some unethical aspects to it. I just think it's more trivial than what we're facing as a nation.'\n___\nBeaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.\n___",

Asked by a local news host about the proliferation of pro-Trump signs across Pennsylvania, Biden bristled: 'Well, you haven't been driving in the right places, pal. … He has no presence here.'\nHe has no presence here.'\nAt other times, Biden faced much friendlier terrain during his three - day swing through Pennsylvania, as large pro-Biden crowds materialized and supporters shouted, 'Four more years' or 'We love you, Joe.' One group held a sign reading 'Scranton Loves Joe!'\n-day swing through Pennsylvania, as large pro-Biden crowds materialized and supporters shouted, 'Four more years' or 'We love you, Joe.' One group held a sign reading 'Scranton Loves Joe!'\nAdvertisement\nThe question for Biden, as he throws himself in earnest into winning a state that means an enormous amount to him personally and politically, is how all these roiling sentiments will play out in November, in Pennsylvania and across the country. In many ways, Pennsylvania is a microcosm of the United States — a Democratic operative once famously described it as two metropolitan areas with Alabama in between — and strategists will be paying close attention to the state's Democratic and Republican primaries Tuesday for clues on which party has momentum.\n'Look, you're my ticket to the White House: you, Pennsylvania,' Biden told a group of campaign workers in Philadelphia on Thursday. 'No, it's not hyperbole. You're the ticket to the White House.'\nPolls show the race essentially tied between Biden and Trump, and both campaigns expect the state — which went for Trump by 0.72 percent in 2016 before swinging to Biden by 1.17 percent in 2020 — to come down to the wire in 2024.\nIn a recent memo on Pennsylvania, Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez stressed that Democrats have won statewide races there in 2018, 2020 and 2022, as voters turned sharply against Trump' policies from abortion to election denialism.\nAdvertisement\nBut Biden's visit highlighted his challenge as an incumbent at a time when many voters are worried about the economy and the country's direction, while others oppose his position on Gaza, and the nation overall is deeply polarized. Speaking to supporters in Scranton on Tuesday, Biden mused about the level of animus he has faced around the country.\n'I've never thought I'd see a time when I'm going through a neighborhood, or a rural town that's in the West, and see big signs that have a Trump sign in the middle that says ‘F Biden,' and having a little kid standing with his middle finger — 7 years old, 8 years old,' Biden said. 'Well, I promise, it happens all the time. It's not who we are.'\nDavid Urban, a Republican strategist who led Trump's successful effort to flip Pennsylvania in 2016, said his travels through the state have convinced him that Biden is struggling with its residents, many of whom blame him for the high cost of living and for policies they see as hostile to the local energy industry.\n'The current president is pushing a big rock up a hill, trying to convince people things aren't as bad as they are,' Urban said.\nLast week, Biden was pushing hard.\nAdvertisement\nHe unleashed a populist speech in Scranton. He embraced unions while addressing steelworkers in Pittsburgh. He made stops at Sheetz and Wawa, a nod to the hometown convenience stores whose respective merits are hotly debated, as well as to the kind of retail politicking aides say will be pivotal to helping the 81-year-old president connect with skeptical voters.\nAnd Biden ended his trip Thursday by visiting a majority-Black neighborhood in Philadelphia, where he accepted an endorsement from family members of his most prominent third-party rival, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nAs Biden's birthplace and the largest battleground state — home to a crucial 19 electoral college votes — Pennsylvania looms large in the president's personal and political backstory. It's a state both Democrats and Republicans view as crucial to victory, and it stands as a key a test of whether everyday Americans believe his performance as president warrants another term.\nAdvertisement\nThat's a big part of the reason Biden has spent so much time in Pennsylvania, which has the added benefit of being close to both Washington and his home state of Delaware.\nLike Biden, who has already traveled to the state a handful of times this year, Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has also prioritized Pennsylvania. His aides and allies see it as a central pillar in their push to knock down Democrats' venerated 'blue wall' of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — as Trump did in 2016 but not in 2020.\nWith a population of about 13 million consisting of large urban centers, fast-changing suburbs, millions of blue-collar workers and vast rural stretches, Pennsylvania reflects many of the trends upending the nation's political landscape. Since 1960, no Democrat has won the presidency without carrying the state.\nAdvertisement\nAt a recent rally ahead of his criminal trial in New York, Trump told a large crowd in Schnecksville, Pa., that Biden is responsible for high inflation, global instability and a general malaise hanging over the country.\n'All of America knows that the real blame for this nightmare lies with one person: Crooked Joe Biden,' Trump said. 'That's why the people of Pennsylvania are going to tell Crooked Joe, ‘You're fired. Get out. You're fired.''\nBiden's swing through the state offered a glimpse at how he will respond to such attacks, as aides noted that he made a point of addressing several constituencies that helped propel him to the White House in 2020.\nOn Tuesday, the president visited his childhood home after giving a speech contrasting his view on taxes with that of Trump, saying he represents the scrappy values of Scranton while Trump reflects the money-focused morals of Mar-a-Lago in Florida. His pitch to the United Steelworkers union Wednesday featured a populist pledge to protect American industry from unfair foreign competition, including by tripling tariffs on Chinese-made steel if necessary. He also took a jab at Trump, joking that the former president — who was in New York facing a court trial — was 'busy right now.'\nAdvertisement\nHis speech at the Martin Luther King Jr. Recreation Center in Philadelphia on Thursday targeted the city's large population of Black voters. John White Jr., a former state representative and civil rights leader, introduced Biden by praising his record of boosting 'Black livelihoods,' and the president was accompanied around town by Mayor Cherelle Parker (D).\nThroughout the trip, Biden played up his personal connection to the state, where first lady Jill Biden grew up — she often mentions her attachment to Philadelphia sports teams — and where the Bidens had their first date. He talked about launching his 2020 campaign in Pittsburgh and turning to Philadelphians to bolster his Senate campaigns over the years. He said he had been dubbed Pennsylvania's 'third senator' because of how often he was on the news in Philadelphia, which shares a media market with his hometown of Wilmington.\nAt the same time, the Biden campaign unleashed a blitz of advertising targeting key groups in the state, including Black residents and Hispanic voters from Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, as well as a ramped-up ground operation aimed in part at holding down Trump's margins in rural and exurban parts of the state. The Trump campaign's on-the-ground presence is more limited than Biden's effort, which now includes more than a dozen offices and a mix of paid staff and volunteers.\nAdvertisement\nThat advantage in fundraising and campaign infrastructure will pay dividends for Biden down the road, said Brendan McPhillips, a senior campaign adviser who managed Biden's 2020 race in Pennsylvania and the successful campaign of Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) in 2022.\n'The gap is huge between what the president's campaign has been doing and is doing right now, versus Trump, who has come into the state once or twice for very brief visits,' McPhillips said, adding that the Biden campaign plans to open another dozen Pennsylvania offices, including in some Trump-friendly areas, in the coming months.\nBut for Trump's allies, the negative emotions sparked by Biden during his visit suggest he will struggle to hit his marks in the parts of the state where he needs a strong turnout to overcome Republicans' dominance in rural counties.\nAdvertisement\n'This '24 race feels way more like '16 than '20,' Urban said. 'The antipathy toward Biden — I won't say it's the same as it was toward Clinton, but it's definitely present. The chants of ‘FJB' are louder than they've ever been.'\nLike Hillary Clinton, Biden has faced public blowback from progressive voters. His support for Israel's military campaign in Gaza, in particular, has cost him support from key voting groups, including many young people, Arab Americans and some Black voters.\nIn Pennsylvania, organizers are aiming to convince some 40,000 voters to write in 'uncommitted' rather than voting for Biden during Tuesday's primary. Given Pennsylvania's tight margins, even a small number of defections in November could tip the race.\nBiden's team hopes the state's voters are listening more to other voices, like those of the Kennedy family members who gathered to support him in Philadelphia on Thursday.",

'For the Syracuse area, this is the best thing that's happened probably since the Erie Canal.'\nThe comparison to the 1825 infrastructure project that connected the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean gets at the magnitude of the economic impact as well as the national security stakes.\nAdvertisement\nIncluding the government support, Micron plans to invest $100 billion in upstate New York over the next two decades. The investment would lead to an estimated 9,000 direct jobs and 40,000 construction jobs. Micron has also announced plans for a $15 billion memory chip plant in its hometown of Boise, Idaho.\nThe funding comes from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which is set to provide government support for new and expanded facilities being developed by Intel, TSMC, Samsung and Global Foundries, among other chip companies.\nThe law included $52 billion to support the domestic semiconductor industry, reducing the risk that the chip shortages experienced amid the pandemic could hurt the U.S. economy and national security.\nThe Democratic administration has set a goal for 20% of the world's advanced chips to be made in the United States and has restricted the flow of chips into China.\nAdvertisement\nA senior Biden administration official, insisting on anonymity to discuss the deal before its official announcement, confirmed the agreement with Micron.\nPresident Joe Biden discussed in Pittsburgh on Wednesday the importance of computer chips that power everything from weapons to artificial intelligence to household appliances such as refrigerators.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBiden noted that Republican Donald Trump, the former president and his election-year rival, had not been as aggressive in boosting the sector and curbing China's access to chips.\n'For all this tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that,' Biden told a group of steelworkers.\nTrump has told his supporters that China was 'afraid' of him because he levied tariffs on the nation with the goal of supporting U.S. factory jobs.

            "summary": "COLUMBIA, S.C. — At first glance, the all-male South Carolina Senate subcommittee deciding whether to approve a proposal to remove the sales tax from feminine hygiene products was a reminder that as recently as 2012 the state had no women in its Senate.\nBut progress is being made. The election of a sixth woman to the 46-member Senate in January pulled South Carolina up from last place in the U.S. in the percentage of women in its upper chamber.\nNo one noted the composition of the all-male Senate Finance subcommittee and they listened to five women speak in favor of the bill before ceding the floor to Republican Sen. Katrina Shealy, who broke the chamber's four-year run with no women in 2013.\n'I know we have a lot to do, but we can always do one more thing,' said Shealy, who spoke about how important it is to keep products like pads and tampons affordable and available, especially for younger women already struggling in poverty.\nAdvertisement\nThe bill, which was approved 114-0 in the House last year, passed through the subcommittee unanimously Wednesday. It now heads to the Senate floor. There are only three weeks left in session, but if anyone has a shot in making sure it gets to the governor's desk, it's Shealy, who got 11 bills where she was primary sponsor passed last session — twice as many as any other senator.\nSouth Carolina women have started organizing to get more of them into political office, from the General Assembly down to school boards.\nSC Women in Leadership is in its sixth year encouraging women to run for office, training them to be better candidates and supporting them when they get elected. The group helps Democrats and Republicans.\nIt's an uphill climb. Just 27 out of the 170 senators and House members in South Carolina are women. That 15.9% is above just West Virginia (11.9%), Tennessee (15.2%) and Mississippi (15.5%), according to the Center for American Women and Politics. Just the addition of Democratic Sen. Tameika Isaac Devine in January boosted South Carolina past a few of those states.\nAdvertisement\nThe five women in the Senate in 2023 — three Republicans and two Democrats — banded together to keep South Carolina from passing a near-total ban on abortions. They picked up the nickname the Sister Senators.\nShealy said it shows women can disagree when their political beliefs differ and still come together when their common experiences match.\nWomen in Leadership said women's experiences are different than men and it's vital their voices are in leadership so they not only get heard, but incorporated into policy. And the group also helps women find spots to serve on government boards and commissions\n''Feminine' traits like empathy, collaboration, and altruism, which women have long been told are weaknesses are, in fact, precisely the traits we need in our leaders,' the group says.\nThey hold sessions like Presenting Yourself in Person and in the Media, Building Your Campaign Team and Lead Like a Woman.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2016 in South Carolina, just seven women ran for state Senate and less than 10 ran for the House. This year, there are 26 women running for Senate and 63 running for the House.\nAt Wednesday's meeting, University of South Carolina students Thrisha Mote and Anusha Ghosh spoke in favor of the bill. They created a group called No Periods Left Behind.\nThe group found women who can't afford feminine hygiene products using whatever they have, like a sock, or not changing the items as frequently as necessary, increasing chances for infections, Ghosh said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'It's time to acknowledge that mistral hygiene products are not luxury items but essential necessities for the health and liberty of individuals,' Mote said.\nThere was more data. South Carolina is one of 21 states that still tax feminine hygiene products. The state would lose about $6 million in revenue.\nAdvertisement\nAnd after the subcommittee vote, Ghosh and Mote took photos with Shealy, subcommittee Chairman Republican Sen. Tom Davis and others.\nThere are plenty of other bills that the women of the South Carolina General Assembly said can use their perspective. Republican Sen. Sandy Senn got a bill through the Senate that would allow for cosmetologists to do hair styling and make up in mobile studios or homes. Currently, those services have to be done in permanent structures.\nThe state allowed barbers, who are more often male, to open mobile hair cut shops in 2021. Senn said plenty of women preparing for weddings or other formal events would prefer to have their hairdressers come to them.\nSenn's bill is awaiting action in the House.",

Lawmakers have denounced Iran's actions, which came in response to a suspected Israeli strike weeks earlier on an Iranian consular building in Syria that killed two Iranian generals.\n'The world is on fire, and history will judge us for our action,' said Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, during a news conference Tuesday.\nThe swift, bipartisan condemnation of Iran has put on sharp display the durability of American support for Israel, even amid growing partisan division over how the country is handling its more than six-month war with Hamas.\nAdvertisement\nThe House passed nearly a dozen bills by Wednesday that would, among other things, issue a slate of new sanctions and other financial restrictions against Iran and its leaders. Other legislation looks to prevent current Iranian officials sanctioned from evading those penalties and urge the European Union to 'expeditiously' designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization as the U.S. has already done.\nOn the other side of the Capitol, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday advanced five bills, including ones that targeted Iran for its human rights record and would require sanctions on ports and refineries that receive and process Iranian oil.\n'Iran's direct attack on Israel this week underscores the need to further cut off the Iranian regime's key revenue streams,' Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire said in a statement. 'I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this bill — which has already passed the House — so that we can send it to President Biden's desk immediately.'\nAdvertisement\nA number of the bills had passed the House weeks before Hamas' deadly attack on Israel in October but have been stalled in the Senate committee. An Israeli offensive in Gaza has since caused widespread devastation and killed over 33,000 people, according to local health officials. Israel's conduct of the war has revealed the depth of unease among U.S. lawmakers as concerns over the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza have caused even some of President Joe Biden's closest allies to threaten conditioning future aid to Israel.\nCongressional Democrats have been reluctant to challenge Biden's handling of the ongoing conflict and related regional tensions that have taken shape, mindful that criticism could further weaken Biden in his reelection campaign against former President Donald Trump.\nBut the attack on Saturday has proven to consolidate public support for the Biden administration's quick response as it ordered U.S. forces to help Israel down 'nearly all' the 300 drones and missiles that were headed its way.\nAdvertisement\nIt also comes as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., released legislation Wednesday that would provide $95 billion in aid collectively to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan. The aid package had been held up for months over Republican opposition to continuing wartime funding for Ukraine as it battles Russia. Iran's attack on Israel added urgency to Johnson's plans to bring the issue to the floor for a vote.\nWhile the measures targeting Iran have received overwhelming support — with the series of House bills mostly passing with at least 300 votes — there has been a quiet but growing dissent among progressive Democratic lawmakers in both chambers, who warn that legislative efforts could risk further escalation in the Middle East.\n'Following last weekend's unprecedented response by Iran to Israel's attack on its consulate, the Republican Majority is explicitly leveraging a series of bills to further escalate tensions in the Middle East,' Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said in a statement Tuesday. 'This is a blatant attempt to distract from their own incompetence.'\nAdvertisement\nThe strike on Saturday marked the first time Iran has launched a direct military assault on Israel despite decades of enmity dating back to the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel has vowed to retaliate against Iran, risking further expanding the shadow war between the two foes into a direct conflict.\nSen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, condemned Iran's attack in a statement but called on his colleagues to respond cautiously. He warned that further U.S. action against Iran could lead to a dangerous escalation that could drag America into a war in the Middle East.",

            "excerpt": "The speaker has introduced a complex five-part plan requiring separate floor votes on Israel and Ukraine, as well as a stand-alone proposal to assuage far-right members who want to strengthen the U.S. southern border. Success is far from guaranteed.",
            "summary": "Speaker Mike Johnson is moving ahead on a foreign aid plan that has roiled his conference and prompted two Republicans to push an effort to oust him from the chamber's top job.\nBut instead of the complex four-part plan he floated earlier this week, Johnson now intends to try to pass five bills — one each for aid to Ukraine; Israel; and Indo-Pacific allies; as well as a GOP wish list of foreign policy priorities and a fifth stand-alone bill to address widespread Republican demands to strengthen the southern U.S. border.\nThe new approach is risky and could blow up on the speaker, whose six-month-old hold on the gavel is being threatened by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's (Ga.) promise to move a motion to topple Johnson (R-La.) if he puts Ukraine aid on the floor, something many far-right Republicans object to.\nAdvertisement\nJohnson told Republicans in a letter to colleagues Wednesday morning, 'After significant Member feedback and discussion' this week, the House will move ahead with his plan, with some significant changes. He intends to release bill text on Ukraine, Israel and for Indo-Pacific allies earlier Wednesday, and language for the GOP wish list and border later Wednesday.\nSuccess is anything but guaranteed, both on the foreign aid package and keeping his job. Timing on the votes, also, is up in the air — even as members were slated to head home for a one-week recess on Thursday.\nThis is all happening against the backdrop of an extremely slender House majority that Republicans argue should be expanded by voters in November to better their chances of advancing a conservative agenda. The GOP currently has a two-vote majority, meaning that if Democrats do not help keep Johnson in the speaker role, only three Republicans would be needed to wrest his gavel. But two Republicans suddenly become enough after Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) resigns. He was supposed to leave Friday, putting the GOP majority at just one vote, but now is expected to leave once foreign aid bill passes.\nAdvertisement\n'The congressman has the flexibility to stay and support the aid package on Saturday,' his office said on Wednesday.\nIt is clear Republicans are growing increasingly fed up with Johnson's leadership, and the far-right flank had already signaled they will not support Johnson's plan even before text of the legislation was released. It's unclear how they will respond to the idea of moving a separate border package — which will, according to the speaker's office — will include the 'core components of H.R. 2,' a harsh immigration bill restricting migrants from entering the United States.\nEarly signals were not good.\nThe House Freedom Caucus has already panned the proposal. Johnson is 'surrendering' on the border, the far-right group tweeted in response to Johnson's plan. 'This flies in the face of every promise Republicans have told you' and they care more about 'funding Ukraine than they do securing our own borders.'\nAdvertisement\nYet Johnson is moving the separate border package in an attempt to appease his unruly conference, many of whom have demanded the border be secure before funding is sent to Ukraine and other allies. Republicans did have a chance to consider a tough bipartisan security bill earlier in the year, but declined to do so as Donald Trump vocally attacked it.\nKeeping border security separate from the foreign aid package may give both pieces of legislation a greater chance of passing. The national security bill will likely need Democratic support because of the large number of Republicans who don't want to fund Ukraine — while Johnson aims to pass the border security bill with just Republican support, hoping to satisfy demands from all corners of his conference and send all bills to the Senate.\nBut in an almost four-hour meeting between Johnson and his allies Tuesday night — before this latest plan was released — Republicans left demoralized after failing to concoct a plan that would ensure enough of them support sending the package to the floor without having to rely on Democrats. Multiple people familiar with the meeting, who were granted anonymity to discuss internal dynamics, said the meeting enlightened them and Johnson about what moving on his plan would mean for his future.\nAdvertisement\nWhile Johnson is officially moving on his foreign aid plan, it could all lead to his ouster.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'The battle lines were very clear at the end,' one Republican said. 'It was very clear [the motion to vacate] will be brought if the speaker's plan proceeds.'",

            "excerpt": "Far-right GOP lawmakers are trying to thwart the House speaker's compromise on aid to the two countries.",
            "summary": "As hundreds of Iranian missiles and drones rained down on Israel this weekend, some far-right lawmakers saw an opportunity to use the attack to accomplish a separate goal: further delay U.S. aid to Ukraine — hurting both Israel and Ukraine in the process.\nOn Monday evening, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) finally announced his plan to address the need for emergency supplemental funding for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific. He is declining to simply call a vote on the Senate-passed $95 billion package, which would easily pass the House and reach President Biden's desk immediately. Rather, he came up with a complicated and risky gambit to call votes on four separate aid bills and then try to join them together afterward on their way to the Senate.\nJohnson is trying to strike a compromise. Splitting the bills into separate votes allows anti-Ukraine Republicans to vote against that funding and progressive Democrats to vote against the Israel funding — but both measures could still pass. That compromise, however, didn't satisfy far-right members of Johnson's caucus, who moved closer Tuesday to forcing a vote to remove him as speaker. He likely needs Democratic support to pass the legislation and to save his job.\nAdvertisement\nGOP congressional sources tell me that before Iran's attack on Israel, Johnson was leaning toward the entire aid package with one vote, which would be much simpler. But beginning on Saturday afternoon, Johnson and his staff started receiving calls and texts from far-right anti-Ukraine lawmakers urging him to pass the Israel aid alone and delay the Ukraine aid yet again.\nFollow this author Josh Rogin 's opinions\nFollow this author\nJosh Rogin\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\n'It had nothing to do with protecting Israel, these guys were just happy to have a new excuse to oppose Ukraine aid and they jumped on it,' a senior GOP congressional aide told me.\nOn Sunday, these MAGA lawmakers went public with their push to shelve Ukraine aid. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who opposes any aid to Ukraine, posted on X, 'It's antisemitic to make Israeli aid contingent on funding Ukrainian Nazis.' Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) posted on X, 'If we send billions to Ukraine because of this Iranian attack, the terrorists win.'\nAdvertisement\nThere's a lot wrong with these statements. Passing the bills together doesn't amount to 'conditioning' the Israel aid — and it wouldn't be 'antisemitic' if it did. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish, not a Nazi. And Gaetz seems not to realize that the Iranians are also helping Russia attack Ukraine.\n'The MAGA faction of Congress fundamentally misunderstands or does not want to understand the national security implications of how these conflicts are connected,' Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.) told me. 'They need to wake up and look at the full picture.'\nThis is not the first time far-right GOP lawmakers have tried to use Israel as an excuse to delay passing aid to Ukraine. In November, Johnson himself pushed through an Israel-only funding bill that ignored Ukraine, but the Senate didn't take it up. He tried again in February to pass aid for Israel only, but failed. Interestingly, Greene voted no on the aid for Israel both times. That didn't stop her from invoking Israel's security to argue for a delay in Ukraine aid again this week.\nAdvertisement\nGreene and Gaetz are now also out of step with former president Donald Trump, who came out in favor of more Ukraine aid (although he wants it issued as loans) during Johnson's visit to Mar-a-Lago last week. Trump wants Congress to pass Ukraine aid because he sees it as in his personal interest, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told me. If Trump returns to office and tries to push a Russia-Ukraine peace deal, he needs Ukraine to be in a strong position militarily.\n'President Trump understands if Ukraine makes a deal from a position of weakness, that will just invite another invasion and entice China,' Graham said.\nJohnson's current effort shows that he is still trying to placate his far-right base but is also genuinely trying to get Israel and Ukraine funding done. Democrats are right to support this effort, and the Senate should pass Johnson's aid package quickly, if it gets that far. His plan includes additional items the White House should be willing to accept, including a bill that would seek to compel TikTok to separate from its Chinese parent ByteDance and a bill to authorize the administration to seize frozen Russian assets. If it fails, the MAGA drive to fully separate Israel aid and kill Ukraine aid will resurface and pick up more steam.\nAdvertisement",

At his own press conference Tuesday, Johnson spoke of the importance of ensuring Trump, who is now at his criminal trial in New York, is re-elected to the White House.\nJohnson also spoke over the weekend with President Joe Biden as well as other congressional leaders about the emerging U.S. aid package, which the speaker plans to move in separate votes for each section — with bills for Ukraine, Israel, the Indo-Pacific region. He spoke about it with Biden again late Monday.\nIt's a complicated approach that breaks apart the Senate's $95 billion aid package for separate votes, and then stitches it back together for the president's signature.\nAdvertisement\nThe approach will require the speaker to cobble together bipartisan majorities with different factions of House Republicans and Democrats on each measure. Additionally, Johnson is preparing a fourth measure that would include various Republican-preferred national security priorities, such as a plan to seize some Russian assets in U.S. banks to help fund Ukraine and another to turn the economic aid for Ukraine into loans.\nThe plan is not an automatic deal-braker for Democrats in the House and Senate, with leaders refraining from comment until they see the actual text of the measure, due out later Tuesday.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nHouse Republicans, however, were livid that Johnson will be leaving their top priority — efforts to impose more security at the U.S.-Mexico border — on the sidelines. Some predicted Johnson will not be able to push ahead with voting on the package this week, as planned..\nAdvertisement\nRep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., called the morning meeting an 'argument fest.'\nShe said Johnson was 'most definitely'' losing support for the plan, but he seemed undeterred in trying to move forward despite 'what the majority of the Conference' of Republicans wanted.\nWhen the speaker said the House GOP's priority border security bill H.R. 2 would not be considered germane to the package, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas a chief sponsor said it's for the House to determine which provisions and amendments are relevant.\n'Things are very unresolved,' Roy said.\nRoy said said Republicans want 'to be united. They just have to be able to figure out how to do it.'\nThe speaker faces a threat of ouster from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., the top Trump ally who has filed a motion to vacate the speaker from office in a snap vote — much the way Republicans ousted their former speaker, Kevin McCarthy, last fall..\nAdvertisement\nWhile Greene has not said if or when she will force the issue, and has not found much support for her plan after last year's turmoil over McCarthy's exit, she drew at least one key supporter Tuesday.\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., rose in the meeting and suggested Johnson should step aside, pointing to the example of John Boehner, an even earlier House speaker who announced an early resignation in 2015 rather than risk a vote to oust him, according to Republicans in the room.\nJohnson did not respond, according to Republicans in the room, but told the lawmakers they have a 'binary' choice' before them.",

            "summary": "It's a sad thing that acts of political bravery are so rare these days, but that makes it all the more important to recognize them when they happen.\nSo let's pause to appreciate how much courage it took, along with legislative skill, for House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) to defy the hardliner bullies of his own party and put forward the $95 billion package of foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan that passed the House on Saturday.\nAnd by doing so, to reclaim — at least for this moment — what Republicans once believed about America's essential place in the world.\nThe hardest part was the badly needed $60 billion for Kyiv, which is struggling to fend off Russia's invasion. As Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) put it on the House floor: 'Traditional conservatives, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, have risen to the occasion.' Moments after the overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also singled out the speaker, writing on his Telegram channel: 'I am grateful to the United States House of Representatives, both parties, and personally Speaker Mike Johnson for the decision that keeps history on the right track.'\nAdvertisement\nAll of this praise might seem excessive, given that allowing the House to work its collective will is the essence of a speaker's role. But doing what's right, or even normal, is not how the Republican Party, locked in the grip of Donald Trump, rolls these days. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) — who, like others on the far right, parrots Kremlin propaganda — has already filed a 'motion to vacate\" that could remove Johnson from the job if she calls for a vote on it.\n'If I operated out of fear over motion to vacate, I would never be able to do my job. Look, history judges us for what we do. This is a critical time right now,' Johnson told reporters last week. 'I can make a selfish decision and do something that is different, but I'm doing here what I believe to be the right thing. I think providing aid to Ukraine right now is critically important.'\nFollow this author Karen Tumulty 's opinions\nFollow this author\nKaren Tumulty\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nWhat convinced him, Johnson noted, was 'I really do believe the intel and the briefings that we've gotten' — something that in itself is heresy these days in the GOP, given how Trump has savaged the credibility of the 'deep state.'\nAdvertisement\nIn all of this, some Democrats see hopeful signs in Johnson's leadership. 'What we get caught up in, and it's a reality, is the obstruction of a small group of people who take the institution hostage,' Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, told me Saturday. 'I have to believe, at some level, the speaker made the decision he was not going to be held hostage by these people.'\nExpectations could hardly have been lower for Johnson when he was plucked from obscurity last fall to become speaker after 21 days of chaos in which his predecessor Kevin McCarthy had been cast out and a handful of right-wingers used their leverage to deny the job to three top leaders who sought to replace McCarthy.\nTo the degree that Johnson was known at all, it was for his alignment with Trump in his efforts to oppose the certification of the 2020 election results. Nor have some of Johnson's moves since taking the gavel inspired confidence — among them, smothering a border security deal that Trump opposed and pursuing the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on the flimsiest of grounds. Less than two weeks ago, Johnson was kissing the ring at Mar-a-Lago, appearing with Trump at an event to promote an unnecessary, conspiracy-theory-driven measure to require proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections.\nAdvertisement\nAll of this, however, reflected in no small measure the degree of difficulty Johnson faces in leading what is a GOP majority in name only, shrunken to the point where the speaker can afford to lose no more than one vote to prevail on party-line measures.\nLess noticed have been some early moves to restore at least a semblance of normalcy to how the House operates. 'He has done what many thought was impossible,' Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) told me, ticking off how Johnson has gotten appropriations bills unstuck, found his way to a complicated deal to keep the government open, defied his party's hardliners to pass the annual National Defense Authorization Act, and, just last week, overcame far-right objections to win reauthorization of a government surveillance program.",

Glenn Youngkin have reached a deal aimed at averting a nasty confrontation over the state budget, agreeing to set aside the current plan and work toward a new budget document sometime next month, according to two people close to the arrangements.\nYoungkin (R) met with Democratic and Republican leaders of the General Assembly on Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning ahead of a reconvened session of the legislature to find a procedural 'out' from a budget impasse over taxes and spending priorities.\nWith Democrats who control both chambers of the legislature expressing no interest in Youngkin's plan to drastically rewrite the budget they passed March 9, it seemed as though the state was careening toward a showdown in which Youngkin would exercise a first-ever veto of the entire budget.\nAdvertisement\nThat, in turn, would leave Virginia facing a possible — and unprecedented — shutdown of state government if no budget compromise was reached by the end of the current fiscal year on June 30.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nWednesday morning's deal finds both lawmakers and governor united around the idea of avoiding that breakdown in governance, which threatened to shake up Virginia's coveted AAA bond rating and undermine the state's reputation for sound fiscal management.\nAccording to the two people familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private negotiations, Youngkin and a bipartisan group of leaders from both the House of Delegates and state Senate met in the General Assembly Building and agreed to find a way out. That will involve the seemingly drastic step of rejecting all of Youngkin's 233 proposed amendments to the budget and then procedurally killing the underlying document, according to the two people.\nAdvertisement\nBut while that would seem to leave the state in even worse limbo, lawmakers and the governor have agreed to work to fashion a new two-year spending plan based on the General Assembly's budget, but with an acknowledgment of Youngkin's opposition to a proposal to extend the state's sales tax to digital goods and to apply the new tax to businesses as well as consumers.\nThere is no agreement to permanently scrap that plan, the people said, but an understanding that some kind of compromise will have to take place. Youngkin himself originally proposed the tax change, but it was in concert with other tax cuts that the legislature rejected. Youngkin's administration also announced Tuesday that the state is running a surplus of roughly $1 billion, offering a potential funding source for legislative priorities such as teacher raises and higher education.\nYoungkin and General Assembly leaders have agreed to hold a special legislative session, probably in mid-May, to wrap up the budget process well before the June 30 deadline.",

            "summary": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Tennessee would join the ranks of states where public school employees have to out transgender students to their parents under a bill advancing in the Republican-supermajority Legislature.\nGOP House lawmakers gave near-final passage to the bill on Monday, putting Tennessee just a few hurdles away from joining states such as Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana and North Carolina with similar laws. Virginia has such guidance for school boards, as well. The bill goes back for another vote in the Senate, which had already passed a version of it, before it can go to Gov. Bill Lee's desk for his signature.\nThe bill's progression comes as Tennessee Republican lawmakers have established the state as one of the most eager to pass policies aimed at the LGBTQ+ community as Republicans pursue legislation nationwide.\nAdvertisement\nDuring Monday's limited but heated House floor hearing, Democrats took turns alleging that their Republican colleagues were constantly finding new ways to bully LGBTQ+ kids.\n'These are the most vulnerable kids in our state who are just trying to make it out of middle school alive,' said Democratic Rep. Aftyn Behn. 'And we are weaponizing their identities instead of actually passing bills that help Tennesseans.'\nAudible gasps could be heard from the public galleries when the bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Mary Littleton, argued that the legislation was needed so parents could know if their student would need therapy.\n'I feel like the parents, they have the right to know what's happening in the school with their children,' Littleton said. 'And I also think that possibly they could get that child some therapy that could help them solve their problems and make their way through school.'\nAdvertisement\nLittleton also confirmed she did not speak to any transgender students before introducing the proposal but said some teachers had told her that they did not want the responsibility of having such information.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAccording to the legislation that passed Monday, school employees would be required to pass on information about a student to an administrator, who would have to tell the parent. That includes a student asking for action to affirm their gender identity, such as using a different name or pronoun.\nHowever, the bill also would allow parents or the state's attorney general to sue if they felt the school district was not following this new law.\nThe proposal is just one of several targeting the LGBTQ+ community over the years.\nEarlier this year, Tennessee Republicans passed a measure that would allow LGBTQ+ foster children to be placed with families that hold anti-LGBTQ+ beliefs. Gov. Lee signed the bill into law last week. Lawmakers are still considering criminalizing adults who help minors receive gender-affirming care without parental consent.\nAdvertisement\n___",

            "summary": "This nation, tobogganing swiftly down a steep slope of fiscal irresponsibility, barely notices a blur of alarming milestones. Last week, we sped past this one: A $1.1 trillion deficit in the first six months of fiscal year 2024 that began Oct. 1 resulted in almost as many dollars spent on debt service ($429 billion) as on defense ($433 billion).\nThis, at the most menacing geopolitical moment since 1945, makes one hope that JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon was radically wrong in saying recently that interest rates could reach 8 percent or more in coming years. If they do, deficits will explode even before the Social Security and Medicare trust funds are exhausted, within 10 years.\nThe Federal Reserve was instrumental in igniting inflation with too-cheap money for too long, and then was serene about inflation's supposedly 'transitory' nature. In 2012, the Fed announced its hubristic plan to achieve its aspiration of exactly 2 percent inflation. Even if evidence indicated the Fed capable of such precision (evidence does not), Joseph C. Sternberg's question in the Wall Street Journal is apposite: 'Who elected these folks to aim for a 50% loss in purchasing power of a dollar every 35 years?'\naspiration of exactly 2 percent inflation. Even if evidence indicated the Fed capable of such precision (evidence does not), Joseph C. Sternberg's question in the Wall Street Journal is apposite: 'Who elected these folks to aim for a 50% loss in purchasing power of a dollar every 35 years?'\nAdvertisement\nIn a recent report, the Manhattan Institute's Dan Katz and Stephen Miran argue that 'the Fed's current governance has facilitated groupthink that has led to significant monetary-policy errors while allowing the Fed the flexibility to unwisely expand its remit into inherently political areas such as credit rationing and banking regulation.' Here is groupthink: 'Despite the biggest monetary errors in four decades,' Katz and Miran write, none of the nine recent appointees to the Board of Governors was on record as having made accurate predictions about inflation's path. Mission creep: The Fed has moved beyond its traditional technocratic role and 'pursued a much more expansive monetary and regulatory agenda that is more consistent with an explicitly political institution.'\nThis has included allocating credit, thereby picking private-sector winners and losers; urging Congress to favor the Democrats' stimulus proposal (10 times the size of the Republicans' proposal) a month before the 2020 presidential election; allowing racial inducement in its operations; and injecting environmental considerations into financial regulations. What the Fed calls 'climate-related financial risks' are fictitious. This column has previously noted that the Hoover Institution's John Cochrane is correct: Measurable climate risk to the financial system's 'resilience' in the time frame that regulation can foresee and control — five years or so — simply does not exist.\nFollow this author George F. Will 's opinions\nFollow this author\nGeorge F. Will\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nIn July 2019, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said: 'We don't have authority … to lend to state and local governments.' Nine months later the Fed did that. Randal K. Quarles, leaving as the Fed's vice chair for supervision in 2020, said, 'Those whose plans are grand and whose patience with democratic accountability low' will ask 'why the Fed can't fund repairs of the country's aging infrastructure, or finance the building of a border wall, or purchase trillions of dollars of green energy bonds.' Perhaps it could. Who would stop it? Congress cannot even budget but is a geyser of opinions about everything. As government's institutions fail at their primary missions (the Fed's is to preserve the currency as a store of value), the institutions pursue grandeur through mission creep. This is perhaps partly for the pleasure of being where political fashion locates excitement (today, 'equity' and climate change).\nAdvertisement\nKatz and Miran recommend shortening the terms of members of the Fed's Board of Governors, and making them removable by the president. The authors would balance this increased democratic control by nationalizing the reserve banks, which are privately owned by local banking consortia. Katz and Miran say, somewhat puzzlingly, that making the reserve banks government institutions subject to political accountability would somehow make them a counterweight to the Board of Governors whose members would be removable by the president.\nIt is counterintuitive to advocate more direct political control of the Fed amid accumulating evidence that politics is the problem. That the biggest threat to American democracy is American democracy. The fiscal incontinence propelling the nation toward an utterly predictable crisis reflects the majority's preference: Let's make unconsenting (because unborn) future taxpayers — debt is taxation, including the tax of inflation, deferred — pay for a significant portion of our consumption of government services.

            "summary": "In their May 14 primary election, Maryland Democrats face a dilemma, but at least it's the good kind: how to choose between two well-qualified candidates seeking the nomination to run for U.S. senator against the likely Republican contender, former governor Larry Hogan. Similar in policy and ideology, either Prince George's County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks or Rep. David Trone, who has represented Maryland's 6th Congressional District since 2019, could do the job, which is currently held by retiring incumbent Ben Cardin (D). On balance, though, Ms. Alsobrooks is the better pick.\nAngela D. Alsobrooks or Rep. David Trone, who has represented Maryland's 6th Congressional District since 2019, could do the job, which is currently held by retiring incumbent Ben Cardin (D). On balance, though, Ms. Alsobrooks is the better pick.\nThe first Black woman ever to serve as Prince George's county executive, Ms. Alsobrooks, 53, possesses a down-to-earth personal perspective and ample seasoning as a public official. She has been a fiscally responsible steward through the pandemic and a champion of economic development in areas historically left behind. She helped make the case for moving the FBI headquarters to Greenbelt. She worked out a deal with Mr. Hogan when he was governor for up to $400 million in state bonds to ensure redevelopment along Prince George's five-mile Blue Line Corridor even if the Washington Commanders leave their stadium. She embraced innovative public-private partnerships to construct 10 new schools.\nMs. Alsobrooks deserves credit for her leadership on public safety. She resisted pressure from progressives to pull police officers out of schools during the tumultuous summer of 2020 — in contrast to D.C., Alexandria and Montgomery County, which came to regret their rash cuts to school resource officer programs. In 2022, Ms. Alsobrooks began enforcing a curfew for kids under 17 when she learned that most armed carjackings were being committed by teens between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. She clashed with her successor as state's attorney, who accused her of grandstanding, but Ms. Alsobrooks stuck to her position and she was right.\nAdvertisement\nAt the same time, Ms. Alsobrooks knows what it means to battle systemic injustice and to struggle economically. Her mother's family came to Maryland from South Carolina after a White sheriff's deputy fatally shot her unarmed great-grandfather in 1956. Ms. Alsobrooks's parents were working class; her father recently went back to work part-time to help pay bills after her mother developed dementia.\nMs. Alsobrooks graduated from Duke University and the University of Maryland School of Law. Joining the Prince George's County state's attorney's office in 1997, she became the first prosecutor assigned full-time to domestic violence cases. After leading the county's revenue authority for six years, she won election in 2010 as state's attorney. During her eight years as the county's chief law enforcement officer, she built successful diversion programs for nonviolent drug offenders.\nMs. Alsobrooks would bring valuable diversity to the Senate. Ten men and no women currently represent Maryland in Congress. In 1992, the delegation had four women. She would be the first Black woman elected statewide in Maryland and only the third Black woman ever elected to the Senate. (Nearly one-third of Maryland's population is Black or African American.)\nAdvertisement\nOur conversation with Ms. Alsobrooks convinced us she has mastered local and state issues — but that she'll face a learning curve about federal issues unrelated to Maryland and about foreign policy. Her approach to issues gives us confidence she'll ascend that curve rapidly. Ms. Alsobrooks doesn't take knee-jerk stands. She's not full of bluster. She studies carefully and talks to all sides before making decisions. Her general philosophy is solidly internationalist, including support for funding Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\nFollow this author Editorial Board 's opinions\nFollow this author\nEditorial Board\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nThe record of Mr. Trone, 68, is a creditable one, focused on relatively noncontroversial bipartisan bills addressing addiction, mental health, criminal justice reform and medical research. From modest beginnings, he made a large fortune as co-founder of the retail alcoholic beverage chain Total Wine & More, money he deployed first as a major donor to Democratic causes and then as a candidate for office in his own right. Having spent nearly $42 million through March 30, Mr. Trone ranks as one of the most prolific self-funding primary candidates in U.S. Senate history. This has so far enabled him to bombard the airwaves and drown out Ms. Alsobrooks, though he recently stepped on his own message by uttering a racial slur, a mistake he said was unintentional and for which he promptly apologized.",

            "summary": "Earlier this week, I was asked a question for which I didn't know the answer: What could President Biden do to firm up his support among younger voters?\nRecent polling has shown that Biden is performing more poorly than expected with Americans under 30, though, as I've written, that varies depending on the poll and whether it screens for the likelihood that the respondents will vote.\nSkip to end of carousel\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter Subscribe to How to Read This Chart , a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\nEnd of carousel\nConsider, for example, new polling from the Harvard Institute of Politics that considers only the views of adults 18-29. Overall, Biden leads former president Donald Trump by eight points, 45 percent to 37 percent. Among registered voters, though, he's up 13 points — 50 percent to 37 percent. And among those who say they're most likely to vote, he's up 19 points. Biden has 56 percent of support and Trump, again, 37 percent.\nThat Trump doesn't gain ground as the pool of respondents is narrowed is important. It suggests that indifference to the candidates and voter apathy are linked — and that there's potentially an opportunity for Biden if his campaign can compel more young Americans to vote.\nAdvertisement\nThis comes back to the initial question: What's the pitch?\nRecent YouGov polling conducted for the Economist included a battery of issues on which respondents were asked to offer their opinions. This allows us to see where Americans stand on the election and also how younger (those under 30) voters differ from older ones.\nWhat we find is that there are only a handful of issues to which younger voters ascribe more importance than older ones, whether we're considering issues respondents identify as the most important (red, below), very important (purple) or at least somewhat important (orange). Younger Americans are more likely to point to jobs and abortion as the most important issue to them, but the gap between younger voters and voters overall is wider when describing climate change or civil rights as very important issues.\nThe issue that scored the highest in importance to younger Americans? Inflation, same as everyone else.\nThat holds in the Harvard Youth Poll as well. Its methodology was different, presenting respondents with two options from a lengthy list and asking them to identify which was more important. The issue that was most commonly selected as most important relative to alternatives was, once again, inflation.\nBy virtue of focusing on younger respondents, the Harvard poll allows a breakdown by gender. You can see that, on several issues, there's a substantial difference in the views of young men and women, like reproductive rights. The three issues on which there's the widest difference by gender are three of the most commonly associated with liberal politics: reproductive rights, climate change and gun violence. Young women were at least 10 points more likely to identify those issues as important than were young men.\nA key finding in the Harvard poll centers on the divide by gender. Support for Biden is higher among likely voters than among young people overall — but among young men who are likely to vote his advantage is only six points compared with a 33-point advantage with young women who are likely to vote.\nSince 2020, the Harvard Youth Poll has seen the partisan advantage for Democrats evaporate among young men. In 2020, men and women were about 20 points more likely to identify as Democrats than as Republicans. Now, women are 26 points more likely to, while among men, there's virtually no difference.\n(It's worth noting that Gallup polling of partisan identity shows a rightward shift among young voters that comports with the data above.)\nAdvertisement\nOn the issue importance question, the views of young women correlate strongly to the views of young Democrats. The views of young men correlate slightly less strongly to the views of young Republicans.\nThe question of how Biden appeals to these voters, though, remains unanswered. He's put a big focus on student loan relief, as you're probably aware, and it's the issue on which Harvard found the highest level of approval for Biden from younger Americans. It is also the issue that was least likely to be identified as important in Harvard's battery. On inflation and gun violence, issues seen as more important, his approval rating was around 25 percent. On the issue of Israel — which was also surprisingly low on the importance list — his approval was under 20 percent.\nYouGov found that younger Americans were more critical of Biden across the board than Americans overall, including on education and civil rights, issues that they were more likely to identify as important.\nThe situation, then, is that the issues important to young people and those important to Americans overall don't differ that much as Biden's party has lost ground with young men. (A plurality of young men in the poll identified as independent.) Analysis from Pew Research Center found that voters under 30 backed Biden by a 26-point margin in 2020, down from the 30-point margin Hillary Clinton enjoyed four years before. If the margin had instead matched that seen in this poll — 19 points — it would have meant a shift of more than 4 million votes from Biden to Trump.",

            "excerpt": "The move by several Kennedys to endorse President Biden is a rebuke of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is pursing the White House as an independent.",
            "summary": "Several Kennedy family members plan to endorse President Biden for reelection at a campaign event in Philadelphia on Thursday, saying that Biden reflects the values and 'moral leadership' of their clan's most celebrated members, in a move intended in part to counter the independent campaign of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nMore than a dozen Kennedys — including siblings of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — will be on hand during Biden's remarks. The event comes at the end of the president's three-day sprint through the battleground state of Pennsylvania, where he has tried to paint himself as a champion of the American middle class in the Kennedy mold.\nThe endorsement from about a dozen members of America's most famous political family is intended to showcase Biden as the figurative torchbearer of the legacy of President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963, and of Robert F. Kennedy, who was shot down as he sought the presidency in 1968. It is an unusually personal rebuke to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is portraying himself as the true heir to the Kennedy tradition, and reflects the Biden campaign's concern that he could siphon at least a small number of votes from the president.\nwho is portraying himself as the true heir to the Kennedy tradition, and reflects the Biden campaign's concern that he could siphon at least a small number of votes from the president.\nAdvertisement\n'A vote for Joe Biden is a vote to save our democracy and our decency,' Kerry Kennedy, the elder Robert F. Kennedy's daughter and the current candidate's sister, plans to say, according to remarks released by the campaign. 'It is a vote for what my father called, in his own presidential announcement in 1968 … ‘our right to the moral leadership of this planet.''\nKerry Kennedy also plans to stress that Biden stands for the core values of her father and her family: 'Daddy stood for equal justice, human rights, and freedom from want and fear. Just as President Biden does today.'\nIt is not clear if any of the Kennedys will mention their family member's candidacy, and the endorsement is in line with the clan's long, if informal, support of Biden. On St. Patrick's Day, Kerry Kennedy posted a picture on X, formerly Twitter, showing Biden surrounded by a sea of Kennedys.\nBiden was a senior in high school when John F. Kennedy became president, and he sometimes traces his interest in politics to the former president.\nAdvertisement\nJohn F. Kennedy was the nation's first Irish Catholic president; Biden is the second. And both contended with questions about how their faith would inform their role as commander in chief. Kennedy was asked whether he felt he would answer to the pope, while Biden faced questions about where his political views veered away from Catholic doctrine, particularly on abortion.\nBiden also had a long friendship with the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), John F. Kennedy's younger brother. The two served together for decades in the Senate, including on the high-profile Judiciary Committee. Years later, as Biden sought the presidency in 2020, he modeled his effort to eradicate cancer on President Kennedy's push to put Americans on the moon.\nBiden's campaign hopes Thursday's endorsement gives the president a boost in Pennsylvania — a state he sorely needs to win in November — and beyond.\nAdvertisement\nThe candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has thrown an unexpected twist into this year's presidential battle. He is the son and namesake of a legendary figure in the Democratic Party, one who spoke passionately about injustice, was brother to an idealized president and was martyred by an assassin's bullet.\nHis ultimate effect on the presidential race remains unclear, including whether he will draw more votes from Biden or former president Donald Trump, but his candidacy makes many Biden supporters nervous. He has embraced unorthodox and even conspiratorial ideas — for example, questioning the efficacy of vaccines and the role of those involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol — but he seems to draw some support from older Democrats nostalgic about the Kennedy era.\nIn addition, some Democrats have a deep-seated fear of third-party campaigns. Some in the party believe that Green Party candidate Ralph Nader cost Al Gore the presidency in 2000, and that Green Party candidate Jill Stein cost Hillary Clinton the White House in 2016. This year, Biden faces not only Kennedy and Stein, but also Cornel West, a scholar and activist.\nAdvertisement\nThe Kennedys, however, do not appear likely to focus on the dissenting member of their family Thursday, but instead will aim their fire at Trump, who Kerry Kennedy plans to say is 'attacking the most basic rights and freedoms that are core to who we are as Americans.'\n'attacking the most basic rights and freedoms that are core to who we are as Americans.'\n'I can only imagine how Donald Trump's outrageous lies and behavior would have horrified my father, Robert F. Kennedy, who proudly served as attorney general of the United States and honored his pledge to uphold the law and protect the country,' she will say, according to the prepared remarks.\nAmong those expected to attend Thursday's event are Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a former lieutenant governor of Maryland; Rory Kennedy, a documentary filmmaker; and former congressman Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-Mass.) — all children of the elder Robert F. Kennedy and siblings of the current candidate. Another former congressman, Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.), also plans to be there.",

            "summary": "RICHMOND, Va. — Gambling regulations, school construction and the state budget were on the agenda for Virginia lawmakers returning to Richmond on Wednesday to consider Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's proposed amendments to legislation and his record number of vetoes.\nDemocrats who control the General Assembly don't have the numbers to override Youngkin's vetoes without GOP support, but their leaders have signaled that they plan to reject many of his proposed changes, including most of those he made to the two-year budget bill. Youngkin's rewrite of the spending plan — he's submitted more than 200 amendments — was so extensive, it exceeded the governor's authority, legislative leaders say.\n'If you think of the governor as a surgeon, the Constitution authorizes nips and tucks, but not organ transplants. And his 233 amendments are trying to give the budget a new heart, lungs and kidneys,' said Senate Democratic Majority Leader Scott Surovell, who predicted lawmakers would reject the vast majority of Youngkin's proposed changes to that bill.\nAdvertisement\nPrior to Wednesday's so-called reconvened session, Democratic lawmakers spent weeks publicly at odds with the governor over the budget that they sent him in a bipartisan vote on the final day of their regular session.\nYoungkin embarked on a series of public events during which he blasted what he called the 'backward budget,' criticizing lawmakers for including a sales tax expansion to digital products that he initially proposed at the start of the process in December but had paired with an income tax cut that Democrats rejected. The governor has said unequivocally that he won't sign a budget that increases taxes.\nDemocrats criticized Youngkin for his tour but then launched one of their own to defend their budget plan, which would increase K-12 education spending and pay for teachers and other public workers.\nAdvertisement\nWith his budget amendments, the governor has proposed sticking with the tax policy status quo, which required him to also suggest spending cuts and other accounting maneuvers to account for the revenue that would be lost by eliminating the new digital sales tax.\nDemocratic Del. Luke Torian, who chairs the House of Delegates' budget-writing committee, signaled in an interview Tuesday that his caucus has no intention of going along with that proposal from the governor.\n'The new digital economy (tax), as we call it, is something that's important to us,' he said.\nLawmakers' objections to Youngkin's budget changes could very well result in a version that he ends up vetoing, something longtime government observers say would be unprecedented.\n'My thinking is, we're just at the beginning of the battle,' said Bob Holsworth, a veteran political analyst and commentator.\nAdvertisement\nThe governor has said he hopes to avoid that option, however. He struck an optimistic tone in a statement Tuesday, saying he was encouraged by extensive discussions with legislators from both chambers and both parties.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'Tomorrow is another step towards our destination, which is to pass and sign a common ground budget,' Youngkin said.\nLawmakers will also be working through dozens of other bills Youngkin returned to them with suggested changes, including a heavily lobbied measure dealing with so-called skill games, gambling machines that proliferated in convenience stores and other small businesses around the state before lawmakers passed a ban in 2020.\nThis year's legislation would legalize, regulate and tax the machines, though the changes Youngkin suggested would implement far stricter limits and a higher tax rate than the version the Assembly sent him. Convenience stores around the state staged demonstrations this week, briefly halting lottery ticket sales Monday and closing for an hour on Tuesday, in an effort to draw attention to the issue and urge lawmakers to reject the governor's amendments.\nAdvertisement\nSurovell said he saw the skill-games bill as one of two that could potentially face a veto override, the other being a measure that would have allowed all localities to hold a referendum on raising sales taxes to help fund school construction. The bill passed with strong bipartisan support and has been supported by school officials in red-leaning rural areas.\nIn remarks Tuesday with reporters, House Speaker Don Scott said he's gotten calls from school superintendents in southwest Virginia who questioned the veto. Scott also criticized the governor for a proposed amendment that would ban state funding for abortions in cases of severe fetal abnormalities.\nBetween Youngkin's proposed amendments and his record number of vetoes — more this year alone than in any of the complete four-year terms of the state's past seven governors, according to the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project — the governor showed he's no moderate, Scott said.\nAdvertisement\n'He went after the most vulnerable citizens again,' Scott said. 'And so we're just saying that he's not a middle-ground, bipartisan governor. He has been an extreme — I call him MAGA-in-disguise — governor,' Scott said, referring to the 'Make America Great Again' slogan of former president and presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.",

A success for SDP could put it on track for victory in the European Parliament elections in June and the presidential election in December. It would shake the HDZ's long dominance of politics and potentially open space for stronger pro-Russian influence in the country, akin to Hungary and Slovakia.\nAdvertisement\nThe HDZ has largely held power since Croatia gained independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991. The Adriatic Sea nation became the newest member of the European Union in 2013, and joined Europe's passport-free travel area and the eurozone last year.\nThe president holds a largely ceremonial role in Croatia, while the prime minister exerts most of the political power.\nAfter Milanovic called the early election and announced his surprise bid for prime minister, he began campaigning on behalf of the SDP. But Croatia's constitutional court judges stepped in, saying the move was unconstitutional.\nThey said that the president can't run for prime minister, take part in the upcoming parliamentary election or campaign in favor of any party, unless he resigns immediately.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nMilanovic refused, openly ignoring the top court and continuing to campaign in favor of the left-wing alliance He accused Plenkovic and the HDZ of rampant corruption and 'massive theft' of state funds, referring to past and present scandals, some of which had ended up in the courts.\nAdvertisement\nPlenkovic denied the accusations.\nThe election has played out as the final episode in the long-running rivalry between Plenkovic and Milanovic. Milanovic's colorful use of insults against his opponents and critics has jarred many but he remains the most popular politician in surveys, seen as speaking openly and using plain words as opposed to the more reserved Plenkovic.\nMilanovic has often voiced a pro-Russian stance during the war in Ukraine, opposing the training of Ukrainian soldiers in Croatia as well as sending weapons to Ukraine because, in his view, it only prolongs the war. He called Plenkovic an 'ordinary coward' for allegedly preventing him from directly taking part in the election.\n'It will be game over for Plenkovic' after Wednesday, Milanovic said, calling on voters to turn out in great numbers 'to get rid of Plenkovic and his cartel.'\nAdvertisement\nPlenkovic, like Milanovic a former career diplomat, accused his rival of being irresponsible and of 'pushing Croatia and the Croatian people into the ‘Russian World.''\nPlenkovic said Milanovic should not hold any public office, describing him as a 'political waste that brought only negativity.'",

Why?\nThree words are commonly repeated to describe rural America and its residents: older, sicker and poorer.\nObviously, there's a lot more going on in the nation's towns than that tired stereotype suggests.

            "excerpt": "Former Florida Gov. and U.S. Sen. Bob Graham is being remembered as a politician who genuinely loved people and encouraged them to get involved in civic affairs",
            "summary": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — A leader like Bob Graham would be a unicorn in the hyper-partisan politics of today.\nThe former Florida governor and U.S. senator wasn't a slick, slogan-spouting politician. He didn't have an us-against-them mentality. Sometimes, he even came across as more of a kind-hearted professor just trying to make the world a better place.\nHe connected with people on a very real level during his nearly five decades in politics, and he had immense respect for the nation's political process and institutions. Graham died Tuesday at the age of 87.\nIn a state long politically divided and now dominated by Republicans, he earned support among Republicans and Democrats alike with a folksy charm that belied the fact that he was a millionaire Harvard-educated lawyer. He fit in just as easily in conservative, rural north Florida as he did in bustling Miami.\nAdvertisement\nGraham was known for his workdays, when he would try a new job for a day. They began when he was a state senator and became a regular feature in his campaigns and time in office. It was his way to meet and connect with every day folks. His 408th and final workday was wrapping Christmas presents for a Florida Keys charity.\n'I've been Santa Claus, I've been an elf and, on a number of occasions as today, I've been a Santa Claus helper,' Graham said that day, wearing a red shirt instead of a red suit.\nThe workdays were similar to the 1,003-mile walk that former U.S. Sen. and Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles used to launch his foray into national politics.\n'I don't know why there hasn't been other efforts, either to emulate a walk or workdays or some other way to establish a special relationship with the people,' Graham said.\nAdvertisement\nAfter he retired from politics, Graham made it his goal to encourage people — all people — to get involved in civic affairs, from the local level on up. He established the Bob Graham Center for Public Service at the University of Florida, which list its mission as 'three central principles: civic engagement, public leadership and public service.'\nIn his book 'America: The Owners Manual,' Graham wrote, 'Since my retirement from the U.S. Senate in 2005, I have become increasingly involved in the effort to transform civics from a spectator sport into a participatory sport — one in which citizens directly engage in democracy and shape local, state and federal policies to the betterment of their families and communities.'\nPresident Joe Biden, who served in the Senate with Graham, described him as a person of principle.\nAdvertisement\n'Bob loved people, and he knew that politics at its core is about learning from and serving others. That's why he spent more than 400 ‘workdays' on the job with constituents, doing everything from picking tomatoes, to handling baggage, to patrolling the streets with police. He knew it matters to walk a mile in other folks' shoes,' Biden said in a statement.\nGraham briefly ran for president in 2004, emphasizing his opposition to the invasion of Iraq. When Al Gore lost Florida, and thus the presidency, by 537-votes to George W. Bush in 2000, many speculated that Gore would have won if he had picked Graham instead of Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman as his running mate.\nDemocrats and Republicans remember him fondly.\n'Florida and our country has lost a great public servant. Bob Graham served Floridians with a servants heart, with integrity and with civility. Columba and I are praying for the Graham family,' former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush said in an email.\nAdvertisement\nCharlie Crist, who served as a Republican governor before switching parties and serving as Democratic U.S. representative, said Graham was an influence on him.\n'I always felt that when he was governor, that he was trying to govern for the people of Florida — not in any way political or partisan — and I took that to heart and tried to, in some small way, emulate it,' Crist said in a phone interview.\nGraham's daughter, former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, tried following in her father's footsteps, running for governor in 2018 in much the same spirit he did, continuing his workdays and promising to put people over politics. She narrowly lost the Democratic primary and Republican Ron DeSantis went on to win the general election.\n'I've certainly learned from him, but I would never expect anyone to support me simply because I am Dad's daughter,' Graham told The Associated Press before announcing her candidacy. 'I will be a governor that does focus on what he focused on, which is making the right decisions for Florida again.'\nAdvertisement\nAt her announcement, Bob Graham was present, and spoke of how he relished the job. 'In a life of public service, I don't think there is a more exciting but demanding job than being governor,' he said.\nChris Hand, a former speechwriter for Graham who co-wrote 'America: The Owners Manual' with him, said his love of people was genuine, whether it was during workdays or meeting well-wishers after his retirement.\n'He was never anything but sincerely interested in the stories they would share and he would usually conclude by getting their contact information so he could stay in touch,' Hand said. 'I think that's one of his defining features as a leader. He truly loved the people that he represented, saw them as the best source of his ideas and truly enjoyed hearing their stories and learning from them.'\n___",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden returns to his childhood hometown of Scranton on Tuesday to open three straight days of campaigning in Pennsylvania, capitalizing on the opportunity to work the battleground state while Donald Trump spends the week in a New York City courtroom for his first criminal trial.\nThe Democratic president plans to use Scranton, a working class city of roughly 75,000 people, as the backdrop for his pitch for higher taxes on the rich. At the same, he will portray Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee and a billionaire himself, as a tool of wealthy interests.\nIt's all aimed at reframing the conversation around the economy, which has left many Americans feeling sour about their financial situations at a time of stubborn inflation and elevated interest rates despite low unemployment.\nAdvertisement\nBiden plans to spend Tuesday night in Scranton before continuing to Pittsburgh on Wednesday morning. He then goes back to the White House, only to return to Pennsylvania on Thursday, this time visiting Philadelphia.\nBy the time the week is over, Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris will have visited the state eight times this year, reflecting its importance to Biden's hopes for a second term.\n'It's hard to draw paths to Biden winning the White House that don't involve Pennsylvania,' said Daniel Hopkins, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania. No Democrat has become president without winning the state since Harry Truman in 1948.\nScranton, the president's first destination, will blend the personal and the political for Biden. He grew up in a three-story colonial home in the Green Ridge neighborhood until his father struggled to find work and moved the family to Delaware when the future president was 10.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough Delaware eventually became the launching pad for Biden's political career, he often returned to Scranton and grounded his autobiography in the city. He visited so often, he was sometimes called 'Pennsylvania's third senator.'\nIn 2020, Biden described the presidential campaign as 'Scranton versus Park Avenue,\" and his reelection team is framing this year's race in a similar way.\n'You've got Joe Biden, who sees the world from the kitchen table where he grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Donald Trump, who sees the world from his country club down in Mar-a-Lago,' said Michael Tyler, the campaign's communications director.\nChristopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, described Scranton as a 'mythical place in political culture,' and it will provide a test for Biden's political appeal.\nAdvertisement\n'It's an area that, on paper, aligns perfectly with the populist gains of the Republican Party during the Trump era,' Borick said.\nHowever, Biden won the city and the surrounding county in 2020. If he's able to carry Scranton and similar places again this year, as well as limit Trump's winning margins in rural areas, Biden may be able to secure another victory in Pennsylvania.\n'Everything is on the margin. Everything that we talk about are small shifts,' Borick said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBiden's pitch on taxes is a key part of his effort to blunt Trump's populist allure.\nWhen Trump was president, he signed into law a series of tax breaks in 2017 that disproportionately benefit the rich. Many of the cuts expire at the end of 2025, and Biden wants to keep a majority of them to fulfill his promise that no one earning less than $400,000 will pay more taxes.\nAdvertisement\nHowever, he also wants to raise $4.9 trillion in revenue over 10 years with higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations. His platform includes a 'billionaire's tax,' which would set a minimum rate of 25% on the income of the richest Americans.\nBiden's travels in Pennsylvania overlap with the start of Trump's first criminal trial, presenting an opportunity and a challenge for the president's campaign.\nTrump is defending himself against criminal charges for a scheme to suppress allegations of affairs with a porn actress and a Playboy model. Biden's team has quietly embraced the contrast of the former president sequestered in a courtroom while the current president has free rein to focus on economic issues that are top of mind for voters.\nHowever, the juxtaposition becomes less helpful if Trump soaks up the country's attention during the first-ever criminal trial of a former president.\nAdvertisement\nBiden campaign officials said they weren't worried about the trial.\n'No matter where Donald Trump is, whether it's in Mar-a-Lago or a courtroom or anywhere else, he'll be focused on himself, his toxic agenda, his campaign of revenge and retribution,' Tyler said. 'That's going to be a continuation of the contrast the American people have been able to see since this campaign began.'\nSam DeMarco, chair of the Republican Party in Allegheny County, where Pittsburgh is located, said Democrats' message is that 'the economy is good, we're just not smart enough to realize it.'\nHowever, DeMarco said, 'across the board, it costs more to live today than it did when Joe Biden came to office.'\n'These are the things that families feel,' he said. 'And a scripted appearance by the president is not going to change that.'\nAdvertisement\nTrump was last in Pennsylvania on Saturday night in Schnecksville, where he described Biden as a 'demented tyrant' and blamed him for all of the country's problems, in addition to his own legal woes.\n'All of America knows that the real blame for this nightmare lies with one person, Crooked Joe Biden,' Trump said.\nHe attacked Biden's tax plans, falsely claiming that 'they're going to raise your taxes by four times.'\nTrump also went on an extended riff about the Civil War battle in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, calling it 'so vicious and horrible, and so beautiful in so many different ways,' and suggesting that the Confederate General Robert E. Lee is 'no longer in favor.'\n___",

Such an agreement was one of several steps to help military and veteran spouses, caregivers and survivors that was laid out in an executive order the Democratic president signed last June at Fort Liberty in North Carolina.\nAdvertisement\nThe White House said the steps announced will help military spouses continue their careers and keep their families together when the servicemember in their household is stationed abroad.",

            "summary": "A super PAC backing independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spent more than $2.4 million on a now-abandoned plan to gather signatures to help him achieve ballot access, without producing anything that will be used by the Kennedy campaign, according to new campaign finance disclosures.\nAmerican Values 2024 announced in December that it would spend between $10 million and $15 million to collect signatures for Kennedy's ballot access in 10 states. The group then expanded the list to 15 states in February, when the Democratic National Committee filed a complaint to the Federal Election Commission arguing that the plan violated campaign finance laws.\nWeeks later, group co-founder Tony Lyons announced a sudden end to the program because, he said, the campaign had signaled publicly it was 'pursuing ballot access in all states.' Lyons said Friday in a statement to The Washington Post that none of the signatures collected by the PAC, including completed petitions for Michigan, Arizona, South Carolina and Georgia, were given to the campaign.\nLyons said Friday in a statement to The Washington Post that none of the signatures collected by the PAC, including completed petitions for Michigan, Arizona, South Carolina and Georgia, were given to the campaign.\nAdvertisement\n'While our PAC could legally gather signatures, we saw no purpose in competing with the campaign. It has become clear that they didn't and don't need our help,' Lyons said. 'As a result, our priorities have shifted, at least for now, toward countering the DNC's desperate attempts to mislead the public with respect to Mr. Kennedy's character and policies.'\nCarlos Sierra, a Kennedy campaign organizer, told other Kennedy backers in a Zoom call this month, that the super PAC's signatures in Arizona would not be used, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by The Post.\n'We are going to be getting Arizona all over again, so those of you that are on this call from Arizona, we are going to have to go back and get those signatures, so don't think it is over yet. It is not,' Sierra said.\nThe Natural Law Party announced Thursday that Kennedy would appear on its Michigan ballot line, which the Michigan secretary of state's office confirmed would give him ballot access in that state, making further signatures there unnecessary. The Kennedy campaign has also scheduled events to continue signature-gathering in South Carolina and Georgia, according to its website.\nAdvertisement\n'We will be collecting our own signatures in every state,' Kennedy campaign spokeswoman Stefanie Spear said. 'We don't collaborate with the PAC. What they do is completely separate from what we do. We don't tell them what to do or know what they are doing unless it is in the press.'\nThe about-face by American Values 2024, which has raised nearly $34 million through the end of March, marks yet another troubled experiment by outside groups seeking to subsidize the costs traditionally borne by candidates themselves, who can raise only limited amounts of money from individuals. An effort by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) to fund much of his presidential campaign with unlimited donations from an outside group, Never Back Down, backfired spectacularly in December because of fundraising shortfalls and strategic disagreements between the group's leaders and the governor's closest allies. He later dropped out of the race.\nPhilanthropist Timothy Mellon, a major donor to former president Donald Trump and other Republican-leaning groups, is the top donor to American Values, with $20 million in contributions. An investment company affiliated with Nicole Shanahan, Kennedy's pick as running mate, gave the group $4 million in January to pay for a pro-Kennedy Super Bowl ad. An adviser to Kennedy, Gavin De Becker, has given or lent the group $14.2 million, of which $9.65 million has been refunded, according to federal records.\nThe idea of splitting the costly and laborious signature-gathering efforts between the campaign and the Kennedy super PAC originated last year, when Kennedy decided to run as an independent and suddenly faced a daunting challenge of gathering nearly 1 million signatures to appear on every ballot as an independent. Early on, there was interest at the campaign about finding a way to offload the significant costs.\nChristine Kramar, Kennedy's first director of ballot access, said she was approached in October by Amaryllis Fox Kennedy, the candidate's daughter-in-law who took over as campaign manager that month, with a question about dividing the signature workload with the super PAC. Campaigns are not allowed by law to privately coordinate most spending with super PACs like American Values 2024, which can accept unlimited donations.\nwith a question about dividing the signature workload with the super PAC. Campaigns are not allowed by law to privately coordinate most spending with super PACs like American Values 2024, which can accept unlimited donations.\nAdvertisement\n'She asked me, could I make for her a spreadsheet of which states the PAC could do and which states the campaign could do. I said, I did not feel comfortable,' said Kramar, who separated from the campaign weeks later and went to work for Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who briefly ran as a Democratic candidate for president. 'I said, I do not want to be in trouble for coordinating with PACs.'\nSpear said the question from Fox Kennedy did not indicate any coordination with American Values.\n'Of course, it was just a hypothetical,' she said.\nLyons said American Values came up with the idea of paying for ballot access on its own. 'We tried to find the most-difficult, most-expensive, most-likely-to-face-a-legal-challenge states,' he said.\nThe DNC filed a complaint in February arguing that the American Values plan violated the law, arguing that state and federal rules presumed that the candidate handles ballot access, making it impossible for a super PAC to assist without illegally coordinating with the campaign.\nAdvertisement\n'Team Kennedy cannot comply with state ballot access laws in the states in which American Values 2024 intends to operate without the group acting ‘in cooperation, consultation or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of' Team Kennedy,' the DNC complaint argued, citing language in U.S. law.\nAt the time, Lyons dismissed the complaint as 'another desperate DNC tactic to defame Kennedy, vilify him and drain his campaign funds.' But about two weeks earlier, on a podcast interview, Deirdre Goldfarb, the general counsel for American Values, acknowledged that the plan to use unlimited money to pay for ballot access was likely to face a legal challenge.\n'This is untested waters,' she said. 'We expect legal challenges. We are geared up for that. It is coming.'\nAt the time of the DNC complaint, Fox Kennedy said in a statement that the Democratic concerns were a 'nonissue' and she was not aware of the campaign receiving any ballot access signatures from American Values.\nAdvertisement\n'I am aware that they have their own signature collection tracker on their public website, but we take our FEC obligation seriously and are not permitted to tell PACs what they should and should not do with their money,' she said in a statement on Feb. 9. 'We are grateful for every last scrap of popular support in meeting these anti-democratic hurdles and intend to follow the precise letter of the law as we clear every one of them.'\nOne of the contractors collecting signatures for the group, Public Appeal LLC, is an affiliate of another petitioning company, Accelevate 2020, whose founder Trey Pool is working with the Kennedy campaign on ballot access. Lyons said all contractors were required to sign a policy requiring them to maintain a firewall with the campaign.\nChristina Tobin, who runs Free and Equal Inc., another ballot access contractor for American Values, said that she understood the PAC's efforts ended because it was clear the campaign was doing the work.",

            "summary": "NAPLES, Italy — The United States informed the government of Niger on Friday that it agreed to its request to withdraw U.S. troops from the West African country, said three U.S. officials, a move the Biden administration had long resisted and one that will transform Washington's counterterrorism posture in the region.\nThe agreement will spell the end of a U.S. troop presence that totaled more than 1,000 and throw into question the status of a $110 million U.S. air base that is only six years old. It is the culmination of a military coup last year that ousted the country's democratically elected government and installed a junta that declared America's military presence there 'illegal.'\n'The Prime Minister has asked us to withdraw U.S. troops, and we have agreed to do that,' a senior State Department official told The Washington Post in an interview. This official, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive situation.\nAdvertisement\nThe decision was sealed in a meeting between Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell and Niger's prime minister, Ali Lamine Zeine, during a meeting earlier Friday.\n'We've agreed to begin conversations within days about how to develop a plan' to withdraw troops, said the senior State Department official. 'They've agreed that we do it in an orderly and responsible way. And we will need to probably dispatch folks to Niamey to sit down and hash it out. And that of course will be a Defense Department project.'\nA Pentagon spokesman did not immediately offer comment.\nThe United States has paused its security cooperation with Niger, limiting U.S. activities — including unarmed drone flights. But U.S. service members have remained in the country, unable to fulfill their responsibilities and feeling left in the dark by leadership at the U.S. Embassy as negotiations continued.\nAdvertisement\nThe Sahel region, including neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso, has become a global hot spot for Islamist extremism in recent years, and Niger saw such attacks spike dramatically following the coup.\nFor years, the Pentagon has deployed a mix of mostly Air Force and Army personnel to Niger to support a mission scrutinizing militant groups in the region. Until the coup last year, the arrangement included counterterrorism drones flights and U.S. and Nigerien troops partnering on some patrols.\nNiger's eviction notice last month followed tense meetings with top officials from the State Department and the Pentagon, whom Nigerien leaders accused of attempting to dictate that the West African nation have no relationship with Iran, Russia or other U.S. adversaries.\nEfforts by top American officials to persuade Niger to get back on a democratic pathway so that U.S. assistance could resume have made little apparent headway.\nAdvertisement\nLast week, at least 100 Russian military instructors arrived in Niamey, marking an escalation of Niger's security relationship with Moscow that analysts said could make it difficult, if not impossible, for the United States to continue its own security cooperation. Reports on Nigerien state television said that the Russian instructors would be providing training and equipment — specifically an air defense system — to Niger.\nThis past weekend, hundreds of protesters gathered in Niamey in what was a largely peaceful demonstration, chanting and waving signs as they called on the American troops to leave.\nWhile the agreement to depart is a significant setback for U.S. officials seeking to maintain a continued military presence, the senior State Department official held out hope that the relationship with Niger could stabilize and bounce back. 'The prime minister repeatedly sought to emphasize that they value the historic partnership with the United States, and that they seek to maintain and deepen our partnership in other sectors,' the official said.",

            "summary": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Paris Hilton joined California state lawmakers Monday to push for legislation aimed at cracking down on the industry that cares for troubled teens by requiring more transparency from youth treatment facilities.\nThe bill supported by the Hilton Hotel heiress and media personality aims to pry open information on how short-term residential facilities for youth dealing with substance abuse and behavioral issues use disciplinary methods such as restraints or seclusion against minors. It would require such centers to notify parents and the state any time they use restrains or seclusion rooms for minors. It's authored by Republican state Sen. Shannon Grove and Democratic state Sens. Aisha Wahab and Angelique Ashby.\n'I know firsthand the horrors that happened behind the closed doors of youth residential treatment facilities,' Hilton said at a Monday news conference at the state Capitol. 'In troubled teen industry facilities in California, Utah and Montana, I was subjected to abuse disguised as therapy, isolated from the outside world and denied even the most basic rights.'\nAdvertisement\nShe added: 'I will fight until every child is safe and keep shining my huge spotlight on these abuses.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nHilton has become a prominent advocate for more oversight and regulation of teen treatment centers after publicly sharing the physical and mental abuse she suffered as a teenager at a boarding school in Utah. She alleged staff members would beat her, force her to take unknown pills, watch her shower and send her to solitary confinement without clothes as punishment.\nIn 2021, her testimony about her experience at Utah's Provo Canyon School helped pass a bill to impose stricter oversight over youth treatment centers in the state. Hilton has also traveled to Washington D.C. to advocate for federal reforms and helped changed laws to protect minors in at least eight states. Earlier this month, she spoke in support of boys sent to a private school for troubled teens in Jamaica.\nAdvertisement\nShe's scheduled to testify in a legislative hearing on California's bill later Monday. Under the bill, facilities would have to report details such as what disciplinary actions were taken, why and who had approved the plan. The state department regulating the facilities also would be required to make public the reports and update the database on the quarterly basis. It would not ban the use of such practices.\nBetween 2015 and 2020, California sent more than 1,240 children with behavior problems to out-of-state facilities due to the lack of locked treatment centers for youths, according to Sen. Grove's office. As reports about abuse happening at these programs emerged, including an incident where a 16-year-old boy died after being restrained for about 12 minutes at a Michigan facility, California also found significant licensing violations at these facilities and decided to do away with the program in 2020. Legislation passed in 2021 formally banned the use of out-of-state residential centers. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom also authorized $8 million to bring all the minors home by last year.\nMinors with behavioral issues are now sent to in-state short-term residential centers, which were created in 2017 to replace group homes. But under current laws, these facilities are not required to share information on how often they use seclusion rooms, restraints, and how many times those methods result in serious injuries or deaths.",
