House Republicans voted to impeach Mayorkas in February over his handling of the southern border by a narrow margin after failing to do so on their first try.\n. House Republicans voted to impeach Mayorkas in February over his handling of the southern border by a narrow margin after failing to do so on their first try. Republicans targeted Mayorkas as soon as they took control of the House last year, blaming the high number of border crossings on the Homeland Security secretary as the party faced pressure from its base to hold the Biden administration accountable on a key campaign issue.\nMultiple constitutional experts, however, have said the evidence Republicans have put forward does not reach the high bar set by the US Constitution of high crimes and misdemeanors. Democrats have argued that the impeachment proceedings have been politically motivated and meritless.\nThe issue now moves to the Senate where Democratic senators \u2014 joined by some Republicans \u2014 have said they expect the chamber will move to dismiss the case before a full trial.\nSenators could be sworn in as jurors as soon as Wednesday if it does not get dismissed outright without holding a trial.\nThe tumultuous way the impeachment process against Mayorkas has played out has led many Republicans to grow even more skeptical about the prospects of impeaching Biden, arguably their top investigative target this Congress. House Republicans do not have the votes or concrete evidence to impeach Biden given their razor-thin majority, leaving that separate impeachment inquiry stalled.\nMayorkas has pushed back against criticism of his leadership, and DHS has called the impeachment effort against him a baseless political attack.\n'Despite warnings from fellow Republicans that this baseless impeachment effort \u2018distorts the Constitution,' House Republicans continue to ignore the facts and undermine the Constitution by wasting even more time on this sham impeachment in the Senate,' a DHS spokesperson said in a statement.\nRepublicans have targeted Mayorkas in an effort to attack Biden and his administration's handling of the southern border. With border crossings reaching record highs and US cities across the country struggling to manage the influx of migrants, immigration has been a political vulnerability for Biden .\n. But the White House is trying to flip the script, citing Republicans blocking a bipartisan border deal as evidence that the party isn't serious about border security.\nAfter months of negotiations, Senate Republicans blocked a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year that would have marked a tough change to immigration law and would have given the president far-reaching powers to restrict illegal migrant crossings at the southern border. The legislation was aimed at closing loopholes in the asylum process, limiting the use of parole for migrants and giving the president new authority to essentially shut down the border to migrants when attempted crossings got too high.\nThe deal faced relentless attacks from former President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, who said the bill would be dead on arrival in his chamber - if it ever made it out of the Senate. Trump, who has made immigration a key plank of his presidential campaign, suggested on Truth Social that approving additional resources for the border would make Republicans 'look bad.'\nReferring to the Mayorkas impeachment proceedings, White House counsel's office spokesman Ian Sams wrote in a memo, 'this effort is a complete waste of time that constitutional and legal experts have said is \u2018unconstitutional' and that even Senate Republicans have made clear they don't want to focus on.'\n'But the worst part is that extreme Republicans have promoted this silly, baseless stunt at the same time they have killed an actual bipartisan border security bill that would have addressed the challenges at the border and delivered needed resources to DHS,' he continued.\nWhen Johnson originally informed Schumer he would be sending the impeachment articles over to the Senate, he laid out why he believed a Mayorkas impeachment was justified. Johnson claimed that Mayorkas directed department employees to violate US immigration laws and argued that the administration's use of parole authority was unlawful.\nHouse Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green of Tennessee who led the House investigation into Mayorkas argued the secretary committed high crimes and misdemeanors that amount to impeachable offenses.\n'These articles lay out a clear, compelling, and irrefutable case for Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' impeachment,' Green said in a statement provided to CNN. 'He has willfully and systemically refused to comply with immigration laws enacted by Congress. He has breached the public trust by knowingly making false statements to Congress and the American people, and obstructing congressional oversight of his department.'\nAnd he has cited Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, arguing that he has indicated Congress could 'employ the weapons of inter-branch warfare,' including impeachment, in light of a Supreme Court ruling that states could not challenge federal immigration law.\nDemocrats have slammed the impeachment effort, saying that policy disagreements are not a justification for the rarely used constitutional impeachment of a Cabinet official.\nLegal scholars have also poured cold water on the legal arguments Republicans are using to support their impeachment effort.\npoured cold water on the legal arguments Republicans are using to support their impeachment effort. Ross Garber, a Tulane University law professor who has represented many Republican officeholders as both the prosecution and defense in impeachment cases, told CNN that House Republicans have not presented evidence of impeachable offenses.\n'I think that what the House Republicans are asserting is that Secretary Mayorkas is guilty of maladministration,' Garber said. 'At least as framed right now, the charges don't rise to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor.'\nFormer DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff, who served under Republican President George W. Bush, wrote in an op-ed, 'as a former federal judge, U.S. attorney and assistant attorney general \u2014 I can say with confidence that, for all the investigating that the House Committee on Homeland Security has done, they have failed to put forth evidence that meets the bar.'\nConstitutional law expert Jonathan Turley, who has been called by Republicans to serve as a witness in hearings, said: 'There is no current evidence he is corrupt or committed an impeachable offense.' More than two dozen law professors wrote in an open letter that impeaching Mayorkas would be 'utterly unjustified as a matter of constitutional law.'\nQuestions remain over Senate trial The question now for Senate Democratic leadership is what a trial will look like and how exactly they will handle the impeachment articles.\nWhile Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has not specified exactly how he plans to handle the trial procedurally, the Senate could pass a motion to dismiss or table the articles on a simple majority vote on Thursday, the same day senators are sworn in. But some hard-right Republican senators are trying to find a way to force a full trial.\nSchumer has previously said that they will wrap up the impeachment trial 'as quickly as possible,' but he did not say if he will move to dismiss or table the articles.\nEven if the Senate does not vote to quickly dismiss, it is highly doubtful the chamber would vote to convict Mayorkas, which would require a two-thirds majority vote \u2013 an exceedingly high bar to clear.\nSenate Majority Whip Dick Durbin noted that he thinks it will be over 'quickly,' and that several Republicans have indicated to him that they don't support convicting Mayorkas.\n'I'm not sure how Chuck's going to approach it. There's two or three procedural opportunities,' he told CNN's Manu Raju. 'I think it will be done quickly. I've talked to some Republicans who candidly don't \u2013 they don't take it very seriously.'\nRepublican Whip John Thune said that Senate Democrats running for reelection in red states would be in a 'difficult position' if they vote to dismiss impeachment charges against Mayorkas when that trial gets underway.\nVoting to dismiss would make Democrats appear they are turning a 'deaf ear and blind eye' to the crisis at the border, he said.\nHe said he expects a 'large majority' of Republicans to vote to have a full trial. But he also acknowledged that it's unlikely all Republicans will vote together on that question and that some Republicans will join Democrats to dismiss the case.\nBut he also acknowledged that it's unlikely all Republicans will vote together on that question and that some Republicans will join Democrats to dismiss the case. Johnson has called on Schumer to not dismiss the articles quickly.\n'We call upon you to fulfill your constitutional obligation to hold this trial' Johnson wrote to Schumer last month. 'To table articles of impeachment without ever hearing a single argument or reviewing a piece of evidence would be a violation of our constitutional order and an affront to the American people whom we all serve.'\nSenate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray, a Democrat of Washington, will oversee the proceedings.\nIn addition to Green, the other House Republicans tapped to serve as impeachment managers in the Senate include: Reps. Michael McCaul of Texas, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Clay Higgins of Louisiana, Ben Cline of Virginia, Michael Guest of Mississippi, Andrew Garbarino of New York, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, August Pfluger of Texas, Harriet Hageman of Wyoming and Laurel Lee of Florida.\nCNN's Ted Barrett and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.\nCNN's Ted Barrett and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Priscilla Alvarez,Annie Grayer","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2148872027.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":7.603063,"_id":"21896be37a5bb335ed18f9f2727edb91"},{"title":"Opinion: Mike Johnson is testing to see if the MAGA Republican fever can be broken","author":"Julian Zelizer","published_date":"2024-04-19 08:34:16","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/19/opinions/mike-johnson-house-maga-republicans-zelizer","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Despite fierce opposition from MAGA Republicans within his caucus, House Speaker Mike Johnson is moving forward with a legislative package to aid Ukraine, a decision that could very well cost his job,\u2026","summary":"Editor's Note: Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst, is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University.

CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson is moving forward with a legislative package to provide aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Despite fierce opposition from MAGA Republicans within his caucus, Johnson has decided that the imperative of the US providing this assistance is more important than pleasing all the members of his caucus.\nWithout this support, international adversaries, including Russia, Iran and China, would read the failure of the US Congress to pass legislation as a sign that MAGA's America First agenda was triumphant. They might conclude that age of internationalism, entrenched into American politics since World War II, had come to an end.\nThe problem for Johnson is that his decision to move forward could very well cost him his job. Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has been beating the drums to vote Johnson, who is himself also an extreme right-wing Republican, out of office. With the new rules adopted by House Republicans when Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California was elected speaker last year, it only takes one member to trigger a vote to 'vacate' the speakership.\nWhen GOP House members adopted this lower threshold in exchange for accepting McCarthy, experts understood that the rule would create extreme instability within the Republican caucus. That proved true in October when McCarthy became the first speaker in American history who was voted out of his position. With the low threshold whoever was speaker would always know that angering just one member could result in their downfall.\nvideo\nvideo Related video SE Cupp: Marjorie Taylor Greene has become irrelevant\nRelated video SE Cupp: Marjorie Taylor Greene has become irrelevant The rule was only one part of the challenge. Since we live in an era where there tend to be extremely narrow congressional majorities, party leaders find themselves in a position where just a few defections could render the passage of legislation impossible without bipartisan support. The choice for Republicans in the House has increasingly become doing nothing or working with Democrats to get things done.\nYet Republican speakers can't really turn to the second option without immense risk. As the Republican Party has shifted dramatically to the right in recent decades there is very little appetite on the red side of the aisle to enter into any kind of deal with the other side. The resistance is both political, for fear of giving the Democrats any kind of victory that could help them gain the majority, and ideological, given that many in the GOP claim that anything their opponents want constitutes a fundamental threat to the country.\nWhile Democrats too have also veered toward the left, the party remains much more ideologically and politically diverse. There is still more tolerance for sometimes working with the other side. This was evident when New York Senator Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries showed willingness to support the stringent bipartisan immigration deal that House Republicans ultimately subverted at the behest of former president and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.\nThe new generation of Republicans have almost no tolerance for leaders who don't follow their command.\nAll of this is made worse by the fact that Republicans have become a political party that has little room for strong, independent leadership. For decades, there has been a willingness to throw leaders overboard rather than providing them with the leeway congressional leaders have historically needed to govern.\nThe trend started as a Republican strategy against Democrats. In 1989, House Minority Leader Newt Gingrich led the way when he toppled Democratic Speaker Jim Wright through an ethics scandal that resulted in Wright's resignation. Although Wright warned colleagues to avoid the 'mindless cannibalism' that he feared was sweeping the chamber, conditions only became worse.\nagainst Democrats. In 1989, House Minority Leader Newt Gingrich led the way when he toppled Democratic Speaker Jim Wright through an ethics scandal that resulted in Wright's resignation. Although Wright warned colleagues to avoid the 'mindless cannibalism' that he feared was sweeping the chamber, conditions only became worse. In the era since 1994, when Republicans have held control of the House numerous times, they have frequently turned on themselves. In 1998, Republicans pressured Gingrich into relinquishing his speakership because the party did poorly in the midterms - as they were impeaching President Bill Clinton - and since Gingrich was having an affair. Gingrich's successor, Louisiana's Rep. Robert Livingston, stepped down before even becoming speaker because of his own affair.\nAlthough Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois would retain the speakership from 1999 to 2007 (he would end his career as a convicted felon and sex offender), Republican speakers are always on thin ice. Hastert's relative longevity was the exception. Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, who helped Tea Party Republicans win office in 2010, struggled with young colleagues, one of whom he later called a 'legislative terrorist,' (fellow Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan), thought he was too open to compromise.\nOn July 28, 2015, Tea Party Republican Rep. Mark Meadows from North Carolina filed a motion to vacate but the House never voted on the resolution. Nonetheless, the pressure was so intense that in September of that year Boehner resigned. 'My first job as speaker,' he said, 'is to protect the institution. It had become clear to me that this prolonged leadership turmoil would do irreparable harm to the institution.' Of course, Boehner only had himself to blame as he had been part of the Gingrich generation that promoted smashmouth partisanship and opened the doors to Tea Party Republicans who he saw as useful and believed he could control.\nBoehner was followed by Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan. As speaker, Ryan unsuccessfully tried to change what he called the 'weapon' of the ability of members to vacate the speakership and spent his four years unable to control the creeping extremism of his colleagues. His tenure ended in 2019 after Democrats retook control of the chamber.\nof the ability of members to vacate the speakership and spent his four years unable to control the creeping extremism of his colleagues. His tenure ended in 2019 after Democrats retook control of the chamber. Elected as speaker in 2023, McCarthy only held the seat for 269 days before the GOP voted him out for working with Democrats to keep the government open. His became the third shortest speakership in American history, only longer than Speaker Michael Kerr who passed away in the middle of his term (1876) and Speaker Theodore Pomeroy who was elected in 1869, the final day of the 40 th Congress.\nth Congress. The time of Republican speakership keeps shrinking as right-wing ousters have become increasingly common. In a party that has become hyperpolarized, respect for stability, governance and compromise has gone out the window. Republican speakers have to toe the line. If they don't, they are likely to be shown the exit.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook The long and short-term changes have produced a party in the House of Representatives that is almost incapable of producing strong leaders, rendering the GOP unstable, toxic and destructive. But the costs are not just internal.\nA functional House depends on having two parties that can maintain some internal order and deliver when it comes to deal-making. Functionality depends on two parties with strong leaders that are ultimately committed to governance as a shared central goal.\nWhen this imperative breaks down within one party, as we are seeing in 2024, the risks to the nation increase as each speaker in the GOP must confront the choice of moving forward with legislation that is in the interest of most of the chamber or relinquishing their power. It has become an either-or proposition.\nJohnson is now testing the waters to see if the fever can be broken.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Julian Zelizer,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap24108830220202.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":7.417204,"_id":"9b4cb8f34357ab68b5baa11d81665864"},{"title":"Senate set\u00a0for showdown over Mayorkas impeachment articles","author":"Clare Foran","published_date":"2024-04-17 10:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/17/politics/senate-mayorkas-impeachment-articles","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The Senate is set for a showdown over the articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas as Democrats are expected to move quickly to dismiss the articles, while\u2026","summary":"The Senate is set for a showdown over the articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas as Democrats are expected to move quickly to dismiss the articles, while Republicans insist there must be a full trial.\nThe House transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate on Tuesday and senators are expected to be sworn in as jurors Wednesday.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has not specified exactly how he plans to handle the trial procedurally.

The Biden appointee became the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.\nThere was less drama in the upper chamber, where the proceedings ended a few hours after they began following votes, mostly along party lines, to declare unconstitutional the two articles of impeachment against Mayorkas \u2013 one for 'willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law' and another for 'breach of public trust.' Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski was the lone Republican holdout, voting present on the first article.\nThe blink-and-you-missed it Senate trial marked the culmination of a mostly failed political gambit hatched by House Republicans seeking to cast the limelight on the Biden administration's handling of the southern border ahead of the general election. But the merits of the case they hoped to bring to the Senate were widely seen as lacking substance and, to some, a distraction from other election year messaging. House GOP claims that Mayorkas, the first Latino and immigrant to hold the job, committed high crimes and misdemeanors never passed muster with constitutional experts, who said the evidence against him failed to clear that high bar.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer opened the proceedings by offering a time agreement to Republicans that would have allowed a certain amount of floor debate and votes on trial resolutions and points of order before an eventual vote to dismiss the case.\nBut Republican Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri objected, saying he would not agree to a proposal that would have concluded the matter with the 'unprecedented' step of ending an impeachment case without a trial. Many Republicans wanted an agreement because it would have allowed them to make floor speeches targeting Democrats over the process and the situation at the border. Absent that, speeches would only have been allowed to those who got unanimous consent from their colleagues \u2013 an unlikely scenario given the political stakes of the moment.\nSchumer then made a motion to table, or kill, the first impeachment article because 'it does not allege conduct that rises to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor' as required in the Constitution. After several rounds of procedural votes, the Senate passed that motion 51-48 with one voting present, killing the first article of impeachment.\nAfter several more procedural votes, Schumer's motion to table the second article was also approved, killing the second article of impeachment by a party line vote of 51-49.\nThe House transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate on Tuesday and senators were sworn in as jurors Wednesday. It was highly doubtful that the chamber would vote to convict, which would require a two-thirds majority vote \u2013 an exceedingly high bar to clear.\nDemocrats had slammed the impeachment as a political stunt, saying that Republicans had no valid basis for the move and that policy disagreements were not a justification for the rarely used constitutional impeachment of a Cabinet official.\n'We want to address this issue as expeditiously as possible,' Schumer said in floor remarks on Tuesday. 'Impeachment should never be used to settle a policy disagreement.'\nHe added, 'Talk about awful precedents. This would set an awful precedent for Congress. Every time there's a policy agreement in the House, they send it over here and tie the Senate in knots to do an impeachment trial? That's absurd. That's an abuse of the process. That is more chaos.'\nA number of congressional Republicans, however, criticized the prospect of a quick dismissal or move to table.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that senators had a 'rare' and 'solemn' responsibility to consider the impeachment articles and said he would oppose any effort to table the articles.\n'As befits such a solemn and rare responsibility as convening a court of impeachment, I intend to give these charges my full and undivided attention,' he said.\nThe Kentucky Republican added, 'It would be beneath the Senate's dignity to shrug off our clear responsibility and fail to give the charges we'll hear today the thorough consideration they deserve. I will strenuously oppose any effort to table the articles of impeachment and avoid looking the Biden administration's border crisis squarely in the face.'\nAdditionally, some hard-right Republican senators were trying to find a way to force a full trial, but their efforts did not get enough traction to pass as procedural vote after procedural vote failed along party lines.\nRepublicans targeted Mayorkas as soon as they took control of the House, blaming the high number of border crossings on the Homeland Security secretary as the party faced pressure from its base to go after the Biden administration on a key campaign issue.\nMayorkas has pushed back against criticism of his leadership, and DHS has called the impeachment effort against him a baseless political attack.\nThe White House, for its part, had worked to flip the script, citing Republicans blocking a bipartisan border deal in the Senate as evidence that the party isn't serious about border security.\nWhite House and Homeland Security officials were in frequent communication over the course of the impeachment inquiry into Mayorkas, gaming out strategy and response as they publicly cast the trial as a political stunt. Since Republicans launched their effort to oust the Homeland Security secretary, Biden administration officials have maintained that Mayorkas planned to stay in the post, dismissing the GOP impeachment inquiry into the DHS chief as 'meritless.'\nInstead, White House and Homeland Security officials deployed a split-screen strategy, like casting the House majority's proceedings as a waste of time while Mayorkas worked with senators to strike a border deal.\nAfter months of negotiations, Senate Republicans earlier this year blocked that major bipartisan border deal that would have marked a tough change to immigration law and would have given the president far-reaching powers to restrict illegal migrant crossings at the southern border.\nThe deal faced a torrent of attacks from former President Donald Trump and top House Republicans.\nThe Department of Homeland Security and White House praised Senate Democrats for killing the impeachment proceedings.\n'Once and for all, the Senate has rightly voted down this baseless impeachment that even conservative legal scholars said was unconstitutional,' said Ian Sams, White House spokesperson for oversight and investigations. 'President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas will continue doing their jobs to keep America safe and pursue actual solutions at the border, and Congressional Republicans should join them, instead of wasting time on baseless political stunts while killing real bipartisan border security reforms.'\n'As he has done throughout more than 20 years of dedicated public service, Secretary Mayorkas will continue working every day to enforce our laws and protect our country,' added Mia Ehrenberg, a spokesperson for DHS. 'It's time for Congressional Republicans to support the Department's vital mission instead of wasting time playing political games and standing in the way of commonsense, bipartisan border reforms.'\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.

The result came one week after the stunning loss House Republicans suffered when they last tried to impeach Mayorkas and GOP defections and an absence sank the initial floor vote, a move Republicans had hoped to use to spotlight the Biden administration's handling of the southern border. The impeachment also came as House Republicans have faced building pressure from their base to hold President Joe Biden and his departments and agencies accountable over immigration and border security policies. House Republicans claim Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors for his handling of the southern border, even though several constitutional experts have said the evidence does not reach that high bar. Only one Cabinet official has previously been impeached in American history: Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876. The House impeachment vote was 214 to 213. Three Republicans \u2013 Ken Buck of Colorado, Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, and Tom McClintock of California \u2013 voted with Democrats against the measure. The Department of Homeland Security said that House Republicans 'will be remembered by history for trampling on the Constitution' following the vote to impeach.

A number of far-right House Republicans were quick to shoot down the immigration legislation, dispelling any hope that the border provisions would placate Johnson's right flank. Here is the note Johnson sent to members moments ago: 'After significant Member feedback and discussion, the House Rules Committee will be posting soon today the text of three bills that will fund America's national security interests and allies in Israel, the Indo-Pacific, and Ukraine, including a loan structure for aid, and enhanced strategy and accountability.\nThese will be brought to the floor under a structured rule that will allow for an amendment process, alongside a fourth bill that includes the REPO Act, TikTok bill, sanctions and other measures to confront Russia, China, and Iran.\nThe Rules Committee will also be posting text on a border security bill that includes the core components of H.R.2, under a separate rule that will allow for amendments.\nText of the first three bills will be posted shortly, while the fourth bill under the same rule will be posted later today.

'We cannot resource ourselves \u2013 we need Congress to do so,' Mayorkas continued on Wednesday. 'We cannot change a broken immigration system, only Congress can do so.' Senate Republicans derailed a bipartisan border deal crafted in part by their colleague, Sen. James Lankford, in February, that would have expanded the powers of the federal government to address the influx of migrants entering the country. The White House has considered executive action to enact tougher border policies reminiscent of the toppled Senate legislation.

The Kentucky Republican added: 'It would be beneath the Senate's dignity to shrug off our clear responsibility and fail to give the charges we'll hear today the thorough consideration they deserve. I will strenuously oppose any effort to table the articles of impeachment and avoid looking the Biden administration's border crisis squarely in the face.'\nAdditionally, some hard-right Republican senators are trying to find a way to force a full trial, but their efforts are not expected to get enough traction to pass, according to senators and aides from both parties.\nCNN's Manu Raju contributed to this report.\nCNN's Manu Raju contributed to this report. 1 hr 58 min ago From CNN's Priscilla Alvarez\nWhite House and Homeland Security officials have been in frequent communication over the course of the impeachment inquiry into Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. They are gaming out a strategy and response as they publicly cast the trial as a political stunt.\nMayorkas emerged as a top target of Republicans over the Biden administration's border policies early on. Since Republicans launched their effort to oust the Homeland Security secretary, Biden administration officials have maintained that Mayorkas planned to stay in the post, dismissing the GOP impeachment inquiry into the DHS chief as 'meritless.'\nInstead, White House and Homeland Security officials deployed a split-screen strategy, including casting the House majority's proceedings as a waste of time while Mayorkas worked with senators to strike a border deal.\n\"This effort is a complete waste of time that constitutional and legal experts have said is \u2018unconstitutional' and that even Senate Republicans have made clear they don't want to focus on,\" Ian Sams, the spokesperson of the White House counsel's office, wrote in a memo in relation to the Mayorkas impeachment proceedings. What Mayorkas is doing today: As senators plot their next steps Wednesday, Mayorkas will be in New York City for a nationwide awareness campaign to combat online child exploitation and abuse. Mayorkas has maintained that his focus is on the department's work, including pointing to recent testimony on the Hill to shore up additional funds for DHS.\nWhat Mayorkas is doing today: As senators plot their next steps Wednesday, Mayorkas will be in New York City for a nationwide awareness campaign to combat online child exploitation and abuse.

J. Scott Applewhite/AP Republicans targeted Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas as soon as they took control of the House, blaming the high number of border crossings on the official as the party faced pressure from its base to go after the Biden administration on a key campaign issue.\nMultiple constitutional experts, however, have said the evidence Republicans have put forward for impeachment does not reach the high bar of high crimes and misdemeanors set by the US Constitution.\nMayorkas has pushed back against criticism of his leadership, and the Department of Homeland Security has called the impeachment effort against him a baseless political attack. The White House, for its part, has worked to flip the script, citing Republicans blocking a bipartisan border deal in the Senate as evidence that the party isn't serious about border security.\nAfter months of negotiations, Senate Republicans blocked a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year that would have marked a tough change to immigration law and would have given the president far-reaching powers to restrict illegal migrant crossings at the southern border. The deal faced a torrent of attacks from former President Donald Trump and top House Republicans.\nCNN's Manu Raju contributed reporting to this post.\nCNN's Manu Raju contributed reporting to this post. 2 hr 21 min ago From CNN's Avery Lotz\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas testifies before the House Homeland Security Committee about the Biden Administration's FY2025 budget request in the Cannon House Office Building on Capitol Hill on April 16, in Washington, DC.Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas called on Congress to pass bipartisan border reform legislation Wednesday as the Senate prepares to consider articles of impeachment brought against him by the House.\n'As they work on impeachment, I work in advancing the mission of the Department of Homeland Security \u2013 that's what I've done throughout this process,' Mayorkas said on 'CBS Mornings.' 'We need Congress to pass the bipartisan legislation that a group of Senators worked on. That is the enduring solution.'

That includes voting last week for a House Freedom Caucus-backed amendment to a foreign surveillance law. Emmer was the only member of GOP leadership to support the provision, which ultimately failed. And Emmer also traveled to Pennsylvania over the weekend to attend a roundtable and reception with Trump ahead of his rally in the state, multiple sources told CNN.\n'Tom was very well praised by the president. \u2026 He was very pleased to see the whip there,' Rep. Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania, who was also in attendance, told CNN. 'A lot of people were happy to see the whip there.'\nAsked about Trump burying the hatchet with Emmer and recently endorsing him, Meuser said: 'I handed it to Trump for doing that.'\nIn recent days, proxies close to Emmer have also reached out to some Republicans to gauge his standing inside the conference, according to three sources, including a GOP leadership aide. Neither Emmer nor his office have been making any calls on his behalf, and Emmer has made clear he is firmly against a motion to vacate the speaker's chair. Still, sources believe Emmer is working to improve his stock inside both the House GOP and MAGA world, and keeping his options open for the future.\n'They're testing the waters,' the GOP leadership aide told CNN.\nAnother potential contender who sources believe could run for the top job in the next Congress: House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, who also mounted an unsuccessful bid for speaker last year. Jordan has publicly backed Johnson and wants him to keep his job. But the Ohio Republican is still beloved by conservatives, and sources believe he could have a strong case to lead the conference next year \u2013 especially if Trump is back in the White House.\nOthers who could be waiting in the wings: House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who also previously ran for speaker, and House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, a top Trump ally.\nBut working to Johnson's advantage, at least in this Congress: the GOP's inability to get behind a successor, as well as Democrats signaling they'd be willing to save him if a motion to vacate were to come to the floor.\nStill, the quiet maneuvering inside the House GOP conference shows a level of uncertainty among Republicans about the long-term political future of Johnson, who unexpectedly came into the job after the unprecedented ouster of their last speaker, Kevin McCarthy.\nAnd those conversations could soon intensify, particularly after GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky announced Tuesday he was signing on to the motion to vacate led by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia \u2013 a precarious development for Johnson in a shrinking majority. The speaker will not be able to lose more than one Republican on party-line votes.\n'It keeps bubbling around,' one GOP lawmaker said of the quiet discussions about a potential Johnson successor.\nSome Republicans are now privately \u2013 and in some cases, publicly \u2013 questioning whether Johnson will be able to hang on to his post next Congress, especially if he needs Democrats to bail him out this year. There's ample uncertainty about what the mood will be next year, which could depend on the election results in November.\n'He's definitely not going to be speaker next Congress if we're lucky enough to have a majority. I think that is a widely held belief throughout the Congress,' Greene told CNN.\nBut in terms of what happens during the remainder of this session, Greene was less definitive: 'That is to be determined.'\nFor his part, Johnson insisted he would not need Democratic support to hold onto his gavel, telling reporters they would 'work this out.'\nBut he also referred to himself as a 'wartime speaker' \u2013 a recognition of the embattled role he finds himself in \u2013 and warned Republicans that a motion to vacate 'is not helpful to the cause.'\n'I am not resigning. And it is in my view an absurd notion that someone would bring a vacate motion when we are simply here trying to do our jobs,' he told reporters Tuesday. 'We need steady leadership. We need steady hands on the wheel.'\nAfter Emmer's speakership bid was derailed at the hands of Trump in just hours \u2013 with the former president slamming Emmer as a 'RINO,' an acronym for 'Republican in name only' \u2013 the Minnesota Republican recognized he needed to repair their frayed relationship to preserve his political future, according to sources close to him.\nAs part of his effort to curry favor with the former president, Emmer endorsed Trump ahead of the Iowa caucuses in January, which sources say Trump relished in and marked a key turning point in their relationship.\nwhich sources say Trump relished in and marked a key turning point in their relationship. Trump soon returned the favor, endorsing Emmer for reelection in April and calling the congressman 'fantastic.' One month earlier, Emmer hosted a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago, where sources say Trump praised his leadership. Trump also tapped Emmer to serve as Minnesota state chair of his 2024 campaign, in another sign of their improved ties.\nSources say Emmer has also been attempting to make inroads with key conservative hardliners in the House, talking to members of the House Freedom Caucus constantly on the floor and showing support for issues they care deeply about.\nAnd Emmer has also ramped up his fundraising, which could be another selling point for any future leadership bid. Emmer's team touted that he raised $7.2 million for GOP candidates and incumbents in the first quarter of the year \u2013 a record for the Minnesota Republican.\nFor his part, Emmer has expressed support for Johnson amid threats to his speakership, even as he has shown some distance from all the drama. When asked Tuesday if he was frustrated by the threats, Emmer said: 'My job is to count votes, make sure our people are getting the information they need, we are going to get stuff done.'\nPressed on why it's important for Johnson to keep his job, Emmer said: 'Again, we are going to be focused on the things we have in front of us this week, we have some great bills on the floor tonight and tomorrow, we are waiting to see text on the supplemental.'\nMeanwhile, Johnson has been making his own moves to shore up support from Trump to counter Greene, one of Trump's most vocal congressional allies.\nJohnson has been making his own moves to shore up support from Trump to counter Greene, one of Trump's most vocal congressional allies. Johnson trekked down to Mar-a-Lago last week to deliver a joint press conference on so-called 'election integrity,' which was Johnson's idea, as CNN previously reported. And as the Louisiana Republican pitches his conference on foreign aid legislation, he also has been working to keep Trump in the loop on his plans, sources said.\nDuring the press conference, Johnson got some key backup from the former president.\n'I stand with the speaker,' said Trump, who also called the continued threat of a motion to vacate 'unfortunate.'\nAsked Tuesday if he would protect Johnson, Trump said, 'Well, we'll see what happens with that,' adding, 'I think he's a very good person.'\nSources say Trump is not interested in another messy speaker fight, worried it could undermine Republicans ahead of November. And a large swath of the House GOP conference agrees.\nRepublicans descended into a round of angry finger pointing Tuesday after Greene's effort to oust Johnson grew by one.\nRep. Marc Molinaro, a swing district New York Republican, told CNN that the push to vacate Johnson was an 'absolutely ridiculous concept,' adding, 'The concept of another motion to vacate is an utter waste of time, and frankly a distraction from really important business. It hopefully has no ability to move forward.'\nAnother GOP lawmaker told CNN that Republicans should accept the hand they have been dealt: 'We have Johnson and we did it to ourselves. Every decision we as a conference make should be in the best interest of getting the White House back in 2024. Period!'\nAnd the scars still run deep from the protracted speakership fight following McCarthy's ousting, which exposed internal divisions and left the House paralyzed for three weeks.\nLouisiana GOP Rep. Garret Graves warned against the idea of ousting Johnson without another speaker candidate waiting in the wings.\n'I don't think that the threat is really real at this point, just because you don't have an alternative. We saw what happened last fall, whenever this all went down. There's not an alternative,' Graves said. 'I don't think that folks are going to go through it at this point.'\nJordan also insisted that Republicans needed to fall in line behind Johnson, telling CNN of threats to oust the speaker, 'We don't need that. No way, no way. We don't want that. We shouldn't go through that again.'\nMorgan Rimmer and Haley Talbot contributed to this report.\nMorgan Rimmer and Haley Talbot contributed to this report.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Annie Grayer,Manu Raju,Melanie Zanona","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2148848516.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":7.2549396,"_id":"5910044fa1ecbdd408c0895c4d51d020"},{"title":"Arizona Republicans weigh options to defeat abortion rights ballot measure, draft proposal reveals","author":"Arit John","published_date":"2024-04-15 22:32:53","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/15/politics/arizona-republicans-abortion-ballot-measures","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Arizona Republicans are weighing their options to defeat a potential abortion rights ballot initiative this fall, including offering measures of their own that could draw support away from efforts to\u2026","summary":"Arizona Republicans are weighing their options to defeat a potential abortion rights ballot initiative this fall, including offering measures of their own that could draw support away from efforts to enshrine access to the procedure in the state constitution, according to a draft proposal obtained by CNN.\nUnder the proposal, Republicans could introduce two ballot initiatives that would restrict abortion to either six weeks or the beginning of the 15th week of pregnancy.\nThe proposal, drafted by Linley Wilson, the general counsel to Arizona House Republicans, comes days after the Arizona Supreme Court revived a 160-year-old near-total abortion ban. Arizona for Abortion Access, a coalition of abortion rights advocates, has gathered more than 500,000 signatures to put a constitutional amendment on the November ballot that would protect abortion until fetal viability, which doctors believe is around 22 to 24 weeks.\nArizona Republicans have been under intense pressure to address abortion rights following last week's state Supreme Court decision, which revived an 1864 law that bans abortion except to save the life of the pregnant person and threatens doctors with two- to five-year prison sentences.\n'The document presents ideas drafted for internal discussion and consideration within the caucus,' House GOP Speaker Ben Toma said in a statement. 'I've publicly stated that we are looking at options to address this subject, and this is simply part of that.'\nThe memo suggests that one of the 'pros' of the strategy would be to make it 'more likely that the [Arizona for Abortion Access] Initiative will fail' due to the vote being split, Wilson wrote. One downside, she added, would be that the initiatives would 'transfe[r] regulation of abortion from the Legislature to voters.'\nThe ballot initiatives mentioned were part of a multiphase approach designed to either block the passage of the Arizona for Abortion Access initiative or protect lawmakers' ability to regulate abortion access.\nAbortion rights groups have had success with ballot initiatives put to voters since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The memo references several ballot initiatives abortion rights advocates are seeking to pass across the country, including the one in Arizona.\nArizona for Abortion Access blasted the draft strategy memo, calling it a political scheme designed to create chaos.\n'This shows yet again why Arizonans can't leave our most basic and personal rights in the hands of politicians,' the group said in a statement.\nIn the wake of the state Supreme Court decision last week, House Republicans gaveled out early to block Democrats from rolling back the ban. The legislature is scheduled to meet again on Wednesday.\nRepublicans in competitive races in the state, including former President Donald Trump and Senate candidate Kari Lake, have called on the GOP-led legislature to work with Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs on a fix.\nBut the proposal sent by Wilson would take Republicans down a different path. It argues Republicans should pursue a 'Phase One' and consider 'Phase Two' to change the 'narrative' and show the party has a 'plan,' as well as 'potentially pull votes from [Arizona for Abortion Access] Initiative.'\nUnder the proposed Phase 1, lawmakers would first add a measure to the November ballot that would allow lawmakers to regulate certain practices, including requiring parental consent or a court order for minors seeking abortions and only allowing physicians to perform the procedure, which would exist alongside the fetal viability amendment.\nUnder the proposed Phase 2, the legislature would refer the six-week ban and a second measure the memo describes as 'a 14-week law disguised as a 15-week law because it would only allow abortion until the beginning of the 15th week.'\nThe proposal also includes an alternative to Phase 2, under which lawmakers would refer a conditional enactment of the abortion rights ballot initiative, stating it is 'not absolute,' and allow for laws regulating abortion for reasons including the 'mitigation of fetal pain.'\nAny ballot initiative referred by the Republican-led legislature would not need the signature of Hobbs. But it's not clear if Republicans, who hold razor thin majorities in the state House and Senate, will have enough support to enact the plan laid out.\nThe memo, however, ends with a meme featuring talk show host Seth Meyers that says: 'Boom. Easy as that.'\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\nThis story has been updated with additional details.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Arit John,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-ap24102780914169.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":7.252286,"_id":"40cf742a7da099e0101bfbf76e0e8f6a"},{"title":"Full jury panel selected for Trump trial","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-20 02:19:07","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/the-lead-with-jake-tapper/episodes/de56cfc4-a9ba-11ee-89c8-77342e90860c","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"A horrific scene outside of Trump's New York City courthouse after a man lit himself on fire while inside the courthouse there was a major development in the hush money trial.

Their GOP counterparts, the Congressional Leadership Fund, along with its affiliate, American Action Network, announced a combined fundraising haul of $30 million in the first quarter. The groups are set to play pivotal roles in the upcoming House contests, devoting tens of millions of dollars to independent expenditures.\nDemocrats also have a fundraising edge when it comes to the candidates themselves. First-quarter FEC filings showed that in 20 of 22 races rated as 'toss-ups' by the Cook Political Report \u2013 its most competitive category \u2013 the lead Democratic candidate outraised the lead Republican candidate. Many of the Democratic candidates, hauling in millions, hailed from highly competitive seats in California and New York, critical sections of the House map.\nAdding to the pressure, House Republicans are still dealing with the fallout from leadership fights as they seek to defend their razor-thin majority. During his first full quarter as speaker, Mike Johnson struggled to keep pace with the fundraising of his predecessor, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who was ousted last year. Johnson hauled in $20 million for House Republicans in the first quarter, while McCarthy raised at least $30 million for the party in the first quarter of the previous two years.\nAnd the leadership drama appears poised to drag on. With less funds to distribute to the party than his predecessor \u2013 a key lever of influence \u2013 Johnson faces threats to his job as he has sought to advance legislation on Capitol Hill.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has led an effort to potentially oust the speaker amid disputes over foreign aid and the renewal of a foreign surveillance law. Johnson has said he will not resign, and on Thursday, he took the extraordinary step of relying on Democratic votes to move advance a package providing foreign aid for Ukraine and Israel. Greene left the US Capitol on Friday following the vote without moving to oust Johnson.\nMeanwhile, a conservative dark money group, American Prosperity Alliance, launched new ads this week targeting three House Republicans who had voted to oust McCarthy, slamming their voting records. It is spending about $700,000 on the ad campaign, which is set to run through the rest of the month, another example of costly intraparty divisions.\nDemocrats, for their part, are prepping massive fall advertising reservations. House Majority PAC, the lead Democratic super PAC, announced earlier this month plans to spend $186 million on advertising campaigns targeting a series of key battleground races.\nThe group, whose 2024 investment surpasses the $102 million initially reserved in ads in the 2022 cycle and the $41 million in the 2020 cycle, said it was making its largest investment ever to flood key districts with an aggressive ad campaign, including attacks against Republicans on abortion and the collapse of a bipartisan border security deal.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,David Wright","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2115165051.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":7.1693587,"_id":"f526121bb9bed9cbbf6cfaadcd4855a1"},{"title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene calls on Johnson to resign after foreign aid bills pass: \u2018If he doesn't do so, he will be vacated'","author":"Veronica Stracqualursi","published_date":"2024-04-21 16:18:59","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/21/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-calls-on-johnson-to-resign-after-house-approves-ukraine-aid","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Republican Rep.

He needs to do the right thing to resign and allow us to move forward in a controlled process. If he doesn't do so, he will be vacated,' Greene said on Fox News' 'Sunday Morning Futures.'\nAfter months of resisting putting a foreign aid bill on the House floor, Johnson joined with Democrats on Saturday to advance a $95 billion foreign aid package, which contains $61 billion for Ukraine and regional partners. The legislation \u2013 which passed with the support of 210 Democrats and 101 Republicans \u2013 now heads to the Senate, which is expected to give final approval this week.\nShould Greene and her supporters make good on their threat to force a vote on ousting him as speaker, Johnson will almost certainly need to rely on Democrats to bail him out.\nThe Georgia hardliner is one of at least three Republicans who have said they will support a move to oust Johnson \u2014 whose majority is so slim he cannot afford to lose any Republicans on a party-line vote.\nJohnson maintains that he has not asked any Democrats for their help, but senior Republicans believe they will be able to count on support across the aisle to swiftly kill any motion to vacate the speaker's chair \u2013 a feeling that may have bolstered Johnson's confidence in pressing ahead with his plans.\nIt is still unclear whether Democrats will throw him a lifeline.

Big donors began writing six-figure checks to support a new fundraising arrangement he established with the Republican National Committee and state parties after he became his party's presumptive nominee last month.\nThe Trump 47 Committee, as the new joint operation is known, reported raising more than $23 million in the first quarter of the year \u2013 including from nearly two dozen people who donated at least $600,000 apiece to the effort.\nRelated article Takeaways from the first day of the Trump hush money trial\nRelated article Takeaways from the first day of the Trump hush money trial Those Republican megadonors included TD Ameritrade founder J. Joe Ricketts, former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler and billionaire investor John Paulson, who hosted a Trump fundraiser earlier this month that the campaign said brought in $50.5 million for Trump and the GOP.\nThe committee transferred about $10 million to the RNC, which had started the election year facing a serious cash crunch.\nThe Trump 47 Committee \u2013 formalized last month \u2013 is also designed to direct money to Save America, a leadership PAC that the former president has relied on to help pay his personal legal bills, but the filing covering January 1 through March 31 did not show any immediate transfers to Save America.\nA separate and long-standing Trump committee, called the Trump Save America Joint Fundraising Committee, reported bringing in more than $65 million during the first quarter of this year.\nMonday's filings offer a partial snapshot of the fundraising and spending by Trump's political organization. Other groups in his orbit are slated to file reports later this week.\nTrump is scrambling to catch up with President Joe Biden's financial operation. Biden and the Democratic Party previously reported bringing in $90 million in March, far surpassing the $65.6 million that Trump reported raising with the Republican Party in that month alone.\nBiden said his team entered April \u2013 and the general election showdown \u2013 with a war chest of $192 million, more than double the cash stockpile Trump and the GOP announced.\nBiden has used that financial advantage to start spending heavily \u2013 as he tries to combat persistently low approval ratings and gain a polling advantage over Trump.\nIn March alone, the president's principal campaign committee reported more than $29 million in disbursements \u2013 more than four times the roughly $6.3 million the campaign spent during the previous month, according to a report filed late Monday.\nAmong the big-ticket items: Nearly $21.8 million to produce and place campaign ads. Another $1.7 million went to 'text message outreach.'\nThe campaign's report was not due to federal regulators until Saturday, but the Biden campaign filed it early \u2013 alongside reports for other parts of his political apparatus.\nDemocrats dominated CNN's most recent list of the top 10 Senate seats most likely to flip, with the most of the races taking place in states that either Trump carried or Biden narrowly won four years ago.\nBut at least in the money race, FEC records show the Democratic incumbents or front-runners in these battleground states well armed for the fall fight, several of whom are likely to face wealthy Republican challengers.\nIn Montana, vulnerable Democratic Sen. Jon Tester raised $8 million in the first quarter and ended March with $12.7 million in the bank. In Ohio, Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown reported a first-quarter haul of more than $12 million, which his campaign touted as an Ohio record, and entered April with nearly $16 million on hand. Both senators are running in states that backed Trump twice and have drawn wealthy GOP challengers who have already put in seven-figure sums into their campaigns.\nOther Democratic incumbents posting big hauls in the first quarter include Pennsylvania's Bob Casey ($5.7 million), Wisconsin's Tammy Baldwin ($5.4 million) and Nevada's Jacky Rosen ($5 million, which her campaign touted as a quarterly record for the state). Casey and Baldwin are facing Republican challengers who have demonstrated strong self-funding capabilities, while the GOP front-runner to take on Rosen is Purple Heart recipient Sam Brown, who raised $2.4 million in the first quarter.\nDemocratic candidates in open battleground seats also took in massive sums during the first quarter. In Arizona, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego significantly outraised his likely GOP opponent, 2022 gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake, $7.5 million to $4.1 million. And Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin took in about four times the amount raised by former Rep. Mike Rogers, the leading GOP candidate, $4.4 million to $1.1 million.\nAwaiting several of these Democrats in the fall will be GOP challengers hailing from a variety of business backgrounds and some with net worths in the hundreds of millions.\nOhio businessman Bernie Moreno, who, buoyed by a Trump endorsement, clinched the GOP nomination to take on Brown last month, loaned his campaign $1.5 million in the first quarter, bringing his total self-funding so far this cycle to $4.5 million.\nIn Montana, entrepreneur and retired Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, who appears well positioned to win the GOP nod in June, has loaned his campaign nearly $1.5 million so far, including $500,000 in the first quarter.\nFormer hedge fund executive Dave McCormick, who recently secured Trump's support, made a nearly $1 million first-quarter loan to his campaign in Pennsylvania. (He loaned his unsuccessful 2022 bid for the state's other Senate seat more than $14 million.) And in Wisconsin, Republican bank executive Eric Hovde lent his campaign $8 million since launching his challenge to Baldwin in February, according to the latest reports.\nThe presence of these self-funding Republicans could help ease pressure on national party finances and offset what has been a recurrent disadvantage for the GOP, which has struggled to match Senate Democrats' powerful small-dollar fundraising machine.\nMeanwhile, the biggest self-funder by far this cycle is Maryland Rep. David Trone, who is seeking to succeed retiring fellow Democrat Ben Cardin. The owner and founder of Total Wine and More, Trone reported loaning his campaign $18.5 million in the first quarter, his fillings show, bringing his self-funding total for the cycle to almost $41.8 million \u2013 a Senate primary record.\nTrone's main challenger for the Democratic nomination is Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, who hauled in $2.1 million during the first three months of the year. The race, which debuted on CNN's Senate rankings this month, has taken on added importance with the entry of Republican Larry Hogan, a popular former governor who has raised GOP hopes in the deep-blue state.\nA competitive fight is also underway for control of the US House as Republicans look to hold on to their narrow majority, which has been further eroded - at least temporarily - through a series of member exits in recent months.\nRelated card Why the race for the House is the one to watch in 2024\nRelated card Why the race for the House is the one to watch in 2024 Across several battleground districts, the first-quarter reports show House Democratic candidates matching their Senate counterparts in the money race. Of the 22 races rated as 'Toss Up' contests by The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter, the top Democratic fundraiser overperformed the top Republican in 20 of them during the first quarter.\nMany of these Republican incumbents are from either California (John Duarte, David Valadao, Mike Garcia and Ken Calvert) and New York (Anthony D'Esposito, Mike Lawler and Marc Molinaro). The two states collectively host the biggest concentration of GOP lawmakers holding seats that Biden would have won in 2020. All the Republicans mentioned above, save for Calvert, fit this definition.\nMeanwhile, vulnerable Democratic incumbents posted bigger first-quarter hauls than their top GOP challengers in several battleground races, including in Ohio (Marcy Kaptur and Emilia Sykes), Pennsylvania (Susan Wild and Matt Cartwright), Colorado (Yadira Caraveo), Maine (Jared Golden), North Carolina (Don Davis) and Washington state (Marie Gluesenkamp Perez).\nSeveral members of the House \u2018squad' of progressive Democrats who face competitive primaries reported strong first-quarter hauls.\nPennsylvania Rep. Summer Lee, a first-term lawmaker from the Pittsburgh area, outraised challenger Bhavini Patel, a local council member, nearly $920,000 to roughly $291,000 through early April, according to pre-primary reports filed with the FEC. But Patel has had significant support from an outside group called the Moderate PAC, which says it backs champions of 'moderate fiscal policy.' Jeffrey Yass, a major Republican donor, has been a top contributor to the PAC, according to federal records.\nThe race could serve as an early test of how the Israel-Hamas war affects congressional contests, with the Gaza conflict becoming a flashpoint in the primary. More broadly, pro-Israel groups have pledged to spend heavily in several key House races to elevate more moderate candidates.\nOther 'squad' members facing strong primary challenges include New York's Jamaal Bowman, Missouri's Cori Bush and Minnesota's Ilhan Omar. Bowman was lapped in fundraising during the first quarter by Westchester County Executive George Latimer, while Bush underperformed against primary challenger Wesley Bell, the elected prosecutor for St. Louis County.\nagainst primary challenger Wesley Bell, the elected prosecutor for St. Louis County. Omar, who reported raising nearly $1.7 million in the first quarter, faces a host of primary challengers, including former Minneapolis City Council Member Don Samuels, whom she narrowly defeated in the 2022 primary. He posted a first-quarter haul of roughly $400,000.\nVirginia Rep. Bob Good \u2013 one of eight Republicans who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy as House speaker last year \u2013 raised more than $307,000 during the first three months of the year, new filings show.\nIt marked the House Freedom Caucus leader's strongest fundraising quarter of the 2024 cycle, but primary challenger John McGuire, a state senator, raised nearly as much \u2013 about $290,000 over the same period. His haul included a $10,000 infusion in late March from McCarthy's leadership PAC.\nAs CNN previously reported, some House Republicans \u2013 embittered by the party infighting that led to McCarthy's ouster \u2013 are looking for ways to boost McGuire ahead of the June primary.\nSouth Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace and top primary challenger Catherine Templeton reported raising similar first-quarter hauls, though Templeton, who served in former Gov. Nikki Haley's administration, received more money from individual contributors than Mace did.\nMace, however, has Trump's endorsement \u2013 a valuable commodity in a GOP primary.\nIn Arizona, Rep. Eli Crane, the only House Republican freshman who voted to boot McCarthy, raised more than $1.1 million in the first three months of the year, fueled, in part, by small-dollar contributions. He recently drew a primary challenge from Jack Smith, a former Yavapai County supervisor.\nAt least two Republicans who helped push out McCarthy are not returning to Congress next year: Montana Rep. Matt Rosendale is retiring, and Colorado's Ken Buck resigned last month.\nCelebrity donors during the first quarter included actor Sean Penn, who gave $5,000 to former Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich's independent House campaign for a GOP-held Ohio seat, and 'Family Guy' creator Seth McFarlane, who gave $1 million to Future Forward PAC, a key super PAC supporting Biden's reelection.\nSeveral media personalities wrote checks to former CNN anchor John Avlon's bid for New York's 1st Congressional District on Long Island, including Ken Burns, Maury Povich, Connie Chung and Barry Diller. Avlon is seeking the Democratic nomination to take on freshman Republican Nick LaLota.\nFormer Republican Rep. George Santos, who is challenging LaLota as an independent, filed a report showing that he raised zero dollars from March 7 through March 31. Santos, who faces a slew of federal charges, represented a neighboring district before his expulsion from the House last year.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Fredreka Schouten,David Wright,Alex  Leeds Matthews,Leeds Matthews,Alex","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2133977884.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":7.1037345,"_id":"7b8ef82a30b308511a5cc1da827b2499"},{"title":"Lawmakers vote against hearing Arizona bill repealing abortion ban on House floor","author":"Arit John","published_date":"2024-04-17 18:31:24","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/17/politics/arizona-house-abortion-law-repeal","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The Republican-controlled Arizona House of Representatives once again failed to advance a repeal of the state's 160-year-old abortion ban Wednesday, days after the state Supreme Court roiled state\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 The Republican-controlled Arizona House of Representatives once again failed to advance a repeal of the state's 160-year-old abortion ban Wednesday, days after the state Supreme Court roiled state politics by reviving the law.\nThe vote is a blow for GOP candidates in competitive races, who have been scrambling to distance themselves from the court's decision. Republicans facing competitive races in the state, including former President Donald Trump and US Senate candidate Kari Lake, called on the GOP-controlled legislature to work with Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs to take a more moderate path.\nOn Wednesday, following two attempts to discuss a bill that would repeal Arizona's 1864 ban on abortions, lawmakers voted not to discuss the measure on the House floor.\nThe representatives' votes were evenly split, with the chair making the tie-breaking decision. The bill itself was not brought up for a vote.\n'The last thing we should be doing today is rushing a bill through the legislative process to repeal a law that has been enacted and affirmed by the legislature several times,' House Speaker Ben Toma said during debate.\nIf the 1864 ban were repealed, Arizona would revert back to a 15-week abortion restriction signed into law in 2022 by then-Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican. The law prohibits the procedure except to save the life of the pregnant person and threatens providers with prison sentences between two and five years.\n\ufeffState lawmakers last week ended a House session early to block an effort to repeal the abortion ban. And on Monday, House Republicans' general counsel laid out a strategy to defeat or dilute the impact of a potential abortion rights ballot initiative in a leaked memo.\nArizona Democrats, who are hoping to flip control of the state House and Senate, where Republicans hold one seat majorities, were quick to highlight the failed repeal. State Sen. Priya Sundareshan, the co-chair of the Arizona Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the state legislature, called the vote 'a perfect example of why we need to flip' control of the two chambers.\n'Only then will we be able to codify abortion access and stop Republicans from interfering in our medical decisions ever again,' she said in a statement.\nAbortion rights advocates say they have gathered 500,000 signatures to put an initiative on the November ballot that would enshrine abortion access in the state constitution until fetal viability, which doctors estimate is around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy.

Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Chip Roy of Texas \u2013 voted against the legislation in committee, but all Democrats on the panel voted for it. The three Republican hardliners on the panel had threatened to oppose a rule on the foreign aid bills.\nThe four bills head to the House floor on Friday for their first test on the floor with a rule vote. A vote on final passage is expected Saturday.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, appearing on Newsmax, suggested the timing for a vote on the package would be 'early Saturday.' He did not elaborate, and his office told CNN exact timing is still being worked out.\nAccording to the rule, if the bills pass the House, they will be combined into one amendment before being sent to the Senate.\nEarlier Thursday, the House Freedom Caucus took an official stance urging House Republicans to oppose the procedural vote, arguing 'to secure the border we must kill the rule.'\n'The House Freedom Caucus will vote NO on rule for the \u2018America Last' foreign wars supplemental package with zero border security, and urge all House Republicans to do the same,' the group said in a statement posted on X.\nThree bills in the foreign aid package would provide aid for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific region, with the latter intended to help deter Chinese aggression in the area. A fourth bill includes other House GOP priorities, including sanctions on Iran, the seizure of frozen Russian sovereign assets and a measure that could lead to a nationwide ban of TikTok.\nThe three assistance bills are similar to the foreign aid legislation that passed the Senate in February. The fourth House bill was not part of the Senate package.\nThe three House aid bills add up to about $95 billion \u2013 the same amount the Senate bill included \u2013 with an adjustment that $10 billion in Ukraine economic assistance is in the form of a repayable loan, CNN has reported.\nWith Republicans controlling the House only by a razor-thin margin, Johnson will have to rely on a significant number of Democrats to get the bill through procedural hurdles, especially with a growing number of hardliners upset about border security provisions.\nThe fight over the bills \u2013 and the potential for right-wing members of the GOP to attempt to oust Johnson over it \u2013 adds up to the most intense pressure that the speaker has faced over his future in his short time in the role. Massie on Tuesday said he would co-sponsor Rep.

The House GOP Conference will meet Monday evening to discuss the Iran-Israel situation and their legislative plans going forward, according to GOP sources.\n'The House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel. We're going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together right now. We're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues,' Johnson told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo over the weekend.\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries urged immediate passage of the foreign aid package passed by the Senate in a new letter to colleagues.\n'The gravely serious events of this past weekend in the Middle East and Eastern Europe underscore the need for Congress to act immediately. We must take up the bipartisan and comprehensive national security bill passed by the Senate forthwith,' Jeffries wrote.\nIn November, the House passed a bill to provide $14.3 billion in aid to Israel, but Democrats objected to the fact that the bill did not include aid to Ukraine and would enact funding cuts to the Internal Revenue Service.\nThe Senate passed its bill in February \u2013 a $95.3 billion foreign aid bill with assistance for Ukraine, Israel and other priorities.\nA significant number of House Republicans are opposed to sending further aid to Ukraine. Now, Johnson faces the most significant threat to his speakership to date after GOP Rep.

His actions could save thousands of Ukrainian lives, even if Russia's determination to win a bloody war in which it is targeting civilians shows no sign of fading.\nJohnson's support for the bill followed a period of self-examination and a political evolution that is also unusual in the hyperpolarized Capitol. One of his senior colleagues in the House said the 'transformation' involved prayer by the devout Louisiana hardline conservative, who expressed a wish to be on the right side of history.\nJohnson's piloting of the bill through the House, after months of bitter infighting that split the GOP, saw him side with the diminished internationalist Ronald Reagan wing of his party while turning his back on the 'America First' faction where he previously made his political home.\nJohnson argued that without the United States continuing its arms and ammunition lifeline to Ukraine, Russia could score a victory that would prompt it to march deeper into Europe, drawing the US into another world war. He said a failure to act would bolster the emerging de facto axis of totalitarianism between Russia, Iran and China. Two other bills that Johnson shepherded through the House in a rare Saturday session will also send new aid to Israel and Taiwan, reinforcing other vital US national security goals in two other world hot spots. His decisions also preserved and prolonged the central planks of President Joe Biden's foreign policy less than seven months before he seeks reelection. Classified briefings by US covert agencies appear to have played a major role in his shift in thinking \u2014 another factor likely to anger Make America Great Again Republicans who view the intelligence community as a 'deep state' that targets ex-President Donald Trump.\nBut Johnson argued that the international situation is so grave that the House had no choice, warning that Russia, China and Iran are 'a global threat to our prosperity and our security. Their advance threatens the free world, and it demands American leadership. (If) we turn our backs right now the consequences could be devastating.'\nThe significance of the remarkable events on a charged floor of the House was underscored by a message from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had spent months warning he could lose the war if US help already worth tens of billions of dollars dried up. 'I am grateful to the United States House of Representatives, both parties, and personally Speaker Mike Johnson for the decision that keeps history on the right track,' he wrote on his Telegram channel. 'Democracy and freedom will always have global significance and will never fail as long as America helps to protect it.'\nCNN's Frederik Pleitgen reported from Ukraine on Saturday that US aid could quickly start funneling into Ukraine \u2014 assuming the Senate signs off on the bill, as expected. Zelensky's forces especially need anti-aircraft missiles and new air defense systems to counter growing Russian air superiority and an expanding assault on civilian and energy infrastructure targets. Ukrainian soldiers fighting in grim trench warfare conditions have meanwhile been rationing bullets and artillery. The House vote will also offer a vitally needed boost of morale as the vicious war has turned against Ukraine in recent months.\nJohnson's actions, however, represented a flagrant challenge to the populist base of the Republican Party, which is adamantly against more Ukraine aid, hews closer to Putin than Zelensky and views America's traditional leadership of the West as propping up globalist policies antithetical to US interests. This seam of opinion is hugely influential in the GOP and has been harnessed over the years by Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. And 112 Republicans \u2014 a majority of the conference \u2014 voted against the Ukraine bill. Millions of Americans share the ex-president's worldview that America's allies \u2014 who pleaded with Johnson not to abandon Ukraine \u2014 are freeloading off its defense umbrellas and that the US should take a much narrower view of its international obligations. They don't believe that Ukraine is America's fight and warn that standing up to Russia could lead to World War III.\nJohnson is also increasingly vulnerable because in passing the Ukraine bill, he repudiated the demand of right-wing Republicans to use the aid as leverage to force the Biden administration to introduce hardline policies at the US-Mexico border. In this, however, he was undercut by his own side. The president had previously agreed to many of the GOP's demands in the most conservative immigration bill in years \u2014 but Trump's allies in the House killed the measure, apparently to deprive Biden of a win on an issue that the ex-president sees as his path back to the White House. That move \u2014 which deprived Johnson's tiny majority of a significant policy win \u2014 taken together with the use of Democratic votes to pass Saturday's Ukraine measure reflects the utter disarray in a Republican Party that is at war with itself. The optics turned even more perilous for Johnson when Democrats waved Ukrainian flags on the House floor, creating a scene that is already going viral among conservatives on social media and that the speaker was quick to condemn.\nGeorgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a vehement opponent of funding Ukraine's war effort, warned after the vote that Johnson was a 'lame duck,' though she did not trigger the vote on ousting him that she had threatened in an attempt to thwart the Ukraine bill. Greene slammed Johnson for funding what she called America's 'murder industry' by supporting foreign wars and warned, 'It's unbelievable. I'm thankful that America gets to see who this man is.'\nThe Georgia hardliner is one of at least three Republicans who have said they will support a move to oust Johnson \u2014 whose majority is so slim he cannot afford to lose any Republicans on a party-line vote and would likely need the support of Democrats to remain speaker.\nGreene predicted fury among grassroots Republicans as lawmakers return home for a short recess after Johnson also worked to pass vital spending bills that funded the government \u2014 in what Greene says is a betrayal of GOP voters. She may be correct in her analysis, and a slow buildup of pressure may represent Johnson's biggest vulnerability.\nStill, there were also signs even among Republicans disappointed with Johnson of no appetite for another debacle that would likely unfold in seeking a new speaker so close to elections. If Johnson has correctly read the mood of those members, he may survive in a display of political dexterity that few observers expected to see after he was elevated to the speakership from the backbenches in October as almost the last resort after better-known figures failed to amass a majority after the toppling of then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy. But his chances of staying in his post if the GOP wins in November still seem slim. Nevertheless, in passing aid to Israel and Ukraine, Johnson may have provided a service to vulnerable freshmen Republicans in swing districts whose victories in the 2022 midterms paved the way to their party's control of the House. One of their number, Rep. Marc Molinaro of New York, told CNN's Manu Raju that after speaking with his constituents, 'It is clear to me that there are moments in time where we must do the right thing, and today we did that.'\nOne intriguing question Saturday was the position of Trump \u2014 a longtime antagonist of Zelensky and mentor of Greene, whose pressure on Kyiv to investigate Biden caused Trump's first impeachment. Johnson traveled to Mar-a-Lago to see Trump recently and bolstered the ex-president's false claims of election fraud in an apparent bid to shore up his own position. The ex-president, who has long genuflected to Putin, stayed on the sidelines of the Ukraine debate. It remains unclear whether he was seeking to preserve his options in the event he is the next commander in chief and wants to follow through with his vow to end the war in Ukraine. Or perhaps Trump was preoccupied with his own political goals \u2014 and his first criminal trial ahead of opening arguments on Monday.\nWith the GOP in uproar following Saturday's vote, Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries refused to say whether his party will back Johnson if Greene and her allies seek to unseat him with a maneuver known as a motion to vacate. Even if Democrats save Johnson as payback for the passage of the aid bills \u2014 a key Biden priority \u2014 a long-term effort to keep him in office seems unlikely. The speaker may be the most conservative person to hold the job in modern US history, and many Democrats disdain his efforts to promote Trump's election-fraud falsehoods following the last election. And any Republican speaker propped up by Democrats might hemorrhage support among GOP lawmakers and be forced to resign.\nThere was, however, grudging support among some Democrats for the speaker. Rep Mike Quigley, who co-chairs the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, was asked whether he had new respect for Johnson. 'I guess I do,' the Illinois Democrat said. 'The old adage is \u2018It's never too late to do the right thing.' We tested that,' Quigley added. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer praised both Johnson and Jeffries, saying, 'I know it was a difficult road, but the House is on the right side of history for approving this bill.'\nAmerica's enemies, including Putin, had been betting that US political divisions \u2014 exacerbated by past Russian election interference \u2014 would mean that the US would be unable to protect its traditional interests on the world stage. But Johnson put those assumptions on hold, even if the long-term prospects for continued US support for Ukraine and traditional leadership of the West look dim if Trump wins in November.\nBut House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Mike McCaul, a Texas Republican who previously revealed Johnson had prayed for guidance, said the speaker showed true leadership. 'He said, \u2018I want to be on the right side of history.' And I think he will be. And again, I think putting the nation above himself, it's a real profile in courage, what he did.'\nAs the debate over Ukraine aid peaked, McCaul had drawn analogies between the US posture toward Putin and Britain's appeasement of Nazi Germany under one prime minister and the stalwart resistance of his successor. 'As we deliberate on this vote, you have to ask yourself this question. Am I Chamberlain or Churchill?' he said.\nThe accidental speaker makes an unlikely Churchill, but on Saturday he proved to be a far more daring and substantial figure than many of his Republican and Democratic critics previously believed.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Stephen Collinson,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/b5ca8a42-d9e5-4732-940d-95d63d46e7c3.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.9986153,"_id":"25ccaa1415dbd4480f06377dea3ba60b"},{"title":"By passing Ukraine aid, the accidental speaker became an unlikely Churchill","author":"Stephen Collinson","published_date":"2024-04-20 22:56:52","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/20/politics/mike-johnson-ukraine-aid-russia-zelensky-putin/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Republican Speaker Mike Johnson showed political courage that is rare in Washington and notable legislative skill for an inexperienced leader in forcing a long-delayed $60 billion aid bill for Ukraine\u2026","summary":"Republican Speaker Mike Johnson showed political courage that is rare in Washington and notable legislative skill for an inexperienced leader in forcing a long-delayed $60 billion aid bill for Ukraine through the House of Representatives on Saturday.\nJohnson put his own job in extreme peril to stand up for a democratic nation victimized by an unprovoked invasion by Russian strongman Vladimir Putin and to bolster America's leadership of the West. His actions could save thousands of Ukrainian lives, even if Russia's determination to win a bloody war in which it is targeting civilians shows no sign of fading.\nJohnson's support for the bill followed a period of self-examination and a political evolution that is also unusual in the hyperpolarized Capitol. One of his senior colleagues in the House said the 'transformation' involved prayer by the devout Louisiana hardline conservative, who expressed a wish to be on the right side of history.\nJohnson's piloting of the bill through the House, after months of bitter infighting that split the GOP, saw him side with the diminished internationalist Ronald Reagan wing of his party while turning his back on the 'America First' faction where he previously made his political home.\nJohnson argued that without the United States continuing its arms and ammunition lifeline to Ukraine, Russia could score a victory that would prompt it to march deeper into Europe, drawing the US into another world war. He said a failure to act would bolster the emerging de facto axis of totalitarianism between Russia, Iran and China. Two other bills that Johnson shepherded through the House in a rare Saturday session will also send new aid to Israel and Taiwan, reinforcing other vital US national security goals in two other world hot spots. His decisions also preserved and prolonged the central planks of President Joe Biden's foreign policy less than seven months before he seeks reelection. Classified briefings by US covert agencies appear to have played a major role in his shift in thinking \u2014 another factor likely to anger Make America Great Again Republicans who view the intelligence community as a 'deep state' that targets ex-President Donald Trump.\nBut Johnson argued that the international situation is so grave that the House had no choice, warning that Russia, China and Iran are 'a global threat to our prosperity and our security. Their advance threatens the free world, and it demands American leadership. (If) we turn our backs right now the consequences could be devastating.'\nThe significance of the remarkable events on a charged floor of the House was underscored by a message from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who had spent months warning he could lose the war if US help already worth tens of billions of dollars dried up. 'I am grateful to the United States House of Representatives, both parties, and personally Speaker Mike Johnson for the decision that keeps history on the right track,' he wrote on his Telegram channel. 'Democracy and freedom will always have global significance and will never fail as long as America helps to protect it.'\nCNN's Frederik Pleitgen reported from Ukraine on Saturday that US aid could quickly start funneling into Ukraine \u2014 assuming the Senate signs off on the bill, as expected. Zelensky's forces especially need anti-aircraft missiles and new air defense systems to counter growing Russian air superiority and an expanding assault on civilian and energy infrastructure targets. Ukrainian soldiers fighting in grim trench warfare conditions have meanwhile been rationing bullets and artillery. The House vote will also offer a vitally needed boost of morale as the vicious war has turned against Ukraine in recent months.\nJohnson's actions, however, represented a flagrant challenge to the populist base of the Republican Party, which is adamantly against more Ukraine aid, hews closer to Putin than Zelensky and views America's traditional leadership of the West as propping up globalist policies antithetical to US interests. This seam of opinion is hugely influential in the GOP and has been harnessed over the years by Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. And 112 Republicans \u2014 a majority of the conference \u2014 voted against the Ukraine bill. Millions of Americans share the ex-president's worldview that America's allies \u2014 who pleaded with Johnson not to abandon Ukraine \u2014 are freeloading off its defense umbrellas and that the US should take a much narrower view of its international obligations. They don't believe that Ukraine is America's fight and warn that standing up to Russia could lead to World War III.\nJohnson is also increasingly vulnerable because in passing the Ukraine bill, he repudiated the demand of right-wing Republicans to use the aid as leverage to force the Biden administration to introduce hardline policies at the US-Mexico border. In this, however, he was undercut by his own side. The president had previously agreed to many of the GOP's demands in the most conservative immigration bill in years \u2014 but Trump's allies in the House killed the measure, apparently to deprive Biden of a win on an issue that the ex-president sees as his path back to the White House. That move \u2014 which deprived Johnson's tiny majority of a significant policy win \u2014 taken together with the use of Democratic votes to pass Saturday's Ukraine measure reflects the utter disarray in a Republican Party that is at war with itself. The optics turned even more perilous for Johnson when Democrats waved Ukrainian flags on the House floor, creating a scene that is already going viral among conservatives on social media and that the speaker was quick to condemn.\nGeorgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a vehement opponent of funding Ukraine's war effort, warned after the vote that Johnson was a 'lame duck,' though she did not trigger the vote on ousting him that she had threatened in an attempt to thwart the Ukraine bill. Greene slammed Johnson for funding what she called America's 'murder industry' by supporting foreign wars and warned, 'It's unbelievable. I'm thankful that America gets to see who this man is.'\nThe Georgia hardliner is one of at least three Republicans who have said they will support a move to oust Johnson \u2014 whose majority is so slim he cannot afford to lose any Republicans on a party-line vote and would likely need the support of Democrats to remain speaker.\nGreene predicted fury among grassroots Republicans as lawmakers return home for a short recess after Johnson also worked to pass vital spending bills that funded the government \u2014 in what Greene says is a betrayal of GOP voters.

The ad also began airing the same day that the Senate will consider articles of impeachment against Biden's Homeland Security Secretary Alexander Mayorkas, whom they have blasted for his handling of the southern border.\nThe new ad from the pro-Trump super PAC spotlights the 2022 case of an undocumented immigrant who assaulted and murdered a 20-year-old autistic woman in Maryland and blames 'Biden's weak border policies.' The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee investigated the case last year, finding that the Biden administration 'insufficiently vetted' the perpetrator, who had entered the US.\nThe new ad opens, 'A defenseless young girl was brutally raped and killed by an illegal alien and known member of the violent MS 13 gang. It could have been prevented. The killer was detained at the border but released onto our streets by Biden's weak border policies.'\n'Biden's open border puts us all at risk by releasing criminal illegals into our communities,' it says. 'We have to stop Joe Biden to close our border.'\nThe high-profile case was one of several factors contributing to Republicans' push to impeach Mayorkas, which is set to proceed Wednesday as the Senate takes up the case, though the Democratic-controlled body is expected to move quickly to dismiss the charges even as Republicans insist on a full trial.\nMayorkas is the first Cabinet secretary to be impeached in almost 150 years. House Republicans voted to impeach Mayorkas in February over his handling of the southern border by a narrow margin after failing to do so on their first try.\nThe Biden administration has defended Mayorkas' record. In a statement following the House vote, the White House accused House Republicans of 'unconstitutional partisanship' and 'petty political games,' and said that Mayorkas 'has upheld the rule of law faithfully and has demonstrated a deep commitment to the values that make our nation great.'\nBut the administration has also hardened immigration policy in response to the blistering criticism from Republicans, embracing tougher border measures, including asylum restrictions and shutting down the US-Mexico border during migrant surges.\nThe new ad is the first that MAGA Inc. has launched since mid-March, and only the second the group has produced since Trump secured the GOP presidential nomination. It echoes the Trump team's consistent focus in its campaign messaging on immigration, which was among the top issues referenced in ads from his campaign and super PAC during the presidential primary.\nThe pro-Trump super PAC is also ramping its ad spending back up, having been mostly off the air since late January in the waning days of the nominating contest. MAGA Inc. has about $1.4 million worth of airtime booked for this week, nearly all of it targeting Pennsylvania \u2013 meaning the new ad will be airing at the same time that President Biden is there this week for a campaign swing. MAGA Inc. also has some small reservations in Wisconsin and Georgia this week. In total, MAGA Inc. has spent more than $42 million on advertising since the start of the 2024 presidential race.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David Wright,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2147786908.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.9604983,"_id":"3d47feeeee9f9821f7a6c52171b1b278"},{"title":"Key surveillance tool could run out Friday as senators struggle to reach agreement to beat deadline","author":"Ted Barrett","published_date":"2024-04-16 00:13:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/15/politics/senate-fisa-vote-negotiations-deadline","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"A critical intelligence community surveillance tool could lapse temporarily Friday unless senators reach an agreement to speed passage of a bill that would renew the program for two years.","summary":"A critical intelligence community surveillance tool could lapse temporarily Friday unless senators reach an agreement to speed passage of a bill that would renew the program for two years.\nThat cooperation would be needed from Senate critics who have myriad of complaints about Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, notably that the government can get access without a warrant to data from foreigners including when they are interacting with Americans.\nSenate Republican Whip John Thune said if the Senate is going to meet its deadline, members of his conference will need to get, at a minimum, a vote on an amendment requiring warrants for any spying on Americans. A similar amendment narrowly failed in the House last week when the bill was passed there.\n'We are going to have people who will want amendments, and so that's what it's going to take. I assume they'll want to have the same vote they had in the (House) on search warrants,' he said. 'There is going to be a bit of a pile up, I think. But hopefully we'll be able to transact FISA.'\nWithout a time and amendment agreement, it could take the Senate until Sunday to process the bill, meaning a lapse in the programs would occur.\nOne conservative senator with concerns over FISA was hopeful Democrats who control the chamber will cede to their demands and the bill will pass in time.\n'I would imagine we get amendments considering how important this is,' said Alabama GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who said most of the Republicans he's talked to would be satisfied if they got votes on amendments.\n'They don't want this to run out,' he said referencing pressure on Democrats to make a deal.\nA top Democratic senator, Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, told reporters Monday that he believes the intelligence community could continue eavesdropping for a year or more even after the program lapses.\n'My staff tells me there are provisions for that possibility, that they can continue applying FISA, I think, for a year or even longer,' he said.'\nBut that was sharply disputed by top Republicans.\n'That's not true,' said Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee. 'I know there is a legal theory that because the Foreign Surveillance Court certified the program for a year that somehow, maybe, we can continue to use those tools. But I don't believe that's true. I think that certification was in expectation that the authorization would resume.'\nCornyn added that it's very important the authority is not interrupted: '60% of the president's daily brief is composed of 702 derived material, so this is absolutely critical.'\nSen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, agreed.\n'I think that if it's not authorized, you have to be very careful with it. As sympathetic as I may be to that concept, they better follow the law,' he said. 'That was an unproductive comment by Sen. Durbin, probably out of frustration. But that is not what we want to be doing.'\nOne Democratic aide involved in the issue said when there was a previous lapse in Section 702 authority, providers like Google and AT&T stopped giving material to the government, so that would be at risk now.\nRepublican senators who are demanding FISA amendment votes are some of the same group that is frustrated that Democrats are poised to short-circuit the impeachment trial of DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas when it hits the floor Tuesday and Wednesday. Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah is venting that frustration, in part, by forcing the Senate to take time-consuming procedural votes on motions that are typically approved by unanimous consent.\nDurbin was asked if he was concerned Lee's moves could cause FISA to lapse.\n'I'm always concerned with Mike Lee,' he said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ted Barrett,Ted,CNN,Ted  Barrett","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/231216171105-us-capitol-dome-1024.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.9594064,"_id":"aa122e297be52958f77762070c40c9d1"},{"title":"Analysis: Some House Republicans need this reminder that Russia is not their friend","author":"Zachary B.

CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 There is a major disconnect between two CNN stories on Wednesday about Russia and the US.\n\u25ba First, read this report from CNN's Sean Lyngaas about a hacking group with ties to the Russian government that may be responsible for a cyberattack on a Texas water facility, one of several possible attacks on US water facilities about which the federal government has warned.\nKey line: '\u2026if it is confirmed that the (Russian intelligence service) GRU or one of its proxies was involved, this would mark an escalation in targeting US critical infrastructure for a Russian group often known for focusing on Ukraine.'\nKey line: '\u2026if it is confirmed that the (Russian intelligence service) GRU or one of its proxies was involved, this would mark an escalation in targeting US critical infrastructure for a Russian group often known for focusing on Ukraine.' \u25ba Then, read the latest from CNN's Capitol Hill team on the long-stalled effort to provide additional military aid to Ukraine in its war to repel Russia's invasion. GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson may finally be primed to defy the right wing of his party and allow a bipartisan majority to bless the aid six months after it was requested by the White House.\nKey line: 'Conservative hardliners were quickly fuming at Johnson for his decision to move ahead with billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine and loudly warning him it could cost him his job.'\nKey line: 'Conservative hardliners were quickly fuming at Johnson for his decision to move ahead with billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine and loudly warning him it could cost him his job.' What's clear from the water facility hack is that Russia continues to meddle in the US, either by attacking infrastructure or meddling in elections.\nWhat's clear from the Ukraine funding story is that a very small minority of lawmakers, with help from right-wing media, does not view Russia as much of a threat.\nWhile it is mostly Republicans who oppose additional funding for Ukraine, they are still a minority, even within their own party. In February, 22 Republicans in the Senate joined all but three Democrats to form a 70-vote majority in favor of the funding. It's fair to think a similar bipartisan majority would support Ukraine funding in the House's latest foreign aid package unveiled on Wednesday.\n'We're the greatest nation on the planet and we have to act like it,' Johnson told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview on 'The Lead' on Wednesday. He defended his plan, promised a future bill would address the Republican priority of border security and argued that the vast majority of $60 billion in Ukraine aid would go to US defense contractors.\n'The responsibility for the free world has been shifted onto our shoulders,' he said, adding US troops would not be committed in Ukraine. 'We're not the world's policeman.'\nNot all Republicans are buying the pitch, and the divide within the GOP over Ukraine is getting more heated, which is jeopardizing Johnson's ability to lead. CNN's Capitol Hill team reports that some potential Johnson rivals are quietly positioning themselves in case there is yet another ousted speaker.\nJohnson's Republican critics, meanwhile, are getting louder.\nFlorida Rep. Matt Gaetz described Johnson's strategy, a complicated four-part parliamentary gambit to tie aid for Ukraine with aid for Israel, Taiwan and the US border, as 'surrender.'\nTexas Rep. Chip Roy didn't commit to voting to oust Johnson but said he's 'past the point of giving grace' to the still-new speaker.\nAnd they aren't even the two Republicans who have already said they would soon vote to end Johnson's speakership, although it's not clear when.\nThe first who's already on the record is Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who described Ukraine as 'the only country that for some weird, sick and evil reason that they care about.' She was referring to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who has raised the alarm about the threat of Russia to the rest of the world if Ukraine falls.\nThe other Republican already publicly in favor of ousting Johnson is Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky. He praised Tucker Carlson for that softball interview the former Fox News host conducted with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this year. That's the interview CNN's media team described as a 'propaganda victory' for Putin.\nJohnson may need help from moderate Democrats to fend off the effort to oust him, and a few Democrats have said they would break tradition and cross party lines to support him. It's not clear if Johnson would want the help, since party loyalty is prized in the GOP.\nThe Russia divide is clearly testing that loyalty. Former Rep. Liz Cheney, the Republican from Wyoming, who was ousted for her opposition to former President Donald Trump, has referred to the 'Putin wing' of the GOP as a threat to the US.\nFormer Rep. Liz Cheney sees a \"Putin wing\" in the GOP.\n07:47 - Source: CNN\n07:47 - Source: CNN Rep. Michael McCaul, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told Puck News this month that Russian propaganda has 'infected a good chunk of my party's base,' threatening the Ukraine aid.\nAsked about that propaganda comment by Tapper earlier this month, Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, agreed.\n'Oh, it is absolutely true,' he said.\nRepublican lawmaker says Russian propaganda has 'infected a good chunk' of GOP base\n01:29 - Source: CNN\n01:29 - Source: CNN 'To the extent that this propaganda takes hold, it makes it more difficult for us to really see this as an authoritarian-versus-democracy battle, which is what it is,' Turner said.\nGreene, who former Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado described as 'Moscow Marjorie' during one recent CNN interview, has said on conservative media outlets that she is not concerned that Putin's aggression against Ukraine will spread.\nIn a post on X this past weekend, she suggested US military funding would go to 'Ukrainian Nazis,' repeating a false claim about Ukraine pushed by Putin.\nJohnson still has the key support of Trump. The two appeared together at Mar-a-Lago last week, and Johnson has bought into Trump's proposal to structure some Ukraine aid as a loan rather than direct aid. While Democrats have long complained that Trump shows deference to Putin, Johnson made the argument to Tapper that Trump could negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine.\nJohnson said he's not going to be consumed by thinking about efforts within his own party to oust him.

The Democratic votes were necessary to overcome opposition from Speaker Mike Johnson's right flank, who will likely only increase their calls to oust him.\nThe fight over the bills \u2013 and the potential for right-wing members of the GOP to attempt to oust Johnson over it \u2013 adds up to the most intense pressure that the speaker has faced over his future in his short time in the role. Rep. Thomas Massie on Tuesday said he would co-sponsor Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to vacate, which would boot Johnson from the speakership if it passed, leading the speaker to defiantly tell reporters that he would not be resigning.\nGreene left the US Capitol on Friday following the vote without moving to oust Johnson.\nThe GOP-led House Rules Committee late Thursday night also used Democratic support to advance the bills.\nThe move is likely to further inflame conservatives who are against additional aid to Ukraine and have threatened Johnson's job over the issue.\nThe committee activity capped off another contentious day on Capitol Hill as the renewed push to send foreign aid to Ukraine has divided House Republicans. The right wing of the GOP conference has come out against the plan and vented their anger over a separate effort to change House rules regarding the process for removing the speaker \u2013 a rule change Johnson said Thursday he would not make.\nThree Republicans \u2013 Massie, Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Chip Roy of Texas \u2013 voted against the foreign aid legislation in committee Thursday night, but all Democrats on the panel voted for it.\nThree bills in the foreign aid package would provide aid for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific region, with the latter intended to help deter Chinese aggression in the area. A fourth bill includes other House GOP priorities, including sanctions on Iran, the seizure of frozen Russian sovereign assets and a measure that could lead to a nationwide ban of TikTok.\nThe three House aid bills add up to about $95 billion \u2013 the same amount the Senate bill included \u2013 with an adjustment that $10 billion in Ukraine economic assistance is in the form of a repayable loan, CNN has reported.\nThe three assistance bills are similar to the foreign aid legislation that passed the Senate in February. The fourth House bill was not part of the Senate package.\nJohnson, appearing on Newsmax, suggested the timing for a vote on the package would be 'early Saturday.' He did not elaborate, and his office told CNN exact timing is still being worked out.\nAccording to the rule, if the bills pass the House, they will be combined into one amendment before being sent to the Senate.\nEarlier Thursday, the House Freedom Caucus took an official stance urging House Republicans to oppose the procedural vote, arguing 'to secure the border we must kill the rule.'\n'The House Freedom Caucus will vote NO on rule for the \u2018America Last' foreign wars supplemental package with zero border security, and urge all House Republicans to do the same,' the group said in a statement posted on X.\nWith Republicans controlling the House only by a razor-thin margin, Johnson will have to rely on a significant number of Democrats to get the bill through procedural hurdles, especially with a growing number of hardliners upset about border security provisions.\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.

'We decline your invitation for President Biden to testify.'\nIn the letter, Sauber said that the president 'has done nothing wrong' and accused Comer of peddling 'false and unsupported allegations.'\nIn a statement to CNN, Comer criticized Biden for declining to testify publicly and called on the president to answer questions that accompanied the hearing invitation. Comer's statement did not address whether he plans to take any further steps now that Biden has declined.\n'It is unfortunate President Biden is unwilling to answer questions before the American people and refuses to answer the very simple, straightforward questions we included in the invitation,' Comer said in the statement.\nHouse Republicans have not uncovered evidence of wrongdoing by the president and currently do not have the votes in the House to impeach him given their narrow, divided majority.

So far, those\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 When Kevin McCarthy was ousted as House speaker last fall, Republican operatives were concerned that his successor, Mike Johnson, would not be able to replicate his fundraising prowess. So far, those concerns appear valid, new federal filings show.\nJohnson announced earlier this month that he had raised $20 million total in the first three months of the year, funds that will go toward his campaign, fellow Republican colleagues and party committees. By comparison, in the first quarter of 2022, McCarthy announced raising $31.5 million for Republicans, and in the first quarter of 2023, he raised even more, $35 million.\nThe latest filings from the leaders' joint fundraising committees \u2013 which were due Monday with the Federal Election Commission \u2013 further illustrate that disparity. In last year's first quarter, McCarthy's joint fundraising committee, Protect The House 2024, raised $28 million. In contrast, Johnson's joint fundraising operation, Grow the Majority, raised $9 million between January and March of this year.\nMcCarthy, of course, had years to cultivate relationships with donors and distribute funds to allies, while Johnson took over as speaker less than six months ago and faces the challenge of building out his fundraising operation in an election year. Still, his inability to match McCarthy's fundraising could add pressure to the already embattled speaker as he continues to face ouster threats from rebellious members of his caucus.\nIn a statement about his fundraising, Johnson said that 'in less than six months as Speaker, we have hit the ground running to ensure House Republicans will have the resources necessary to win in battlegrounds across America \u2013 and we cannot slow down now. While families suffer under increasing inflation, rising crime, and open borders, we will stay focused on our goal to grow the majority in November and deliver solutions for our nation.'\nMeanwhile, the latest filings show that McCarthy, who resigned from Congress at the end of December, still has $6.3 million banked in his personal campaign account, funds he could direct toward other campaign efforts. He did some of that in the first quarter, making $4,000 contributions to both Vince Fong, a former staffer and California assemblyman who is running to succeed him in his Central Valley seat, and to Louisiana Rep. Garret Graves, a McCarthy ally whose seat became more Democratic under a new map that is currently being challenged.\nMcCarthy also distributed some of the remaining funds in his leadership PAC during the first quarter, transferring $200,000 to a pro-Fong super PAC and notably giving 2,000 to a primary challenger to Virginia Rep. Bob Good, leader of the House Freedom Caucus and one of eight House Republicans who voted to oust him as speaker.\nHowever, McCarthy's campaign committee refunded roughly $2.8 million worth of contributions last quarter, and he terminated his leadership PAC in February, signs that he is winding down his political operation.\nThe new FEC records also show how Senate GOP whip John Thune of South Dakota and Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who held the position before him, moved money around to win influence and jockey for votes as they vie to succeed Mitch McConnell, who is stepping down as their party's Senate leader in November.\nCornyn, a former National Republican Senatorial Committee chair, transferred $1.2 million to the group and around $1.3 million to Republican Senate candidates and incumbents up for reelection through his joint fundraising account.\nMeanwhile, Thune's leadership PAC, Heartland Values, sent $120,000 to a joint fundraising committee for the GOP's Senate candidates. He also directed $1.2 million the NRSC's way through his own joint fundraising operation.\nThe two major super PACs aligned with Senate leaders of both parties also filed their quarterly reports Monday.\nSenate Majority PAC, the Democratic outfit, significantly outraised its GOP counterpart, Senate Leadership Fund, $39.3 million to $26.8 million. The Democratic super PAC also entered April with more cash banked \u2013 $92.4 million to $59.5 million. Both groups are poised to play decisive roles this fall: Senate Majority PAC has already announced plans to spend $239 million on a series of key races, while Senate Leadership Fund has announced $130 million in its own fall reservations.\nThe new FEC filings also shed light on other intraparty divides.\nMaine Sen. Susan Collins's leadership PAC donated $15,000 to Republican Rep. John Curtis' bid to succeed retiring Sen. Mitt Romney in Utah. Other contenders for the seat include former Utah House Speaker Brad Wilson and attorney Brent Hatch, a former George H.W. Bush aide whose father, the late Sen. Orrin Hatch, held this seat for seven terms before Romney.\nAnd in another example of internal GOP conflict, California Rep. John Duarte donated $2,000 through his leadership PAC to a primary challenger to South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace, another of the eight Republicans who voted for McCarthy's ouster last fall.\nWhile many members used their funds to compete for influence and shape elections, the latest FEC reports also showed how those heading for the exits are managing their leftover piles of cash.\nIndependent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona entered April with $10.1 million in the bank. Since announcing on March 5 that she would not be running for reelection, she spent roughly $180,000 on various expenses through the rest of the month, including security, travel and payroll.\nRetiring Sen. Joe Manchin's leadership PAC donated $5,000 to Wheeling Mayor Glenn Elliott, who is seeking the Democratic nomination to succeed him in ruby-red West Virginia. In March, CNN reported that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had approached Manchin about seeking reelection as an independent. A month earlier, Manchin ruled out running for president on a third-party ticket.\nIndicted New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, who is not seeking the Democratic nod for reelection this year but has left open the possibility of an independent run, raised just $1,200 in first-quarter contributions. He spent nearly $600,000 from January through April, with $550,000 for legal fees in his bribery case.\nMeanwhile, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont has not said if he will seek a fourth term this year. But his first-quarter fundraising report suggests he may be preparing to serve again: He raised $1.1 million and entered April with $9.8 million in cash on hand.\nCNN's Fredreka Schouten contributed to this report.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Matt Holt,CNN,David Wright","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-04-16t161059z-537130427-rc2q77a7mkww-rtrmadp-3-usa-congress.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.8384175,"_id":"b1a8a51196ba8e37b7db49e9c8df78f9"},{"title":"Arizona Senate keeps effort to repeal abortion ban in play","author":"Andy Rose","published_date":"2024-04-18 12:19:57","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/18/politics/arizona-senate-abortion-ban","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"A bill that would repeal Arizona's 160-year-old abortion ban was successfully introduced in the state Senate on Wednesday after the Republican-controlled House of Representatives failed to advance a\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 A bill that would repeal Arizona's 160-year-old abortion ban was successfully introduced in the state Senate on Wednesday after the Republican-controlled House of Representatives failed to advance a similar effort.\nThe Senate effort was rescued with the help of two Republicans, state Sens. T.J. Shope and Shawnna Bolick, who sided with Democrats in the GOP-controlled chamber to allow the bill to go forward by a vote of 16 to 14. The bill, which required a special vote since it was filed after the legislature's normal deadline, must still move through the full legislative process in the Senate, which requires consideration for three days before a final vote and potential move to the House.\nLast week, the state Supreme Court roiled Arizona politics by reviving the Civil War-era law, saying that the 2022 decision by the US Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade left nothing to block the state law from being enforced. Since then, failed efforts by the Arizona legislature to repeal the ban have frustrated abortion rights activists and Democrats, as well as GOP candidates in competitive races who have been scrambling to distance themselves from the court's decision. Some Republicans, including former President Donald Trump and US Senate candidate Kari Lake, have called on the GOP-controlled legislature to work with Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs to take a more moderate path.\nEarlier Wednesday, in the state House following two attempts to discuss a bill that would repeal Arizona's 1864 ban on abortions, lawmakers voted not to discuss the measure on the floor. The representatives' votes were evenly split, with the chair making the tie-breaking decision. The bill itself was not brought up for a vote.\n'The last thing we should be doing today is rushing a bill through the legislative process to repeal a law that has been enacted and affirmed by the legislature several times,' House Speaker Ben Toma said during debate.\nIf the 1864 law were repealed, Arizona would revert back to a 15-week abortion restriction signed into law in 2022 by then-Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican. The state court delayed enforcement of the ban for at least 14 days to allow plaintiffs to challenge it, meaning abortions are still allowed in the state.\nThe ban prohibits the procedure except to save the life of the pregnant person and threatens providers with prison sentences between two and five years.\nIf the 1864 law goes into effect, Arizona would join 14 states that have passed near total abortion bans, some with no exceptions for victims of rape or incest.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Andy Rose,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap24101701453260.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.8115244,"_id":"fb48526c1fab22f3ea5cfe7df913f3ad"},{"title":"Analysis: Why Biden and Democrats are talking so much about freedom","author":"Ronald Brownstein","published_date":"2024-04-17 04:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/abortion-democrats-freedom-messaging","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration:\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration: 'This fight is about freedom, and the freedom that is fundamental to the promise of America.'\nIn a new abortion-focused ad that the Biden campaign aired in Arizona last week, President Joe Biden somberly asks: 'If Donald Trump gets back in power, what freedom will you lose next?'\nFor Biden, Harris and other Democrats to lean so heavily on the word 'freedom' in this campaign is a historic reversal of roles. At least since the New Deal 90 years ago, Republicans have been the party most likely to frame their agenda as advancing 'freedom' and 'liberty' while Democrats have more often emphasized ideas such as 'equality' and 'justice.'\nRepublicans haven't abandoned their rhetorical efforts to claim the terrain of freedom. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for instance, used the word almost as a mantra the past few years to denounce the restrictions many states imposed to fight the spread of Covid-19 and to attack what he calls the left's effort to impose 'woke ideology.' And Trump disparages Biden's agenda to promote the deployment of electric vehicles as an attempt to deny Americans' freedom to continue purchasing gas-powered cars and trucks.\nBut the GOP push at every level of government to roll back the 'rights revolution' of the past six decades \u2013 symbolized by the proliferation of red-state laws limiting access to abortion and potentially other reproductive health care such as IVF \u2013 has provided Democrats a historic opportunity to reverse the direction of this long-running debate, many analysts agree.\n'Historically, Republicans have rooted their philosophical world view in liberty: for them it's about freedom to own guns, to practice religion as they see fit' or reducing government taxes, spending and regulation, said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute, which studies the intersection of culture and politics. 'What's new is Democrats are using the term in ways to reimagine what freedom really means.'\nTransforming the debate over freedom may be especially crucial for Biden because polls consistently show Trump with a double-digit lead when voters are asked who they trust more to handle the economy. That means that to win the election Biden will need to convince a substantial number of voters who believe Trump is better for their bottom line to vote against him anyway. The interrelated issues revolving around rights, values and democracy likely offer the president his best chance to do so. 'If any issue' is going to flip voters who express more confidence in Trump on the economy, 'it is going to be social issues like abortion,' said Deckman.\nBiden signaled the central role freedom would play in his campaign messaging from the outset, in the video he released last year announcing his plan to seek reelection. As an ominous piano key trills behind images of the January 6, 2021, insurrection, abortion rights protesters and the White House, Biden opens the video with a stark declaration: 'Freedom. Personal freedom is fundamental to who we are as Americans. There's nothing more important. Nothing more sacred.' Later he says: 'The question we're facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer. I know what I want the answer to be, and I think you do too.'\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security.\nRoe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security. Harris, who has been the administration's point person in delivering the freedom message, has likewise cast an expansive net. When Harris delivered a Martin Luther King Day speech to the NAACP this year that summarized the administration's case for another term, she cited all the issues Biden did in the video and others, such as the restrictions several red states have imposed on the teaching of the nation's racial history and the right 'to live free from the horror of gun violence.'\nWay to Win, a liberal group that funds organizations and campaigns focusing on voters of color, has been pushing the party for several years to emphasize the freedom argument. Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, the group's vice president and chief strategy officer, says linking all these other issues to abortion is key to portraying Trump and his allies as a threat to freedom.\n'If [abortion] was the only thing, it would feel different than if you are able to tick off all these other things that they are doing and that they will do,' she said. 'We can even say it with other kinds of repro [rights]: We can say it with IVF, or now they are going to come for your contraception. Abortion is an entry point: because it is so visceral for people, it is a way to connect to a larger story about rights and freedoms.'\nLauren Hitt, a senior spokesperson for the Biden campaign, argued freedom will be a powerful message for the president because it resonates with a broad range of voters. 'It \u2026 speaks to the values of traditional Republican voters, [Nikki] Haley primary voters, and suburban voters \u2013 as well as to our base who believe deeply that the government shouldn't be making personal decisions for people,' she said. 'It's a uniquely powerful idea grounded in traditional democratic values that will be critical in winning the swing voters we need to win in November.'\nThe Trump campaign pushed back on Biden's ad asking which freedom Trump would take away next. 'Under Joe Biden, Americans are less free, less safe, and less prosperous,' Karoline Leavitt, the campaign's national spokesperson, said in a statement.\nDaniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that broad changes in societal attitudes have encouraged both parties to emphasize their commitments to personal freedom. 'Each side recognizes this is something people care about,' Cox said. 'It's effective language at a time when we are increasingly individualistic. We are not as inclined to be communitarian and oriented toward the concerns of others. So I think it's not a surprise that we're seeing both political parties try to employ this language to their advantage.'\nEven with all the increased Democratic emphasis on protecting rights, Cox said, the issue remains 'contested ground' that can favor either party depending on how it is framed. While Republicans have been 'on their heels' defending abortion restrictions such as last week's Arizona ruling, he said, the party has benefited in other races from positioning itself as defending 'parent's rights,' as Republican Glenn Youngkin did while winning the Virginia governorship in 2021. (It's notable that when abortion rights and parental rights collided in the 2023 Virginia state legislative elections, Democrats stressing the former won control of both chambers over Republicans emphasizing the latter.)\nPolling suggests the public remains split over which party it trusts to defend basic rights and freedoms. To begin with, Democrats and Republicans hold very different priorities over which rights are most important to protect, PRRI found in unpublished national polling shared exclusively with CNN. In that survey, conducted late last year, Republicans were most likely to say their freedom to own guns, to practice their religion and to speak their mind was growing more restricted; Democrats were most likely to say that they were losing the freedom to control their own body. 'The parties are talking past each other,' Deckman said. 'Freedom is a word that is quintessentially American, but it depends on what freedoms you are referring to in the first place.'\nThe public returned a similar split verdict last fall in an NBC poll that asked voters which party they trusted more to handle different issues. In the poll, Democrats held a commanding 18 percentage point advantage on dealing with abortion. But when asked which party they trusted more on 'protecting our constitutional rights,' voters preferred Republicans by a margin of 43% to 35%. Even White women, who strongly preferred Democrats on abortion, split evenly over which party they trusted on the broader question of preserving core constitutional rights.\nThat GOP advantage may reflect the traditional political dynamic that conservative voters have been more likely than liberals to believe their rights are under siege and to view government actions as a threat to their liberty. In 2022 polling by Penn State University's McCourtney Institute for Democracy, Republicans were twice as likely as Democrats to say that they had lost rights and freedoms over the past decade. Republicans were also considerably more likely, though not by as lopsided a margin, to predict that they would lose more rights than they gain over the next decade.\nThe real-world consequence of that imbalance was on display in the 2016 presidential campaign, when Democratic-leaning voters largely shrugged about Hillary Clinton's warnings that a Trump victory would allow him to move the Supreme Court to the right in a way that would threaten basic rights, like abortion.\nChris Wilson, a GOP pollster who worked for the super PAC supporting DeSantis in the 2024 campaign, said the Penn State polling suggests that Biden still will face difficulty mobilizing key elements of the Democratic coalition with a message about rights and freedoms. He noted that such groups as Generation Z, Blacks and Latinos were much less likely than college-educated Whites or Republicans to express fears in the poll that they would lose rights in the decade ahead.\n'To whatever extent the Democrats are trying to make a rights argument, it's not as worrying to the youth and to minorities as it is to Whites, people with college degrees, and Boomers,' Wilson said. 'Biden's \u2018rights' argument might be a big hit with his peers, but might be the wrong note to strike if he wants to hold onto the parts of the Democratic coalition that are starting to look shaky.'\nBut the Penn State polling was conducted before the Dobbs decision ended the nationwide right to abortion. And many analysts believe that seismic shift has increased the relevance of questions revolving around rights and freedoms to key groups that Democrats rely on \u2013 with younger women especially focused on these threats. While Republicans traditionally responded more to these arguments, Deckman said, 'These times certainly have made freedom a more accessible, even an existential, issue for people on the left.'\nFernandez Ancona agrees to an extent with both Wilson and Deckman. The 2022 elections, she said, demonstrated how strongly many people react to the risk of losing rights they believed had been settled. 'When these things you take for granted are taken away in this very stark way, it's incredibly motivating,' she said. But she also believes that Democrats need to tie their case about defending personal freedom into a broader message that portrays the 2024 election less as a personal choice between Trump and Biden than as a fundamental crossroads over America's future priorities that will shape not only personal liberties but also economic opportunity.\n'We have to get people to shift their thinking about how this is a choice between two different futures,' she said. 'It can get people out of this one-to-one candidate-to- candidate [comparison] and asking, \u2018what I like, what I don't like' about Trump or Biden.'\nFor libertarians, the escalating struggle between Biden and Republicans over the idea of freedom is a source of both bemusement and frustration. Libertarians take a purist position that advocates for minimal government intervention in both personal behavior and the economy; they usually find Republicans deficient on the first count, and Democrats on the second.\nDavid Boaz, a distinguished senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, sees those flaws in both Biden and Trump. The Biden administration, Boaz said, is 'very big on reproductive freedom, and very big on a lot of aspects of LGBTQ freedom, but beyond those things, where's the freedom in the Biden-Harris plan?' And while Trump talks about promoting economic freedom by cutting taxes and regulation, Boaz continued, Republicans have also undermined such freedom by promoting high tariffs and using government policy to punish companies they disfavor, as DeSantis did with Disney in Florida.\nBut while Boaz believes both Biden and Trump have imperfect records when it comes to promoting freedom, he thinks one issue breaks the tie between them: Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election. \ufeff'I have friends who say Biden is the biggest spender ever and he's regulating and he's woke and how can anyone consider voting for him over Trump?' Boaz said.\n'And I'll say that one reason is that Biden has not tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power. That's a very fundamental issue. You can add up all these [other] issues and weigh them. But the big freedom issue that Biden has over Trump,' Boaaz added, 'is that Trump tried to steal an election.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Ronald Brownstein","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bc56ff7a-5e96-468d-93c1-418068e7e891.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.8101277,"_id":"81dbae72a82253d6374c4fc6129317ab"},{"title":"Why Biden and Democrats are talking so much about freedom","author":"Ronald Brownstein","published_date":"2024-04-17 04:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/abortion-democrats-freedom-messaging/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration:\u2026","summary":"When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration: 'This fight is about freedom, and the freedom that is fundamental to the promise of America.'\nIn a new abortion-focused ad that the Biden campaign aired in Arizona last week, President Joe Biden somberly asks: 'If Donald Trump gets back in power, what freedom will you lose next?'\nFor Biden, Harris and other Democrats to lean so heavily on the word 'freedom' in this campaign is a historic reversal of roles. At least since the New Deal 90 years ago, Republicans have been the party most likely to frame their agenda as advancing 'freedom' and 'liberty' while Democrats have more often emphasized ideas such as 'equality' and 'justice.'\nRepublicans haven't abandoned their rhetorical efforts to claim the terrain of freedom. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for instance, used the word almost as a mantra the past few years to denounce the restrictions many states imposed to fight the spread of Covid-19 and to attack what he calls the left's effort to impose 'woke ideology.' And Trump disparages Biden's agenda to promote the deployment of electric vehicles as an attempt to deny Americans' freedom to continue purchasing gas-powered cars and trucks.\nBut the GOP push at every level of government to roll back the 'rights revolution' of the past six decades \u2013 symbolized by the proliferation of red-state laws limiting access to abortion and potentially other reproductive health care such as IVF \u2013 has provided Democrats a historic opportunity to reverse the direction of this long-running debate, many analysts agree.\n'Historically, Republicans have rooted their philosophical world view in liberty: for them it's about freedom to own guns, to practice religion as they see fit' or reducing government taxes, spending and regulation, said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute, which studies the intersection of culture and politics. 'What's new is Democrats are using the term in ways to reimagine what freedom really means.'\nTransforming the debate over freedom may be especially crucial for Biden because polls consistently show Trump with a double-digit lead when voters are asked who they trust more to handle the economy. That means that to win the election Biden will need to convince a substantial number of voters who believe Trump is better for their bottom line to vote against him anyway. The interrelated issues revolving around rights, values and democracy likely offer the president his best chance to do so. 'If any issue' is going to flip voters who express more confidence in Trump on the economy, 'it is going to be social issues like abortion,' said Deckman.\nBiden signaled the central role freedom would play in his campaign messaging from the outset, in the video he released last year announcing his plan to seek reelection. As an ominous piano key trills behind images of the January 6, 2021, insurrection, abortion rights protesters and the White House, Biden opens the video with a stark declaration: 'Freedom. Personal freedom is fundamental to who we are as Americans. There's nothing more important. Nothing more sacred.' Later he says: 'The question we're facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer. I know what I want the answer to be, and I think you do too.'\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security.\nRoe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security. Harris, who has been the administration's point person in delivering the freedom message, has likewise cast an expansive net. When Harris delivered a Martin Luther King Day speech to the NAACP this year that summarized the administration's case for another term, she cited all the issues Biden did in the video and others, such as the restrictions several red states have imposed on the teaching of the nation's racial history and the right 'to live free from the horror of gun violence.'\nWay to Win, a liberal group that funds organizations and campaigns focusing on voters of color, has been pushing the party for several years to emphasize the freedom argument. Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, the group's vice president and chief strategy officer, says linking all these other issues to abortion is key to portraying Trump and his allies as a threat to freedom.\n'If [abortion] was the only thing, it would feel different than if you are able to tick off all these other things that they are doing and that they will do,' she said. 'We can even say it with other kinds of repro [rights]: We can say it with IVF, or now they are going to come for your contraception. Abortion is an entry point: because it is so visceral for people, it is a way to connect to a larger story about rights and freedoms.'\nLauren Hitt, a senior spokesperson for the Biden campaign, argued freedom will be a powerful message for the president because it resonates with a broad range of voters. 'It \u2026 speaks to the values of traditional Republican voters, [Nikki] Haley primary voters, and suburban voters \u2013 as well as to our base who believe deeply that the government shouldn't be making personal decisions for people,' she said. 'It's a uniquely powerful idea grounded in traditional democratic values that will be critical in winning the swing voters we need to win in November.'\nThe Trump campaign pushed back on Biden's ad asking which freedom Trump would take away next. 'Under Joe Biden, Americans are less free, less safe, and less prosperous,' Karoline Leavitt, the campaign's national spokesperson, said in a statement.\nDaniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that broad changes in societal attitudes have encouraged both parties to emphasize their commitments to personal freedom. 'Each side recognizes this is something people care about,' Cox said. 'It's effective language at a time when we are increasingly individualistic. We are not as inclined to be communitarian and oriented toward the concerns of others. So I think it's not a surprise that we're seeing both political parties try to employ this language to their advantage.'\nEven with all the increased Democratic emphasis on protecting rights, Cox said, the issue remains 'contested ground' that can favor either party depending on how it is framed. While Republicans have been 'on their heels' defending abortion restrictions such as last week's Arizona ruling, he said, the party has benefited in other races from positioning itself as defending 'parent's rights,' as Republican Glenn Youngkin did while winning the Virginia governorship in 2021. (It's notable that when abortion rights and parental rights collided in the 2023 Virginia state legislative elections, Democrats stressing the former won control of both chambers over Republicans emphasizing the latter.)\nPolling suggests the public remains split over which party it trusts to defend basic rights and freedoms. To begin with, Democrats and Republicans hold very different priorities over which rights are most important to protect, PRRI found in unpublished national polling shared exclusively with CNN. In that survey, conducted late last year, Republicans were most likely to say their freedom to own guns, to practice their religion and to speak their mind was growing more restricted; Democrats were most likely to say that they were losing the freedom to control their own body. 'The parties are talking past each other,' Deckman said. 'Freedom is a word that is quintessentially American, but it depends on what freedoms you are referring to in the first place.'\nThe public returned a similar split verdict last fall in an NBC poll that asked voters which party they trusted more to handle different issues. In the poll, Democrats held a commanding 18 percentage point advantage on dealing with abortion. But when asked which party they trusted more on 'protecting our constitutional rights,' voters preferred Republicans by a margin of 43% to 35%. Even White women, who strongly preferred Democrats on abortion, split evenly over which party they trusted on the broader question of preserving core constitutional rights.\nThat GOP advantage may reflect the traditional political dynamic that conservative voters have been more likely than liberals to believe their rights are under siege and to view government actions as a threat to their liberty. In 2022 polling by Penn State University's McCourtney Institute for Democracy, Republicans were twice as likely as Democrats to say that they had lost rights and freedoms over the past decade. Republicans were also considerably more likely, though not by as lopsided a margin, to predict that they would lose more rights than they gain over the next decade.\nThe real-world consequence of that imbalance was on display in the 2016 presidential campaign, when Democratic-leaning voters largely shrugged about Hillary Clinton's warnings that a Trump victory would allow him to move the Supreme Court to the right in a way that would threaten basic rights, like abortion.\nChris Wilson, a GOP pollster who worked for the super PAC supporting DeSantis in the 2024 campaign, said the Penn State polling suggests that Biden still will face difficulty mobilizing key elements of the Democratic coalition with a message about rights and freedoms. He noted that such groups as Generation Z, Blacks and Latinos were much less likely than college-educated Whites or Republicans to express fears in the poll that they would lose rights in the decade ahead.\n'To whatever extent the Democrats are trying to make a rights argument, it's not as worrying to the youth and to minorities as it is to Whites, people with college degrees, and Boomers,' Wilson said. 'Biden's \u2018rights' argument might be a big hit with his peers, but might be the wrong note to strike if he wants to hold onto the parts of the Democratic coalition that are starting to look shaky.'\nBut the Penn State polling was conducted before the Dobbs decision ended the nationwide right to abortion. And many analysts believe that seismic shift has increased the relevance of questions revolving around rights and freedoms to key groups that Democrats rely on \u2013 with younger women especially focused on these threats. While Republicans traditionally responded more to these arguments, Deckman said, 'These times certainly have made freedom a more accessible, even an existential, issue for people on the left.'\nFernandez Ancona agrees to an extent with both Wilson and Deckman. The 2022 elections, she said, demonstrated how strongly many people react to the risk of losing rights they believed had been settled. 'When these things you take for granted are taken away in this very stark way, it's incredibly motivating,' she said. But she also believes that Democrats need to tie their case about defending personal freedom into a broader message that portrays the 2024 election less as a personal choice between Trump and Biden than as a fundamental crossroads over America's future priorities that will shape not only personal liberties but also economic opportunity.\n'We have to get people to shift their thinking about how this is a choice between two different futures,' she said. 'It can get people out of this one-to-one candidate-to- candidate [comparison] and asking, \u2018what I like, what I don't like' about Trump or Biden.'\nFor libertarians, the escalating struggle between Biden and Republicans over the idea of freedom is a source of both bemusement and frustration. Libertarians take a purist position that advocates for minimal government intervention in both personal behavior and the economy; they usually find Republicans deficient on the first count, and Democrats on the second.\nDavid Boaz, a distinguished senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, sees those flaws in both Biden and Trump. The Biden administration, Boaz said, is 'very big on reproductive freedom, and very big on a lot of aspects of LGBTQ freedom, but beyond those things, where's the freedom in the Biden-Harris plan?' And while Trump talks about promoting economic freedom by cutting taxes and regulation, Boaz continued, Republicans have also undermined such freedom by promoting high tariffs and using government policy to punish companies they disfavor, as DeSantis did with Disney in Florida.\nBut while Boaz believes both Biden and Trump have imperfect records when it comes to promoting freedom, he thinks one issue breaks the tie between them: Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election. \ufeff'I have friends who say Biden is the biggest spender ever and he's regulating and he's woke and how can anyone consider voting for him over Trump?' Boaz said.\n'And I'll say that one reason is that Biden has not tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power. That's a very fundamental issue. You can add up all these [other] issues and weigh them. But the big freedom issue that Biden has over Trump,' Boaaz added, 'is that Trump tried to steal an election.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ronald Brownstein,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bc56ff7a-5e96-468d-93c1-418068e7e891.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.8038597,"_id":"29d5ef176fd69a8b984c85be46f5d200"},{"title":"How Johnson came to embrace Ukraine aid and defy his right flank","author":"Annie Grayer","published_date":"2024-04-21 11:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/21/politics/ukraine-aid-mike-johnson-house-speaker-israel-taiwan","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The day after Iran attacked Israel, House Speaker Mike Johnson was on the phone with a man who suddenly held the keys to his legislative agenda and potentially his own future: House Democratic leader\u2026","summary":"Watch 'Inside Politics Sunday with Manu Raju' at 8 a.m. ET and 11 a.m. ET on Speaker Johnson and the tension in the House GOP.\nWatch 'Inside Politics Sunday with Manu Raju' at 8 a.m. ET and 11 a.m. ET on Speaker Johnson and the tension in the House GOP. CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 The day after Iran attacked Israel, House Speaker Mike Johnson was on the phone with a man who suddenly held the keys to his legislative agenda and potentially his own future: House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.\nIn a phone call that has not been previously reported, Johnson said he was ready to act on foreign aid, even though that would enrage Republicans who did not support additional assistance to Ukraine and could potentially cost him his job, a source familiar with the conversation told CNN.\nJeffries pressed Johnson on how many Republicans he could deliver to support the aid for Ukraine, knowing House Democrats would have to bring the rest, the source added.\nBut when Johnson returned to Washington, DC, on Monday plotting his path forward, he was faced with an onslaught of attacks from many of his GOP colleagues.\nThe Louisiana Republican quickly began hearing an earful from hardline conservatives, coming to realize his risky gambit of holding separate votes on aid for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan \u2013 and later tying those bills together in one package without including conservative demands over stricter border policies \u2013 could trigger a snap vote to remove him as speaker.\nOn Tuesday, Johnson sat in his office as members streamed in to voice their complaints and level their demands. By nighttime, he was wrestling how to proceed. Feeling the weight of his future and knowing history was watching him, Johnson, a devout Christian, turned to prayer.\n'He was torn between trying to save his job and do the right thing,' House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a top Ukraine advocate who was with Johnson the night before the legislation was released, told CNN. 'He prayed over it.'\nJohnson ultimately emerged Wednesday firm in his convictions that he was on the right path to make the most consequential decision of his political career by moving ahead with billions of dollars in foreign aid. The decision culminated in a tense scene on the House floor as Republican members traded insults and the speaker navigated his warring factions.\n'Kick rocks, tubby,' Rep. Derrick Van Orden said to Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican trying to derail Johnson's plans.\nIn a message to his colleagues ahead of the release of legislative text, Johnson acknowledged the 'significant member feedback and discussion.' And publicly, Johnson \u2013 who came into the job somewhat accidentally after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted in October \u2013 was even more blunt.\n'My philosophy is do the right thing and let the chips fall where they may. If I operated out of fear over motion to vacate, I would never be able to do my job. Look, history judges us for what we do. This is a critical time right now,' Johnson said Wednesday.\n'I can make a selfish decision and do something that is different, but I'm doing here what I believe to be the right thing. I think providing aid to Ukraine right now is critically important,' the speaker added.\nThe $95 billion aid package, which has the backing of President Joe Biden, ultimately passed Saturday with the support of 210 Democrats and 101 Republicans. It now heads to the Senate, which is expected to give final approval this week.\nDespite the bipartisan vote, Johnson admonished Democrats who waved Ukrainian flags on the House floor after the bill's passage.\n'We should only wave one flag on the House floor. And I think we know which flag that is,' Johnson said.\nThe speaker's embrace of Ukraine aid represents a remarkable evolution for Johnson, who voted against funding for the country as a rank-and-file member. But almost immediately after securing the speaker's gavel, sources say he began to hear directly from critical Republican national security voices \u2013 including Donald Trump's former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who impressed upon him the urgent need to approve assistance for Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion.\nIn March, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky lobbied the speaker directly. Within minutes of the House approving a new military aid package for Ukraine on Saturday, Zelensky offered his thanks to US lawmakers, and in particular to Johnson for his decision that 'keeps history on the right track.'\nAnd more recently, Johnson received a key intelligence briefing from CIA Director Bill Burns, who painted a picture of the dire situation on the battlefield in Ukraine and the global consequences of inaction, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the situation. The briefing left a lasting impression, and Johnson became increasingly convinced the fate of Western democracy was on his shoulders, sources close to him said.\nAnother factor that sources say weighed heavily on his decision-making: Johnson's oldest son was recently accepted into the Naval Academy.\n'To put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys. My son is going to begin in the Naval Academy this fall. This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is so many American families,' Johnson told reporters. 'This is not a game, this is not a joke.'\nIf Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and her supporters make good on their threat to force a vote on ousting him as speaker, Johnson will almost certainly need to rely on Democrats to bail him out. Johnson maintains that he has not asked any Democrats for their help, but senior Republicans believe they will be able to count on support across the aisle to swiftly kill any motion to vacate the speaker's chair \u2013 a feeling that may have bolstered Johnson's confidence in pressing ahead with his plans.\nIt is still unclear whether Democrats will throw him a lifeline. But they have expressed a willingness to save Johnson, especially after he defied his right flank to move ahead with a foreign aid package that closely resembles a Senate-passed version.\n'We'll have to have the conversation before the House caucus. But first thing's first, we still have to get the national security bills over the finish line,' Jeffries told reporters Friday.\nJohnson did not come to his decision on how to handle foreign aid quickly.\nIn one of his first acts as speaker, Johnson put on the floor a bill that provided $14.3 billion in aid for Israel. The measure went nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate because it did not include money for Ukraine and would have enacted funding cuts to the Internal Revenue Service.\nHe remained resistant to moving on Ukraine funding, letting the Senate-passed foreign aid package sit idle for months \u2013 even when Biden and the other three top congressional leaders, including Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, pressured him to act in a tense Oval Office meeting in February.\n'Slow,' New York Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said when asked how Johnson handled Ukraine aid. 'It should have been done months ago; should have just put the Senate bill on the floor. It would have gotten 300 votes.'\nMany Republicans believe Johnson could have arrived at his position of supporting Ukraine aid much sooner, as the bipartisan support was inevitable.\n'We have walked through broken glass to get a result, all of which could have been done before Christmas, but we're bringing it out until nearly summer,' GOP Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina told CNN. 'That is an active choice that I disagree with.'\nPart of Johnson's reluctance: Trump, who has been critical of Ukraine aid and has the power to make or break any legislation \u2013 and his own speakership. In recent weeks, allies counseled Johnson to keep the former president in the loop on his potential foreign aid plans.\nSo Johnson trekked down to Mar-a-Lago last week for an unrelated news conference, at Johnson's behest, where Trump expressed support not only for structuring some Ukraine aid as a loan but also for Johnson's speakership.\n'I stand by the speaker,' Trump said at the joint news conference.\nThe next day, Israel was attacked by Iranian missiles, fueling a new sense of urgency for Congress to act. Johnson knew he could no longer put off a decision, vowing over the weekend to put some form of Israel aid on the floor. But he was still wrestling with how to proceed.\nWhen Johnson finally announced his plans and the legislative text became public on Wednesday, he was facing an all-out revolt from his right flank.\n'It's tough to defend him right now,' said Arizona Rep. Eli Crane, one of the GOP members who voted to depose McCarthy.\nHardliners were furious that aid for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan would be voted on separately but ultimately merged into a single package to be sent to the Senate. A separate vote on a border security bill, meant to placate conservatives, was also met with swift opposition.\n'I don't defend the performance of the speaker. I don't defend the actions that have been taken. \u2026 I think this is a terrible mistake,' said GOP Rep. Bob Good of Virginia, who also supported McCarthy's ouster, adding that Johnson 'has failed us.'\nMeanwhile, moderate Republicans were lobbying Johnson to raise the threshold required to trigger a motion to vacate the speaker's chair to make it harder for any single member to use, essentially neutralizing the threat from Greene.\nJohnson, a self-described 'wartime speaker,' walked into a meeting with center-right Republicans who showed him overwhelming support, giving him multiple standing ovations.\n'I think he needed it,' a GOP lawmaker in the closed-door meeting told CNN. 'He certainly said that.'\nBut news of Johnson weighing a rule change on the motion to vacate sparked a fury on his right.\nThursday morning, Johnson found himself essentially pinned against the wall of the House floor as he was swarmed by right-wing lawmakers pressing him for assurances that he would not change the rules on the motion to vacate and making last-ditch efforts to change his course on foreign aid.\nIn one particularly bizarre moment, as the intense huddle was taking place, Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas stood at the microphones at the front of the chamber for a floor speech and began citing the Pledge of Allegiance. Johnson and the group of hardliners stopped their conversation, turned to the American flag at the front of the room, put their hands over their hearts, and recited the pledge along with Green, according to a GOP member who witnessed the moment. They then turned back around and resumed arguing.\nThe huddle grew so heated, that at one point, Van Orden \u2013 a Johnson ally who decided to step in and provide backup for the speaker \u2013 told Gaetz to 'kick rocks, tubby.'\n'I'm a retired Navy Seal, and Navy Seals only go places with a swim buddy, and the speaker didn't have a swim buddy,' Van Orden told CNN, recounting the exchange. 'So he didn't ask me to come over there. I went and was his swim buddy.'\n'Matt Gaetz is a bully, Chip Roy's a bully, Bob Good's a bully, and the only way to stop a bully is to push back harder,' the Wisconsin Republican added.\nGaetz told reporters Van Orden was acting 'unhinged' and called him 'not particularly intelligent.'\nBut Democrats, too, were leery of rules changes to make it harder to kick out the speaker, according to multiple congressional sources. Jeffries had been supportive of making other rules changes to empower Democrats \u2013 something Republicans opposed. It was clear Johnson couldn't get a deal with Democrats or the votes to change the threshold to call for such a vote.\nHours later, Johnson announced he would not move ahead with changing the motion to vacate tool, declaring there was not enough support in the House.\nLate Thursday night, Democrats joined Republicans to deliver the votes needed to move the foreign aid package out of the House Rules Committee and onto the floor, a rare bipartisan move and something a minority party has never done in recent history.\nThat bipartisan spirit carried into Friday, when Democrats again crossed party lines to help Republicans clear another key legislative hurdle on the House floor.\nBut then Greene's effort to oust Johnson grew by one, with GOP Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona announcing shortly after the vote that he was co-sponsoring the motion to vacate, becoming the third member to do so.\nStill, Johnson's foreign aid plan sailed over the finish line Saturday, leaning heavily on Democratic support \u2013 with less than half of the Republican conference voting for aid for Ukraine. Johnson has relied on a bipartisan coalition to pass every bill that has become law under his watch, and Democrats will likely be needed for other must-pass bills this year \u2013 and potentially, to save Johnson's speakership.\nJohnson has forcefully defended his plans, arguing his foreign aid package is a better product than the Senate-passed version, which some Republicans had been threatening to join with Democrats in forcing a floor vote on if the speaker didn't act.\n'I know there are critics of the legislation. I understand that. It is not a perfect piece of legislation. We're not ensured that in a time of divided government and in a time where there are lots of different opinions,' Johnson said after the bills passed Saturday. 'But there's no question whatsoever that the House has made many strong improvements to the Senate bill, and the product that we've sent over there is much better.'\nVeteran GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma also argued Johnson's dependence on Democrats is the reality of governing in a razor-thin majority.\n'This place is probably operating right now more like the founders thought it would,' Cole told reporters.\nBut even if Johnson keeps his job, some hardliners are warning it's politically untenable if he is propped up by Democrats.\n'There's probably a clear consensus that next Congress, he won't be speaker,' said Rep. Warren Davidson, a Freedom Caucus member from Ohio.\nCNN's Haley Talbot and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.\nCNN's Haley Talbot and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Annie Grayer,Manu Raju,Melanie Zanona","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/283939c2-de00-4978-adb1-35926f765fa7.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.7853246,"_id":"214391be4b0008b4b5d5e8cb46476716"},{"title":"Trump hush-money trial, House foreign aid bill, Columbia University campus crisis","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-22 17:11:43","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/cnn-this-morning/episodes/19221798-a9b7-11ee-804d-23df811bd798","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"As opening statements are set to begin in Donald Trump's hush money trial we bring you new CNN reporting on who prosecutors plan to call as their first witness.

Their refusal to lead the US into debt or financial crises or to compromise America's global role ended up driving them into political oblivion.\nNow, as Johnson tries to pass billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan \u2014 vital to protecting US allies from Russian, Iranian and Chinese totalitarianism and preserving US power and prestige \u2013 he's having to put his own job on the line to confront GOP extremists who accuse him of betraying the party's base.\n'When you do the right thing, you let the chits fall where they may,' Johnson said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on Wednesday ahead of three critical days that could decide whether he can cling to his gavel.\nThe prospects for the rookie speaker look grim. His tiny majority means he can't afford to lose more than one GOP vote to pass a bill on a party-line vote. And two hardliners, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, are threatening to call a vote to oust him if he puts the Ukraine bill on the floor.\nOther right-wing Republicans are warning Johnson must make $60 billion in Ukraine aid conditional on tough new border security measures despite the party's trashing of the most conservative immigration compromise in decades at presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump's behest.\nThe schism in the GOP highlights how Trump has eroded the party's internationalist principles in favor of his 'America First' creed. Lawmakers like Greene and Texas Rep. Chip Roy counter traditional national security arguments by warning there is no greater US interest than protecting the southern border, following high levels of crossing by undocumented migrants in recent months.\nRoy, who is yet to decide whether to back an effort to oust Johnson, told CNN Wednesday that he was 'disappointed' in the speaker and was 'past the point of giving grace.' Johnson's increasing vulnerability on this issue is particularly acute since he was also arguing for months that there could be no Ukraine aid without using the same measure to force the White House to introduce draconian measures at the US border with Mexico.\nRising right-wing opposition to his foreign aid plans has left Johnson in a deeply vulnerable position. To even pass a rule to set up a cascading series of votes on the bills this weekend, Johnson is almost certain to need Democratic votes. The minority party may also have to save him if Greene calls up her motion to vacate the speaker's chair \u2013 a step several Democrats say they are prepared to take to ensure that Ukraine aid will pass at a moment when Kyiv warns it will lose its war of survival without urgent help. This could save Johnson in the short term. But a GOP speaker dependent on Democratic votes will be seen by many Republicans as a tool of the minority party and would be on borrowed time.\nJohnson's problem is a more extreme version of one that has dogged Republican speakers for years. A strong but small group of right-wing Republicans elected on absolutist platforms in deep-red districts comes to Washington with an expansive agenda and adamant they won't compromise with Democrats. But they lack the power or numbers to force their will apart from in the rare phases when Republicans have a monopoly on Washington power. The frustrated extremists then turn on GOP leaders and accuse them of becoming traitors \u2013 simply because they live in the land of political reality.\nFor example, Greene told CNN's Manu Raju on Wednesday: 'I don't know how long people are going to tolerate this because he is doing nothing but serving the Democrats.'\nJohnson, who is facing claims that he's sold out despite being possibly the most conservative speaker in history, tried to explain his constraints in the interview with Tapper. 'The Republicans run the House. We have the smallest majority in the House. The Democrats are in charge of the Senate and the White House. So, by definition, we won't get everything we want,' he said.\nThe idea, however, that the party should settle for something less than an absolutist position is not one that flies in the modern GOP, where stunt politics that play well on conservative media are as important as legislating. 'There's certain members that just prefer the minority,' Texas GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw, who supports sending new aid to Ukraine, told CNN's Raju. 'It's easier, just, you can always just be against something, you never really have to work.'\nThe speaker had seemed to buy himself some time after traveling to Mar-a-Lago last week to bolster Trump's false claims of election fraud and securing in return about the strongest public endorsement the ex-president is likely to give. Johnson 'is doing a very good job,' Trump said. Logic suggests that the presumptive GOP nominee has an interest in delaying a third debacle over electing a GOP speaker since the party won the majority in the 2022 midterm elections because it might distract from his own campaign to take back the White House. Yet Greene, one of Trump's top supporters, hasn't taken his hint and is still determined to bring Johnson down. The speaker might be wise not to trust Trump. Loyalty to others is a fungible commodity for the ex-president. Once Trump senses an associate is vulnerable or no longer serves his political interests, he usually casts them loose.\nJohnson's push to put foreign aid bills on the floor separately ahead of a possible attempt to jam them together to send to the Senate \u2013 another move infuriating hardliners \u2013 might be a logical solution in a normal House. In this way, those who oppose Ukraine aid on principle could vote against it, allowing Democrats who support it to ensure its passage. There could be a strong bipartisan vote to help Israel, days after Iran's air attacks, and to support Taiwan, which is increasingly vulnerable to China's massive military buildup. And Republicans could get cover by voting for a separate bill that Johnson plans to put on the floor strengthening border security. But the extreme polarization of the GOP majority \u2013 and the lack of maneuvering room Johnson has after the 'red wave' failed to materialize in the 2022 midterms \u2013 gives individual members the opportunity to create chaos and makes governing all but impossible.\nOn Wednesday evening, for example, in another defeat for Johnson, the House Rules Committee recessed because it was unable to pass a rule on the border security bill, with Republicans threatening to vote against the measure in committee.\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Johnson's new strategy is the way that he is now forcibly arguing about the need for the US to send billions of dollars in aid to its allies. (In order to placate some Republicans, some economic aid to Ukraine has been refashioned as a loan). As a backbencher, Johnson voted against sending more funds to Ukraine several times and he's been careful in his six months as speaker not to get too far ahead of GOP critics of bankrolling Kyiv's war effort.\nBut on Wednesday, he was making the kind of foreign policy argument that could have been voiced by any GOP leader from President Dwight Eisenhower to President George W. Bush \u2013 one that was a clear departure from Trumpism.\n'We are going to stand by Israel, our close ally and dear friend, and we're going to stand for freedom and make sure that Vladimir Putin doesn't march through Europe. These are important responsibilities,' Johnson told Tapper. 'Since World War II, really, the responsibility for the free world has been shifted onto our shoulders. And we accept that role. We're an exceptional nation.'\nJohnson added: 'We're the greatest nation on the planet, and we have to act like it. And we have to project to Putin and Xi and Iran and North Korea and anybody else that we will defend freedom.'\nIt was not immediately clear what has prompted Johnson's change of emphasis.\nThe shocking magnitude of Iran's missile and drone attack on Israel last week \u2013 even if it was largely repelled by US, Israeli, British and Jordanian military forces \u2013 has concentrated minds on Capitol Hill about the urgency of replenishing the Israeli arsenal.\nUkraine's need is even more acute. Russia has continued relentless attacks on civilians and infrastructure, and there have been multiple warnings from top US defense and intelligence officials that without Biden's vitally needed aid package, Kyiv could lose the war. 'I think we're already seeing things on the battlefield begin to shift a bit in terms of in Russia's favor,' Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told the House Defense Appropriations subcommittee Wednesday. The implications for a Russian victory would be grave and create new security threats to the West in Europe. And the possibility that the United States would abandon a fellow democracy under assault from a ruthless leader in the Kremlin would shatter the country's reputation abroad and weaken its power as a result. That may be a stain the speaker doesn't want on his conscience or as part of his legacy.\nJohnson, unlike his extremist members, has responsibilities as speaker \u2013 one of the great offices of state that go beyond short-term political interests. And he's been under relentless pressure from foreign leaders, as well as the White House. Biden, for instance, warned in a Wall Street Journal article Wednesday that 'both Ukraine and Israel are under attack by brazen adversaries that seek their annihilation.'\nIf Johnson can somehow engineer passage of the bills aiding Israel and Ukraine this weekend, he'd be bolstering a global leadership role the US played for decades. It's a measure of how much the GOP has changed that such a role might be considered political apostasy and could cost him his job.\nBut he told reporters on Wednesday evening, while making the case that military aid for Ukraine was now critical, 'I'm doing here what I believe to be the right thing.'\n'History judges us for what we do.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Stephen Collinson,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2148847580-20240417203920057-20240417203938535.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.559833,"_id":"a86c8553abada7c443341c7f46d64669"},{"title":"House GOP erupts into name-calling and fresh threats to Johnson over effort to pass aid","author":"Melanie Zanona","published_date":"2024-04-18 13:31:43","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/18/politics/mike-johnson-speakership-rules/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Speaker Mike Johnson is being lobbied by his members to raise the threshold required to trigger the procedure to oust the speaker, according to multiple GOP sources \u2013 a move that would help ensure the\u2026","summary":"Right-wing lawmakers are ramping up their threats to remove Speaker Mike Johnson from his role after Johnson's supporters pushed him to make it harder to oust him from the speakership.\nCNN and other outlets reported Thursday morning that, according to multiple GOP sources, Johnson is being lobbied by his members to raise the threshold required to trigger the procedure to oust the speaker \u2013 a move that would help ensure the Louisiana Republican can pass foreign aid bills and still keep his job without needing to rely on Democrats to bail him out. Currently, any single member can force a floor vote on the motion to vacate \u2014 part of the deal Kevin McCarthy made to become speaker last year.\nThe suggestion set off another round of fury amid conservative lawmakers who are unhappy with the speaker over his proposed package of bills to send aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan among other priorities. An effort has been brewing for weeks to potentially oust Johnson, led by Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, and the proposal to change the rules around ousting the speaker has ignited intense speculation over Johnson's future.\nIt's unclear what Johnson will do, but members believe he is considering the change to the process known as the motion to vacate the chair, which would be a significant move by Johnson.\nIn recent days, rank-and-file House Republicans have privately encouraged Johnson to insert language into the text of a rule for the foreign aid bills to alter the motion to vacate and make it harder for any single member to use.\nThe House is finished with floor action for the day, which means that the earliest that Greene could make a motion to oust Johnson would be on Friday. If Greene takes that consequential step, the House will have to consider it within two legislative days. A floor vote to oust Johnson would require a majority to succeed.\nHouse leadership will have to decide how to handle the issue. A motion to table \u2013 or kill \u2013 the resolution could be offered and voted on first. That would also only require a simple majority to succeed.\nNews that Johnson was being lobbied to raise the threshold was first reported by Punchbowl News.\nTensions were running high in the House on Thursday morning. At one point, Johnson was surrounded on the House floor by a number of far-right lawmakers in a heated discussion. Johnson was essentially pinned against the back wall of the House floor with members on all sides of him, with the speaker constantly pivoting his head as he responded to members speaking to him.\nThe group implored Johnson to give them assurances that he would not raise the threshold on the motion to vacate, and the speaker would not commit, leaving many of the lawmakers fuming and some even saying this was their red line that could propel the motion to oust him forward.\n\ufeff'We notified him that any effort to change the threshold of motion to vacate would likely induce the motion to vacate,' GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, who participated in the conversation, told CNN.\nGOP Rep. Derrick Van Orden entered the 20-minute heated floor conversation as it was ongoing and dared his right-wing colleagues to move on the motion to oust Johnson, even calling Gaetz 'tubby.'\nOne GOP lawmaker who participated in the conversation with Johnson, who was granted the anonymity to speak freely, said Van Orden started 'threatening everyone to go ahead with a motion to vacate.'\nThe GOP lawmaker described Johnson as 'very frustrated.'\nGreene warned the speaker against trying to change the threshold and refused to rule out moving to remove him on Thursday.\n'Mike Johnson owes our entire conference a meeting, and if he wants to change the motion to vacate, he needs to come before the Republican conference that elected him and tell us of his intentions, and tell us what this rule change to the motion to vacate is going to be,' Greene told CNN's Manu Raju.\n'It's unprecedented. This has never happened in history, and it's completely wrong. He owes our conference the truth, and he owes Republicans answers,' she added.\nOn top of discussing motion to vacate on the floor, lawmakers said they tried to persuade Johnson to change his course on the foreign aid bills, but the speaker was not receptive.\nConservative Rep. Anna Paulina Luna said she suggested to Johnson on Wednesday night that he take a step back as he tries to push through the supplemental package against hardliners' wishes. Luna said there is concern supporting the motion to vacate could potentially cost Republicans the majority.\n'I think a bigger issue at hand, though, right now is why is it that we have messaging coming from the speaker that's contradictory to what happened with few months back,' she said.\nThe House Rules Committee is meeting Thursday morning to begin considering the foreign aid bills. Text of the rule will be unveiled after the committee approves it, which is expected later in the day.\nDemocrats will be needed in that committee vote and on the floor to advance the rule, as the House Democratic Caucus is still weighing how to proceed as Johnson's job is on the line and as the critical three-part supplemental aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan hangs in the balance.\nDemocrats are still divided on the question, with some arguing it's imperative the party overcomes the bitter partisanship that has been a hallmark of this Congress to deliver critical aid to Ukraine and others arguing it's up to Republicans to pass their own rules.\n'I mean, it's just another layer for sure,' Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat told CNN, adding, 'It's a ridiculous rule, which, you know, whether or not it's doing the right thing in this moment where we have a global security challenge, we ought to be trying to bail them out of their politics is another question.'\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat, said she wouldn't support a Republican rule regardless of whether it included changes to the motion to vacate.\n'I mean, I think they need to pass the rule on their own, but I've thought from the beginning that Kevin McCarthy never should have agreed to that,' Jayapal said. 'He sold his soul early on and he thought he could control everybody.'\nDemocratic Rep. Mike Quigley said he was inclined to back the rule and would think about even supporting it if it included a change to how the motion to vacate functioned.\n'I think dysfunction is everybody's problem. And I'd be open to whatever it takes so that we can function appropriately,' Quigley said.\nDemocratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said leadership needed to weigh in before he decided whether to support such a change.\nOne thing that is hanging over discussions is that many Democrats view Johnson as a more honest broker than McCarthy. Despite the fact they don't agree with him on many issues, they also believe that he's been a fair partner at a critical moment to pass government funding and now this aid to Ukraine.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.

Their refusal to lead the US into debt or financial crises or to compromise America's global role ended up driving them into political oblivion.\nNow, as Johnson tries to pass billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan \u2014 vital to protecting US allies from Russian, Iranian and Chinese totalitarianism and preserving US power and prestige \u2013 he's having to put his own job on the line to confront GOP extremists who accuse him of betraying the party's base.\n'When you do the right thing, you let the chips fall where they may,' Johnson said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on Wednesday ahead of three critical days that could decide whether he can cling to his gavel.\nThe prospects for the rookie speaker look grim. His tiny majority means he can't afford to lose more than one GOP vote to pass a bill on a party-line vote. And two hardliners, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, are threatening to call a vote to oust him if he puts the Ukraine bill on the floor.\nOther right-wing Republicans are warning Johnson must make $60 billion in Ukraine aid conditional on tough new border security measures despite the party's trashing of the most conservative immigration compromise in decades at presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump's behest.\nThe schism in the GOP highlights how Trump has eroded the party's internationalist principles in favor of his 'America First' creed. Lawmakers like Greene and Texas Rep. Chip Roy counter traditional national security arguments by warning there is no greater US interest than protecting the southern border, following high levels of crossing by undocumented migrants in recent months.\nRoy, who is yet to decide whether to back an effort to oust Johnson, told CNN Wednesday that he was 'disappointed' in the speaker and was 'past the point of giving grace.' Johnson's increasing vulnerability on this issue is particularly acute since he was also arguing for months that there could be no Ukraine aid without using the same measure to force the White House to introduce draconian measures at the US border with Mexico.\nRising right-wing opposition to his foreign aid plans has left Johnson in a deeply vulnerable position. To even pass a rule to set up a cascading series of votes on the bills this weekend, Johnson is almost certain to need Democratic votes. The minority party may also have to save him if Greene calls up her motion to vacate the speaker's chair \u2013 a step several Democrats say they are prepared to take to ensure that Ukraine aid will pass at a moment when Kyiv warns it will lose its war of survival without urgent help. This could save Johnson in the short term. But a GOP speaker dependent on Democratic votes will be seen by many Republicans as a tool of the minority party and would be on borrowed time.\nJohnson's problem is a more extreme version of one that has dogged Republican speakers for years. A strong but small group of right-wing Republicans elected on absolutist platforms in deep-red districts comes to Washington with an expansive agenda and adamant they won't compromise with Democrats. But they lack the power or numbers to force their will apart from in the rare phases when Republicans have a monopoly on Washington power. The frustrated extremists then turn on GOP leaders and accuse them of becoming traitors \u2013 simply because they live in the land of political reality.\nFor example, Greene told CNN's Manu Raju on Wednesday: 'I don't know how long people are going to tolerate this because he is doing nothing but serving the Democrats.'\nJohnson, who is facing claims that he's sold out despite being possibly the most conservative speaker in history, tried to explain his constraints in the interview with Tapper. 'The Republicans run the House. We have the smallest majority in the House. The Democrats are in charge of the Senate and the White House. So, by definition, we won't get everything we want,' he said.\nThe idea, however, that the party should settle for something less than an absolutist position is not one that flies in the modern GOP, where stunt politics that play well on conservative media are as important as legislating. 'There's certain members that just prefer the minority,' Texas GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw, who supports sending new aid to Ukraine, told CNN's Raju. 'It's easier, just, you can always just be against something, you never really have to work.'\nThe speaker had seemed to buy himself some time after traveling to Mar-a-Lago last week to bolster Trump's false claims of election fraud and securing in return about the strongest public endorsement the ex-president is likely to give. Johnson 'is doing a very good job,' Trump said. Logic suggests that the presumptive GOP nominee has an interest in delaying a third debacle over electing a GOP speaker since the party won the majority in the 2022 midterm elections because it might distract from his own campaign to take back the White House. Yet Greene, one of Trump's top supporters, hasn't taken his hint and is still determined to bring Johnson down. The speaker might be wise not to trust Trump. Loyalty to others is a fungible commodity for the ex-president. Once Trump senses an associate is vulnerable or no longer serves his political interests, he usually casts them loose.\nJohnson's push to put foreign aid bills on the floor separately ahead of a possible attempt to jam them together to send to the Senate \u2013 another move infuriating hardliners \u2013 might be a logical solution in a normal House. In this way, those who oppose Ukraine aid on principle could vote against it, allowing Democrats who support it to ensure its passage. There could be a strong bipartisan vote to help Israel, days after Iran's air attacks, and to support Taiwan, which is increasingly vulnerable to China's massive military buildup. And Republicans could get cover by voting for a separate bill that Johnson plans to put on the floor strengthening border security. But the extreme polarization of the GOP majority \u2013 and the lack of maneuvering room Johnson has after the 'red wave' failed to materialize in the 2022 midterms \u2013 gives individual members the opportunity to create chaos and makes governing all but impossible.\nOn Wednesday evening, for example, in another defeat for Johnson, the House Rules Committee recessed because it was unable to pass a rule on the border security bill, with Republicans threatening to vote against the measure in committee.\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Johnson's new strategy is the way that he is now forcibly arguing about the need for the US to send billions of dollars in aid to its allies. (In order to placate some Republicans, some economic aid to Ukraine has been refashioned as a loan). As a backbencher, Johnson voted against sending more funds to Ukraine several times and he's been careful in his six months as speaker not to get too far ahead of GOP critics of bankrolling Kyiv's war effort.\nBut on Wednesday, he was making the kind of foreign policy argument that could have been voiced by any GOP leader from President Dwight Eisenhower to President George W. Bush \u2013 one that was a clear departure from Trumpism.\n'We are going to stand by Israel, our close ally and dear friend, and we're going to stand for freedom and make sure that Vladimir Putin doesn't march through Europe. These are important responsibilities,' Johnson told Tapper. 'Since World War II, really, the responsibility for the free world has been shifted onto our shoulders. And we accept that role. We're an exceptional nation.'\nJohnson added: 'We're the greatest nation on the planet, and we have to act like it. And we have to project to Putin and Xi and Iran and North Korea and anybody else that we will defend freedom.'\nIt was not immediately clear what has prompted Johnson's change of emphasis.\nThe shocking magnitude of Iran's missile and drone attack on Israel last week \u2013 even if it was largely repelled by US, Israeli, British and Jordanian military forces \u2013 has concentrated minds on Capitol Hill about the urgency of replenishing the Israeli arsenal.\nUkraine's need is even more acute. Russia has continued relentless attacks on civilians and infrastructure, and there have been multiple warnings from top US defense and intelligence officials that without Biden's vitally needed aid package, Kyiv could lose the war. 'I think we're already seeing things on the battlefield begin to shift a bit in terms of in Russia's favor,' Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told the House Defense Appropriations subcommittee Wednesday. The implications for a Russian victory would be grave and create new security threats to the West in Europe. And the possibility that the United States would abandon a fellow democracy under assault from a ruthless leader in the Kremlin would shatter the country's reputation abroad and weaken its power as a result. That may be a stain the speaker doesn't want on his conscience or as part of his legacy.\nJohnson, unlike his extremist members, has responsibilities as speaker \u2013 one of the great offices of state that go beyond short-term political interests. And he's been under relentless pressure from foreign leaders, as well as the White House. Biden, for instance, warned in a Wall Street Journal article Wednesday that 'both Ukraine and Israel are under attack by brazen adversaries that seek their annihilation.'\nIf Johnson can somehow engineer passage of the bills aiding Israel and Ukraine this weekend, he'd be bolstering a global leadership role the US played for decades. It's a measure of how much the GOP has changed that such a role might be considered political apostasy and could cost him his job.\nBut he told reporters on Wednesday evening, while making the case that military aid for Ukraine was now critical, 'I'm doing here what I believe to be the right thing.'\n'History judges us for what we do.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Stephen Collinson","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2148847580-20240417203920057-20240417203938535.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.5484195,"_id":"8b571f68271be9eb601c237659289ffc"},{"title":"Rick Santorum Fast Facts","author":"Editorial Research","published_date":"2024-04-19 18:03:19","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2013/05/13/us/rick-santorum-fast-facts/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Read Rick Santorum Fast Facts on CNN.com and learn more about the former Pennsylvania congressman and former presidential candidate.","summary":"Here's a look at the life of Rick Santorum, former Pennsylvania congressman.\nBirth date: May 10, 1958\nBirth date: May 10, 1958 Birth place: Winchester, Virginia\nBirth place: Winchester, Virginia Birth name: Richard John Santorum\nBirth name: Richard John Santorum Father: Aldo Santorum, a psychologist\nFather: Aldo Santorum, a psychologist Mother: Catherine (Dughi) Santorum, a nurse\nMother: Catherine (Dughi) Santorum, a nurse Marriage: Karen (Garver) Santorum (1990-present)\nMarriage: Karen (Garver) Santorum (1990-present) Children: Isabella, 2008; Patrick, 2001; Peter, 1999; Sarah, 1998; Gabriel, born and died in 1996; Daniel, 1995; Richard Jr., 1993; Elizabeth, 1991\nChildren: Isabella, 2008; Patrick, 2001; Peter, 1999; Sarah, 1998; Gabriel, born and died in 1996; Daniel, 1995; Richard Jr., 1993; Elizabeth, 1991 Education: Pennsylvania State University, B.A., Political Science, 1980; University of Pittsburgh, M.B.A., 1981; Dickinson School of Law, J.D., 1986\nEducation: Pennsylvania State University, B.A., Political Science, 1980; University of Pittsburgh, M.B.A., 1981; Dickinson School of Law, J.D., 1986 Religion: Roman Catholic\nReligion: Roman Catholic Member of the 'Gang of Seven,' a group that exposed and condemned scandals in Congress, when in the House of Representatives.\nFounded the Congressional Working Group on Religious Freedom.\nKnown for spearheading and helping to pass the welfare reform bill and a ban on partial-birth abortion.\n1981-1986 - Administrative assistant to Pennsylvania state Senator J.

That weekend, Johnson earned full-throated support from Trump at a perilous time in his speakership.\nJohnson had announced Monday evening the House will take up separate bills this week to provide aid for Israel and Ukraine, heeding demands from the far right to keep the issues separate. But he also had left open the possibility that the bills could ultimately be packaged together, and Republican leaders could still take procedural steps to send all those pieces as one package to the Senate, which could enrage the right wing of the House GOP conference.\nThe speaker has been facing mounting pressure to make tweaks to the foreign aid package proposed earlier this week \u2013 and not just from his most right-wing members. While conservative House Freedom caucus members have been sounding the alarm on border security and the foreign aid bills since Tuesday's caucus meeting, the shouts have now spilled into the rank and file.\nModerate New York Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis on Wednesday told the speaker 'go back to Biden & Schumer and tell them he needs a border security measure to pass foreign aid.' Johnson said in his letter to members that he will bring forward an immigration bill that looks like the House's HR 2.\nA number of far-right House Republicans have been quick to shoot down the border bill that Johnson announced would be included with the foreign aid bills expected to be voted on Saturday, dispelling any hope that the border provisions would placate the speaker's right flank.\nThe border bill, which includes the core provisions of another House passed border package that remains dead in the Senate, was seen as a messaging exercise by Johnson in attempt to placate his colleagues demands on the border and it clearly does not appear to be working.\nGOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is leading the effort to oust Johnson, said on X: 'You are seriously out of step with Republicans by continuing to pass bills dependent on Democrats. Everyone sees through this.'\nIt all adds up to the most intense pressure that Johnson has faced over his future in his short time as speaker. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky on Tuesday said he would co-sponsor Greene's motion to vacate, which would boot Johnson from the speakership if it passed, leading the speaker to defiantly tell reporters that he would not be resigning.\nConservative hardliners were quickly fuming at Johnson for his decision to move ahead with billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine and loudly warning him it could cost him his job.\nAn angry Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said he is 'very disappointed' in the speaker, and he is 'past the point of giving grace.'\n'I need a little bit more time today, but it is not good,' Roy said when asked by CNN if it is time for him to get out of office.\nFirebrand Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz called Johnson's decision to move ahead with the foreign aid bills as tantamount to 'surrender,' vowing to vote against the package and work hard to pressure others to not support the move. Other Republicans also expressed anger and wouldn't rule out voting against Johnson on procedural motions that could upend the bill.\nWith Republicans only controlling the House by a razor-thin margin, Johnson will likely need Democrats to pass the foreign aid bills \u2013 and save his job should the motion to vacate come to the floor.\nHouse Democrats are waiting to weigh in on precisely how much they will help with procedural votes on the aid package until they see if it includes a must-have item for them: $9 billion in humanitarian aid to Gaza and other conflict zones around the globe.

'He went through a transformation. At the end of the day, a profile in courage is putting the nation above yourself, and that's what he did. He said, \u2018At the end of the day, I'm going to be on the right side of history irrespective of my job.''\nAid to Israel, Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific escaped months of congressional gridlock Saturday when the House passed a $95 billion foreign aid package in four separate bills, which will be compiled into one amendment and sent to the Senate for a Tuesday vote. The vote to advance the key aid legislation came as bipartisan pressure on Johnson to pass support for allies abroad mounted, while his far-right allies floated an effort to strip him of his gavel.\nA small group of hardline Republicans, led by firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, have rallied behind an effort to oust Johnson from House leadership, criticizing the Louisiana Republican for relying on Democrats to pass foreign aid, among other priorities. McCaul, who was with Johnson the night before the foreign aid legislation was released, recounted to CNN that the House leader \u2014 a devout Christian \u2014 prayed as he grappled with the political consequences of doing 'the right thing' by bringing the package to the chamber's floor.\n'We were running out of time \u2014 Ukraine is getting ready to fall,' McCaul said Sunday. 'He became the man that went from a district in Louisiana to the speaker of the United States to also someone who had to look at the entire world and had to carry the burden of that and make the right decision.'\nMcCaul contended a majority of House Republicans voted against supplemental aid to Ukraine because the conference 'bought into this notion that it's an either-or proposition' between supporting the US southern border and Ukraine.\n'The eyes of the world are watching, and our adversaries are watching, and history is watching \u2014 and that's what I kept telling my colleagues: Do you want to be a Chamberlain or a Churchill?' he questioned, an analogy McCaul has repeatedly employed in debates over continuing to provide aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia.\nEven with Johnson's victorious passage of these aid bills, the House could be plunged into chaos once again if the far-right wing of his party manages to oust him from the speakership.\nAsked if he believes Johnson's job is in jeopardy following the successful vote, McCaul argued 'stock in Mike Johnson has gone way up' and that the speaker has 'garnered a lot of respect' from both sides of the aisle.\nRepublican Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas, who represents a district along the southern border, also on Sunday applauded Johnson's role in passing the legislation.\n'We're at a point where we're just trying to govern, and that's what Mike Johnson has done, governed in an honorable way,' Gonzales told CNN's Dana Bash on CNN's 'State of the Union.'\n'Mike Johnson is going to avoid the cannibals in his own party here. \u2026 And the adults, we took control of the US Congress, and I think people got sick and tired \u2014 he's one of them \u2014 of Marjorie Taylor Greene being in charge of their life,' Gonzales said. 'I hope that the Democrats will continue to stand with Mike Johnson here for a functional Congress.'\nDemocratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has refused to say whether his party will back Johnson if Greene and her allies seek to unseat him with a motion to vacate \u2014 a threat Greene reiterated on Sunday, saying, 'Johnson has betrayed America.'\n'He needs to do the right thing to resign and allow us to move forward in a controlled process. If he doesn't do so, he will be vacated,' Greene said on Fox News' 'Sunday Morning Futures.'\nFormer President Donald Trump has voiced strong opposition to Ukraine aid in the past, arguing that the US should not grant foreign aid unless it is a loan and indicating that he would encourage Russian aggression against any NATO member country that doesn't pay enough. But Trump has not commented publicly about the package the House passed on Saturday and has previously expressed support for Johnson's speakership.\n'What (Trump) wants is for a lifeline to be given to Ukraine,' McCaul contended, 'so that when he gets into office \u2026 he can then negotiate and save it.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Michelle Shen,CNN,Avery Lotz","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/sipausa-52615085.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.5154896,"_id":"77955d4a2fffcfcd6c1c371b765f4b34"},{"title":"House Democrats keep options open as effort to oust Johnson grows","author":"Lauren Fox","published_date":"2024-04-16 23:23:24","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/house-democrats-options-johnson","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"House Democrats are divided over whether they would try and save Speaker Mike Johnson if an effort to oust him gets underway in the chamber, with institutionalists insisting that voting against a\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 House Democrats are divided over whether they would try and save Speaker Mike Johnson if an effort to oust him gets underway in the chamber, with institutionalists insisting that voting against a motion to vacate could protect the body from devolving into chaos mere months before a presidential election while progressive members warn that helping Johnson now could ultimately undermine the party with its base, which already may be less than enthusiastic about showing up at the polls in November.\nIt's a delicate call that most members are looking to House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries to ultimately make. But unlike in October, when Democrats were unified against helping defeat the motion to vacate against then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, this time the caucus is seeing schisms form. Many Democrats are apprehensive about catapulting the House back into a chaotic speakership fight during a time of tensions following the October 7 terror attacks against Israel, and a very different global stage than what existed just six months ago.\n'There is no way I'm going to let Marjorie Taylor Greene, who wants to secede from the Union, take over the House. There's no way I'm going to let Thomas Massie, who has never voted to help any of our allies. He would let the Ayatollah go right into Israel. He'd let Putin take all of Europe,' Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz said on CNN after Massie announced Tuesday he'd join Greene in her effort to oust Johnson. 'There is no way I'm going to side with these people, stand by while they let the world burn.'\nRecently reelected New York Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi has also pledged to kill an effort to oust Johnson if it came to that on the floor, but other Democrats \u2013 including one who held the same job as Johnson \u2013 aren't ready to make that kind of commitment.\n'Let's just hope that that does not happen, and that we can do our responsibilities, protect and defend our own democracy as we protect theirs,' former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. 'We want to take it one step at a time. But the fact is that if would be shameful for the Republicans to go to the lowest common denominator.'\nFor some, there is a wary willingness to stop Johnson's defenestration, but with conditions. California Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs said that Ukraine funding would have to pass out of the chamber before she'd consider sparing Johnson an early exit from his job.\n'If Speaker Johnson wants to talk to Hakeem Jeffries, I think we'd be open to something like that. But I don't think any of that will be possible unless Ukraine funding is passed,' she said. 'I think we would need to see Ukraine funding passed before anything else.'\nBehind the scenes, Jeffries has sought to downplay hypotheticals, urging members in a private caucus meeting Tuesday morning to understand the substance of the foreign aid bills expected later this week before weighing in on how the process \u2013 or any aftermath \u2013 should play out.\nBut deciding whether to save Johnson could come sooner rather than later. Unlike with McCarthy, who went on cable news and assailed Democrats in the days before eight Republicans led by Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz voted to oust him \u2013 a move that irritated Democrats and undermined their willingness to throw him a life raft \u2013 many Democrats feel as though Johnson has been a fair negotiator in recent months.\nIn his short time as speaker, Johnson has worked closely with Jeffries, the White House and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to secure a series of must-pass spending bills to avert a shutdown, no small task for a speaker who faced massive opposition to many of the bills from those within his own party. Johnson also had to secure a path forward to renew part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, another bill that angered hardliners in his ranks, particularly after a proposed amendment was defeated on the floor, including a no vote by Johnson himself. Although Johnson's policy vision is vastly different from Democrats' \u2013 he rejected the Senate's bipartisan immigration proposal within hours of its release and moved forward with an impeachment of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas \u2013 many Democrats both publicly and privately argue Johnson has been an honest broker since taking the speaker's gavel last fall, making them more willing to help him at a time when they realize the alternative could be a much more difficult GOP leader.\n'If he's a man of his word, and he has told me directly that he intends to bring this package to the floor \u2013 if all the details are there, I don't see that we would have any reason, I wouldn't personally have any reason, to remove him from the chair,' New Hampshire Democratic Rep. Ann Kuster told CNN.\nIt may not ultimately matter if Democrats are united or not. If only a handful of Republicans vote to oust Johnson, only a handful of Democrats would be needed to step in and help him keep his job.\nWith the Friday resignation of Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher from Congress, Johnson will have just a one-vote margin on any vote, giving each member of his conference the ability to scuttle legislation they don't like, unless he can get Democrats to vote with him. Should Greene follow through on her threat of a motion to vacate, and be joined by Massie, Republicans supporting Johnson would make a motion to table, a procedural vote that would set aside Greene's motion.\nAnd that is where Democrats would have to decide if they'd help Johnson.\nJeffries said last week he'd made the 'observation, not a declaration' that if the Louisiana Republican allowed the House to vote on the national security bill, 'I believe there are a reasonable number of Democrats who would not want to see the speaker fall as a result of doing the right thing.'\nBut some Democrats are adamant they won't help Johnson under any circumstance.\n'I am a Democrat. Everything he stands for, I oppose,' Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly said. 'It's simply not viable for Democrats to keep him in that chair.'\n'How often are we going to have to do this? What do you think his shelf life is if he's the Republican speaker who lives at the sufferance of Democrats, in his own caucus?' he asked.\nPutting a Ukraine aid package on the floor \u2013 with the motion to vacate threat hanging over him \u2013 would no doubt be Johnson's biggest gamble yet. The specifics of the aid packages have yet to be rolled out, and most Democrats CNN spoke to said they'd need to see those plans in detail before deciding if they'd help Johnson. At the top of their list: a requirement that the package include $9 billion in humanitarian aid for people around the world, including in Haiti, Sudan and Gaza.\n'I am not answering speculative questions about what the speaker's fate is,' Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut said, 'For me, the moment is, how are we getting a national security package on the floor of the House?'\n'We've waited too long to get to this point,' she said.\nBut there are those who argue that Democrats can't dismiss the possibility that another speaker fight would devolve the institution they want to protect into yet another tenuous chapter that could drag on for weeks or even months. The last speaker battle raged on for three weeks as lawmakers careened from one candidate to another, and as members battled over long-held grudges. Without a speaker, lawmakers can't bring legislation to the floor or conduct other business, a huge liability in a volatile world, members warn.\n'We've been dealing with so much chaos and so much dysfunction there that we would like to try to stabilize the situation as much as possible so we can at least get aid to our besieged foreign allies,' Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin said.\nRep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, warned that while it is ultimately up to Jeffries to pick the path for the caucus, his preference is to avoid a messy speaker fight.\n'Gerry is articulating a fair consideration which is how much are we \u2013 who get called Bolsheviks and traitors and you, know, every name in the book \u2013 how much of it is in our job description to rescue them from chaos,' Himes said of Connolly's view. 'What we are here to do is get big things done. And unlike Republicans, perhaps push our partisan concerns to the side.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kristin Wilson,CNN,Lauren Fox","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2147857308.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.4740305,"_id":"67dfe85f8c9cc5d23191c86a9b2bcfa2"},{"title":"Supreme Court waves off Kari Lake lawsuit over electronic voting","author":"John Fritze","published_date":"2024-04-22 13:52:42","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/22/politics/kari-lake-arizona-republican-supreme-court","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The Supreme Court brushed aside a lawsuit Monday from Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake challenging the use of electronic voting machines in Arizona.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 The Supreme Court brushed aside a lawsuit Monday from Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake challenging the use of electronic voting machines in Arizona.\nLake, who filed the lawsuit during her failed campaign for governor in 2022, challenged whether the state's electronic voting machines assured 'a fair and accurate vote.' Two lower courts dismissed the suit, finding that Lake and former Republican state lawmaker Mark Finchem had not been harmed in a way that allowed them to sue.\nCalling the precise nature of Lake's claim 'not clear,' the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals said the lawsuit was based on speculative concerns that the machines could be hacked.\nAlthough Lake and Finchem cited 'opinions by purported experts on manipulation risk' in the lawsuit, they did 'not contend that any electronic tabulation machine in Arizona has ever been hacked,' the appeals court said.

While I understand the importance of that idea, any rule change requires a majority of the full House, which we do not have. We will continue to govern under the existing rules.'\nCNN and other outlets reported Thursday morning that, according to multiple GOP sources, Johnson was being lobbied by his members to raise the threshold required to trigger the procedure to oust the speaker \u2013 a move that would help ensure the Louisiana Republican can pass foreign aid bills and still keep his job without needing to rely on Democrats to bail him out. Currently, any single member can force a floor vote on the motion to vacate \u2014 part of the deal Kevin McCarthy made to become speaker last year.\nThe suggestion set off another round of fury amid conservative lawmakers who are unhappy with the speaker over his proposed package of bills to send aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan among other priorities. An effort has been brewing for weeks to potentially oust Johnson, led by Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, and the proposal to change the rules around ousting the speaker has ignited intense speculation over Johnson's future.\nIn recent days, rank-and-file House Republicans had privately encouraged Johnson to insert language into the text of a rule for the foreign aid bills to alter the motion to vacate and make it harder for any single member to use.\nThe House is finished with floor action for the day, which means that the earliest that Greene could make a motion to oust Johnson would be on Friday. If Greene takes that consequential step, the House will have to consider it within two legislative days. A floor vote to oust Johnson would require a majority to succeed.\nHouse leadership will have to decide how to handle the issue. A motion to table \u2013 or kill \u2013 the resolution could be offered and voted on first. That would also only require a simple majority to succeed.\nNews that Johnson was being lobbied to raise the threshold was first reported by Punchbowl News.\nTensions were running high in the House on Thursday morning. At one point, Johnson was surrounded on the House floor by a number of far-right lawmakers in a heated discussion. Johnson was essentially pinned against the back wall of the House floor with members on all sides of him, with the speaker constantly pivoting his head as he responded to members speaking to him.\nThe group implored Johnson to give them assurances that he would not raise the threshold on the motion to vacate, and the speaker would not commit, leaving many of the lawmakers fuming and some even saying this was their red line that could propel the motion to oust him forward.\n\ufeff'We notified him that any effort to change the threshold of motion to vacate would likely induce the motion to vacate,' GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, who participated in the conversation, told CNN.\nGOP Rep. Derrick Van Orden entered the 20-minute heated floor conversation as it was ongoing and dared his right-wing colleagues to move on the motion to oust Johnson, even calling Gaetz 'tubby.'\nOne GOP lawmaker who participated in the conversation with Johnson, who was granted the anonymity to speak freely, said Van Orden started 'threatening everyone to go ahead with a motion to vacate.'\nThe GOP lawmaker described Johnson as 'very frustrated.'\nGreene warned the speaker against trying to change the threshold and refused to rule out moving to remove him on Thursday.\n'Mike Johnson owes our entire conference a meeting, and if he wants to change the motion to vacate, he needs to come before the Republican conference that elected him and tell us of his intentions, and tell us what this rule change to the motion to vacate is going to be,' Greene told CNN's Manu Raju.\n'It's unprecedented. This has never happened in history, and it's completely wrong. He owes our conference the truth, and he owes Republicans answers,' she added.\nOn top of discussing motion to vacate on the floor, lawmakers said they tried to persuade Johnson to change his course on the foreign aid bills, but the speaker was not receptive.\nConservative Rep. Anna Paulina Luna said she suggested to Johnson on Wednesday night that he take a step back as he tries to push through the supplemental package against hardliners' wishes. Luna said there is concern supporting the motion to vacate could potentially cost Republicans the majority.\n'I think a bigger issue at hand, though, right now is why is it that we have messaging coming from the speaker that's contradictory to what happened with few months back,' she said.\nThe House Rules Committee is meeting Thursday morning to begin considering the foreign aid bills. Text of the rule will be unveiled after the committee approves it, which is expected later in the day.\nDemocrats will be needed in that committee vote and on the floor to advance the rule, as the House Democratic Caucus is still weighing how to proceed as Johnson's job is on the line and as the critical three-part supplemental aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan hangs in the balance.\nDemocrats are still divided on the question, with some arguing it's imperative the party overcomes the bitter partisanship that has been a hallmark of this Congress to deliver critical aid to Ukraine and others arguing it's up to Republicans to pass their own rules.\n'I mean, it's just another layer for sure,' Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat told CNN, adding, 'It's a ridiculous rule, which, you know, whether or not it's doing the right thing in this moment where we have a global security challenge, we ought to be trying to bail them out of their politics is another question.'\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat, said she wouldn't support a Republican rule regardless of whether it included changes to the motion to vacate.\n'I mean, I think they need to pass the rule on their own, but I've thought from the beginning that Kevin McCarthy never should have agreed to that,' Jayapal said. 'He sold his soul early on and he thought he could control everybody.'\nDemocratic Rep. Mike Quigley said he was inclined to back the rule and would think about even supporting it if it included a change to how the motion to vacate functioned.\n'I think dysfunction is everybody's problem. And I'd be open to whatever it takes so that we can function appropriately,' Quigley said.\nDemocratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said leadership needed to weigh in before he decided whether to support such a change.\nOne thing that is hanging over discussions is that many Democrats view Johnson as a more honest broker than McCarthy. Despite the fact they don't agree with him on many issues, they also believe that he's been a fair partner at a critical moment to pass government funding and now this aid to Ukraine.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.

If approved, it could fast-track what has become the most serious risk to TikTok's US business since former President Donald Trump first proposed a ban of the popular app in 2020.\nAn earlier version of the TikTok bill sailed through the House in March, but it has become bogged down in the Senate. By including it in the aid package, House Republicans hope to force the Senate to a quick vote on a measure supporters say is necessary to protect Americans' personal data from the Chinese government.\nOpponents, including TikTok and a range of civil society groups, have argued the bill risks violating TikTok users' First Amendment rights.\nIn pressuring Senate colleagues to approve the TikTok bill alongside military equipment for Ukraine, House Republicans are angling to avoid the lengthy regular process that could delay a Senate vote on the app, which has 170 million US users. President Joe Biden has said he would sign the House TikTok bill if it reaches his desk.\nThe latest version of the TikTok bill contains some updates. For example, it sets out a nine-month timeframe for the app's Chinese parent, ByteDance, to sell the social media company. If it misses the deadline, TikTok would be banned from US app stores.\nThat proposed time limit is longer than the roughly six months proposed in previous legislation. The new bill would also give the president the option to extend the deadline by another 90 days if he determines there's been progress toward a sale.\nThe changes appear aimed at addressing concerns by some senators that the original six-month deadline was too short. Whether the revisions are enough to gain Senate approval, however, remains unclear, as some leading senators have signaled desires for a slower approach to a TikTok bill.\nOne key senator who was doubtful of the initial House TikTok bill appeared satisfied.\n'I'm very happy that Speaker Johnson and House leaders incorporated my recommendation to extend the ByteDance divestment period from six months to a year,' said Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, in a statement. 'As I've said, extending the divestment period is necessary to ensure there is enough time for a new buyer to get a deal done. I support this updated legislation.'\nFor years, US policymakers have expressed fears that TikTok's links to China through its parent company could allow the Chinese government unauthorized access to TikTok's US user data. That information could potentially help the Chinese government identify intelligence targets or facilitate disinformation campaigns, they have said. Some other countries such as India have already banned TikTok.\nTikTok has pushed back strongly against those claims, saying there is no evidence the Chinese government has accessed US user data to date and that the company has taken steps to insulate Americans' personal information. That includes Project Texas, an initiative that involved moving TikTok's US user data onto servers controlled and overseen by Oracle, the US technology giant.\nSome policy experts say a more comprehensive way to deal with TikTok's potential national security risks would be for Congress to pass a national privacy law that regulates how all businesses and organizations can handle Americans' personal information.\nThis month, Cantwell and her Republican counterpart in the House, Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, unveiled a proposal that could do just that, breaking a yearslong deadlock over key issues including the scope and reach of a unified, national data privacy standard.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"tech","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brian Fung,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2081068441.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":6.4358435,"_id":"e2a2c3492aba4e055d75b6cc43497bb5"},{"title":"Opinion: In a two-issue election, Biden should act\u00a0now\u00a0on immigration","author":"Fareed Zakaria","published_date":"2024-04-19 14:27:21","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/opinions/opinion-biden-should-act-now-on-immigration-zakaria","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Staving off right-wing populism requires more aggressive action on the southern border, Fareed Zakaria argues.","summary":"Editor's Note: Fareed Zakaria is the host of Fareed Zakaria GPS, airing at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET Sundays on CNN .

The party that best navigates these cultural battlefields is likely to prevail in November.\nEach party has an advantage, the Democrats on abortion and the Republicans on immigration. Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, energized generations of conservative voters who felt deeply on the issue but were also outraged that courts had taken the question out of the democratic process.\nNow, it's abortion rights voters who are energized, fueled by states like Arizona that are putting in place draconian restrictions on abortion.

He has criticized Arizona's abortion ban and has pledged not to sign a national abortion ban if re-elected.\nIt might seem hard for him to backtrack; he has loudly taken credit for the repeal of Roe v. Wade and touted his anti-abortion credentials. But Trump seems able to say anything, and even do anything, without losing the cult-like following he has with Republican voters. He can appeal to the middle ground, certain that his base will stay with him.\nPresident Joe Biden, on the other hand, does not have the fanatical following that Trump does. He has constructed a coalition carefully appealing to different groups with specific policies. If he loses one of those groups, his team fears that the math will not add up come Election Day.\nBut he needs to risk it and get tougher on immigration. It has become a proxy for all kinds of issues where people feel that elites simply don't get the concerns of average people. And the concern is rooted in real facts on the ground.\nThe US has taken in huge numbers of immigrants over the last five decades. In 1970, foreign-born people made up 5.7% of the country. As of 2020, that number was 15.3%. And it's not just America. In Sweden, that number went from 6.6% in 1970 to 19.8% in 2020; in the UK, from 5.3% to 13.8%. As I note in my new book, 'Age of Revolutions,' the Western world has seen a wave of unprecedented migration. Considering the numbers and the cultural diversity of the immigrants, people have been remarkably tolerant.\nIn both the EU and the United States, gangs and cartels have recognized that they can game the asylum system by bringing in migrants who are moving for economic reasons but who apply for asylum, claiming that they are being persecuted at home \u2014 and thus get the right to stay, have legal hearings and eventually work. Last fiscal year, nearly a million people applied for asylum in the US. In the EU last year, that number was more than 1.1 million.\nThe waves of recent migrants have produced problems as anyone on the ground can confirm, from New York City to El Paso to Stockholm. Sweden today is home to one of the highest gun crime death rates in Europe. And it is not a coincidence that its second largest political party is one that traces its roots to World War II-era fascism.\nThe Biden administration has made the case that it has put in place a set of well-crafted policies to limit asylum-seekers, that it needs Congressional action to do more and that Republicans want this problem to fester so that they can reap its electoral benefits. (They even tried to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on utterly bogus charges. The Democratic-majority Senate quickly put a stop to that effort.) All true.\nBut Biden must show he can fight. He should declare a national security emergency, send the National Guard to the border, work with Congress to suspend the asylum process and propose a new one that basically makes it impossible to get asylum if you just show up at the border. Many will scream, and it will all be challenged in court. But it will signal that Biden is taking the problem seriously.\nBill Clinton often says that the American people don't always need you to succeed, but they want to catch you trying. Joe Biden needs to be caught trying to solve the immigration crisis.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Fareed Zakaria","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2147862639-20240419041936989.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":6.411507,"_id":"33be269bd1502c81ff09c7985ae297d6"},{"title":"Greene and Massie rail on Johnson, say more Republicans will join their effort to oust him after speaking to their constituents","author":"Kaanita Iyer","published_date":"2024-04-20 16:04:10","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/house-vote-ukraine-israel-taiwan-aid-04-20-24/h_512d7143707002a0ddf90223200bf038","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"GOP Reps.

Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie railed on House Speaker Mike Johnson and his handling of the foreign aid bills, despite deciding not to move to oust the speaker Saturday. Greene argued that more House Republicans will support their effort after going home over recess and speaking with their constituents. 'I'm actually gonna let my colleagues go home and hear from their constituents, because I think people have been too obsessed with voting for foreign wars and the murder industry here in America to actually understand how angry Americans are,' the Georgia Republican told CNN.

Massie added he believes a motion to vacate \u2014 a rarely used procedural tool to remove the House speaker \u2014 will happen eventually. 'I'm pretty sure one will come to the floor, if he doesn't resign at some point, but we're trying to avoid that,' he said.

He's already a lame duck, he can't raise money, everyone knows it,' Greene claimed. 3 hr 22 min ago From CNN's Morgan Rimmer House Speaker Mike Johnson talks to the press after the House passed four foreign aid bills at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on Saturday. Drew Angerer/AFP/Getty Images Several swing-district House Republicans praised Speaker Mike Johnson for pushing forward with the foreign aid bills and attacked his detractors. Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro, a vulnerable New York freshman lawmaker, told CNN's Manu Raju that after speaking with his constituents, 'It is clear to me that there are moments in time where we must do the right thing, and today we did that.' He defended Johnson for waiting for months to hold votes on aid for critical allies Israel and Ukraine, saying the speaker had to build bipartisan consensus in \"a very complicated Congress.\" Molinaro said he hoped Johnson's detractors do not attempt to oust him, warning them that Congress is not 'only supposed to do what they want.' Rep. Jen Kiggans, a vulnerable Republican from Virginia, also praised the speaker. 'I'm very proud of Mike Johnson. I know what he did today was difficult, but there was a lot of us standing by him, and you saw great bipartisan effort today. And that's what Americans want to see,' she said. Kiggans criticized the GOP hardliners who have pushed for Johnson's ouster over the foreign aid package, saying, \"It frustrates me when we have members of our conference who are isolationist; who don't believe in standing with our allies.' 3 hr 37 min ago From CNN's Morgan Rimmer Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer took procedural steps Saturday for the Senate to begin voting on the House-passed foreign aid package Tuesday afternoon.

Michelle Shen/CNN As members of Congress streamed out of the Capitol after passing an aid bill to Israel, a crowd of protesters with loudspeakers shouted, \"Congress, Congress you can't hide, we charge you with genocide!\" The bill also includes aid to Gaza, but the protesters represent the divisive nature of providing support to Israel amid the humanitarian disaster in Gaza. Marione Ingram protests outside the Capitol. Michelle Shen/CNN Marione Ingram, 88, and her husband, Daniel Ingram, 93, were among the protesters. Marione is a survivor of the Holocaust and large-scale bombing operations in Germany during World War II. \"I am now reliving my childhood every time I see anything that's happening in Gaza. And for the last over six months, my husband and I and a few others have been at the White House every single day in the afternoon trying to get our government to stop fighting,\" she said. Pro-Palestinian protesters have been resorting to ever-louder tactics \u2013 such as shutting down the Golden Gate Bridge during Monday's morning commute \u2013 as they try to shake US support for Israel and draw attention to the crisis in Gaza, where more than 34,000 people have died since the war began, according to the Ministry of Health there. 4 hr ago From CNN's Lauren Fox and Alison Main A number of lawmakers who backed the aid packages today said their views on House Speaker Mike Johnson as a leader changed after the speaker put bills on the floor despite a threat against his job. House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, said he thinks it was a transformative moment for Johnson as a leader, adding that the speaker's stock in the conference has gone up even as he faces the threat of an ouster from a minority of members. 'I have tremendous respect. ... He had a learning curve, but at the end of the day, he knew what the right thing to do was,' McCaul said. Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois was blunt when asked whether he had a new respect and view of the speaker than he did two weeks ago. 'I guess I do. The old adage is it's never too late to do the right thing. We tested that,' Quigley said. 'I think we build on this. ... We have a lot of challenges. It's good news that today at a critical time, we did act cohesively as a legislature.' GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said he always thought Johnson would get there but a turning point came when the speaker was briefed that passing Ukraine aid by April was essential. 'He's always said he was for Ukraine, and I've always believed him,' Bacon said. 'I think he just came to the conclusion we couldn't wait any longer. He was briefed that we had to get this done in April or bad things were going to happen to Ukraine.\" 3 hr 31 min ago From CNN's Kit Maher House Speaker Mike Johnson talks to the press after the House passed four foreign aid bills at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on Saturday. Drew Angerer/AFP/Getty Images Moments after the House passed four foreign aid bills totaling $95 billion, Speaker Mike Johnson said he had not spoken to Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries about potentially saving his job if his hardline colleagues move to oust him. 'I don't walk around this building being worried about a motion to vacate,' Johnson said, referring to a procedural tool to remove the House speaker. 'I have to do my job. ... I've done here what I believe to be the right thing to allow the House to work its will. And as I've said, you do the right thing, and you let the chips fall where they may.' Walking toward his office, Johnson told reporters that he believes he will still be speaker in November and that he hasn't spoken to any of his detractors Saturday. Johnson said the 'world is destabilized' and 'a tinderbox,' stressing the importance of the bills' passage in a 'dangerous time.' 'Three of our primary adversaries, Russia, and Iran, and China, are working together and they're being aggressors around the globe,' Johnson said. 'They're a global threat to our prosperity and our security. Their advance threatens the free world, and it demands American leadership. We turn our backs right now, the consequences could be devastating.' 4 hr 20 min ago From CNN's Priscilla Alvarez The White House on Saturday clinched urgent foreign aid after a monthslong saga that involved starts and stops in Congress and was momentarily upended by one of the most politically vulnerable issues for President Joe Biden: border security. The ask for additional aid to Ukraine, among other priorities, dates to October, when the White House put forward its national security supplemental funding request. Over the last several months, Biden has framed the need to provide additional funds to the war-torn country as a national security priority, warning that no ground should be ceded to Russia. More recently, US officials attributed losses on the battlefield in Ukraine to the lack of additional assistance from the United States. In February, for example, the White House laid the blame for Ukraine's withdrawal from the key town of Avdiivka squarely at the feet of Republicans in Congress. Funding for Ukraine was also a recurring topic of discussion between Biden and global leaders as the US sought to reaffirm its leadership on the world stage \u2014 a theme echoed in the president's statement Saturday. 'Today, members of both parties in the House voted to advance our national security interests and send a clear message about the power of American leadership on the world stage. At this critical inflection point, they came together to answer history's call, passing urgently-needed national security legislation that I have fought for months to secure,' Biden said. 4 hr 31 min ago TikTok criticized the House's passage of a bill that could ban the app in the US. \"It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement Saturday. 4 hr 39 min ago From CNN's Samantha Waldenberg President Joe Biden speaks at a campaign event in Philadelphia on Thursday.

He said, \u2018At the end of the day, I'm going to be on the right side of history irrespective of my job.''\nAid to Israel, Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific escaped months of congressional gridlock Saturday when the House passed a $95 billion foreign aid package in four separate bills, which will be compiled into one amendment and sent to the Senate for a Tuesday vote. The vote to advance the key aid legislation came as bipartisan pressure on Johnson to pass support for allies abroad mounted, while his far-right allies floated an effort to strip him of his gavel.\nA small group of hardline Republicans, led by firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, have rallied behind an effort to oust Johnson from House leadership, criticizing the Louisiana Republican for relying on Democrats to pass foreign aid, among other priorities. McCaul, who was with Johnson the night before the foreign aid legislation was released, recounted to CNN that the House leader \u2014 a devout Christian \u2014 prayed as he grappled with the political consequences of doing 'the right thing' by bringing the package to the chamber's floor.\n'We were running out of time \u2014 Ukraine is getting ready to fall,' McCaul said Sunday. 'He became the man that went from a district in Louisiana to the speaker of the United States to also someone who had to look at the entire world and had to carry the burden of that and make the right decision.'\nMcCaul contended a majority of House Republicans voted against supplemental aid to Ukraine because the conference 'bought into this notion that it's an either-or proposition' between supporting the US southern border and Ukraine.\n'The eyes of the world are watching, and our adversaries are watching, and history is watching \u2014 and that's what I kept telling my colleagues: Do you want to be a Chamberlain or a Churchill?' he questioned, an analogy McCaul has repeatedly employed in debates over continuing to provide aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia.\nEven with Johnson's victorious passage of these aid bills, the House could be plunged into chaos once again if the far-right wing of his party manages to oust him from the speakership.\nAsked if he believes Johnson's job is in jeopardy following the successful vote, McCaul argued 'stock in Mike Johnson has gone way up' and that the speaker has 'garnered a lot of respect' from both sides of the aisle.\nRepublican Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas, who represents a district along the southern border, also on Sunday applauded Johnson's role in passing the legislation.\n'We're at a point where we're just trying to govern, and that's what Mike Johnson has done, governed in an honorable way,' Gonzales told CNN's Dana Bash on CNN's 'State of the Union.'\nGonzales \u2014 who voted Saturday to pass aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan \u2014 expressed confidence that Johnson will survive the threats to his speakership, saying, 'The House is a rough and rowdy place, but Mike Johnson is going to be just fine.'\nFormer President Donald Trump has voiced strong opposition to Ukraine aid in the past, arguing that the US should not grant foreign aid unless it is a loan and indicating that he would encourage Russian aggression against any NATO member country that doesn't pay enough. But Trump has not commented publicly about the package the House passed on Saturday and has previously expressed support for Johnson's speakership.\n'What (Trump) wants is for a lifeline to be given to Ukraine,' McCaul contended, 'so that when he gets into office \u2026 he can then negotiate and save it.'\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Avery Lotz,Michelle Shen","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/sipausa-52615085.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.370734,"_id":"352ff1e4e6fe3180fa5eaabadc4a92bd"},{"title":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praises House passage of aid","author":"Kaanita Iyer","published_date":"2024-04-20 16:04:10","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/house-vote-ukraine-israel-taiwan-aid-04-20-24/h_ddb148c30bf91f87e2883fa3b89a28b5","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on X that he is \"grateful\" for House lawmakers for passing the measure that provides aid to Ukraine, personally thanking Speaker Mike Johnson \"for\u2026","summary":"Democratic lawmakers wave Ukrainian flags after the House passed the Ukraine Security Supplemental Appropriations Act.

'And we know that the world is watching us to see how we react.'\nDespite the speaker's attempt to thread the needle, however, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who continues to dangle the threat of a vote on Johnson's ouster, was quick to criticize the foreign aid plan.\n'I am firmly against the plan as it stands right now,' Greene told reporters, though when asked whether she would force a vote on the motion to vacate as a result, she said, 'I haven't decided on that yet.'\nJohnson dismissed concerns over a vote to oust him by his conservative flank if he moves on aid to Ukraine, telling CNN, 'I don't spend my time worrying about motions to vacate. We're having to govern here and we're going to do our job.'\nIn addition to aid for Israel and Ukraine, Johnson said in a post on X that the bills would support allies in the Indo-Pacific and there would be additional measures to 'counter our adversaries and strengthen our national security.'\nBut Republican leaders could still take procedural steps to send all those pieces as one package to the Senate, which could enrage the right wing of the House GOP conference.\nJohnson left open the possibility that the bills could ultimately be packaged together, setting up a potential fight with the right flank.\n'We're discussing whether they would be merged together in one package that's sent to the Senate or if it goes over as individual measures,' Johnson said. 'My personal preference is to do it individually, but we'll let the body decide.'\nAmong the ways GOP leaders plan to address Ukraine aid: a bill to seize Russian assets, a lend-lease program for Ukraine military aid and convertible loans for humanitarian relief.\nFormer President Donald Trump, who recently met with House Speaker Mike Johnson at Mar-a-Lago, has expressed openness to structuring Ukraine aid as a loan.\nGOP Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma told CNN that Johnson is allowing germane amendment votes on these bills as well \u2013 a process that far right Republicans had been demanding of Johnson.\nIn the wake of Iran's unprecedented retaliatory strikes on Israel, Democrats have called on Johnson to bring up a Senate-passed foreign aid package that includes aid to Israel and Ukraine, but hardline conservatives have urged the Louisiana Republican against attaching Ukraine funding to any Israel aid package \u2013 a warning that comes as the speaker faces the threat of a potential vote to oust him from his leadership post.\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries urged immediate passage of the foreign aid package passed by the Senate in a new letter to colleagues.\n'The gravely serious events of this past weekend in the Middle East and Eastern Europe underscore the need for Congress to act immediately. We must take up the bipartisan and comprehensive national security bill passed by the Senate forthwith,' Jeffries wrote.\nIn November, the House passed a bill to provide $14.3 billion in aid to Israel, but Democrats objected to the fact that the bill did not include aid to Ukraine and would enact funding cuts to the Internal Revenue Service.\nThe Senate passed its bill in February \u2013 a $95.3 billion foreign aid bill with assistance for Ukraine, Israel and other priorities.\nA significant number of House Republicans are opposed to sending further aid to Ukraine. Now, Johnson faces the most significant threat to his speakership to date after GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is among those who oppose additional Ukraine aid, filed a motion against him that could be used to force a vote on his ouster.\nGreene told CNN on Monday that Trump's backing of Johnson during a Friday press conference will not deter her from moving to oust the speaker.\n'No, no, and as a matter of fact, there's more people that are probably going to be angry from whatever happens this week,' she said.\nLater, Greene said, 'He's definitely not going to be speaker next Congress if we're lucky enough to have a majority. I think that is a widely held belief throughout the Congress.'\nAsked if she thinks he'll remain speaker for the remainder of the current session of Congress, the congresswoman said, 'That is to be determined. Like I said, I'm still processing.'\nJohnson called Greene's decision to file the motion to vacate a 'distraction' during an interview on Fox News.\n'That's a distraction. What Marjorie has done with the motion to vacate is not helpful for our party, for our mission to save the country, because if we don't grow the House majority, keep the House majority, win the Senate and win back the White House for President Trump, we're going to lose the republic,' he said.\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.

Sherrod Brown in Ohio, and more than $40 million on Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey's reelection, devoting over $100 million to that pair of critical races. The group also said it would direct eight-figure sums to supporting Democrats in Wisconsin, Michigan and Arizona.\nIn addition, SMP had also pledged to spend $45 million on ads supporting Montana Sen. Jon Tester, who is among the most vulnerable Senate Democrats this year, and $36 million in Nevada, where Sen. Jacky Rosen also faces a tough reelection fight.\nAll told, the combined reservations amount to $318 million, a massive reservation of fall airtime that could provide a serious boost to Democrats as they compete across a difficult map and fight to preserve their Senate majority.\nWhile future advertising reservations can be fluid, those totals would be an increase from those key groups' spending in 2022, when the DSCC spent about $50 million on advertising and SMP spent about $240 million, according to AdImpact data.\nCountering those efforts, Senate Republicans have also pledged to spend tens of millions of dollars on some of the same key races, with plans for at least $130 million in fall ad time so far.\nSenate Leadership Fund, a top GOP super PAC aligned with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, said it has plans to spend $57.7 million in Ohio and $24.6 million in Montana \u2013 two races where Republicans feel best about their pickup chances, with Democratic incumbents seeking reelection in states former President Donald Trump carried in 2020. Additionally, an allied GOP group, American Crossroads, says it will spend $25 million more in Ohio, and an additional $23.3 million in Montana.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David Wright","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-ap24079760114039.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.2930484,"_id":"321c6af3616e84213df754db273aa476"},{"title":"Live updates: House vote for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan aid","author":"Kaanita Iyer","published_date":"2024-04-20 16:04:10","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/politics/live-news/house-vote-ukraine-israel-taiwan-aid-04-20-24","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The House is expected to vote on a key foreign aid package on Saturday.

This specific assistance is the kind of direct payment that helps Ukraine's government continue to function during a war.\nThose loans are through approximately $7.9 billion in economic assistance to Ukraine and another $1.6 billion in assistance for Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia, requiring the president to strike an agreement with Kyiv to repay the funding. The administration could cancel the debt if they choose to, according to a source familiar.\nThe fight over the bills \u2013 and the potential for right-wing members of the GOP to attempt to oust Johnson over it \u2013 adds up to the most intense pressure that the speaker has faced over his future in his short time in the role. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky on Tuesday said he would co-sponsor Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to vacate, which would boot Johnson from the speakership if it passed, leading the speaker to defiantly tell reporters that he would not be resigning.\nThe loan structure around aid comes after a meeting and news conference with Johnson and former President Donald Trump, who said in February that the US should stop providing foreign aid unless it is structured as a loan. That weekend, Johnson earned full-throated support from Trump at a perilous time in his speakership.\nJohnson had announced Monday evening the House will take up separate bills this week to provide aid for Israel and Ukraine, heeding demands from the far right to keep the issues separate. But the final product is expected to be lumped together as one big package that will be sent to the Senate, according to sources familiar. The House can do this though an arcane procedure, something that is enraging the right wing of the Republican party but it's what Democrats have been insisting on as a condition of their support.\nThe speaker has been facing mounting pressure to make tweaks to the foreign aid package proposed earlier this week \u2013 and not just from his most right-wing members. While conservative House Freedom caucus members have been sounding the alarm on border security and the foreign aid bills since Tuesday's caucus meeting, the shouts have now spilled into the rank and file.\nModerate New York Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis on Wednesday told the speaker 'go back to Biden & Schumer and tell them he needs a border security measure to pass foreign aid.' Johnson said in his letter to members that he will bring forward an immigration bill that looks like the House's HR 2.\nA number of far-right House Republicans have been quick to shoot down the border bill that Johnson announced would be included with the foreign aid bills expected to be voted on Saturday, dispelling any hope that the border provisions would placate the speaker's right flank.\nThe border bill, which includes the core provisions of another House passed border package that remains dead in the Senate, was seen as a messaging exercise by Johnson in attempt to placate his colleagues demands on the border and it clearly does not appear to be working.\nGreene, who is leading the effort to oust Johnson, said on X: 'You are seriously out of step with Republicans by continuing to pass bills dependent on Democrats. Everyone sees through this.'\nConservative hardliners were quickly fuming at Johnson for his decision to move ahead with billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine and loudly warning him it could cost him his job.\nAn angry Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said he is 'very disappointed' in the speaker, and he is 'past the point of giving grace.'\n'I need a little bit more time today, but it is not good,' Roy said when asked by CNN if it is time for him to get out of office.\nFirebrand Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz called Johnson's decision to move ahead with the foreign aid bills as tantamount to 'surrender,' vowing to vote against the package and work hard to pressure others to not support the move. Other Republicans also expressed anger and wouldn't rule out voting against Johnson on procedural motions that could upend the bill.\nWith Republicans only controlling the House by a razor-thin margin, Johnson will likely need Democrats to pass the foreign aid bills \u2013 and save his job should the motion to vacate come to the floor.\nHouse Democrats are waiting to weigh in on precisely how much they will help with procedural votes on the aid package until they see if it includes a must-have item for them: $9 billion in humanitarian aid to Gaza and other conflict zones around the globe. The billions in humanitarian aid includes not just money for Gaza but for Sudan, Haiti and other areas that Democrats have been quick to point out.\nDuring a caucus meeting on Tuesday, Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries told his caucus they would not accept 'one penny' less of humanitarian aid.\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday offered his first explicit endorsement of the plan offered up by House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n'I strongly support this package to get critical support to Israel and Ukraine, provide desperately needed humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza, and bolster security and stability in the Indo-Pacific. Israel is facing unprecedented attacks from Iran, and Ukraine is facing continued bombardment from Russia that has intensified dramatically in the last month,' Biden said in a statement.\nThe state of the battlefield in Ukraine is beginning to 'shift a bit \u2026 in Russia's favor,' Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers on Wednesday as he urged for passage of the supplemental aid package for Ukraine.\n'In terms of, you know, what happens going forward and how long Ukraine will be able to sustain its efforts, I think we're already seeing things on the battlefield begin to shift a bit in in terms of in Russia's favor,' Austin told the House Defense Appropriations subcommittee.\nHowever, House Democrats are divided over whether they would try and save Johnson if an effort to oust him gets underway in the chamber, with institutionalists insisting that voting against a motion to vacate could protect the body from devolving into chaos mere months before a presidential election. Progressive members, meanwhile, warn that helping Johnson now could ultimately undermine the party with its base, which already may be less than enthusiastic about showing up at the polls in November.\nDemocratic Reps. Tom Suozzi and Jared Moskowitz have said publicly they would not support an attempt to oust Johnson, but other Democrats \u2013 including one who held the same job as Johnson \u2013 aren't ready to make that kind of commitment.\n'Let's just hope that that does not happen, and that we can do our responsibilities, protect and defend our own democracy as we protect theirs,' former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.\nIf Johnson is indeed ousted, it could plunge the House into chaos once again, with zero legislation getting on the floor until a new speaker is elected.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Wednesday.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Wednesday.

We hold it cannot,' Circuit Judge Toby Heytens wrote in the decision, which was joined by Judge Pamela Harris.\nThe ruling is a major win for LGBTQ advocates, who have brought challenges against a slew of anti-trans laws enacted by Republican-led states over the past several years, including ones prohibiting minors from accessing gender-affirming care.\nSigned into law by West Virginia Republican Gov. Jim Justice in 2021, the 'Save Women's Sports Act' bans transgender women and girls from participating on public school sports teams consistent with their gender identity.\nThe court's majority said the law violates Pepper-Jackson's rights under Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex at schools that receive federal aid.\n'B.P.J. has shown that applying the Act to her would treat her worse than people to whom she is similarly situated, deprive her of any meaningful athletic opportunities, and do so on the basis of sex,' Heytens wrote.\nJudge Steven Agee wrote in a partial dissent that 'allowing transgender girls \u2013 regardless of any advantage \u2013 as participants in biological girls' sports turns Title IX on its head and reverses the monumental work Title IX has done to promote girls' sports from its inception.'\nAgee said he would have allowed the state to enforce the law against Pepper-Jackson and concluded his dissenting opinion by writing: 'One can only hope that the Supreme Court will take the opportunity with all deliberate speed to resolve these questions of national importance.'\nLower courts had temporarily blocked West Virginia from enforcing the law against Pepper-Jackson, whose lawsuit against the sports ban asked that the state be prohibited from enforcing it against her, instead of declaring it totally invalid. The federal judge who initially blocked the law in 2021 reversed course last year and sided with state officials.\nAs the yearslong litigation played out, West Virginia last year asked the US Supreme Court to let it enforce the law while the lower courts considered the case, but the justices, in an unsigned order, declined. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito said they would have granted the request.\nJoshua Block, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who represents Pepper-Jackson, said in a statement Tuesday that the appeals court ruling 'is a tremendous victory for our client, transgender West Virginians, and the freedom of all youth to play as who they are.'\n'It also continues a string of federal courts ruling against bans on the participation of transgender athletes and in favor of their equal participation as the gender they know themselves to be,' Block said.\nWest Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, said he stands by the law and that the state 'will use every available tool to defend it.'\n'I am deeply disappointed in the court's divided decision today,' he said in a statement, going on to argue that the law 'is \u2018constitutionally permissible' and the law complies with Title IX.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Devan Cole,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230406132432-02-becky-pepper-jackson.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":6.036605,"_id":"5981a53e77079c431b19f7861d25d82e"},{"title":"Trump targets Alvin Bragg, the prosecutor in his criminal case, while visiting site of fatal bodega stabbing","author":"Gregory Krieg","published_date":"2024-04-17 02:18:50","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/trump-bodega-alvin-bragg","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Donald Trump is trying to turn the tables on Alvin Bragg.","summary":"New York City CNN \u2014\nNew York City CNN \u2014 Donald Trump is trying to turn the tables on Alvin Bragg.\nThe former president ended the second day of his hush money trial in Manhattan by visiting a Harlem bodega where, in 2022, store clerk Jose Alba stabbed an attacker, then got brought up on murder charges by the Manhattan district attorney's office.\nThe case was dropped less than three weeks after the incident, but not before Bragg, who is now leading Trump's prosecution, came under withering attack by the city tabloids and other mostly right-wing critics over what many \u2013 including Mayor Eric Adams \u2013 viewed as a clear act of self-defense.\nWhile the trial in Lower Manhattan will mostly keep Trump off the campaign trail, his visit to the bodega brought the campaign to the city \u2013 where anxieties over a pandemic-era rise in crime drove Adams' mayoral campaign in 2021 and, despite rates now dropping, has made Gotham a useful cudgel for Republicans ahead of the 2024 general election.\n'They want law and order, they have a lot of crime, tremendous crime and their stores over there, stores are being robbed,' Trump said of bodegas in New York during his visit.\nThe New York GOP's message, which Trump called back to during a brief session with reporters outside the store, resonated in 2022 as Republicans won congressional seats outside the city after focusing their campaigns on public safety and worries that violent crime here would radiate out into the suburbs.\nTrump on Tuesday made his visit to Harlem's Sanaa Convenient Store, formerly known as Blue Moon, to meet with a co-owner of the store and Francisco Marte, the founder of the Bodega and Small Business Association. Throngs of supporters, protesters and curious rubberneckers began to amass on Broadway a little after 3 p.m., as word spread that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee was expected.\nBy the time Trump emerged from his black SUV a little after 6:30 p.m., the crowds were exchanging chants, with detractors calling him a 'traitor' and a 'fascist' while fans screamed his name, 'four more years,' and, at one point \u2013 at the urging of campaign staff \u2013 began to sing the National Anthem.\nA group of women, about 50 yards up the block behind a police barrier yelled out for Trump, calling him, in Spanish, 'my tiger!' Meanwhile, employees of the Romantic Depot shop across the street \u2013 'NY's Best Lingerie Store' \u2013 waved a red banner advertising a product named after Trump.\n'It's Alvin Bragg's fault. Alvin Bragg does nothing. He goes after guys like Trump who did nothing wrong,' Trump said. 'There are hundreds of murderers all over the city, they know who they are and they don't pick them up. They go after Trump.\nBragg's office dismissed Trump's talking point, first in a social media post showing the downward trajectory of major crimes, then in a statement defending its handling of the Alba case.\n'This matter was resolved nearly two years ago, and the charges were dismissed after a thorough investigation,' a Bragg spokesperson told CNN. 'D.A. Bragg's top priority remains combating violent crime and the office has worked hand in hand with the NYPD to drive down overall crime in Manhattan, including double digit decreases in homicides and shootings since he took office.'\nMarte, the small business advocate, said the Trump campaign contacted him for a meeting, which he parlayed into an invitation to visit a bodega. His group does not support political candidates, he added, but was pleased Trump decided to come and highlight their concerns about violent crime in the city.\nIn an interview about an hour before Trump arrived, Marte praised the former president's 'tough on crime' rhetoric, but said he hoped Trump wouldn't use the occasion to attack the city or exaggerate the threat.\n'New York is a little dangerous. It is dangerous, but we are working on that. But we need support,' said Marte, before saying President Joe Biden would also be welcome.\nTrump is currently on trial in New York four days a week, severely limiting his ability to campaign or fundraise outside of the state. The trial is forcing his team to come up with creative ideas to campaign while remaining local.\n'It makes me campaign locally, that's OK,' Trump said of the trial. 'We're going to give New York a very good shot for the presidency, we think we should be able to do it, a lot of things have changed.'\nNew York remains a Democratic stronghold. Trump lost to Biden by 23 points in 2020, and argued the influx of migrants into the state could push more New Yorkers to cast their ballots for him in November.\nOn Tuesday, Trump used the appearance at the bodega to attack Bragg.\n'Alvin Bragg does nothing. He goes after Trump, who did nothing wrong,' Trump said.\nThe visit to this bodega came two years after Alba, who was not present for the visit, was charged with second-degree murder after he stabbed Austin Simon in a confrontation.\nAlba and his lawyers argued that he acted in self-defense, saying surveillance video of the incident \u2013 which showed that Simon tried to pull Alba out from the booth before Alba grabbed a knife off the counter \u2013 confirmed their account.\n'Mr. Alba was simply doing his job when he was aggressively cornered by a much younger and bigger man,' Alice Fontier, a spokeswoman for Alba's attorney, said at the time.\nThe charges against Alba were dropped amid an angry, tabloid-fueled backlash to Bragg's decision to charge him at all.\nAdams publicly backed Alba and applauded the move to dismiss the charges against him.\n'I think in this case, we had an innocent, hardworking New Yorker that was doing his job and someone was extremely aggressive towards him,' Adams told reporters at the time. 'And I believe after the DA's review, the DA, in my opinion, made the right decision.'\nProsecutors, in their court motion, said they 'determined that we cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not justified in his use of deadly physical force.'\nIn April 2023, House Republicans on the Judiciary Committee invited Alba to testify at a so-called 'field hearing' in New York City. In his opening statement, Alba wrote that he was 'not motivated by a political agenda' and only wanted 'to tell the public about the horrible experience I had to go through because of crime in this city.'\n'I stabbed that man in self-defense. But when the police came, even though I was injured myself, I was placed under arrest,' Alba recalled. 'When I came before the judge, the prosecutor said I was being charged with Murder in the Second Degree. They asked for bail, even though so many people are being let go these days, and I couldn't afford it.'\nAlba filed a lawsuit, seeking unspecified damages, against the City of New York, Bragg and others involved in his arrest on September 29, 2023, claiming Alba was discriminated against because he is Hispanic. Simon was Black.\n'While in theory, Bragg's \u2018racial equity' policies are a well-intentioned attempt by him to implement evenhanded justice, the means and methods employed by Bragg have instead had an opposite effect,' Alba's lawyers wrote, 'and resulted in discrimination against certain defendants based on race.'\nLawyers for the city have asked for the lawsuit to be thrown out, telling the court in their own filing that prosecutors and police acted reasonably in the moment \u2013 and that 'the undisputed facts show that after the plaintiff's arrest, there was even more evidence to support a finding of probable cause for his prosecution.'\nNew York state lawmakers in 2019 passed a criminal justice reform package designed to end the use of use of cash bail and jail for most cases involving misdemeanors and less serious felonies. The new law went into effect in 2020, shortly before the first cases of Covid-19 were reported in the city, which would be hit hard by the pandemic.\nBut rising crime during that period sparked a political backlash that led Democrats in Albany to repeatedly revise and limit the scope of the law. There is no clear evidence of a connection between bail reform and the spike in crime, but Republicans here and around the country have used the issue as a cudgel against Democrats, arguing they are 'soft on crime.'\nThe Alba case offered an ironic twist in the political narrative, with many Republicans and right-wing news sources effectively arguing that Bragg's office took too harsh a tack against the clerk, calling the initial charges tone-deaf and misdirected.\nBragg, who ran on a platform of progressive reform, was elected alongside Adams, a former police officer who promised a crackdown on crime, in 2021. He came under immediate fire from critics after he released a memo outlining new charging, bail, plea and sentencing policies.\nThe policies, Bragg said, were rooted in his own experience \u2013 being held at gunpoint six times in his life, three of them by overzealous police officers.

A new element playing out behind the scenes, however, is the timing of this media defense campaign.\nNot only is the proceeding taking place at a time when his team is uncertain of how the trial and the salacious details of the case will play with general election voters, but it also comes as Trump is weighing potential running mates \u2013 making this period a tryout of sorts for his vice presidential contenders.\nSome of Trump's prospective VP picks are taking their own initiative, without urging from the former president's campaign, to defend him, according to sources familiar with their tactics.\n'The stakes are very high not just for the president personally and politically but also for his surrogates. They have to know \u2013 and I'm sure they all do \u2013 that everything you say is going to be noticed not just by the president but by his closest advisors as well,' said Gregg Keller, a Republican strategist. 'It's not just going to be a situation where maybe you say something sub-optimal and it gets lost in the mix or doesn't get noticed. That's not how things operate in Trump World. They know and hear about everything.'\nAnother veteran Republican strategist, granted anonymity to speak candidly, said, 'Really, the assignment is nominally \u2018go defend Trump on TV.' The assignment is actually \u2018go show that you're a really, really effective communicator so Trump believes he has in you an ally and a surrogate that's going to be compelling.''\nAlready, at least four potential Trump VP contenders have appeared on TV or made statements on social media undercutting the credibility of the case and players within it, or falsely claimed election interference.\nOn CNN Monday morning, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum called the case 'a sham trial' run by a 'politically motivated' district attorney and claimed: 'If this was brought against anybody other than President Trump, this would have been a misdemeanor.'\nBurgum also suggested that the criminal trial's unprecedented nature has been blown out of proportion. 'What's unprecedented, what's historic, is the fact the lawfare that's going on where the two-tier justice system is trying to take something that's basically a boring business filing case and turn it into the trial of the century, and Americans can see right through it,' he said.\nPutting the general election in focus, Burgum also said the American people want to see Trump debate President Joe Biden on stage, as the Trump campaign last week called on the Commission on Presidential Debates to move up the debate schedule and add more debates.\nBurgum has kept in regular touch with Trump officials and spoke with them as recently as the Sunday before his interview, according to a Republican with knowledge of those talks.\nRep. Elise Stefanik, the House Republican conference chair, highlighted how she led a criminal referral in November 2023 demanding Attorney General Merrick Garland immediately investigate Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen for lying to Congress during a February 2019 deposition.\n'The DOJ still refuses to charge the disgraced, disbarred attorney who admitted his guilt. Now, Soros-funded Alvin Bragg is relying on disgraced Michael Cohen as his key witness in his sham case. The double standard of justice is clear,' Stefanik posted on X. She also called presiding Judge Juan Merchan 'corrupt' and called the case a 'show trial,' claiming election interference.\nRelated article Analysis: Trump's unusual trial request on Day 1\nRelated article Analysis: Trump's unusual trial request on Day 1 Moments later, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance posted of the Manhattan district attorney: 'What Alvin Bragg is doing to President Trump is a disgrace to the rule of law and the opposite of Justice. It's also election interference.'\nRather than mentioning the trial specifically, Sen. Tim Scott painted with a broader brush.\n'What the radical Left is doing is not just election interference, it's election engineering. They will try everything (and fail) to stop Donald J. Trump,' the South Carolina Republican posted on X.\nWhile Trump told entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy that he will not be chosen as his running mate, according to a source familiar with the conversation, he is being considered for a Cabinet position. Bloomberg was first to report on the conversation, which the source said occurred at Mar-a-Lago in the first week of March.\nMonday morning, Ramaswamy posted a nearly 3-minute video on X direct-to-camera arguing that Bragg's case demonstrates 'a bastardization of our legal system.'\n'You have Alvin Bragg, a Manhattan DA who was elected on the promise of going after Donald Trump. For what crime, we have no idea, just the idea that they had to go after Donald Trump,' Ramaswamy said. 'I think Trump is going to prevail. But most importantly, I hope we move beyond this phase of our history, where you have one political party that thinks it can use the legal system to prosecute its opponents.'\nMuch of the commentary being shared by Trump's surrogates reference the themes highlighted in talking points circulated by the former president's campaign.\nThe document, labeled 'The Biden Trial, Talking Points,' parrots the same language the former president has used to attack the case.\nIt urges Trump surrogates to paint the trial as 'a full-frontal assault on American Democracy and the Constitution' and a 'witch hunt' designed by the Biden campaign to hurt the former president's 2024 White House bid \u2013 despite it being a state case brought by Manhattan's top prosecutor.\nIt also directs supporters not to refer to the case as a 'hush money case,' instead labeling it as being 'entries in the company's records,' and claiming Trump 'did not control the books.'\nThe talking points dedicate an entire page to attacking Bragg, and a separate section to discrediting Cohen, Trump's former 'fixer' who is expected to serve as a lead witness in prosecutors' arguments. The document emphasizes Cohen's 2018 guilty plea to campaign finance violations and paints him as someone with a 'personal vendetta' against the former president.\nSprinkled throughout the document is an emphasis on Trump's innocence, claiming that 'President Trump did nothing wrong, his position has never wavered.'\nAnd twice, the same line, which acknowledges Trump could potentially be convicted, appears \u2013 claiming that Trump 'faces no realistic threat of jail, even with a wrongful guilty verdict from the jury.'\nThe talking points also say Trump will 'never stop fighting' for the American people \u2013 rather than as a means of self-preservation \u2013 something surrogates emphasize in underscoring how they believe he will prevail and efforts against him will fail.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Alayna Treene,Daniel Strauss,Kit Maher","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2148449799.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":5.9878507,"_id":"2b02ef48e442cfb25db0a5238bad8211"},{"title":"GOP Gov.

For example, despite global efforts to rein in plastic pollution, only 9% of it is actually recycled.\nHere's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day .\nGet Up to Speed and On with Your Day. Surging tensions at Columbia University have sparked condemnation from the White House as pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus stretch into their fifth day. 'In recent days, we've seen harassment and calls for violence against Jews. This blatant antisemitism is reprehensible and dangerous \u2014 and it has absolutely no place on college campuses, or anywhere in our country,' President Joe Biden said Sunday. A rabbi linked to the Ivy League school has recommended that Jewish students 'return home as soon as possible and remain home' amid the demonstrations. The atmosphere is so charged that school officials said students can attend classes virtually starting today \u2014 the first day of Passover, a major Jewish holiday.\nOpening statements are expected to begin today in former President Donald Trump's New York hush money criminal trial. A full 12-person jury and six alternate jurors were selected last week and could determine whether Trump is a convicted felon by Election Day. The trial is expected to feature several high-profile witnesses, including those who were in Trump's inner circle around the 2016 election, sources have told CNN. One central player is David Pecker, the former chairman of the National Enquirer's parent company, who was involved in numerous 'catch-and-kill' schemes involving the former president. Court filings show Pecker helped to orchestrate the alleged scheme to pay hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels to cover up her alleged affair with Trump ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\nFormer President Donald Trump's first criminal trial starts Monday\n03:03 - Source: CNN\n03:03 - Source: CNN The House passed a $95 billion package over the weekend providing foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific region. Some moderate Republicans commended Speaker Mike Johnson after he joined with Democrats to advance the measure to Saturday's vote, while others in the conservative flank voiced strong opposition. Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Sunday said Speaker Johnson 'betrayed' Republican voters and threatened to call a vote for his ouster if he doesn't resign. The legislation \u2014 which passed with the support of 210 Democrats and 101 Republicans \u2014 now heads to the Senate, which is expected to give final approval this week.\nThe high-stakes foreign aid package approved by the House on Saturday included a measure that could lead to a TikTok ban. By attaching the TikTok bill to funding for Ukrainian military equipment and Israeli missile defense, House Republicans put pressure on Senate lawmakers to consider the whole package in a single up-or-down vote. The current version of the bill would, if signed, give TikTok roughly nine months to separate from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, following national security concerns. The bill also states the deadline could be extended by President Biden by 90 days if he determines there's been progress toward a sale. Policy analysts expect the Senate to take up the aid package quickly, giving it high odds of passage.\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments today on whether ticketing homeless people is 'cruel and unusual' and violates the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. City and state officials are closely watching the case \u2014 which will decide whether the homeless have the right to camp in public places \u2014 as many communities struggle to respond to a surge in encampments that have cropped up under bridges and in city parks across the nation. It's also being followed by people who live in those encampments and are alarmed by efforts to criminalize the population rather than build shelters and affordable housing. This comes as the number of people experiencing homelessness increased by 12% from 2022 to 2023, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nGiving a hoot on Earth Day: How to protect owls in your own backyard\nIt can be tough to survive in a world altered by humans.

House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, said he thinks it was a transformative moment for Johnson as a leader, adding that the speaker's stock in the conference has gone up even as he faces the threat of an ouster from a minority of members. 'I have tremendous respect. ... He had a learning curve, but at the end of the day, he knew what the right thing to do was,' McCaul said. Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois was blunt when asked whether he had a new respect and view of the speaker than he did two weeks ago. 'I guess I do. The old adage is it's never too late to do the right thing. We tested that,' Quigley said. 'I think we build on this. ... We have a lot of challenges. It's good news that today at a critical time, we did act cohesively as a legislature.' GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said he always thought Johnson would get there but a turning point came when the speaker was briefed that passing Ukraine aid by April was essential. 'He's always said he was for Ukraine, and I've always believed him,' Bacon said. 'I think he just came to the conclusion we couldn't wait any longer. He was briefed that we had to get this done in April or bad things were going to happen to Ukraine.\" 8 min ago From CNN's Kit Maher House Speaker Mike Johnson talks to the press after the House four foreign aid bills at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on Saturday.

'I have to do my job. ... I've done here what I believe to be the right thing to allow the House to work its will. And as I've said, you do the right thing, and you let the chips fall where they may.' Walking toward his office, Johnson told reporters that he believes he will still be speaker in November and that he hasn't spoken to any of his detractors Saturday. Johnson said the 'world is destabilized' and 'a tinderbox,' stressing the importance of the bills' passage in a 'dangerous time.' 'Three of our primary adversaries, Russia, and Iran, and China, are working together and they're being aggressors around the globe,' Johnson said. 'They're a global threat to our prosperity and our security. Their advance threatens the free world, and it demands American leadership. We turn our backs right now, the consequences could be devastating.' 21 min ago From CNN's Priscilla Alvarez The White House on Saturday clinched urgent foreign aid after a monthslong saga that involved starts and stops in Congress and was momentarily upended by one of the most politically vulnerable issues for President Joe Biden: border security. The ask for additional aid to Ukraine, among other priorities, dates to October, when the White House put forward its national security supplemental funding request. Over the last several months, Biden has framed the need to provide additional funds to the war-torn country as a national security priority, warning that no ground should be ceded to Russia. More recently, US officials attributed losses on the battlefield in Ukraine to the lack of additional assistance from the United States. In February, for example, the White House laid the blame for Ukraine's withdrawal from the key town of Avdiivka squarely at the feet of Republicans in Congress. Funding for Ukraine was also a recurring topic of discussion between Biden and global leaders as the US sought to reaffirm its leadership on the world stage \u2014 a theme echoed in the president's statement Saturday. 'Today, members of both parties in the House voted to advance our national security interests and send a clear message about the power of American leadership on the world stage. At this critical inflection point, they came together to answer history's call, passing urgently-needed national security legislation that I have fought for months to secure,' Biden said. 32 min ago TikTok criticized the House's passage of a bill that could ban the app in the US. \"It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement Saturday. 41 min ago From CNN's Samantha Waldenberg President Joe Biden speaks at a campaign event in Philadelphia on Thursday. Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters/File President Joe Biden said in a statement Saturday that the House passage of foreign aid bills sends a 'clear message' about America's leadership to the globe.

At this critical inflection point, they came together to answer history's call, passing urgently-needed national security legislation that I have fought for months to secure,' Biden said. 'I urge the Senate to quickly send this package to my desk so that I can sign it into law and we can quickly send weapons and equipment to Ukraine to meet their urgent battlefield needs,' he added. 17 min ago From CNN's Tamar Michaelis in Jerusalem Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked the US House for passing the Israel aid bill. 'The US Congress just overwhelmingly passed a much appreciated aid bill that demonstrates strong bipartisan support for Israel and defends Western civilization. Thank you friends, thank you America!'

Gerry Connolly argued that House Democrats should not save Speaker Mike Johnson's job, telling CNN that the only speaker he wants is Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. 'Democrats need to decide who they want to be speaker, and I want Hakeem Jeffries, he said. Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, noted that voting to save Johnson's job would mean voting to save a speaker who they have major policy disagreements with, saying the Louisiana Republican's record is \"antithetical to every core value\" Democrats hold. However, Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor of Virginia, expressed an openness to saving Johnson. 'I want this place to function, and any future votes I take will be related to my desire to keep on the job,' she said, adding, 'I'm gonna vote for us to continue to be able to govern and we need to be a functional body.\"\nThe House has passed a $95 billion package providing foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific region.\nA fourth bill in the package addressed other House GOP priorities, including sanctions on Iran and a measure that could lead to a TikTok ban. The legislation will be combined into a single amendment as it moves on to the Senate.\nAfter months of resisting putting a foreign aid bill on the House floor, GOP Speaker Mike Johnson joined with Democrats to advance the measure to Saturday's vote.\nThe bipartisan move drew the ire of some hardline members in the Republican Party, who are supporting an effort to oust him. Johnson's job is safe for now, as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said she won't yet move forward with a motion to vacate. 1 min ago From CNN's Lauren Fox and Alison Main\nA number of lawmakers who backed the aid packages today said their views on House Speaker Mike Johnson as a leader changed after the speaker put bills on the floor despite a threat against his job.\nHouse Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, said he thinks it was a transformative moment for Johnson as a leader, adding that the speaker's stock in the conference has gone up even as he faces the threat of an ouster from a minority of members.\n'I have tremendous respect. ... He had a learning curve, but at the end of the day, he knew what the right thing to do was,' McCaul said. Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois was blunt when asked whether he had a new respect and view of the speaker than he did two weeks ago.\n'I guess I do. The old adage is it's never too late to do the right thing. We tested that,' Quigley said. 'I think we build on this. ... We have a lot of challenges. It's good news that today at a critical time, we did act cohesively as a legislature.' GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said he always thought Johnson would get there but a turning point came when the speaker was briefed that passing Ukraine aid by April was essential.\n'He's always said he was for Ukraine, and I've always believed him,' Bacon said. 'I think he just came to the conclusion we couldn't wait any longer. He was briefed that we had to get this done in April or bad things were going to happen to Ukraine.\" 8 min ago From CNN's Kit Maher\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson talks to the press after the House four foreign aid bills at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on Saturday. Drew Angerer/AFP/Getty Images Moments after the House passed four foreign aid bills totaling $95 billion, Speaker Mike Johnson said he had not spoken to Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries about potentially saving his job if his hardline colleagues move to oust him.\n\ufffd\ufffdI don't walk around this building being worried about a motion to vacate,' Johnson said, referring to a procedural tool to remove the House speaker. 'I have to do my job. ... I've done here what I believe to be the right thing to allow the House to work its will. And as I've said, you do the right thing, and you let the chips fall where they may.' Walking toward his office, Johnson told reporters that he believes he will still be speaker in November and that he hasn't spoken to any of his detractors Saturday.\nJohnson said the 'world is destabilized' and 'a tinderbox,' stressing the importance of the bills' passage in a 'dangerous time.'\n'Three of our primary adversaries, Russia, and Iran, and China, are working together and they're being aggressors around the globe,' Johnson said. 'They're a global threat to our prosperity and our security. Their advance threatens the free world, and it demands American leadership. We turn our backs right now, the consequences could be devastating.'\n21 min ago From CNN's Priscilla Alvarez\nThe White House on Saturday clinched urgent foreign aid after a monthslong saga that involved starts and stops in Congress and was momentarily upended by one of the most politically vulnerable issues for President Joe Biden: border security.\nThe ask for additional aid to Ukraine, among other priorities, dates to October, when the White House put forward its national security supplemental funding request. Over the last several months, Biden has framed the need to provide additional funds to the war-torn country as a national security priority, warning that no ground should be ceded to Russia.\nMore recently, US officials attributed losses on the battlefield in Ukraine to the lack of additional assistance from the United States. In February, for example, the White House laid the blame for Ukraine's withdrawal from the key town of Avdiivka squarely at the feet of Republicans in Congress.\nFunding for Ukraine was also a recurring topic of discussion between Biden and global leaders as the US sought to reaffirm its leadership on the world stage \u2014 a theme echoed in the president's statement Saturday.\n'Today, members of both parties in the House voted to advance our national security interests and send a clear message about the power of American leadership on the world stage. At this critical inflection point, they came together to answer history's call, passing urgently-needed national security legislation that I have fought for months to secure,' Biden said.\n32 min ago TikTok criticized the House's passage of a bill that could ban the app in the US.\n\"It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement Saturday. 41 min ago From CNN's Samantha Waldenberg\nPresident Joe Biden speaks at a campaign event in Philadelphia on Thursday.

At this critical inflection point, they came together to answer history's call, passing urgently-needed national security legislation that I have fought for months to secure,' Biden said. 'I urge the Senate to quickly send this package to my desk so that I can sign it into law and we can quickly send weapons and equipment to Ukraine to meet their urgent battlefield needs,' he added.\n17 min ago From CNN's Tamar Michaelis in Jerusalem\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked the US House for passing the Israel aid bill.\n'The US Congress just overwhelmingly passed a much appreciated aid bill that demonstrates strong bipartisan support for Israel and defends Western civilization. Thank you friends, thank you America!' Netanyahu said on social media.\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz also thanked the House, saying he hopes the measure will pass in the US Senate soon 'with strong bipartisan support.'\nPosting on X, Katz said, 'Thank you @SpeakerJohnson for your leadership which led the efforts to pass the Israel aid package in the House of Representatives today. And thank you Minority Leader @RepJeffries for supporting it.The vote on the Israel aid package with an overwhelming bipartisan support proves the strong ties and strategic partnership between Israel and the U.S. and sends a strong message to our enemies.

But it has fierce critics in both parties who have privacy and other concerns and they have the ability procedurally to drag out final passage of the bill into the weekend if an agreement is not reached.\n'We're still trying to see if there's a path to getting this bill done quickly, but disagreements remain on how to proceed. Our work is not done. So, we're going to keep at it. We want to get FISA done as soon as we can, because it's very important for our national security. But as everyone knows, any one member can halt progress in this chamber. So, both sides need to fully cooperate, if we want to get FISA done,' Schumer said on the floor.\nUnder FISA's Section 702, the government hoovers up massive amounts of internet and cell phone data on foreign targets. Hundreds of thousands of Americans' information is incidentally collected during that process and then accessed each year without a warrant \u2014 down from millions of such queries the US government ran in past years. Critics refer to these queries as 'backdoor' searches.\nThe trove of data, including a large portion of US internet traffic, is meant to provide US intelligence agencies with quick access to data regarding foreigners in other countries.\nAccording to one assessment, it forms the basis of most of the intelligence the president views each morning and it has helped the US keep tabs on Russia's intentions in Ukraine, identify foreign efforts to access US infrastructure, uncover foreign terror networks and thwart terror attacks in the US.\nThe New York Democrat told senators they should be prepared to work this weekend to complete FISA and also possibly take up the funding bill for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, which the House is poised to pass Saturday. Schumer said he wants the Senate to pass it 'expeditiously.'\n'We will see how things go in the lower chamber over the next day or so. And I hope the House gets this legislation passed without further delay. If the House sends us a supplemental package, the Senate will move expeditiously to send it to the president's desk. And the president has said if Congress passes the supplemental, he will sign it,' he said.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also pressed for passage of FISA bill, which he said has a number of changes in it to address past 'abuses' by the FBI. The Kentucky Republican also warned that some critics of the bill were 'fear mongering' that the legislation would allow spying on Americans in coffees shops and other places and should be ignored.\n'There will be serious consequences if the Senate fails to do its job today. The stakes of such an outcome are grave. The authorities in question today have quite literally been the only defense against what would be national security disasters,' he said.\nMcConnell also pressed for quick passage of the foreign aid funding bill.\nCNN's Katie Bo Lillis contributed to this report.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ted,CNN,Ted Barrett,Ted  Barrett","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240314193311-chuck-schumer-critica-netanyahu-respyesta-mitch-mcconnell-panorama-mundial-tv.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":5.584679,"_id":"6e3ed08a167e3528f231148c863f5f4f"},{"title":"House passes key foreign aid package","author":"Kaanita Iyer","published_date":"2024-04-20 16:04:10","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/house-vote-ukraine-israel-taiwan-aid-04-20-24/h_ddb148c30bf91f87e2883fa3b89a28b5","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on X that he is \"grateful\" for House lawmakers for passing the measure that provides aid to Ukraine, personally thanking Speaker Mike Johnson \"for\u2026","summary":"Democratic lawmakers wave Ukrainian flags after the House passed the Ukraine Security Supplemental Appropriations Act.

House Republicans released the text of three bills Wednesday that would provide aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, with the latter intended to protect US allies in the region from Chinese aggression. Despite opposition from hardline conservatives, House Speaker Mike Johnson advanced the foreign aid plan that, taken together, adds up to about $95 billion in aid. The House is expected to vote on the bills Saturday. Meanwhile, in the Senate, Democrats were quick to dismiss articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday as the historic trial barely got underway. House Republicans had voted to impeach Mayorkas in February over his handling of the southern border by a narrow margin.\nBoeing's battered reputation took another hit at two Senate committee hearings Wednesday, with witnesses questioning how the company builds its airplanes and the safety of those planes. A former Boeing engineer said he's been threatened for bringing safety concerns to his managers over several years, but that he was testifying due to his belief that 'they are putting out defective airplanes.' Boeing did not have any witnesses at the hearings Wednesday, but defended its company standards earlier this week, saying that the 787 fleet has safely transported more than 850 million passengers in the last 13 years of service.\nThe Republican-controlled Arizona House of Representatives once again failed to advance a repeal of the state's 160-year-old abortion ban. The vote on Wednesday came just days after Arizona lawmakers revived a controversial Civil War-era law that almost completely halts access to the procedure. The vote is a blow to reproductive rights as well as to GOP candidates in competitive races who have been scrambling to distance themselves from the court's decision.

Seven jurors were seated Tuesday on the panel that will decide former President Donald Trump's guilt or innocence in the New York hush money case. The prospective jurors include two lawyers, a nurse, an IT consultant and a teacher \u2014 and all have either said or implied they can be fair and impartial. A panel of 12 New Yorkers and likely six alternates will ultimately be chosen.

This comes as Israel's war cabinet met to discuss a potential response to Iran. Sources told CNN that the US expects Israel's reaction will be limited in scope. However, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi warned that the 'smallest action against Iran's interests' would be met with a 'severe, extensive and painful' response. Meanwhile, amid ongoing strikes in Gaza, the US military airdropped more aid into the besieged enclave \u2014 this time around 25,300 meal equivalents.

The whistleblower, Sam Salehpour, is set to be the key witness at the hearing that could reveal new details about Boeing's safety and quality issues. Boeing has faced more than five years of questions about its commercial jets following two fatal crashes of a different model, the 737 Max, in 2018 and 2019. Those crashes killed 346 people and led to a 20-month grounding of that aircraft. A costly door plug incident on an Alaska Airlines flight in January also sparked allegations that some Boeing employees felt reluctant to raise questions about the safety of the planes they are building or inspecting for fear of retaliation.\nHouse Republicans have sent to the Senate two articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, a step that launches a trial in the Senate as Republican lawmakers seek to highlight President Joe Biden's handling of immigration policy. The Democratic-controlled Senate, however, is expected to quickly dismiss the charges without a trial. The effort by House Republicans comes after they voted to impeach Mayorkas in February over his handling of the southern border by a narrow margin, blaming him and the Biden administration for the high number of border crossings. Democrats have slammed the impeachment as a political stunt, saying that Republicans had no valid basis for the move.\nDubai was inundated Tuesday with a year's worth of rain in under 12 hours.

It was a week of unexpected developments in an unpredictable but consequential election year.\nHere are the surprise developments and what they could mean for the future:\nUnless you've been stranded off the grid in Antarctica, you know that former President Donald Trump is on trial in New York on charges of falsifying business records related to hush money payments made before the 2016 election. This overriding lead story was the subject of blanket TV coverage and banner headlines.\nThe surprise is that a jury selection process predicted to take weeks was over in days. Twelve jurors and six alternates will sit in judgment of the former president.\nThere were multiple hiccups, such as when one juror reconsidered her ability to remain impartial or when a self-immolation created a scene outside the courthouse.\nBut the end result is the most important thing. The first of four potential criminal trials of Trump is happening. Opening arguments get underway next week.\nWe can't say exactly who will testify because the prosecution won't tell Trump's team which witnesses they will call first. They anticipate Trump will violate a gag order and trash talk whoever takes the stand.\nWhat we do know is that Trump has already tried to seed a conspiracy theory that the jury is somehow biased against him. This despite the open process that led to the seating of the anonymous jury.\n'Help' is probably the wrong word. When 165 Democrats voted with 151 Republicans in favor of House Speaker Mike Johnson's plan to hold votes on aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, it ossified the aggravation at Johnson from the right wing of his party.\nThree Republicans \u2013 Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona \u2013 have said they will support a plan to oust Johnson from the speaker's chair.\nJohnson, meanwhile, refused to protect himself by changing House rules to make it harder to fire him. He has maintained the support of most Republicans and of Trump. At least for now.\nThe fault lines in the GOP, evident for years, are under immense stress. If Johnson is to keep his spot as speaker, he'll probably need help as soon as next week from Democrats for that too.\nIt would be something that looks like bipartisan or coalition governing, which would be music to any moderate American's ears. And if Johnson keeps his position as well as passes what most Americans and lawmakers want, his skill at leadership will deserve a reexamination. More to come next week.\nMost lawmakers in the House and Senate support giving more military aid to Ukraine as it fends off Russia's invasion. But the opposition of the right wing of the GOP has delayed the aid since the White House requested it in October.\nJohnson, although a bona fide conservative and a skeptic at times of Ukraine aid, is finally on the cusp of getting the vote done in the House. It's a major development.\nBut the fight over aid has also uncovered some uncomfortable truths, such as the prominence of the nationalist-veering GOP right wing, which is not afraid to say it doesn't put much stock in supporting democracies around the world.\nTit-for-tat strikes and responses between Israel and Iran in recent weeks have threatened to spark an all-out conflagration between the two countries.\nThis week, Iran responded to Israel's strike on a Syrian diplomatic facility with its own strikes, which Israel responded to on Friday with a strike on Iran. But the takeaway of many analysts was that might be it for a while.\nHere's Tamara Qiblawi in CNN's Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter:\nThis month's dramatic escalation, which kicked off with an apparent Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, followed by a largely foiled Iranian attack of over 300 airborne weapons on Israel, seems to have given way to a rapid climbdown. Shortly after the Friday morning attack in Iran, a regional intelligence source told CNN's Nic Robertson that Iran was not expected to respond further, and that the direct state-to-state strikes between the two enemy states were over.

Read more from Qiblawi. With all the Trump trial coverage, you might have missed that President Joe Biden is running a spirited presidential campaign. While Trump is spending most days at his trial, Biden is going all over the map.\nThis week, he was in Philadelphia, where he went to a Wawa, and he was in Pittsburgh, where he went to a Sheetz. He was in Pennsylvania for a three-day swing to push his economic populism. If he can sustain the blue wall that wins Democrats their recent presidencies, it's this kind of tailored campaigning that will do it.\nAs Trump was spinning conspiracy theories outside his trial, Biden was adopting some of Trump's message on issues like tariffs, while drawing a bright line between the two of them on the key American issue of protecting democracy.\nAll of Biden's hard work won't quiet the critics who point to his age and wonder if he's up to the job, but it's impossible to argue the man is not trying very hard to convince people he wants to remain president.\nThe term 'Bidenomics' is either an insult or a brag, depending on the circumstances.\nBiden's economic pitch, as earnest as it was this week, might be a hard sell to Americans who still acutely feel the pinch of inflation and feel priced out of everything from the housing market to the restaurant scene.\nThe International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, is worried not about a US recession, but rather that the US economy is too hot compared with other countries, according to a report released this week. While Europe and other developed countries have yet to reach their pre-pandemic growth levels, the data suggests the US economy has blown past them.\n'Astonishingly, the US economy has already surged past its pre-pandemic (growth) trend,' IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in a blog post accompanying the agency's World Economic Outlook. That means any talk of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the near future is likely to end.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Zachary B.

Read more opinion on CN CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Tennessee's House of Representatives plans to take up a bill that would allow some teachers to carry guns in the classroom, just days after the measure was approved by the state Senate. A similar law that could put guns in the hands of teachers has been approved by lawmakers in Iowa, and presumably other states could choose to follow suit.\nIt's the latest proof that \u2014 a full year after the devastating mass shooting at The Covenant High School in Nashville that killed six people \u2014 our state's political leaders are no closer to providing meaningful, viable solutions to address our state's tragic gun violence problem.\nThe Covenant High School in Nashville that killed six people \u2014 our state's political leaders are no closer to providing meaningful, viable solutions to address our state's tragic gun violence problem. Guns are still the leading cause of death in children and teens in America, and Tennessee continues to be plagued by one of the highest rates of violence perpetrated with firearms in the country. The Republican supermajority that controls our state's General Assembly, tragically, have reneged on their responsibility to pass meaningful gun safety legislation.\nIf Republicans have failed to make inroads in combating senseless gun violence, it cannot be because they are unaware of the seriousness of the problem. The magnitude of our gun violence problem was made clear to residents of Tennessee and the entire nation last March after a shooter armed with a weapon of war carried out the massacre at The Covenant School. Among the dead were three children, 9-year-olds Hallie Scruggs, Evelyn Dieckhaus and William Kinney.\nHere's what Republican lawmakers could do instead of passing measures that would introduce even more guns into our public spaces, and now potentially our classrooms: They could listen to some of the parents who have been appalled at the idea that the adults to whom they have entrusted their children's care at school every day might be carrying loaded guns.\nOne such mom, Beth Gebhard, whose son attended The Covenant School told me after the shooting that quick action by her son's teacher might have saved his life that day, as well as the lives of all of the other children in the class. But it's not because the teacher confronted the shooter with a gun. Far from it.\n'My son was in a second-grade classroom close to where the children were slain. The children heard the intensely loud, repeated shots,' Beth told me.\n'I know the primary reason he's still alive is that his teacher \u2014 under extreme duress \u2014 was able to follow her training to lock the classroom door, pull down the shades, shepherd the children to the safe corner of the room and be there with them, helping them to follow her breathing and to stay silent so the Nashville police officers could do their work.'\nBeth knows that guns belong in the hands of trained professionals who are best equipped to meet the threat posed by a gunman. Putting firearms into the hands of classroom teachers and administrators every day is simply asking for more heartache and tragedy.\nHere's some more wisdom that Tennessee lawmakers could glean from parents: Immediately following The Covenant School massacre, grieving parents lined the streets and the entrance to the Tennessee State House, demanding common sense gun safety laws. Students walked out of schools across Nashville and Memphis making similar demands. We've seen a groundswell of similar protests in recent days, as parents and students raise their voices in opposition to the measure being considered in the House that could put guns in the hands of their teachers.\nRelated article Van Jones: Going home, I encountered a huge problem\nRelated article Van Jones: Going home, I encountered a huge problem Their sentiments are echoed across the country. A strong majority of Americans favor stricter gun safety laws in the US, according to a Gallup poll, and a similar majority of teachers believe arming them would make schools less safe, according to research by the Rand Corporation. In Tennessee, a wide majority \u2014 about three-quarters of registered voters \u2014 want red flag laws, according to polling last year from Vanderbilt University.\nThere is one more group that Tennessee lawmakers should consult with before passing a measure that could make our gun violence problem even worse: The members of the law enforcement community who are directly tasked with keeping schools safe.\nThe National Association of School Resource Officers (NASRO) also opposes arming teachers, and their research data aligns with the fears of teachers and school staff. Among other warnings, NASRO reports that a law enforcement officer could mistake an armed teacher for an assailant and that discharging weapons in a school is an 'extremely risky action' that could result in wounding or killing innocent children and staff.\nTheir data also indicate that an armed teacher is more likely to interfere with first responders' actions than to stop a school shooter. Besides all of the data indicating the dangers of arming teachers, the training outlined in the proposed bill is insufficient to prepare teachers to safely carry and operate a weapon in the event of a mass shooting.\nUnfortunately, rather than heeding wise counsel on the subject of reducing gun violence, our legislature has frequently resorted to reactive and even anti-democratic tactics.\nTennessee state Rep. Justin Jones, Rep. Gloria Johnson and I responded to the pleas of our constituents and the mourners outside and inside the State House last year, joining them in peaceful protest against a conservative majority that refused to listen.\nHowever, on that day and every day since, the majority party lawmakers appear to answer to a different constituency \u2014 the Tennessee Firearms Association and the National Rifle Association. And they responded to our efforts to represent the grieving people of Tennessee by expelling Jones and me \u2014 two Black men \u2014 from our duly elected offices.\nAlthough our municipal governments promptly reinstated us and our constituents voted us back into office, the supermajority in the Tennessee State House is still trying to silence us. Despite the retribution politics that dominate the Republican agenda, we refuse to be silent. We will not sit still and be quiet while our children and communities are ravaged by gun violence.\nArming teachers increases the likelihood of shootings in schools, increases the chance that students will have access to guns and erodes trust in educators. A teacher with a handgun is unable to stop a shooter with a military-style weapon, and teachers aren't able to respond in the ways trained law enforcement agents can. Adverse impacts \u2014 including fatal outcomes \u2014 will disproportionately fall on already marginalized populations such as disabled and Black students.\nAccording to the national teachers' union the American Federation of Teachers, more than three in four teachers oppose putting guns in the hands of educators and school staff, stating that schools would be more dangerous if staff were armed. Most parents, as well as students, oppose arming teachers.\n'Arming teachers is not the answer to school shootings \u2014 it's a dangerous next step in the gun lobby's \u2018guns everywhere' agenda. We need to vote these reckless politicians out and elect lawmakers who will fight for the common sense, research-backed gun safety laws that Tennesseans deserve,' says Angela Ferrell-Zabala, executive director of Moms Demand Action, the anti-gun violence group founded after another horrific school mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in December 2012.\nAs parents tell me time and again, guns in classrooms simply are not the answer. 'Can you imagine what would have happened if my son's teacher left the classroom with a handgun to confront the shooter with military-grade weapons?' Beth asked me. 'Not only would she have been killed, but she would have left terrified 8-year-olds alone \u2014 many likely crying and some following her \u2014 alerting the shooter to their presence. I have no doubt my son wouldn't have survived.'\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook This moment requires our highest reasoning and the best of our efforts. It requires elected officials to do everything we can to end the gun violence epidemic plaguing our communities, our state and our nation. But the bill that passed the Tennessee Senate last week and is under consideration in the House is a red herring that not only prevents us from dealing with the problem of gun safety and fear in schools, but also puts our kids and teachers in more danger.\nArming teachers does not create the school environment we want or need. Students deserve better. They deserve nurturing and care in a trusting and productive educational environment where they can thrive.\nWe need what a vast majority of Tennessee voters and voters nationwide want: common sense gun legislation. These include those articulated by Covenant Families for Brighter Tomorrows and Mothers Over Murder, who are calling for more counseling for children, closing gun-buying loopholes, mandating stronger background checks and passing safer storage laws.\nWe must do right by our children and our communities. We can only do that by listening to them, rather than to those who profit from gun violence.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Opinion Justin J.

Putting firearms into the hands of classroom teachers and administrators every day is simply asking for more heartache and tragedy.\nHere's some more wisdom that Tennessee lawmakers could glean from parents: Immediately following The Covenant School massacre, grieving parents lined the streets and the entrance to the Tennessee State House, demanding common sense gun safety laws. Students walked out of schools across Nashville and Memphis making similar demands. We've seen a groundswell of similar protests in recent days, as parents and students raise their voices in opposition to the measure being considered in the House that could put guns in the hands of their teachers.\nRelated article Van Jones: Going home, I encountered a huge problem\nRelated article Van Jones: Going home, I encountered a huge problem Their sentiments are echoed across the country. A strong majority of Americans favor stricter gun safety laws in the US, according to a Gallup poll, and a similar majority of teachers believe arming them would make schools less safe, according to research by the Rand Corporation. In Tennessee, a wide majority \u2014 about three-quarters of registered voters \u2014 want red flag laws, according to polling last year from Vanderbilt University.\nThere is one more group that Tennessee lawmakers should consult with before passing a measure that could make our gun violence problem even worse: The members of the law enforcement community who are directly tasked with keeping schools safe.\nThe National Association of School Resource Officers (NASRO) also opposes arming teachers, and their research data aligns with the fears of teachers and school staff. Among other warnings, NASRO reports that a law enforcement officer could mistake an armed teacher for an assailant and that discharging weapons in a school is an 'extremely risky action' that could result in wounding or killing innocent children and staff.\nTheir data also indicate that an armed teacher is more likely to interfere with first responders' actions than to stop a school shooter. Besides all of the data indicating the dangers of arming teachers, the training outlined in the proposed bill is insufficient to prepare teachers to safely carry and operate a weapon in the event of a mass shooting.\nUnfortunately, rather than heeding wise counsel on the subject of reducing gun violence, our legislature has frequently resorted to reactive and even anti-democratic tactics.\nTennessee state Rep. Justin Jones, Rep. Gloria Johnson and I responded to the pleas of our constituents and the mourners outside and inside the State House last year, joining them in peaceful protest against a conservative majority that refused to listen.\nHowever, on that day and every day since, the majority party lawmakers appear to answer to a different constituency \u2014 the Tennessee Firearms Association and the National Rifle Association. And they responded to our efforts to represent the grieving people of Tennessee by expelling Jones and me \u2014 two Black men \u2014 from our duly elected offices.\nAlthough our municipal governments promptly reinstated us and our constituents voted us back into office, the supermajority in the Tennessee State House is still trying to silence us. Despite the retribution politics that dominate the Republican agenda, we refuse to be silent. We will not sit still and be quiet while our children and communities are ravaged by gun violence.\nArming teachers increases the likelihood of shootings in schools, increases the chance that students will have access to guns and erodes trust in educators. A teacher with a handgun is unable to stop a shooter with a military-style weapon, and teachers aren't able to respond in the ways trained law enforcement agents can. Adverse impacts \u2014 including fatal outcomes \u2014 will disproportionately fall on already marginalized populations such as disabled and Black students.\nAccording to the national teachers' union the American Federation of Teachers, more than three in four teachers oppose putting guns in the hands of educators and school staff, stating that schools would be more dangerous if staff were armed. Most parents, as well as students, oppose arming teachers.\n'Arming teachers is not the answer to school shootings \u2014 it's a dangerous next step in the gun lobby's \u2018guns everywhere' agenda. We need to vote these reckless politicians out and elect lawmakers who will fight for the common sense, research-backed gun safety laws that Tennesseans deserve,' says Angela Ferrell-Zabala, executive director of Moms Demand Action, the anti-gun violence group founded after another horrific school mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in December 2012.\nAs parents tell me time and again, guns in classrooms simply are not the answer. 'Can you imagine what would have happened if my son's teacher left the classroom with a handgun to confront the shooter with military-grade weapons?' Beth asked me. 'Not only would she have been killed, but she would have left terrified 8-year-olds alone \u2014 many likely crying and some following her \u2014 alerting the shooter to their presence. I have no doubt my son wouldn't have survived.'\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook This moment requires our highest reasoning and the best of our efforts. It requires elected officials to do everything we can to end the gun violence epidemic plaguing our communities, our state and our nation. But the bill that passed the Tennessee Senate last week and is under consideration in the House is a red herring that not only prevents us from dealing with the problem of gun safety and fear in schools, but also puts our kids and teachers in more danger.\nArming teachers does not create the school environment we want or need. Students deserve better. They deserve nurturing and care in a trusting and productive educational environment where they can thrive.\nWe need what a vast majority of Tennessee voters and voters nationwide want: common sense gun legislation. These include those articulated by Covenant Families for Brighter Tomorrows and Mothers Over Murder, who are calling for more counseling for children, closing gun-buying loopholes, mandating stronger background checks and passing safer storage laws.\nWe must do right by our children and our communities. We can only do that by listening to them, rather than to those who profit from gun violence.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Justin J.

Signed by Republican Gov. Brad Little last year, the law makes it a felony to provide medical treatment \u2013 such as puberty-blocking drugs, hormone therapy and certain surgeries \u2013 to transgender minors.\nThe high court's decision, which came over the dissent of liberal justices, doesn't resolve the underlying legal challenges raised by the case but instead allows the state to enforce the law against most people while the lower courts resolve those questions.\nThough there was no formal opinion from the court, as is often the case on the court's emergency docket, several justices wrote to explain their positions.\nThe court's conservatives said the decision was intended as a signal to lower courts to limit how far they rule when they are temporarily blocking the state from enforcing a law. Justice Neil Gorsuch, in an opinion joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, noted that the lower court that reviewed the Idaho law didn't just block it for the parties involved but blocked its enforcement for everyone in the state.\nThat, they said, represented an overreach by the courts.\n'A return to a more piecemeal and deliberative judicial process may strike some as inefficient. It may promise less power for the judge and less drama and excitement for the parties and public,' Gorsuch wrote. 'But if any of that makes today's decision wrong, it makes it wrong in the best possible ways.'\nThe Supreme Court's decision on Monday continued to block enforcement against the parties who brought the suit, but no one else.\nThe move drew a sharp dissent from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who described the majority's decision as 'micromanaging the lower courts' exercise of their discretionary authority.'\nJackson, in an opinion joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, noted that a lower federal court 'determined that a never-before-in-effect Idaho law is likely unconstitutional' and that court temporarily blocked the law's enforcement while it considered the legal challenges involved.\n'This court is not compelled to rise and respond every time an applicant rushes to us with an alleged emergency, and it is especially important for us to refrain from doing so in novel, highly charged, and unsettled circumstances,' Jackson wrote.\nThe justices have for weeks been considering three merits appeals over similar laws in Tennessee and Kentucky. An Indiana ban on transition care for minors was allowed to take effect in late February by an appeals court in Chicago.\nIdaho, which is being represented in part by conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, argues that the lower court decisions to block the law were too broad because they swept in procedures banned under the act that the plaintiffs did not seek to continue.\nEvery day the law is blocked 'exposes vulnerable children to risky and dangerous medical procedures and infringes Idaho's sovereign power to enforce its democratically enacted law,' the state told the Supreme Court in its filing.\nAttorneys for the transgender teenagers and their parents who are challenging the state law had asked the court to turn down the request from Republican state Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador, saying that for both minor plaintiffs, 'gender-affirming medical care has dramatically alleviated their gender dysphoria and enabled them to become healthy, thriving teenagers.'\nLabrador said a statement that 'the state has a duty to protect and support all children,' adding: 'And that's why I'm proud to defend Idaho's law that ensures children are not subjected to these life-altering drugs and procedures.'\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Idaho, which represented the two families who sued over the law, described the court's decision as 'an awful result for transgender youth and their families.'\nThe ruling, the groups said in a statement, 'allows the state to shut down the care that thousands of families rely on while sowing further confusion and disruption.'\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\nThis story has been updated with additional details.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"John Fritze,CNN,Devan Cole","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2023-11-16t205735z-105410334-rc23z2adv2b0-rtrmadp-3-usa-court-florida-drag.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":5.3017783,"_id":"49d0ff3cac5d9a1ec6b2bee5c634bb75"},{"title":"Opening statements to begin in Trump's historic criminal trial","author":"'S Jeremy Herb","published_date":"2024-04-22 11:59:21","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-04-22-24/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Opening statements are expected to begin Monday in Donald Trump's New York hush money criminal trial.

CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 It was a week of unexpected developments in an unpredictable but consequential election year.\nHere are the surprise developments and what they could mean for the future:\nUnless you've been stranded off the grid in Antarctica, you know that former President Donald Trump is on trial in New York on charges of falsifying business records related to hush money payments made before the 2016 election. This overriding lead story was the subject of blanket TV coverage and banner headlines.\nThe surprise is that a jury selection process predicted to take weeks was over in days. Twelve jurors and six alternates will sit in judgment of the former president.\nThere were multiple hiccups, such as when one juror reconsidered her ability to remain impartial or when a self-immolation created a scene outside the courthouse.\nRelated article How a trial works: Trump's first criminal case is in court\nRelated article How a trial works: Trump's first criminal case is in court But the end result is the most important thing. The first of four potential criminal trials of Trump is happening. Opening arguments get underway next week.\nWe can't say exactly who will testify because the prosecution won't tell Trump's team which witnesses they will call first. They anticipate Trump will violate a gag order and trash talk whoever takes the stand.\nWhat we do know is that Trump has already tried to seed a conspiracy theory that the jury is somehow biased against him. This despite the open process that led to the seating of the anonymous jury.\n'Help' is probably the wrong word. When 165 Democrats voted with 151 Republicans in favor of House Speaker Mike Johnson's plan to hold votes on aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, it ossified the aggravation at Johnson from the right wing of his party.\nThree Republicans \u2013 Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona \u2013 have said they will support a plan to oust Johnson from the speaker's chair.\nJohnson, meanwhile, refused to protect himself by changing House rules to make it harder to fire him. He has maintained the support of most Republicans and of Trump. At least for now.\nThe fault lines in the GOP, evident for years, are under immense stress. If Johnson is to keep his spot as speaker, he'll probably need help as soon as next week from Democrats for that too.\nIt would be something that looks like bipartisan or coalition governing, which would be music to any moderate American's ears. And if Johnson keeps his position as well as passes what most Americans and lawmakers want, his skill at leadership will deserve a reexamination. More to come next week.\nMost lawmakers in the House and Senate support giving more military aid to Ukraine as it fends off Russia's invasion. But the opposition of the right wing of the GOP has delayed the aid since the White House requested it in October.\nJohnson, although a bona fide conservative and a skeptic at times of Ukraine aid, is finally on the cusp of getting the vote done in the House. It's a major development.\nBut the fight over aid has also uncovered some uncomfortable truths, such as the prominence of the nationalist-veering GOP right wing, which is not afraid to say it doesn't put much stock in supporting democracies around the world.\nTit-for-tat strikes and responses between Israel and Iran in recent weeks have threatened to spark an all-out conflagration between the two countries.\nThis week, Iran responded to Israel's strike on a Syrian diplomatic facility with its own strikes, which Israel responded to on Friday with a strike on Iran. But the takeaway of many analysts was that might be it for a while.\nHere's Tamara Qiblawi in CNN's Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter:\nThis month's dramatic escalation, which kicked off with an apparent Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, followed by a largely foiled Iranian attack of over 300 airborne weapons on Israel, seems to have given way to a rapid climbdown. Shortly after the Friday morning attack in Iran, a regional intelligence source told CNN's Nic Robertson that Iran was not expected to respond further, and that the direct state-to-state strikes between the two enemy states were over.

Read more from Qiblawi. With all the Trump trial coverage, you might have missed that President Joe Biden is running a spirited presidential campaign. While Trump is spending most days at his trial, Biden is going all over the map.\nThis week, he was in Philadelphia, where he went to a Wawa, and he was in Pittsburgh, where he went to a Sheetz. He was in Pennsylvania for a three-day swing to push his economic populism. If he can sustain the blue wall that wins Democrats their recent presidencies, it's this kind of tailored campaigning that will do it.\nAs Trump was spinning conspiracy theories outside his trial, Biden was adopting some of Trump's message on issues like tariffs, while drawing a bright line between the two of them on the key American issue of protecting democracy.\nAll of Biden's hard work won't quiet the critics who point to his age and wonder if he's up to the job, but it's impossible to argue the man is not trying very hard to convince people he wants to remain president.\nThe term 'Bidenomics' is either an insult or a brag, depending on the circumstances.\nBiden's economic pitch, as earnest as it was this week, might be a hard sell to Americans who still acutely feel the pinch of inflation and feel priced out of everything from the housing market to the restaurant scene.\nThe International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, is worried not about a US recession, but rather that the US economy is too hot compared with other countries, according to a report released this week. While Europe and other developed countries have yet to reach their pre-pandemic growth levels, the data suggests the US economy has blown past them.\n'Astonishingly, the US economy has already surged past its pre-pandemic (growth) trend,' IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in a blog post accompanying the agency's World Economic Outlook. That means any talk of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the near future is likely to end.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Zachary B.

He invited employees to an internal town hall scheduled for Wednesday 'for additional context.'\nThe memo was earlier reported by The Information. A TikTok spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe legislation calls for forcing TikTok's Chinese parent, ByteDance, to sell the app within 270 days \u2014 otherwise it would be illegal for US app stores to offer TikTok for downloads. The legislation also would allow Biden to extend that deadline by another 90 days if he determines there's been progress toward a sale.\nForeshadowing its legal strategy, TikTok has already publicly opposed the bill as an infringement on its users' First Amendment rights. Supporters of the legislation, by contrast, have said it is a necessary measure to protect Americans' personal data and have pushed back on characterizations of it as a flat-out ban.\nSome legal experts on the First Amendment have suggested TikTok could have a case, noting that courts have tended to look at the ultimate impacts of challenged laws on Americans' speech and not just their stated intent.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"tech","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brian Fung,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1249829557.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":5.2355824,"_id":"11d816b7b045458ec60729db1b0d1e46"},{"title":"Trump lawyers expect to have a common preliminary hearing before jury selection begins","author":"Kara Scannell","published_date":"2024-04-15 11:58:49","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-04-15-24/h_a773873f77f793607515b3468d6459c5","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Donald Trump's lawyers expect to have a Sandoval hearing today before jury selection gets underway in the hush money trial, a source familiar with the plans tells CNN.","summary":"Donald Trump will make history when he arrives in lower Manhattan Monday morning as the first former president to go on trial for criminal charges.\nDespite a blitz of last-minute attempts to derail the trial, jury selection is expected to get underway and will continue until a panel of 12 New Yorkers and alternates are seated, a process that could take at least a week.\nThe historic trial centers on a potential sex scandal coverup that took place just days before the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors allege Trump falsified business records to hide the reimbursement of hush money payments that were made to influence the election outcome. Trump has pleaded not guilty and has denied having an affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels.\nThe case will be a major test for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, as it may be the only one of Trump's four criminal cases to face a jury before Election Day. Trump will trade the campaign trail for the courtroom, where the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is expected to be four days a week for the next two months.\nThe former president has used his court appearances to rally supporters for his campaign but, despite his showmanship, the stakes for Trump are high.

Here are some of the policies Biden says he would enact if elected for a second term.","summary":"President Joe Biden's main pitch to voters ahead of November is simple: They should vote for him because he is not Donald Trump. In speeches and political events since his reelection campaign began in earnest earlier this year, Biden had said that his second term would essentially be a continuation of his first: 'Let's finish this job,' Biden said in a video announcing his reelection campaign last year. In making his case to voters, Biden has contrasted his own ideas of governance with Trump's stated plans to drastically alter how the federal government works, how executive power would be used and how America's role on the world stage will change if the former president wins a second term. Biden, meanwhile, has promised to protect American democracy, pass a federal law to codify the right to an abortion into law, preserve the country's international alliances and agreements and deliver on climate benchmarks. His ability to deliver on these promises even if he wins a second term, though, is not a certainty. Many of his more lofty ambitions would require congressional approval and action. In some of his most significant and enduring acts as president, Trump appointed three conservative nominees to the Supreme Court. The ensuing right-wing supermajority paved the way for the court's 2022 decision that overturned Roe. V Wade, which had enshrined the right to an abortion in federal law for nearly half a century. Biden has made the court's decision, and Trump's repeated promises to go further in restricting abortion access if he were to win in November, a centerpiece of his reelection campaign. 'Like most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right,' Biden said during his State of the Union address on March 7. '\u2026 But my predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. He's the reason it was overturned \u2014 in fact, he brags about it.' 'Look at the chaos that has resulted,' Biden added. During the speech, Biden promised to codify the abortion-related protections enshrined in Roe v. Wade into federal law if he wins a second term, but he acknowledged that would require the cooperation of a Democratic-controlled Congress. 'If Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again,' Biden said. Biden called for codifying Roe into law when he was running for president in 2020. While seeking office in 2020, Biden made ambitious climate-related promises, warning that climate change presents an existential threat to humanity. Some of those promises panned out: Biden's landmark legislative achievements, the bipartisan infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act, include hundreds of billions of dollars to encourage clean energy production and the manufacturing of electric vehicles. Pollution-falling emissions fell by 2% in the United States last year. Activists on Biden's left flank still think the president has not done enough \u2014 they want Biden to declare a climate emergency that would free up federal resources to confront climate change. Biden will need more time to fulfill some of his other pledges, including cutting emissions in half by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, and having a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. Biden said the 2020 race was a 'battle for the soul of the nation.' Now, he has made preserving democracy the focal point of his 2024 campaign \u2014 saying the value Americans place on a free and democratic society is the most important question of our country's time. He lays out the stakes in stark terms: If Trump wins a second term, the United States will face a crisis that could lead to the erosion of democratic norms. 'Not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault here at home as they are today,' Biden said during his State of the Union address last month. Today, he warned, there are 'forces taking us back in time.' Biden urged Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. The acts, which would have made Election Day a federal holiday, bolstered voting-related security measures, allowed all voters to request mail-in ballots and updated parts of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, were blocked by Senate Republicans in 2021. 'Pass and send me the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act,' Biden told Congress during his address, 'and stop denying another core value of America \u2014 our diversity across American life.' Biden has criticized Republican-led drives to ban certain books from public schools. 'Banning books \u2013 it's wrong,' he said in his State of the Union address. The United States, he said, shouldn't be erasing history. In the same speech, Biden also called for expanded pre-kindergarten for 3- and 4-year-olds, along with raises for teachers in public schools. He said he wants to continue making college more affordable by expanding access to Pell grants for working-class families, renewing a 2020 promise he made to double the grants' value. 'To remain the strongest economy in the world,' Biden said, 'we need the best education system in the world.' In some of his first actions as president, Biden worked to return the United States to the presence it held on the world stage before Trump became president. As president, Trump denigrated alliances like NATO and withdrew the United States from crucial international agreements, including the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accords. While running in 2020, Biden promised to undo damage wreaked by Trump on America's international partnerships. Biden has said he will continue to repair relationships that have faltered under Trump's control \u2014 and uphold American commitments to NATO and Ukraine. Trump, meanwhile, has said he would encourage Russia to do 'whatever the hell they want' to NATO-member countries who don't fulfill certain funding obligations. Biden frequently refers to those comments while speaking with supporters. 'The rest of the world is wondering what in the hell is happening to us,' Biden said at a campaign event in New York last month. 'And they're relieved, not because I'm so special but that I'm not Trump.' In an earlier Dallas fundraiser, Biden said the United States' international reputation was 'crushed when (Trump) was president.' 'Imagine what will happen if he's reelected,' Biden said. In 2022, Biden signed the most comprehensive gun-reform legislation in nearly 30 years. The law, passed shortly after a White supremacist massacred 10 people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket, allocated more than $750 million to help states implement crisis-intervention programs, closed certain loopholes in existing gun-control legislation and required more thorough reviews for people aged 18 to 21 who wanted to buy firearms. Biden has said he wants to go further. 'I'm demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,' Biden said at his State of the Union address. 'Pass universal background checks. None of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners.' He made a similar promise while running in 2020 but has not been able to get Congress' support. Biden has homed in on Trump's statements suggesting he would be open to cutting programs like Social Security and Medicare. In an interview with CNBC last month, Trump said: 'There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements,' Trump said on CNBC. Biden responded on X: 'Not on my watch.' He reiterated his vow to protect Social Security during his State of the Union address. 'Many of my Republican friends want to put Social Security on the chopping block,' Biden said 'If anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age I will stop them.' 'I will protect and strengthen Social Security and make the wealthy pay their fair share,' he added. ``\nPresident Joe Biden's main pitch to voters ahead of November is simple: They should vote for him because he is not Donald Trump.\nIn speeches and political events since his reelection campaign began in earnest earlier this year, Biden had said that his second term would essentially be a continuation of his first: 'Let's finish this job,' Biden said in a video announcing his reelection campaign last year.\nIn making his case to voters, Biden has contrasted his own ideas of governance with Trump's stated plans to drastically alter how the federal government works, how executive power would be used and how America's role on the world stage will change if the former president wins a second term.\nBiden, meanwhile, has promised to protect American democracy, pass a federal law to codify the right to an abortion into law, preserve the country's international alliances and agreements and deliver on climate benchmarks.\nHis ability to deliver on these promises even if he wins a second term, though, is not a certainty.

If the House's gambit succeeds, TikTok could be forced to find a new owner or be banned from the United States entirely.\nHere's what we know, and how it could affect you.\nYes. In March, House lawmakers approved a bill that would give TikTok roughly six months to sell. Failure to do so would lead to significant consequences: The app would be prohibited from US app stores and from 'internet hosting services' that support it.\nA few things. For starters, there are some substantive changes. Instead of a six-month deadline, TikTok would have roughly nine months. And that deadline could be extended by the White House \u2014 for a period of 90 days \u2014 if President Joe Biden determines there's been progress toward a sale.\nGiving TikTok as long as a year to wrap up a forced sale appears to have changed the political calculus on Capitol Hill. Some key lawmakers who've previously expressed skepticism now say they support the bill. One of those lawmakers is Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, who chairs the powerful Senate Commerce Committee.\nAnother factor that's shaking things up is how House Republicans inserted the TikTok bill into a much larger foreign aid package. Rather than asking the Senate to vote on the TikTok bill in isolation, bundling the bill with foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel makes it much harder for lawmakers to oppose the TikTok measure.\nSenators could try to strip out the TikTok legislation, but policy analysts view it as unlikely. Quickly approving the foreign aid is a top congressional priority, and if the Senate were to pass the package without the TikTok bill, those changes would have to be approved by the House, further delaying matters.\nIt seems more likely for the Senate to consider the entire package in a single, up-or-down vote \u2014 which is precisely what House Republicans appear to have wanted. The odds of Senate passage are as high as 80%, according to Paul Gallant, a policy analyst at the market research firm Cowen, Inc.\nThe Senate could vote in as little as one to two weeks, Gallant added, though Senate leadership has expressed a desire to move even faster.\nIf the Senate votes to approve the TikTok legislation, it heads to President Joe Biden's desk. Biden endorsed the prior version of the TikTok bill, which suggests he may quickly sign any foreign aid package that includes similar language targeting TikTok.\nIn theory, that would start the 270-day clock for TikTok to find a buyer. If it can't separate from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, then users could be cut off. But that is still a big 'if.' So for now, TikTok fans can continue using the app as before, though they might begin to see more creators \u2014 or the company itself \u2014 speaking out in the app to oppose the legislation.\nIn addition to complying with the legislation, TikTok could challenge it in court and has made no secret that it might do so. Its CEO, Shou Chew, vowed in March to continue fighting, 'including (by) exercising our legal rights.'\nTikTok and a slew of civil society groups have blasted the House legislation as unconstitutional, arguing that it violates TikTok users' First Amendment rights to access lawful information.\nFirst Amendment experts say a bill that has the ultimate effect of censoring TikTok users could be shot down by the courts. It's unclear whether the recent updates to the bill may help it survive constitutional scrutiny.\n'Longstanding Supreme Court precedent protects Americans' First Amendment right to access information, ideas, and media from abroad,' said Nadine Farid Johnson, policy director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. 'By banning TikTok, the bill would infringe on this right, and with no real pay-off. China and other foreign adversaries could still purchase Americans' sensitive data from data brokers on the open market.'\nA court challenge could lead to the measure being temporarily blocked while the litigation plays out, likely over multiple years.\nBut if a court declines to grant a temporary injunction, TikTok could have to scramble to comply with the law.\nThe trouble is that TikTok's parent is subject to Chinese law, and the Chinese government is on record opposing a sale.\nIn recent years, China has implemented export controls governing algorithms, a policy that would seem to cover the incredibly successful algorithm that powers TikTok's recommendation engine.\nIf the Chinese government doesn't want to let ByteDance relinquish TikTok's algorithm, the thinking goes, it could block the sale outright. Alternatively, it may allow TikTok to be sold but without the lucrative algorithm that forms the basis for its popularity.\nCan TikTok still succeed without its algorithm? That would be the difficult question facing the company in the event of a forced sale. Without the secret sauce that has propelled the app to 170 million US users, the app could be as good as dead.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"tech","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brian Fung,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-03-13t160217z-999331478-rc22l6abx549-rtrmadp-3-usa-tiktok-copy.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNNbusiness","_score":4.968577,"_id":"cbc9b20510d5509f9a6e51742681c6b3"},{"title":"Fact check: Donald Trump attacks Jimmy Kimmel for something Al Pacino did","author":"Daniel Dale","published_date":"2024-04-17 16:03:47","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/17/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-jimmy-kimmel-al-pacino","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"On Tuesday, late-night television host Jimmy Kimmel delivered another monologue making fun of former President Donald Trump.

CNN reporters will be in the courtroom, read their real-time updates below. 1 min ago From CNN's Kara Scannell, Jeremy Herb, Lauren del Valle, Julian Cummings, and Laura Dolan This photo taken April 4, 2023, shows a copy of the unsealed indictment for former President Donald Trump. Rebecca Wright/CNN Donald Trump has faced three civil trials in New York since he left the White House, but this is the first time he faces possible jail time. The former president is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, stemming from reimbursements made to his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen for hush money payments he made before the 2016 election to an adult film star alleging an affair with Trump. The former president has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair with Stormy Daniels. Each count represents a separate instance of the alleged misconduct, pointing to different business records associated with a series of repayments to Cohen (ledger entries, checks, stubs, invoices, etc.) that were allegedly falsified to conceal his criminal conduct. Penalty: The maximum penalty for each count is four years in state prison. However, the judge has discretion on how long any sentence should be and whether to allow any sentences to be served consecutively. He could also sentence Trump to probation. New York caps sentencing for this type of felony at 20 years. A president has no authority to pardon state crimes. 10 min ago From CNN's Devan Cole Judge Juan Merchan poses for a picture in his chambers in New York, Thursday, March 14. Seth Wenig/AP/File The New York judge overseeing Donald Trump's hush money trial will take center stage in the case Monday with jury selection kicking off in the historic criminal prosecution of the former president. New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan is a seasoned jurist who is no stranger to Trump's orbit. He has presided over the Trump Organization tax fraud trial, sentenced the former president's close confidant Allen Weisselberg to prison over his role in the scheme and overseen former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's criminal fraud case. But it's the former president's trial on charges that he illegally falsified business records over the reimbursement of hush money payments made before the 2016 election that will leave a lasting mark on Merchan's long career atop the state-level trial court. Merchan launched his legal career in 1994 when he started off as an assistant district attorney in the trial division in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. Several years later, he moved on to the state attorney general's office, where he worked on cases in Long Island. In 2006, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, then a Republican, appointed Merchan to Family Court in the Bronx, and Democratic Gov. David Paterson appointed him to the New York State Court of Claims in 2009, the same year he began serving as an acting New York Supreme Court judge. Born in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, Merchan emigrated to the United States at the age of six and grew up in the New York City neighborhood of Jackson Heights, Queens, according to a New York Times profile of the judge. He was the first in his family to go to college. He received his law degree from Hofstra University. 13 min ago From CNN's Paula Reid Donald Trump's lawyers expect to have a Sandoval hearing today before jury selection gets underway in the hush money trial, a source familiar with the plans tells CNN. A Sandoval hearing is a common preliminary proceeding that reviews a defendant's criminal history and looks at how much prosecutors can ask if a defendant testifies. 22 min ago From CNN's Amy O'Kruk and Curt Merrill Former President Donald Trump was first indicted in March 2023 by the Manhattan district attorney on state charges related to a hush money payment to an adult-film star in 2016. Now the case is going to trial. Catch up on the key people in the case below: 27 min ago From CNN's Kara Scannell and Lauren del Valle Donald Trump will make history when he arrives in lower Manhattan Monday morning as the first former president to go on trial for criminal charges. Despite a blitz of last-minute attempts to derail the trial, jury selection is expected to get underway and will continue until a panel of 12 New Yorkers and alternates are seated, a process that could take at least a week. The historic trial centers on a potential sex scandal coverup that took place just days before the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors allege Trump falsified business records to hide the reimbursement of hush money payments that were made to influence the election outcome. Trump has pleaded not guilty and has denied having an affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels. The case will be a major test for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, as it may be the only one of Trump's four criminal cases to face a jury before Election Day. Trump will trade the campaign trail for the courtroom, where the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is expected to be four days a week for the next two months. The former president has used his court appearances to rally supporters for his campaign but, despite his showmanship, the stakes for Trump are high. Trump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. If convicted, Judge Juan Merchan, the no-nonsense judge overseeing the trial, could sentence Trump to probation or a maximum sentence of 1 1/3 to 4 years on each count in state prison. A president has no authority to pardon state crimes. 40 min ago From CNN's Lauren del Valle, Jhasua Razo and Gillian Roberts Former President Donald Trump's first criminal trial begins Monday. Jury selection will start, and is expected to take six to eight weeks for the whole process from start to finish. This trial, related to a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016, is the first of four ongoing criminal cases that are expected to head to trial for the presumptive 2024 GOP presidential nominee. Read more about the stages of the case, and what they mean here. 31 min ago From CNN's Stephen Collinson The United States will cross a historic threshold on Monday when for the first time a former president goes on criminal trial in a case laced with fateful significance because Donald Trump could be back in the Oval Office next year. When the presumptive GOP nominee walks into court for the start of jury selection, he and the country will enter a new state of reality as legal and political worlds collide in a trial almost guaranteed to deepen Americans' bitter ideological estrangement. The trial, related to hush money payments to an adult film actress before the 2016 election, will mark yet another extraordinary twist in the story of Trump, whose incessant testing of the limits of presidential decorum and the law has caused nearly nine years of political tumult and may still have years left to run. It raises the possibility that, depending on the jury's verdict, the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election could be a convicted felon. And given the case's subject matter \u2014 details about a payment to a woman who alleged that she had a sexual relationship with Trump, which he denies \u2014 it could reflect poorly on Trump's character and ethics as voters weigh their decisions in November. Read Collinson's full analysis ahead of Trump's first criminal trial . 40 min ago From CNN's Mark Morales When former President Donald Trump appears in a New York courtroom today to face an unprecedented legal battle in his hush money case, law enforcement will deploy a sophisticated and multi-layered security plan greater than that of his previous high-profile cases in Manhattan, law enforcement officials told CNN. Trump, who is supposed to be in court and does not have the option of skipping any of the estimated six-to-eight week trial, is now the presumptive Republican nominee set to rematch President Joe Biden in November \u2013 a key difference from his attendance during a civil fraud case brought by state Attorney General Letitia James that inherently raises the stakes and will mean a more robust security package. The hallmark of the strategy is a combination of extra staffing, strategically placed frozen zones, and high-tech deployments and intelligence, which includes monitoring social media for anything ranging from lone wolf threats to major politically themed protests and disturbances, the officials said. 'Obviously, the threat picture is bigger,' said New York Police Department Assistant Chief John Hart, commanding officer of the NYPD's Intelligence and Counterterrorism Division, who added that the department did a similar security ramp-up around Trump when he became the GOP nominee in 2016.

Rebecca Wright/CNN Donald Trump has faced three civil trials in New York since he left the White House, but this is the first time he faces possible jail time.\nThe former president is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, stemming from reimbursements made to his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen for hush money payments he made before the 2016 election to an adult film star alleging an affair with Trump. The former president has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair with Stormy Daniels.\nEach count represents a separate instance of the alleged misconduct, pointing to different business records associated with a series of repayments to Cohen (ledger entries, checks, stubs, invoices, etc.) that were allegedly falsified to conceal his criminal conduct.\nPenalty: The maximum penalty for each count is four years in state prison. However, the judge has discretion on how long any sentence should be and whether to allow any sentences to be served consecutively. He could also sentence Trump to probation.\nPenalty: The maximum penalty for each count is four years in state prison.

Seth Wenig/AP/File The New York judge overseeing Donald Trump's hush money trial will take center stage in the case Monday with jury selection kicking off in the historic criminal prosecution of the former president. New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan is a seasoned jurist who is no stranger to Trump's orbit. He has presided over the Trump Organization tax fraud trial, sentenced the former president's close confidant Allen Weisselberg to prison over his role in the scheme and overseen former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's criminal fraud case.\nBut it's the former president's trial on charges that he illegally falsified business records over the reimbursement of hush money payments made before the 2016 election that will leave a lasting mark on Merchan's long career atop the state-level trial court.\nMerchan launched his legal career in 1994 when he started off as an assistant district attorney in the trial division in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. Several years later, he moved on to the state attorney general's office, where he worked on cases in Long Island. In 2006, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, then a Republican, appointed Merchan to Family Court in the Bronx, and Democratic Gov. David Paterson appointed him to the New York State Court of Claims in 2009, the same year he began serving as an acting New York Supreme Court judge.\nBorn in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, Merchan emigrated to the United States at the age of six and grew up in the New York City neighborhood of Jackson Heights, Queens, according to a New York Times profile of the judge. He was the first in his family to go to college. He received his law degree from Hofstra University.\n13 min ago From CNN's Paula Reid\nDonald Trump's lawyers expect to have a Sandoval hearing today before jury selection gets underway in the hush money trial, a source familiar with the plans tells CNN.\nA Sandoval hearing is a common preliminary proceeding that reviews a defendant's criminal history and looks at how much prosecutors can ask if a defendant testifies.\n22 min ago From CNN's Amy O'Kruk and Curt Merrill\nFormer President Donald Trump was first indicted in March 2023 by the Manhattan district attorney on state charges related to a hush money payment to an adult-film star in 2016.\nNow the case is going to trial. Catch up on the key people in the case below:\n27 min ago From CNN's Kara Scannell and Lauren del Valle\nDonald Trump will make history when he arrives in lower Manhattan Monday morning as the first former president to go on trial for criminal charges.\nDespite a blitz of last-minute attempts to derail the trial, jury selection is expected to get underway and will continue until a panel of 12 New Yorkers and alternates are seated, a process that could take at least a week.\nThe historic trial centers on a potential sex scandal coverup that took place just days before the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors allege Trump falsified business records to hide the reimbursement of hush money payments that were made to influence the election outcome. Trump has pleaded not guilty and has denied having an affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels.\nThe case will be a major test for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, as it may be the only one of Trump's four criminal cases to face a jury before Election Day. Trump will trade the campaign trail for the courtroom, where the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is expected to be four days a week for the next two months.\nThe former president has used his court appearances to rally supporters for his campaign but, despite his showmanship, the stakes for Trump are high. Trump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. If convicted, Judge Juan Merchan, the no-nonsense judge overseeing the trial, could sentence Trump to probation or a maximum sentence of 1 1/3 to 4 years on each count in state prison.

'There seems to be some thunder and lightning and it's a pretty big storm so if you don't mind, I think we're going to have to just do a raincheck, I'm so sad.'\nDespite the postponement, Trump, largely confined to a Manhattan courtroom for most of the past week, still reemerged on the campaign circuit here in North Carolina, where the stakes of the Republican's trial-to-trail presidential campaign are especially high.\nHe held a fundraiser in Charlotte, and he also posted several times on Truth Social about how he thinks presidents should be immune from prosecution. His flurry of posts comes as the Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on April 25 over whether Trump may claim immunity from prosecution in the federal election subversion case.\nSaturday capped an unprecedented week in American politics as the first criminal trial of a former president kicked off. The trial, which will determine whether Trump illegally sought to undermine the 2016 election through a scheme to pay off women with whom he allegedly had extramarital affairs, is expected to begin with opening statements on Monday.\nThe task ahead in New York for Trump is clear: Convince seven men and five women on the jury he is innocent of the 34 charges he faces. In battlegrounds like North Carolina, the challenge for Trump is less straightforward but similarly daunting: He must persuade voters in these states to overlook whatever details emerge from his New York trial when determining the country's next president. That includes evidence of alleged hush money payments as well as testimony from his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, a former Playboy playmate and an adult film star.\nAppearing in Greensboro, North Carolina, ahead of the state's primary last month, Trump remarked on his legal peril at length. He told the crowd that the 91 charges he then faced (it's now down to 88) were 'not legit.' He baselessly claimed the case against him in New York, which was brought by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, was 'being run by the Department of Justice for election interference \u2013 knock out your political opponent.'\n'The one thing they didn't know is the people of our country hear about it from me,' Trump asserted then.\nTrump handily won the primary days later during a convincing Super Tuesday performance. Yet, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley managed to win support from 23% of Republican primary voters in North Carolina, with many in Trump's party saying they could not overlook the vast legal challenges he faces. Three in 10 GOP voters said Trump would not be fit for the presidency if he was convicted of a crime \u2013 a troubling sign for the former president in a state he won over President Joe Biden by only 1.3% four years ago.\nTrump's campaign pointed to poll numbers that showed two-thirds of Americans don't believe he has broken any laws.\n'Polling shows the American people see right through the Stalinist tactics employed by Crooked Joe and his allies,' Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told CNN in a statement. 'President Trump and our team will continue fighting for truth in the courtroom, while working to earn votes on the campaign trail.'\nThroughout the dramatic first week of his trial \u2013 marked by a series of stunning moments, including potential jurors brought to tears by the intense pressure of their duty and a man who set himself on fire outside the courthouse \u2013 Trump made clear he intends to make sure people continue to hear about the case from him. In theatrical news conferences in front of courthouse cameras and aggressively posting on social media, Trump repeatedly lashed out at the judge overseeing the case and tested the boundaries of the gag order intended to keep him from intimidating jurors and witnesses.\nWithout cameras inside the courtroom, Trump has also challenged the narratives that have emerged from those watching the proceedings. In a fundraising text to supporters, Trump claimed he stormed out of the courtroom during the first day of the trial \u2013 a statement not supported by those who witnessed him walk out. Trump posted on Truth Social that 'I was PRAYING not sleeping!!' when multiple news outlets reported the former president appeared to doze off during the proceedings.\nThe judge overseeing the case, Judge Juan Merchan, is requiring Trump to appear in the courtroom during the trial, which could last several weeks. Court is in session every weekday except Wednesdays, leaving Trump with smaller windows to travel, making weekend events like Saturday's postponed Wilmington rally a focal point of his campaign calendar.\n'I'm supposed to be in New Hampshire. I'm supposed to be in Georgia. I'm supposed to be in North Carolina, South Carolina. I'm supposed to be a lot of different places campaigning,' Trump told reporters outside the courtroom this week. 'But I've been here all day on a trial that really is a very unfair trial.'\nTrump's statement, however, overlooks that the former president has often voluntarily appeared at proceedings for his civil cases rather than campaign. Trump also kept a notably light political schedule throughout the GOP primary when the legal cases against him had yet to reach this stage.\nRegardless of where Trump is spending his time, his campaign insists it is readying a robust operation, including paid teams and volunteers in every battleground state.\n'Our aggressive and experienced operation is focused on turning out votes and highlighting the contrast between Joe Biden's weakness and failures with President Trump's record of success,' Leavitt said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kate Sullivan,CNN,Steve Contorno","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2147933925.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":4.824352,"_id":"34d3653bdc8efced2a32bac91c042323"},{"title":"Jury selection continues in Trump's historic hush money trial","author":"'S Kara Scannell","published_date":"2024-04-16 12:00:21","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-hush-money-trial-04-16-24/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Jury selection will continue Tuesday in former President Donald Trump's New York hush money trial.
