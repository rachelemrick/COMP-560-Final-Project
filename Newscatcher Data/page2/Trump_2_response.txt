Donald J. Trump was a beneficiary.","summary":"The term was coined by old-time tabloid editors for buying the exclusive rights to stories, or 'catching' them, for the specific purpose of ensuring the information never becomes public, or 'killing' them.\nWhy would anyone want to spend money on a story that it never intends to publish? In the world of tabloid journalism, where ethical lines are blurry, deciding what to publish and why is often a calculus that covers favors doled out and chits called in.\nDavid Pecker, the former publisher of The National Enquirer, who also oversaw other tabloids such as Star and lifestyle publications such as Men's Fitness, was a master of the technique, according to people who have worked for him.\nIn 2003, Mr. Pecker's company, American Media Inc., bought several muscle magazines founded by a mentor of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilding legend and movie star. When Mr. Schwarzenegger, who was often featured in those magazines, jumped into the recall election to replace California's governor, Mr. Pecker ordered his staff to buy up negative stories about him in order to protect his investment, former employees said.\nStaff members called it 'the David Pecker Project.' American Media paid $20,000 to a former mistress of Mr. Schwarzenegger so that she would not speak about their affair \u2014 though news of it had previously been published. The company paid another $1,000 to her friend and $2,000 to a man who had a video of Mr. Schwarzenegger dancing lewdly in Rio de Janeiro 20 years earlier. Mr. Schwarzenegger was elected governor.\nMr. Pecker's publications made deals with other celebrities as well, though not always for money. He traded away dirt about the golfer Tiger Woods in exchange for an exclusive interview in Men's Fitness in 2007, according to people with knowledge of that episode.\nAnd, according to the prosecutors in the Manhattan trial of Donald J. Trump, Mr. Pecker employed 'catch-and-kill' tactics in the 2016 presidential election, paying a doorman and a Playboy model to suppress negative stories about Mr. Trump and boost the candidacy of his longtime associate.","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Michael Rothfeld","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/22/multimedia/22trump-trial-catch-kill-ghbp/22trump-trial-catch-kill-ghbp-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":5.9255,"_id":"8f87d06ea9c8745314f733d369ab12a6"},{"title":"Election Updates: Biden campaigns again in Pennsylvania, a swing state crucial to his re-election hopes.","author":"Chris Cameron","published_date":"2024-04-17 13:56:39","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/17/us/biden-trump-election-news","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"In his first campaign stop since his criminal trial in Manhattan began, former President Donald J.

He slammed fossil fuel companies for ramping up plastics production and promoting technology to suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which he called 'utterly preposterous.'\nAfterward, Mr. Gore explained in an interview why he was not surprised that major oil and gas companies have walked back their pledges to decarbonize. And he said he believed that former President Donald J. Trump would lose his campaign to return to the White House. Here are excerpts from that conversation, edited and condensed for clarity.\nOil and gas companies recently gathered in Houston for the industry's annual conference. Many of the major companies have walked back their promises to decarbonize. In Houston, the head of Saudi Aramco said the 'fantasy of phasing out oil and gas' should be ditched.\nOil and gas companies recently gathered in Houston for the industry's annual conference. Many of the major companies have walked back their promises to decarbonize. In Houston, the head of Saudi Aramco said the 'fantasy of phasing out oil and gas' should be ditched. I don't think their pledges were sincere in the first place. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there was this pinch in Europe's access to fossil fuels which translated into a crunch and in demand elsewhere in the world. There was a sudden surge to try to replace the Russian supplies. That had a global impact on the price of fossil fuels, and on the profits of the large companies.\nWhen they got a taste of these higher windfall profits, they came under pressure from their investors to capitalize while the getting was good. So they just decided en masse to abandon their pledges and just go forward, without regard to what they had pretended to be doing in the past. I think it was always a fraud. It remains to be seen whether they are going to be able to walk back their pledges without incurring significant damage politically and in the business community.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

They ended the year in a political bind after two House members left to become mayors of suburbs, leaving that chamber with an even partisan split and making it impossible for Democrats to pass bills without Republican support.\nOn Tuesday, five months after their House majority evaporated, Democrats won two special elections to reclaim those seats and full control at the Michigan Capitol. The Associated Press said the Democrats Mai Xiong, a Macomb County commissioner, and Peter Herzberg, a Westland City Council member, defeated their Republican opponents.\nThe results of the special elections had never been in great doubt. Both districts, situated in the Detroit area, are liberal strongholds that Democratic candidates had carried by large margins in 2022. But the details of scheduling and running special elections meant a long, slow winter for Democratic lawmakers in Lansing while the House was evenly divided between the two parties. Michigan's governor, Gretchen Whitmer, is a Democrat, and her party has a majority in the State Senate.\nRepublicans hope the Democrats' renewed House majority is short-lived. Michigan, long a swing state, is expected to be a pivotal presidential battleground again this year. President Biden is working to rebuild a coalition that helped him win the state in 2020, but early polling has been favorable to former President Donald J. Trump. Republicans see an opening to deliver Michigan for Mr. Trump in November and to win control of the Michigan House, a goal that could be helped by newly redrawn legislative maps in the Detroit area. All 110 Michigan House seats are up for election in November, including the two seats that were contested on Tuesday.\nBefore losing their House majority last year, Michigan Democrats raced through a list of longstanding policy goals that had been stymied during decades of divided government or Republican control of the state. In the span of several months in 2023, Ms. Whitmer and legislative Democrats enacted new gun laws, codified civil rights for L.G.B.T.Q. people, solidified abortion rights and undid Republican laws that they said weakened labor unions.\nThose efforts slowed in November after one House member, Kevin Coleman, was elected mayor of Westland and another, Lori M. Stone, was elected mayor of Warren. Under Michigan law, Mr. Coleman and Ms. Stone had to resign from the Legislature when they became mayor.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The Biden administration was growing closer to Saudi Arabia, Iran's biggest rival for power. Israel, Iran's longtime enemy, had signed a diplomatic deal during the Trump administration with Bahrain, Morocco and the U.A.E.

Israel, Iran's longtime enemy, had signed a diplomatic deal during the Trump administration with Bahrain, Morocco and the U.A.E.

Israel's massive military response focused global attention on the plight of Palestinians \u2014 a subject that tends to isolate Israel.

Voir dire is the part of jury selection in which lawyers directly question potential jurors, trying to detect any beliefs or biases that could help or harm their cases.\nJoshua Steinglass, a prosecutor with the Manhattan district attorney's office, quickly mentioned the elephant in the room (an appropriate metaphor, it would seem, for the presumptive Republican nominee for president).\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

In recent months, it has suffered its worst losses since seizing power in a coup in 2021.\nMs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who was deposed in the coup and is still widely revered in the country, is serving a 27-year sentence on corruption and other charges. Rights groups and supporters say the charges were trumped up and meant to keep the Nobel Peace laureate from elected office.Kim Aris, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's younger son, said he believes the junta could use his mother as a potential 'bargaining chip.'\n'As the fighting is getting closer and closer' to the capital, he said, 'they are getting more desperate and trying to put things in place that might protect them a little bit.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

And like many Democrats, he is nervous about Biden's current level of support among some core Democratic constituencies.\nBut Tulchin is warning any Democrat who will listen about one particular thing they might not have thought of: the possibility that Robert F.

He recently presented those findings to a consortium of Democratic groups and super PACs.\n'I'm raising the alarm,' Tulchin said in an interview.\nTulchin's concern is basically this: Latinos and younger voters, who flocked to Sanders, an independent, in the 2020 Democratic primary, were never that into Biden in the first place. Sure, they sided strongly with Biden in the general election. But, as Tulchin put it, 'they weren't enthused.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

When he turned up decades ago for a first date with the woman who would become his wife and the country's first lady, her gut reaction was, 'This is never going to work, not in a million years.'\nDressed in a sports coat and loafers, Joe Biden was too dapper for someone who had previously gone out with men in T-shirts and clogs.\nThey worked it out. And the future president stuck to his style. It was one that sometimes skewed Gatsby, for which in 1974 Washingtonian magazine noted his penchant for pinstripe suits and tasseled loafers when citing him as one of the best dressed men in the Senate. It was one that was sometimes too high-toned for its setting. In 1979, Mr. Biden, then a second-term senator, exuded confidence in a 'tailored suit and expensive tie' for a campus speech at the University of Alabama, The New Yorker later reported.\nIt was one that, on occasion, even threatened to upstage the boss. Yes, it must have been flattering to be praised by The Chicago Tribune as the 'best-dressed guy' at Bill Clinton's 2000 State of the Union address. Politically, however, it was not the best look.\nStill, dapper cred has stood President Biden in good stead. When Donald J. Trump, now 77, derides his 81-year-old opponent as doddering Uncle Joe, he is missing a point any tailor would be happy to clarify. There is getting old, and there is looking old. To avoid having your clothes add unnecessary years, make style your friend.\n'Joe Biden's style is timeless and doesn't have any expiration date,' the designer Todd Snyder said recently.

Putin could cooperate with the West on critical security issues and help constrain a disruptive regime in a volatile region.\nA lot has changed in the subsequent nine years. China and Russia are now more aligned with Iran's 'Axis of Resistance' to an American-led order, along with the likes of North Korea. When President Biden gathered the leaders of six nations for a video call from the White House on Sunday to plot a common strategy for de-escalating the crisis between Israel and Iran, there was no chance of getting anyone from Beijing or Moscow on the screen.\nThe disappearance of that unified front is one of the many factors that make this moment seems 'particularly dangerous,' said Vali Nasr, an Iranian-born professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, 'maybe the most dangerous in decades.'\nBut it is hardly the only one.\nPresident Donald J. Trump's decision to pull out of the Obama-era nuclear deal triggered a predictable counterreaction from Tehran, and after a long pause, Iran resumed enriching uranium \u2014 some to near-bomb-grade quality. Today it is far closer to producing a bomb than it was when the accord was in effect.\nIran has moved forward with its ballistic missile programs, and some of those weapons were used against Israel this weekend.

The police hurried to extinguish the flames, but officials said his injuries were grave, and he was being treated at a hospital burn unit.\nThe fire just a block or two from the courthouse appeared calculated to draw widespread attention, horrifying bystanders and temporarily overshadowing the momentous trial of a former president.\nBut a closer look at the path the man had traveled to this moment of self-destruction revealed a recent spiral into volatility, one marked by a worldview that had become increasingly confusing and disjointed \u2014 and appeared to be unattached to any political party. His social media postings and arrest records suggest the immolation stemmed instead from a place of conspiracy theories and paranoia.\nUntil last summer, Mr. Azzarello seemed to have lived a relatively quiet life. After high school, where he was a member of a bowling team, he graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2009, with degrees in anthropology and public policy.\nAs a student at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., where he received a master's degree in city and regional planning in 2012, he was known for leaving supportive Post-it notes for classmates in the hallways and for his karaoke performances of Frank Sinatra and Disney tunes, said a former classmate, Katie Brennan.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

In presenting the warning, NPR said that Mr. Berliner had failed to clear his work for outside outlets, adding that he would be fired if he violated the policy again.\nMr. Berliner's essay was published last week in The Free Press, a popular Substack publication.\nHe declined to comment about the suspension. NPR said it did not comment on personnel matters.\nThe revelation of Mr. Berliner's punishment is the latest aftershock to rattle NPR since Mr. Berliner published his essay. Employees at the public radio network were taken aback by Mr. Berliner's public condemnation of the broadcaster, and several have said that they no longer trust him because of his remarks. Mr. Berliner told The New York Times last week that he did not reach out to the network before publishing his essay.\nAfter Mr. Berliner's essay was published, NPR's new chief executive, Katherine Maher, came under renewed scrutiny as conservative activists resurfaced a series of years-old social media posts criticizing former President Donald J. Trump and embracing progressive causes.

The ruling infuriated supporters of abortion rights and presented a grave political threat to Republicans, who narrowly control both houses of the State Legislature.\nDemocrats' immediate attempts to repeal the ban failed last week. A Republican member of the House had sided with Democrats and put forward a measure to repeal it, but G.O.P. leadership adjourned, delaying any action for a week since the Legislature currently meets only on Wednesdays.\nAs a second attempt at repeal looms, both parties are scrambling to count votes and game out legislative strategies to determine whether Democrats have found enough Republican support to strike down the law.\nFormer President Donald J. Trump last week called on legislators to 'act immediately to remedy what has happened,' as Democrats slammed the ban as another sign of Republican extremism in a pivotal state in this fall's election. The ban allows only an exception to save the life of the mother. Doctors prosecuted under the law could face fines and prison terms of two to five years.\nDemocrats likely need only two or three Republicans to vote with them to repeal the law. Activists and lobbyists have jockeyed behind the scenes to sway \u2014 or hold \u2014 the handful of Republican lawmakers whose actions could determine the law's fate. A variety of procedural elements could also disrupt a repeal's chance of advancing. If the House is able to pass a repeal, it is expected to head to the Senate later on Wednesday.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

But her grilling of the presidents of Harvard, University of Pennsylvania and M.I.T. at a December hearing became a defining moment.\nMs. Stefanik pressed the leaders to say whether students would violate their universities' codes of conduct if they called for the genocide of Jews. Their dispassionate, lawyerly answers about context and free speech set off a firestorm that ultimately helped cost two of them, Claudine Gay of Harvard and Elizabeth Magill of the Penn, their jobs.\nThe exchange also helped win Ms. Stefanik widespread attention and rare plaudits from grudging liberals, who typically revile her for embracing former President Donald J. Trump and his lies about the 2020 election. On Wednesday, she was named one of Time's 100 most influential people of 2024.\nMs. Stefanik is a graduate of Harvard herself.

Both parties are racing to define him.","summary":"The prospect of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. threatening to upend the presidential race went from an idea to a reality in one of the country's most consequential battlegrounds on Thursday, when Mr. Kennedy qualified for the ballot in Michigan.\nThe decision by the Natural Law Party to grant Mr. Kennedy its ballot line in November ensures he will be a factor in a pivotal swing state where the presidential election is expected to be incredibly close and where President Biden has already shown vulnerability with key Democratic constituencies. During Michigan's primary in February, a protest movement over Mr. Biden's support for Israel's war in Gaza drew significant support.\nMr. Kennedy, a lifelong Democrat and the scion of perhaps the nation's most famous Democratic family, is running as an independent in 2024 and polling higher in early surveys than any third-party candidate since Ross Perot, the self-funding billionaire who ran in the 1990s.\nHis independent candidacy has earned him the estrangement of his own family \u2014 who campaigned this week with Mr. Biden in Pennsylvania \u2014 and many of his previous colleagues from the environmental movement, who denounced his candidacy publicly on Friday.\nMr. Kennedy has emerged as a leading voice of vaccine skepticism, both before and after Covid-19 vaccine, and dabbled in conspiratorial theories, including about the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, his father. He had initially declared his 2024 campaign as a Democratic challenger to Mr. Biden \u2014 and was heavily featured in conservative media \u2014 until he switched last fall to run as an independent.\nBoth parties are already rushing to define Mr. Kennedy as he races to get on the ballot nationwide.\nBrian Hughes, an adviser to Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, called Mr. Kennedy 'a leftist and liberal with a history of supporting an extreme environmental agenda that rivals Joe Biden for its ability to kill American jobs.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The move was a nod to ultraconservatives who have demanded that the speaker not advance aid to Ukraine without securing sweeping concessions from Democrats on immigration policy.\nThe legislative package Mr. Johnson is trying to advance roughly mirrors the $95 billion aid bill the Senate passed two months ago with aid to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and other American allies, but he has proposed breaking that package into three pieces that would be voted on individually. There would be a fourth vote on a separate measure containing other policies popular among Republicans, including conditioning Ukraine aid as a loan and a measure that could lead to a nationwide TikTok ban.\nMr. Johnson said the text of the legislative package would be released later Wednesday.\nThe multipart plan has been painstakingly structured to cobble together just enough support from Democrats and mainstream Republicans to pass over the opposition of the hard right to funding for Ukraine funding and left-wing Democrats who do not support unfettered aid for Israel. If all four pieces passed the House, they would then be folded into a single bill for the Senate to take up, in an effort to ensure that senators could not cherry-pick pieces to approve or reject.\nIts success will require everything to go right for Mr. Johnson this week to prevail.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Minutes before the vote on assistance for Kyiv, Democrats began to wave small Ukrainian flags on the House floor, as hard-right Republicans jeered.\nThe legislation includes $60 billion for Kyiv; $26 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza; and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific region. It would direct the president to seek repayment from the Ukrainian government of $10 billion in economic assistance, a concept supported by former President Donald J. Trump, who had pushed for any aid to Kyiv to be in the form of a loan. But it also would allow the president to forgive those loans starting in 2026.\nIt also contained a measure to help pave the way to selling off frozen Russian sovereign assets to help fund the Ukrainian war effort, and a new round of sanctions on Iran. The Senate is expected to pass the legislation as early as Tuesday and send it to President Biden's desk, capping its tortured journey through Congress.\n'Our adversaries are working together to undermine our Western values and demean our democracy,' Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said Saturday as the House debated the measure.

Don't let that stop the reader of this thorough, compassionate biography by Susan Page: It's a valuable document, sobering where 'Audition' aimed for sassy.\nIf anything, the 16 long years between autobiography and biography endow the two books, taken together, with a memento mori gravitas for any student of Walters, or of television journalism, or of the past, present and future of women in the TV workplace \u2014 or, for that matter, of Monica Lewinsky. More on her in a moment.\nWalters called her autobiography 'Audition' to emphasize the need she always felt to prove herself, pushing her way to professional success in a world that never made it easy for her. Nearly 80 then and still in the game, she acknowledged that personal contentment \u2014 love, marriage, meaningful family connections \u2014 lagged far behind. She wrote of being the daughter of an erratic father, who bounced \u2014 sometimes suicidally \u2014 between flush times and financial failure as a nightclub owner and impresario.\nShe told of her fearful mother, and of the mentally disabled older sister to whose welfare she felt yoked. She wrote of the three unsatisfying marriages, and of her strained relationship with the daughter she adopted as an infant.\nShe breezily acknowledged the ease she felt throughout her life with complicated men of elastic ethics like Roy Cohn and Donald Trump. She leaned into her reputation as a 'pushy cookie.'\nPage, the Washington bureau chief of USA Today, who has also written books about Barbara Bush and Nancy Pelosi, tells many of the same stories. ('Audition' is an outsize presence in the endnotes.) But in placing the emphasis on all the rule-breaking Barbara Jill Walters had to do over her long life \u2014 she died in 2022 at 93 \u2014 the biographer pays respect to a toughness easy to undervalue today, when the collective memory may see only the well-connected woman with the instantly recognizable (thanks to Gilda Radner's 'SNL' impression) speech impediment.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Kennedy Jr.'s independent bid, and its desire to discredit him.","summary":"The elaborate rollout of a Kennedy family endorsement of President Biden on Thursday \u2014 talk-show interviews, a campaign event with the president, door-knocking by Kennedys across Philadelphia \u2014 was the most powerful sign yet of rising concern in the Biden camp that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s independent White House bid presents a serious threat to the president's re-election prospects.\nMembers of this prominent Democratic family, including most of Mr. Kennedy's siblings, had already signaled their support for Mr. Biden's re-election. Mr. Kennedy's estrangement from much of his family had grown increasingly apparent over the years, as he became a leading spokesman against Covid vaccines and promoted conspiratorial theories about the 1968 assassination of his father, Robert F. Kennedy.\nBut this was the first time Mr. Biden's campaign had been so aggressively involved in promoting the Kennedys' strong support for the president, making an open push to discredit any enduring Democratic credentials Robert F. Kennedy Jr. carries because of his family name.\nAfter leaving the work to outside liberal groups, the Biden campaign has now joined the effort to define Mr. Kennedy beyond the gauzy memory of his father and two uncles, who for many members of Mr. Biden's fraying coalition, including Black voters, Latinos and blue-collar workers, continue to symbolize Democratic politics in America.\nDemocratic worries about Mr. Kennedy have grown as he has turned up his attacks on the preisdent and worked to win ballot lines in critical battleground states. Michigan election officials announced on Thursday that he had secured a spot as a member of a little-known third party.\n'I can only imagine how Donald Trump's outrageous lies and behavior would horrify my father, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who proudly served as attorney general of the United States, and honored his pledge to uphold the law and protect the country,' Kerry Kennedy, one of the independent presidential candidate's siblings, said as she stood next to Mr. Biden, addressing about 150 people at a recreation center gym in Philadelphia. 'Daddy stood for equal justice, for human rights and freedom from want and fear. Just as President Biden does today.'\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Four months ago, the same congressional committee questioned the presidents of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and M.I.T. about similar allegations. After that hearing, the presidents of the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard stepped down, in part because of blowback over their responses.\nLawmakers will also have much more material to work with this time. Since the earlier hearing, Columbia's campus has been host to heated protests related to the war, and the school has become the target of criticism by both pro-Israel groups and supporters of Palestinians over how it has handled them. The committee, led by Representative Virginia Foxx, a Republican of North Carolina, has also received roughly 4,000 pages of internal information from Columbia related to the antisemitism investigation, a committee spokesman said.\nDr. Shafik, an Egyptian-born economist who started in her job last July, will be flanked by the co-chairs of Columbia's board of trustees: Claire Shipman, a journalist and author, and David Greenwald, a corporate attorney.

Politicians in both parties call the app a threat to national security. But its reach is felt most acutely in our culture. Since it first arrived in the United States in 2018 (after merging with another app), its 15-second gulps of entertainment have become a fixture in the lives of tens of millions of Americans \u2014 including those who've never opened the app.\nThe engine that powers this juggernaut is TikTok's recommendation algorithm, which figures out what users like and populates a customized feed of addictive videos. It's called the For You Page, or FYP. It was not built to connect people with friends, the way Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat were. It was built to entertain.\nAs the app fights the most serious threat yet to its autonomy, my colleagues and I explored the ways that its innovation has reshaped American lives. In today's newsletter, I'll spotlight a few of them.\nHollywood. The film industry at first ignored and feared TikTok. But it eventually embraced the platform as a marketing tool for a new generation of moviegoers. The Sony romantic comedy 'Anyone But You' drew a weak $8 million in ticket sales over Christmas weekend, my colleague Brooks Barnes, who covers Hollywood companies, writes. But 'the movie turned into a full-fledged hit ($219 million) after TikTok users (at the urging of Sony) began making videos of themselves re-enacting the credit sequence.'

For 14 percent of American adults, TikTok is a regular news source, up from 3 percent in 2020. People who don't have traditional backgrounds in journalism, akin to bloggers for the TikTok era, aggregate and share information in snappy videos. Traditional news outlets are scrambling to catch up \u2014 and fretting about accuracy and context. Organizations including The New York Times are also making short-form videos in which reporters talk to the camera about their stories, the TikTok way.\nCooking. Recipes got a makeover on TikTok, as creators depart from static images and step-by-step instructions. My colleague Becky Hughes, NYT Cooking's social media editor, writes that traditional recipes have given way to looser concepts. That has helped create trends like eggs fried in a puddle of pesto, sandwich fillings chopped into a homogenous mixture and mini pancakes served like cereal, she says. 'The most shareable recipes are the ones that you can watch once, then turn around and make \u2014 no measurements, bake times or reading needed,' she writes. 'Just dump, stir, like, follow, repeat.'\nCooking. Recipes got a makeover on TikTok, as creators depart from static images and step-by-step instructions.

Lawmakers say it's a national security threat, and that the Chinese government could lean on its owner, ByteDance, to obtain sensitive U.S. user data or influence content on the app to serve its interests.\nRoughly 170 million Americans use TikTok. That's half the population of the United States.\nRoughly 170 million Americans use TikTok. That's half the population of the United States. There's a long road of legislation, deal making and legal challenges ahead before TikTok could be forced to change ownership or even be banned. The Senate would need to pass the legislation \u2014which it may do as soon as next week, now that the House has bundled it into a foreign aid package that it is likely to vote on over the weekend. It would have to survive lawsuits from TikTok and creators. Buyers would have to clear regulatory approval. And after all that, Beijing could simply block a deal. But imagining what a United States without TikTok would look like throws into sharp relief just how much the app has worked its way into American culture.\nTikTok, which officially landed in the United States in 2018, was the most downloaded app in the country, and the world, in 2020, 2021 and 2022. It wasn't that the elements of it were so new \u2014 compelling videos from randos had long been a staple of American pop culture \u2014 but TikTok put the pieces together in a new way.\nUnlike Instagram, Facebook or Snapchat, TikTok didn't build itself around social connections. Its goal is pure, uncut entertainment. The algorithm ingested every data point it could from what users skipped, liked or shared \u2014 and spat it directly into the maddeningly habit-forming For You Page. Fans whispered reverently that it knew them better than they knew themselves.\nHere are 19 ways of understanding how TikTok became part of American life. The music America listens to, the movies it sees, what conspiracies it believes, how it can make or break a product's success, who it defines as a celebrity \u2014 all of it has been influenced by TikTok, for good and bad. Even if you've never opened the app, you've lived in a culture that exists downstream of what happens there.\nof what happens there. Insular, slow-changing Hollywood responded to TikTok's arrival in 2018 in typical fashion: complete dismissal.

We're way too busy making pictures to worry about some new short-form video app. Then came denial. (This thing is just another fad.) Next, fear. (Teenagers and young adults are never going to the movies again!)\nBut there's a plot twist: Hollywood has come to see TikTok as indispensable.\n'Anyone But You,' a Sony romantic comedy starring Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, arrived to a piddly $8 million in ticket sales over Christmas weekend. The movie turned into a full-fledged hit ($219 million) after TikTok users (at the urging of Sony) began making videos of themselves re-enacting the credit sequence.\nTikTok also served as a ticket-selling machine for 'M3gan,' a Universal-Blumhouse horror movie about a sassy robot that has spawned a new franchise; 'Wonka,' which debuted in December and collected $632 million; and the Barbenheimer box office phenomenon, otherwise known as 'Barbie,' with $1.4 billion, and 'Oppenheimer,' with about $1 billion. Rote glamour shots and insipid interviews \u2014 ye olde studio publicity tools \u2014 don't work on TikTok; users want behind-the-scenes 'realness.' Hence 'Oppenheimer' stars goofing in a hotel hallway before a premiere, and pink-clad 'Barbie' stars cavorting on the floor with puppies.\n'Now that studios have figured out how to harness TikTok, the last thing they want is for it to go dark,' said Sue Fleishman, a former Universal and Warner Bros. executive who is now a consultant. 'That would actually be a big problem.'\nRecently, V Spehar has posted TikTok videos telling viewers what they might have missed from President Biden's State of the Union address, the first 15 actions that former President Donald J.

Trump said he would take if he's re-elected in November and Caitlin Clark's WNBA starting salary. Mx. Spehar posts to more than three million followers from the handle @UnderTheDeskNews and films many clips lying on the floor, a gimmick that began as an effort to differentiate from the authoritative tone of traditional television news anchors. The style of communication has resonated enough to make Mx. Spehar a regular at White House briefings with social media influencers.\nNews aggregation and analysis accounts like Mx. Spehar's are shaping the discourse about current events in the United States, especially among young people. They're a modern version of old-school bloggers \u2014 users respond to the personal tone, and the editorializing. (Some creators have even built followings simply by reading print news articles to their followers.)\nPew Research Center has found that about one-third of 18- to 29-year-olds say they get news regularly on the platform, far outpacing people in other age groups.\nIn 2023, about 14% of American adults said they regularly got news on TikTok, compared with just 3% percent in 2020.\nIn 2023, about 14% of American adults said they regularly got news on TikTok, compared with just 3% percent in 2020. Other sites have similar draws. Roughly 16 percent of all American adults get their news from Instagram, and a similar amount from X. Far more people consume news on Facebook and YouTube.\nThe appeal of TikTok and other social sites has made mainstream outlets nervous, and has raised some concerns around accuracy and context as original reporting is funneled through other accounts. The Wall Street Journal has more than 340,000 followers on TikTok, while The New York Times has nearly 630,000 \u2014 numbers that pale in comparison with the followings of individual commentators like Mx. Spehar.\nBy Tiffany Hsu\nSeveral dentists recently took to TikTok to debunk a conspiracy theory: that toothpaste tubes were printed with secret codes signaling their true ingredients to powerful people in the know.\nSeveral dentists recently took to TikTok to debunk a conspiracy theory: that toothpaste tubes were printed with secret codes signaling their true ingredients to powerful people in the know. Their efforts garnered far fewer views than the video that offered up the theory in early January. Not counting all the times the post was referenced in videos by other TikTok users, it has been seen more than seven million times in less than three months.\nTall tales are common on TikTok, where a flimsy patchwork of assumptions and coincidences \u2014 often concerning the schemes of a nefarious echelon of elites \u2014 is illustrated by dramatic images generated by artificial intelligence and spooky musical tracks. (Other such hits include false theories that President Joe Biden rigged the Super Bowl in favor of the Kansas City Chiefs or that Justin Bieber had signaled he was a victim of PizzaGate. False allegations of voter fraud also abound.)\nAbbie Richards, a misinformation researcher who studies the TikTok ecosystem, said that such posts thrive because of the platform's potent recommendation algorithms and its low barrier to entry.\nTikTok allows users to earn money from their videos through tools such as its creator rewards program and livestream subscriptions. Conspiracy theories, which draw high engagement, are one of the most profitable categories, said Ms. Richards, a senior video producer at the liberal watchdog group Media Matters.\n'It's like candy for your brain \u2014 it tells a story that simplifies the world in a way that feels good to you,' she said.\nA quarter of American adults who use the app create 98 percent of its videos.\nA quarter of American adults who use the app create 98 percent of its videos. The toothpaste theory was promoted by two young men known for conspiratorial content, including popular posts about satanic hit men and Britney Spears. They claimed that the colored dots on toothpaste tubes correspond to all-natural, medicinal or chemical ingredients.\nThe post was quickly reposted, copied and stitched into reaction videos. Some came from dentists, who explained that the dots were actually used during the toothpaste packaging process to help guide manufacturing equipment to properly cut and seal the tubes.\nThat conspiracy theory is not new \u2014 they rarely are on TikTok. Colgate, a major toothpaste manufacturer, addressed the color patch rumor last year and said that 'as much as we love cracking secret codes, this one actually has nothing to crack because it's entirely untrue.'\nEven silly rumors, however, can spin out from TikTok into real-world harms. The baseless concerns that store-bought toothpaste tubes might hide toxic ingredients reignited recommendations to opt instead for unproven and potentially damaging homemade options.\nBy Madison Malone Kircher\nIncluding but certainly not limited to: Butter boards, sexy water, blueberry milk nails, unexpected red, lucky girl syndrome, first-time-cool syndrome, bed rotting, 75 soft, 75 cozy, bookshelf wealth, loud budgeting, broccoli freckles, strawberry makeup, glazed donut skin, latte makeup, cowboy copper hair, old money blonde, expensive brunette, orange peel theory, quiet luxury, stealth wealth, tomato girl summer, indie sleaze, coquette, looksmaxxing, male perms, vanilla girl, clean girl, soft girl, coastal grandma, coastal cowgirl, low-high visual weight makeup, sleepy-girl mocktails, fluffy coffee, shrimp tree, girl math, girl dinner, mob wife, clowncore, balletcore, Barbiecore, royalcore, corecore.\nFor the music industry , TikTok has become a potent but unpredictable promotional outlet, and a vital one in the race to mint a new hit.

Young artists like Olivia Rodrigo and Lil Nas X saw their popularity explode on the platform, and acts like Fleetwood Mac have seen decades-old songs get a boost from memes on the app. But TikTok is also the latest tech platform to draw the anger of the music industry for low royalty rates. In February, Universal Music Group, which represents artists like Ms. Rodrigo, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and Drake, withdrew the rights to its music on the app, saying that TikTok was trying to 'bully' the company to accept low terms.\nWithin days, millions of TikTok videos using music from Universal artists went mute, and since then guessing which side would blink first has become a media-business parlor game.\nLast week, however, Ms. Swift \u2014 who releases her music through Universal, but has owned the copyrights to her work since 2018 \u2014 broke ranks and put her songs back on TikTok, just ahead of the release of her next album on Friday. Now the question is, will other artists will follow.\nFor years I thought TikTok was mostly a parenting problem , and had only tangential bearing on what I cover: threats to national security. It took a while \u2014 and a lot of conversations with both tech firms and government officials \u2014 for me to become concerned about the potential that it could also pose a major problem on that front.\nFor years I thought TikTok was mostly a parenting problem, and had only tangential bearing on what I cover: threats to national security. It took a while \u2014 and a lot of conversations with both tech firms and government officials \u2014 for me to become concerned about the potential that it could also pose a major problem on that front. Not because the company's Chinese owners could figure out your dance-move preferences, but because the algorithm at the core of the app is wrapped in such mystery.\nSo what's the issue? The algorithm doesn't belong to TikTok; it is provided by engineers working for ByteDance, the Chinese company that controls the platform and develops the code in enormous secrecy in laboratories around the world, in Beijing, Singapore and Mountain View, Calif.\nThe Chinese government is intent on keeping it that way. It has issued regulations that require Beijing's regulators to grant permission before any ByteDance algorithms can be licensed to outsiders. They are unlikely to do so.\nAnd so, as long as it is written by ByteDance, and can't be picked apart on the outside, there will always be the risk that it will become a pipeline for influencing citizens, and thus voters, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways.\nSenator Mark Warner, the chairman of Senate Intelligence Committee, has noted that because TikTok has emerged as a major source of news \u2014 and because it collects data on users that the Chinese government could find useful, even crucial \u2014 it poses a serious threat, and could become 'the most powerful propaganda tool ever.'\nAt least based on what the United States has made public. The intelligence agencies have been giving closed-door briefings, but presumably there hasn't been a classified blockbuster, since there would likely be great pressure to declassify it.\nStill, we have seen waves of new influence campaigns flowing out of China \u2014 much of it aimed at nations other than the United States. While TikTok has not been at the center of those campaigns, clearly, the Chinese have learned a lot in the past few years, including from the Russians. (Researchers have also found that topics commonly suppressed in China, including about the Tibetan and Uyghur populations, appear to be unusually underrepresented on TikTok compared with Instagram.)\nThis is not a problem that would be solved by simply selling TikTok's operations to an American buyer. Sure, the bill that went through the House bans a new, Western-owned TikTok from having any 'operational relationship' with ByteDance, 'including any cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm.' Good luck with that \u2014 TikTok would no longer be TikTok.\nThe real question is whether anyone gets to look under the hood. Because to make Americans trust TikTok, the country will need an early warning system, something that will assure everyone that a technology that became popular because it generated memes and celebrates self-expression does not become a conduit for a foreign government interested in subtly influencing how we vote.\nSouthern Alamance Middle School, a public school in Graham, N.C., recently came up with a novel way to combat student distractions from social media. Or at least to curb the phenomenon that some teachers have dubbed 'Toilet TikToks.'\nSouthern Alamance Middle School, a public school in Graham, N.C., recently came up with a novel way to combat student distractions from social media. Or at least to curb the phenomenon that some teachers have dubbed 'Toilet TikToks.' The problem: Educators there noticed a spike in the number of students asking to leave class \u2014 sometimes as frequently as nine times per day \u2014 to go to the bathroom, where they made TikTok videos.\nThe solution: Administrators decided to remove the bathroom mirrors that students used to film TikToks and primp for their close-ups. They also introduced an online system that issues students digital hall passes when they want to be excused from class and that allows administrators to track students' locations. 'Since removing the mirrors,' administrators wrote in a message to parents in January, 'we have seen a drastic decrease in bathroom visits from students asking to be excused just to make videos.'\nToilettoks \u2014 a TikTok genre, dating back at least five years, in which students use school bathrooms as film sets for dance routines, lip-syncing clips or critiques of unclean lavatories \u2014 are one of the milder social media annoyances for schools.\nAcross the United States, students have also used school bathrooms as arenas to stage, film and post videos of bullying, physical assaults on schoolmates and acts of vandalism.\nIn March, Alamance-Burlington schools announced that it was joining dozens of other U.S. districts that have filed lawsuits accusing social media platforms, including TikTok, of unfairly ensnaring young people.\n'We're seeing the negative impacts of social media on our students every day,' Kristy Davis, the acting superintendent of Alamance-Burlington schools, said. 'Their well-being has to be the top priority.'\nMy favorite Instagram account is a collection of TikToks. Curated by the videographer Leia Josp\u00e9, @favetiktoks420 hunts for Gen-Z's ickiest thirst traps and bleakest acting exercises and delivers them to me in a Millennial-safe package, uploading them directly to a social network that I actually use.\nMy favorite Instagram account is a collection of TikToks.

By the time TikTok debuted, in 2017, I was already in my 30s and too old and lazy to work another app into my rotation. Instagram and Twitter were distracting enough. But now those platforms lie downstream of TikTok's creative wellspring, waiting for bits of its most popular content to drift into the open internet. TikToks float into my friends' Instagram stories, percolate into our group chats, swirl into my Twitter feed. My phone is always bleating with its outro sound effect. I rarely open TikTok, but I watch TikToks all the time.\nTikToks let loose a chaotic element into Instagram's internet mall, and they break the monotony of Twitter's boosted tech-bro threads. They stock YouTube compilations and spark Facebook debates and fuel trend pieces.\nIf TikTok were to disappear, it would feel, at least for a while, like the internet's big content spigot had been turned to a trickle. Rival platforms have tried to remake themselves in TikTok's image \u2014 building in short-form videos, algorithmic timelines and searchable sound clips \u2014 but have failed to reproduce the hypnotic energy of its perpetual discovery machine. We'd be left with a diluted version of its secret sauce.\nBut any network that hopes to capitalize on its own popularity will disrupt its product. Even as other social media platforms try to become TikTok, TikTok is trying to become them, lengthening its videos to compete with YouTube and introducing an e-commerce platform to 'drive meaningful shopping experiences' and rival Instagram. Eventually some new, inexplicably addictive platform will rise in its place. And I will rely on the kindness of some slightly younger strangers to show me what's on it.\nMuch has been said about the 'addictive design' of TikTok. But what is the social media site actually doing to our brains?\nThere is very little research looking at what goes on inside people's heads while they're using TikTok. But one small study conducted on Chinese university students used magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activity while they watched personalized TikTok videos (ones the algorithm had selected based on their past use) versus generalized ones (videos the app recommended to new users).\nThe students had greater activity in several areas of the brain, including ones associated with reward, attention and processing social information, while viewing personalized videos. In other words, the algorithm did its job.\nOther social media platforms have been shown to turn on similar brain regions. So what makes TikTok different? Some experts have proposed that it can send users into a 'flow state': the experience of being so absorbed in a task that the person loses track of time. Backing this up, one study found that TikTok users reported experiencing higher levels of flow than Instagram users.\n'Flow' is often associated with work or hobbies \u2014 activities that are challenging enough to be engaging but not frustrating. Watching videos doesn't require skill the way that many flow-inducing activities do, yet the app is able to induce the feelings of enjoyment, concentration and time distortion that are characteristic of flow \u2014 possibly because of the algorithm's immersive quality.\nIs there any more official signal that a business titan has arrived at the heart of the American social-financial-artistic-political power nexus than being invited to be an honorary host of the annual Met Gala, a.k.a.

'the party of the year'? Any more glamorous recognition than being asked to join its convener, the Vogue editor, Anna Wintour, in the Metropolitan Museum's soaring atrium as the great and the good of Hollywood, fashion, sports, Wall Street and Washington swan past? On May 6, TikTok will be lead sponsor of both the party and the museum fashion exhibition it celebrates. The company's chief executive, Shou Chew, has been named an honorary chair of this year's gala, along with the Loewe designer Jonathan Anderson, while Ms. Wintour, Zendaya, Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez and Chris Hemsworth are the event's co-chairs.\nThat placement would put TikTok firmly in the tradition of previous gala sponsors like Amazon, Instagram and Apple \u2014 tech companies bedazzled by the Old Establishment, which in turn is bedazzled by their blush of upstart cool.\nIt is an acknowledgment, if any were needed, of the prominent role the app has come to play in fashion in a mere few years.\nIt was only in 2021, after all, that Ms. Wintour was criticized for inviting TikTok stars such as Addison Rae and Dixie D'Amelio to the party \u2014 for somehow cheapening it by catering to the buzzfeed machine of the smartphone, rather than the elite. After all, not just anyone can get an invite, even if they can afford the $50,000 price tag for a seat; Ms. Wintour vets every guest, and the price of admission has to do with cultural currency even more than actual currency.\nWhich is why, of course, TikTok belongs. Despite the fact that all social media is forbidden inside the party.\nFast-forward three years, and there are more than 75 billion views associated with the #TikTokfashion hashtag; almost 500 million with #2023Gala alone. Luxury brands routinely sign up TikTok stars as brand ambassadors along with every other kind of star, hoping to access their audience (received relevance is something Vogue might be getting out of the association, too). And thus is created a virtuous \u2014 or vicious? \u2014 cycle in which TikTok feeds the gala machine, which feeds TikTok, which is the vicarious experience that has come to feed us all.\nTikTok is a motherlode of mental health content , filled with compelling first-person accounts of everything from major depression to selective mutism.

Depending on your perspective, that's either a very good thing \u2014 or concerning. Corey Basch, who analyzed 100 popular TikTok videos with the hashtag mentalhealth for a 2022 study, emerged concerned about the looping effect of the algorithm.\n'What's so important and disturbing to recognize is the downward spiral that users can get swept into,' said Dr. Basch, a professor of public health at William Paterson University. 'If one is drawn to posts related to despair and anxiety, they can easily spend hours exposed to repetitive content known as an echo chamber.'\nThe surge of content about mental health has meant that young people are more likely to self-diagnose before seeing a clinician, psychiatrists report. Diagnoses for ADHD and anxiety disorders shot up during the pandemic years, especially among young people.\nSome researchers have expressed concern about how profit motives may feed into these trends, since platforms often feature advertising from app-based mental health services, and influencers have sponsorship deals with such companies.\n'They say we can diagnose you really quick, just take this five-question quiz and we can send you a prescription in a nice little box,' said Holly Avella, a Ph.D. candidate at Rutgers University who has researched mental health and social media.\nResearchers also warn that TikTok videos can deliver misinformation. A review of literature published last year found that around one-fifth of videos mentioning cognitive behavioral therapy were inaccurate, describing it as ineffective or harmful.\nBut some users credit the app with breaking open the national conversation around mental illness.\n'You can sit there on your pedestal and pooh-pooh it all you want,' said Kate Speer, who has used her social media feeds to describe her experience of serious mental illness. TikTok is helpful for 'the very people who are struggling the most, those who don't have access to services in the real world and who might even be so disabled by mental illness that they are locked in their houses.'\nBy Michael M.

Israel's military, with the help of the United States, Britain and Jordan, shot down nearly all of the drones and missiles that Iran fired on Saturday, in what was believed to be the first direct Iranian attack on Israel after years of a shadow war. Life largely returned to normal in Israel on Sunday, and there were indications that the military would not seek to immediately retaliate against Iran, even as tensions remained high in the region. Iranian officials also appeared to signal that its operation against Israel was over. Israel's war cabinet concluded a meeting on Sunday evening without deciding how to respond to Iran's assault, according to an official briefed on the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks more freely. By nightfall, the military had yet to detail possible options, the official said.\nIn public, Israeli ministers appeared divided over how to respond. Benny Gantz, a centrist minister and one of three voting members of the war cabinet, said that Israel should exact a price from Iran, but only 'in a way and at a time that suits us.'

Israeli military analysts are divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza. Credit...Within moments of Israel and its allies shooting down a fusillade of Iranian missiles and drones this weekend, many began wondering what the latest exchange between Israel and Iran would mean for the war in the Gaza Strip. The Iranian attack was retaliation for what was widely believed to be an Israeli strike this month on an embassy building in Damascus that killed seven Iranian officials, including three top commanders in Iran's armed forces. But it occurred against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel is battling Hamas, a militant group funded and armed by Iran. Israeli military analysts were divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza, now in its sixth month. The next fulcrum in that war could hinge on whether Israel decides to pursue Hamas in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have fled amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis. Some analysts argued that the implications for Gaza would depend on whether Israel responded with a major counterattack against Iran. Others contended that Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip would be unaffected. Shlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and a former director of the Israeli military's strategic planning division, said that if Israel responds with substantial force to the Iranian attack, it could spark a multifront war that would compel the Israeli leadership to move its attention away from Gaza. In the case of a significant regional conflagration, General Brom said, Israel might choose to delay its plans to invade Rafah, which Israeli officials describe as the last Hamas stronghold. 'It's not comfortable for us to have simultaneous, high-intensity wars in multiple theaters,' General Brom added. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to send ground forces into Rafah, despite international pressure to back off the operation. On Sunday, an Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that the Iranian attack would have no effect on the military's plan to invade Rafah. A large-scale direct confrontation with Iran could potentially bring the war in Gaza to a close, General Brom said. But for the war to end in such a way, it would require a broader cease-fire that encompassed several parties, including Israel, Iran and the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. 'There's an idea that in order to resolve a crisis, the situation first needs to become worse,' he said, explaining that an escalation followed by a comprehensive cease-fire with Iran might incline that country to push its regional proxies to stop fighting with Israel. While the members of Israel's war cabinet did not issue a formal statement after meeting on Sunday, a separate Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, indicated that the country would respond to the Iranian assault \u2014 although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how. Other military experts, however, dismissed the link between the Iranian attack and the war in Gaza. 'There's no connection at all,' said Amos Gilead, a retired major general who served in Israeli military intelligence. General Gilead said that Israel's army had enough resources to fight against Iran and continue to wage war against Hamas in Gaza. Others analysts made a similar point, arguing that the resources needed to fight Iran were different from those needed in Gaza. Israel needs fighter jets and air defense systems to counter Iran, they said. In contrast, they added, the army mainly requires ground troops, drones, and attack helicopters to fight Hamas in Gaza. 'There's no real tension between these two things,' said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel's National Security Council. Still, General Eiland said that the success of the coalition that repelled the Iranian attack, which included the United States, Britain and Jordan, could inspire Israel to take advantage of the momentum to overcome its declining status internationally by ending the war in Gaza. Though the United States, Israel's closest ally, has broadly supported Israel's decision to go to war in Gaza, it has increasingly signaled its displeasure over the mounting death toll and warned against a major ground assault in Rafah. The support the United States provided Israel on Sunday in shooting down Iranian drones and missiles could give it more leverage over its Israeli counterparts. While General Eiland said such an outcome could help Israel develop good will in the international community and contribute to reaching a solution to end the war in Gaza and skirmishes with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, he was doubtful that Mr. Netanyahu would purse such a path. 'He says he wants to achieve \u2018total victory' in Gaza and conquer Rafah, a process that could last two or three months,' he said, referring to the prime minister. 'It's clear Netanyahu has a different mind-set and priorities.' Aaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

Credit... Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, with diplomats urging restraint by all parties to prevent conflict in the region from escalating. The brazen attack this weekend, when Iran launched a barrage of drones and missiles in retaliation for Israel's attacking its embassy compound in Syria earlier in the month, was the first time Iran had launched open attacks against Israel from its soil. The attack has unnerved a region already roiling in conflict, raising concerns among diplomats and U.N. officials that a new, potentially wide and destructive war could spark if both sides don't stand down. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the Secretary General of the U.N., told the Council that it was 'time to step back from the brink,' and that its members, as well as the United Nations at large, had the collective responsibility 'to actively engage all parties concerned to prevent further escalation.' The meeting on Sunday was convened at the request of Israel. The Council has not collectively issued a statement condemning Iran's attack, and it has also not issued a statement condemning Israel's attack on Iran's embassy in Damascus that killed several senior commanders. All 15 members of the Council must reach a consensus for a statement to be issued and none was reached on both issues. The Security Council is one of the few venues where adversaries engaged in conflict come face to face and sit in the same chamber. On Sunday, both Israel and Iran's ambassadors were present and delivered fiery comments about the other's country, blaming each other for actions they both called terrorism. Gilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador, said Iran's attack had 'crossed every red line' and Israel reserved the right to retaliate. Mr. Erdan called for the Council to take severe action against Iran, including 'crippling' sanctions and statements of condemnation. 'The fact that Israel's air defense proved to be superior does not change the brutality of Iran's attack,' he said. Iran's ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, said his country had an 'inherent right to self-defense' after Israel's attack on its diplomatic compound. Mr. Iravani said that Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region,' but that if its interests, people or national security came under attack it would 'respond to any such threat or aggressions vigorously and in accordance with international law.' The United States and Iran both said that they do not seek war with one another, but that if one attacks the other's interests, there would be a defensive response. Robert A. Wood, a U.S. representative to the U.N., told the Security Council that the 'U.S. is not seeking escalation, our actions have been defensive in nature,' and said the U.S. goal was to 'de-escalate' and then get back to securing an end to the conflict in Gaza. Mr. Wood said the U.S. planned to bring further action on Iran at the Council and called on the Council to unequivocally condemn Iran's actions. Any resolution against Iran put forth by the U.S. at the Council would likely be vetoed by Russia and China, two of Iran's close allies, who sharply criticized Israel for what they said was reckless violation of international law when it attacked Iran's embassy compound. 'What happened in the night of the 14th of April did not happen in a vacuum,' said Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's ambassador to the U.N. China's ambassador, Dai Bing, called on the Council to 'exercise maximum calm and restraint' and said the implementation of an immediate cease-fire is the 'top priority.' Israel has said that the embassy compound was a legitimate military target because senior commanders from Iran's Quds Forces, the external branch of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, were holding a meeting inside the building.

Ramadan Abed/Reuters As thousands of displaced Palestinians attempted to return to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, Israeli troops fired at the crowd, forcing people to turn back in panic, according to an emergency worker and two people who tried to make the journey. Wafa, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency, reported that five people were killed and 23 wounded by Israeli gunfire and artillery in the incident on Al-Rashid Street south of Gaza City as a crowd of Gazans headed north to their homes. The circumstances of the deaths could not be confirmed independently, and the Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions about whether its forces opened fire on Palestinian civilians trying to cross to northern Gaza. For months, the Israeli military has barred Palestinians who have been displaced by the war in Gaza from returning to their homes in northern Gaza. It has become a sticking point in negotiations between Israel and Hamas. It was not clear why some Palestinians believed that Israel would not block them from returning on Sunday. But they were making the journey on a day when Iran had launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel. More than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its assault there in October, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. The assault occurred in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people. On Sunday morning Jamila Ibrahim, 39, said that she began hearing of some Palestinians who left early and managed to get back to the north. She later spoke with friends who were able to return north. But there were very few. Around 10:30 a.m. she and her three children \u2014 who are between 10 and 17 \u2014 set out, joining other people on the journey. She said there were no official notices from the Israel military, which has occupied large parts of Gaza after it launched a ground invasion, that residents would be allowed to return to their homes. It was just based on word of mouth, as well as people seeing others leaving and being encouraged to join the trek home, she said. 'Some people were scared, they didn't know what fate they were heading to, they didn't know what would happen,' she said. 'Some were happy that they were going to return.' Most people were on foot \u2014 carrying what little food they had or their few belongings in bags and luggage \u2014 and some paid large sums of money to go by car, trucks or donkey carts, she said. But they all took the same seaside road, heading north toward an Israeli checkpoint that has cut off southern Gaza from the north. 'There was lots of tension, lots of tension among the people, they were scared they could be shot,' she said. Those who tried to cross north in the middle of the night \u2014 around 4 a.m. \u2014 managed to make it to the north, she said, based on her conversation with friends who crossed successfully. But later that morning, by the time she and other displaced Palestinians tried to follow, Israeli forces opened fire on them, she said. 'Around 12:30 the Israelis started shooting,' she said. Mazen Al-Harazeen, a first responder in Gaza, said Israeli forces fired weapons and he did not know how many had been killed, but he said, 'There was shooting and martyrs.' Early Sunday morning, Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces, or I.D.F., wrote on social media that the rumors that the army was allowing residents to return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip were false. 'The I.D.F. will not allow the return of residents,' he added. 'For your safety, do not approach the forces operating there.' Nearly 2 million Gazans have been displaced by the war between Hamas and Israel, now in its sixth month. One of their biggest concerns is when and if they will be allowed to return to their homes, or whether they will be permanently displaced, as previous generations were. Around 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes in 1947 and 1948 during the wars surrounding Israel's establishment as a state. Bilal Shbair contributed reporting.

At Amina al-Hasoni's house in the village of al-Fur'ah, Israel, the Iranian attack wounded her and ripped holes in the roof and floor. Credit... Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times The hospital waiting room was quiet on Sunday: There was no crowd of relatives, no flood of patients. Israel's air defenses had just fended off a large-scale Iranian attack, with only one serious casualty recorded. But there was no sense that a crisis had been averted outside the pediatric intensive care unit at Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel's city of Beersheba. Instead, tension filled the air until the doors to the ward swung open and a gasping mother stumbled out, her face contorted. Then raw emotion quickly took its place as she crumbled into a chair, crying. While Israel suffered little in the way of significant damage overnight, this one family was dealt a devastating blow. Amina al-Hasoni, 7, was clinging to life \u2014 the sole serious casualty of the Iranian barrage. And were it not for systemic inequities in Israel, her relatives said, maybe she too could have been spared. There are roughly 300,000 Arab Bedouins in the Negev desert. About a quarter of them live in villages that are not recognized by Israeli officials. Without state recognition, those communities have long suffered from a lack of planning and basic services like running water, sewers and electricity. And few have access to bomb shelters, despite repeated requests to the state. The Hasoni family lives in one such community, sharing a hilltop in the Negev village of al-Fur'ah with a plot of disconnected houses. When rocket warning sirens went off on Saturday night, Amina's uncle Ismail said he felt stuck \u2014 there was nowhere to go. Booms overhead signaled air defenses intercepting missiles before there was a big explosion. Then he heard a woman screaming \u2014 his sister \u2014 and 'I started running,' he said. Ismail, 38, found his sister outside her house holding Amina, who was bleeding from the head. Her family had decided to flee the rockets, running out the front door. But Amina, who slept in a back room with pink walls covered in painted butterflies, didn't make it. A missile fragment ripped through the home's thin metal roof, shearing a hole with sharp metallic edges. It made impact just in front of the door \u2014 which is where Amina was knocked unconscious. 'I think it hit her while she was running away,' Ismail said. He said he took the injured Amina from his sister and lifted the girl into his own arms. Ismail then tracked down a car that raced her toward the hospital, more than 40 minutes away on a rutted, winding road that fades out in some places, with camels crossing in others. Only then, with Amina on her way, did he go inside the house, where he said he saw a large, black piece of shrapnel about the size of a pretzel jar. And 'there was blood,' he said, a puddle that had turned into a stream across the tile floor, to the front door. By Sunday afternoon, the orange patterned tiles had been cleaned. None of the dozen or so relatives there could say who had done it, only that 'it was bad for the children to see' all the blood. But Ismail hasn't gone back inside. 'It's difficult,' he said, his jeans and boots still spattered with blood. Not far from where he sat, a pink Minnie Mouse blanket and a small black-and-white girl's dress hung on a family clothesline. 'We could have built shelters here,' Ismail added. He dismissed any suggestions that what happened to Amina was bad luck. 'It's part of a policy,' he said. 'We can't do anything.' The missile fragment that tore into Amina's home was one of more than 150 collected in the area on Sunday by police bomb disposal teams, and the family said officers had taken away the piece that hit their home. The teams combed the desert for hours, searching for debris and carting away huge hunks of twisted metal \u2014 efforts repeated across Israel. The Hasoni home is not far from a military base, Nevatim, that was reportedly a target of the Iranian assault and that Israeli officials said was lightly damaged. That is little consolation to Amina's father, Muhammad, who spent the morning at the hospital taking turns at her bedside. He didn't say much to her, he said, and just repeated her name. Amina \u2014 the youngest of his 14 children \u2014 'likes to laugh and have fun all the time,' said Muhammad, 49. She's a good student with a 'strong personality,' he added, who doesn't always listen to instructions. And she loves to draw. He called Iran's actions 'inhumane.' 'May God demolish them,' he said, without hesitation.

Erdan called for the Council to take severe action against Iran, including sanctions and statements of condemnation. 'The fact that Israel's air defense proved to be superior does not change the brutality of Iran's attack,' he said.

Tomer Neuberg/Associated Press After convening a virtual meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, Group of 7 leaders adopted a joint declaration that reaffirmed their 'full solidarity and support to Israel' and accused Iran of having risked 'provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation' that must be avoided. Iran's attack, which appeared to have been mostly intercepted by Israel and its allies, was carried out in retaliation for Israeli attacks on an Iranian Embassy building in Syria earlier this month. Iranian leaders have signaled that their retaliation is over unless they are attacked again. The joint declaration from the leaders of G7 nations \u2014 Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, as well as the European Union \u2014 demanded that 'Iran and its proxies cease their attacks.' The leaders said they were ready 'to take further measures now and in response to further destabilizing initiatives.' Hoping to head off Israel from further escalating the conflict, President Biden privately advised Israel against firing back on Iran, U.S. officials said on Sunday. It was not yet clear how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his government would respond. Leaders of the European Union have publicly urged restraint from both countries as they, too, condemned Iran's actions. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, called the attack 'blatant and unjustifiable,' adding that 'all actors must now refrain from further escalation.' Charles Michel, president of the European Council, said that the condemnation from G7 leaders was unanimous and that 'all parties must exercise restraint.' 'Ending the crisis in Gaza as soon as possible, notably through an immediate cease-fire, will make a difference,' Mr. Michel added.

It was not immediately clear what the group had decided about possibly responding to Iran's overnight strikes. Demonstrators gather at Palestine Square in Tehran on Sunday. Credit... Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times Many Iranians stayed glued to their television screens and phones Saturday night, anxiously following updates as their country launched a military attack on Israel and fearing a wider war that would only add to the country's current economic upheaval. In Tehran and several other big cities, lines of cars stretched a mile or more outside gas stations in the middle of the night. Some parents kept their children home from school on Sunday. Tehran's airport closed down, and will remain that way until at least Monday morning. Iranians living inside the country said in interviews that they were worried the confrontation with Israel would spiral out of control and hoped both sides would avoid escalating the conflict. Soheil, a 37-year-old engineer in Isfahan who, like several other Iranians, asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution, said all he and his colleagues could talk about at work on Sunday was the prospect of a broader conflict. 'I'm afraid of war,' he said. 'It will have a great impact on our daily lives, especially on the economy and the price of dollar, and the anxiety will affect our mental health.' Since a strike two weeks ago on the Iranian Embassy complex in Syria that killed three top military commanders, Iran's currency, the rial, has fallen sharply against the U.S. dollar, shrinking purchasing power as Iran's leaders vowed to respond. Nafiseh, a 36-year-old high school teacher in Tehran, said that many of her students did not attend school on Sunday because parents were worried about counterattacks from Israel. 'It's all everyone is talking about, from teenagers to teachers and family members, it's all about the war and attacks,' she said. Supporters of the government hailed the attacks as Iran's showcasing its military might to defend itself on Saturday, with several hundred gathering in Tehran's Palestine Square to celebrate with fireworks and chants of 'Death to Israel.' A large mural on the square depicted Iranian missiles with a message written in Farsi and Hebrew that read, 'Next time the slap will be harder.' On Sunday night, a crowd formed again in the square, carrying signs and chanting anti-Israel slogans. Others took to social media to say they would fight for their country unconditionally if Iran were to go to war. 'When a foreign enemy is involved, honor means standing with our country even at the cost of our lives,' Reza Rashidpour, a civil engineer, wrote on social media. 'Long live Iran, long live soldiers of Iran.' But critics of the government denounced the attacks, seeing them as a misadventure that risks harming ordinary Iranians. Many Iranians oppose government policies that include funding, arming and training groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed group that has increasingly traded fire with Israel since the Oct. 7 attacks that set off the current fighting in Gaza. In protests against the government over the past few years a recurring chant has been, 'No to Gaza, no to Lebanon, my life for Iran.' Ali, a 53-year-old veteran of the Iran-Iraq war who lives in Kerman, said the existence of the Islamic Republic depends on 'crisis.' 'Now they are exploiting the war and the crisis to survive,' he said.

'The people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating, full-scale conflict,' the U.N. secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said in opening remarks. 'Now is the time to defuse and deescalate. Now is the time for maximum restraint.' April 14, 2024, 4:36 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 4:36 p.m. ET For the Security Council to issue any statement condemning Iran's actions all of its 15 members would have to agree \u2014 a prospect that appears unlikely, given its recent lack of consensus over issuing condemnation statements on Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks and the attack on the Iranian Embassy compound in Syria, which prompted Iran's strikes.

Hannah Mckay/Reuters After many Israelis spent a long night huddled in bomb shelters, life crept back toward calm on Sunday, even as the people of Israel waited tensely to see how their government would respond to the Iranian strikes that set off rarely heard sirens in Jerusalem. Jerusalem is targeted much less frequently than border communities or the coastal metropolis of Tel Aviv, but during the assault loud booms resounded in the skies, where missiles and interceptors wove around one another like fireflies. In areas of Jerusalem with a mostly Jewish population, many crowded into public bomb shelters, some wearing pajamas and lugging sleeping bags. 'There were more people there than usual,' said Zev Palatnik, 33, who spent some of the night in his building's bomb shelter alongside his neighbors. 'There's a sense that the rockets from Iran are more sophisticated than the ones from Gaza,' he said, adding that there was a higher level of anxiety as a result. But on Sunday, a relatively steady amount of foot traffic flowed in downtown Jerusalem as Israelis returned to work. Ron Cohen, a 37-year-old engineer, said he had hoped that the Israeli government would immediately strike back at Iran, but he did not expect a significant Israeli response. 'Not much, maybe a few small things,' he said. 'Our government knows how to defend, but not how to attack.' For the Israelis among the tens of thousands forced to flee communities along the borders with Gaza and Lebanon, the assault compounded six exhausting months of war. Many expressed uncertainty over the best way for the government to respond. Gidi Lapid, who left his home in Metula, near the border with Lebanon, with his family at the beginning of the war, said Israel might be able to show strength through restrained action. But at the same time, Iranians 'should be the ones in existential dread, in bomb shelters, stocking up on food and water,' Mr. Lapid said by phone from Eliav, a small town near Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem. 'Not our peace-seeking nation.'

Although Hezbollah, Iran's most powerful regional proxy, launched rockets into the Golan Heights amid the overnight attack, it largely remained on the sidelines. April 14, 2024, 2:48 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 2:48 p.m. ET Adam Sella Reporting from Tel Aviv With much attention shifted to Iran, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an Israeli grass-roots citizens' group, reiterated its call for a deal to release the approximately 100 hostages held in Gaza. The group said in a statement that the fear and uncertainty felt by Israelis during Iran's overnight strike 'pale in comparison to the terror, dread, despair, loneliness, cold, physical and mental torment' experienced by the hostages. April 14, 2024, 2:32 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 2:32 p.m. ET Eric Schmitt Reporting from Washington American officials said U.S. fighter jets shot down more than 70 exploding drones in the attack Saturday, while two Navy warships in the eastern Mediterranean destroyed between four and six ballistic missiles and an Army Patriot battery in Iraq knocked down at least one missile that passed overhead. The more than 300 drones and missiles Iran launched was on the high end of what U.S. analysts had expected, one official said.

'We're going to try again this week,' Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday about voting on a bill to aid Israel. Credit... Kenny Holston/The New York Times Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday after Iran's overnight attack on Israel that the House would vote in the coming days on aid for Israel, and he suggested that aid for Ukraine could be included in the legislation. 'House Republicans and the Republican Party understand the necessity of standing with Israel,' Mr. Johnson said on Fox News, noting that he had previously advanced two aid bills to help the U.S. ally. 'We're going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together. Right now, we're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.' U.S. funding for both Israel and Ukraine has languished in Congress; Mr. Johnson initially refused to take up a $95 billion aid package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan passed by the Senate, and the Senate refused to take up a House Republican proposal that conditioned aid to Israel on domestic spending cuts. In recent weeks, Mr. Johnson has repeatedly vowed to ensure that the House moves to assist Ukraine. He has been searching for a way to structure a foreign aid package that could secure a critical mass of support amid stiff Republican resistance to sending aid to Kyiv and mounting opposition among Democrats to unfettered military aid for Israel. But the attacks from Iran have ratcheted up the pressure on Mr. Johnson to bring some kind of package to the floor this week, potentially forcing him to make a decision he has been agonizing over for weeks. He left it unclear on Sunday whether the legislation he said the House would advance this week would also include aid for Ukraine. Mr. Johnson said he believed that some proposals around Ukraine aid enjoyed broad support among House Republicans. He noted that he met with former President Donald J. Trump on Friday at his estate in Florida and that Mr. Trump had been supportive of conditioning the aid as a loan. 'I think these are ideas that I think can get consensus, and that's what we've been working through,' Mr. Johnson said. 'We'll send our package. We'll put something together and send it to the Senate and get these obligations completed.' Before the attacks in Israel over the weekend, Mr. Johnson had privately floated bringing up the $95 billion spending package for Ukraine and Israel passed by the Senate in February \u2014 and moving it through the House in tandem with a second bill containing policies endorsed by the conservative wing of his party. That plan envisioned two consecutive votes \u2014 one on the Senate-passed bill and another on a package of sweeteners geared toward appeasing Republicans who otherwise would be infuriated by Mr. Johnson's decision to push through a bipartisan aid package for Ukraine. Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Sunday that the two conflicts were tied together, and that he hoped they would be addressed together. 'What happened in Israel last night happens in Ukraine every night,' he said on CBS's 'Face The Nation.' Mr. McCaul said that he had previously secured a 'commitment' from Mr. Johnson that a broad national security bill would be brought to the House floor for a vote, but that the timing was unclear. 'My preference,' he said, 'is this week.' Minho Kim contributed reporting.

Iranian officials also appeared to signal that its operation against Israel was over.\nIsrael's war cabinet concluded a meeting on Sunday evening without deciding how to respond to Iran's assault, according to an official briefed on the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks more freely. By nightfall, the military had yet to detail possible options, the official said.\nIn public, Israeli ministers appeared divided over how to respond. Benny Gantz, a centrist minister and one of three voting members of the war cabinet, said that Israel should exact a price from Iran, but only 'in a way and at a time that suits us.' Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right minister, then criticized Mr. Gantz for his perceived moderation, arguing that Israel should deter Iran by going 'crazy.'\nThe Biden administration is advising Israel that it does not necessarily need to fire back at Iran, with U.S. officials saying that Israel had proved its ability to protect itself.\nIranian officials issued a series of statements that appeared designed to keep tensions from escalating further.

Israeli military analysts are divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza. Credit...Within moments of Israel and its allies shooting down a fusillade of Iranian missiles and drones this weekend, many began wondering what the latest exchange between Israel and Iran would mean for the war in the Gaza Strip.\nThe Iranian attack was retaliation for what was widely believed to be an Israeli strike this month on an embassy building in Damascus that killed seven Iranian officials, including three top commanders in Iran's armed forces. But it occurred against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel is battling Hamas, a militant group funded and armed by Iran.\nIsraeli military analysts were divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza, now in its sixth month. The next fulcrum in that war could hinge on whether Israel decides to pursue Hamas in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have fled amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis.\nSome analysts argued that the implications for Gaza would depend on whether Israel responded with a major counterattack against Iran. Others contended that Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip would be unaffected.\nShlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and a former director of the Israeli military's strategic planning division, said that if Israel responds with substantial force to the Iranian attack, it could spark a multifront war that would compel the Israeli leadership to move its attention away from Gaza.\nIn the case of a significant regional conflagration, General Brom said, Israel might choose to delay its plans to invade Rafah, which Israeli officials describe as the last Hamas stronghold.\n'It's not comfortable for us to have simultaneous, high-intensity wars in multiple theaters,' General Brom added.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to send ground forces into Rafah, despite international pressure to back off the operation. On Sunday, an Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that the Iranian attack would have no effect on the military's plan to invade Rafah.\nA large-scale direct confrontation with Iran could potentially bring the war in Gaza to a close, General Brom said. But for the war to end in such a way, it would require a broader cease-fire that encompassed several parties, including Israel, Iran and the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.\n'There's an idea that in order to resolve a crisis, the situation first needs to become worse,' he said, explaining that an escalation followed by a comprehensive cease-fire with Iran might incline that country to push its regional proxies to stop fighting with Israel.\nWhile the members of Israel's war cabinet did not issue a formal statement after meeting on Sunday, a separate Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, indicated that the country would respond to the Iranian assault \u2014 although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how.\nOther military experts, however, dismissed the link between the Iranian attack and the war in Gaza.\n'There's no connection at all,' said Amos Gilead, a retired major general who served in Israeli military intelligence.\nGeneral Gilead said that Israel's army had enough resources to fight against Iran and continue to wage war against Hamas in Gaza.\nOthers analysts made a similar point, arguing that the resources needed to fight Iran were different from those needed in Gaza. Israel needs fighter jets and air defense systems to counter Iran, they said. In contrast, they added, the army mainly requires ground troops, drones, and attack helicopters to fight Hamas in Gaza.\n'There's no real tension between these two things,' said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel's National Security Council.\nStill, General Eiland said that the success of the coalition that repelled the Iranian attack, which included the United States, Britain and Jordan, could inspire Israel to take advantage of the momentum to overcome its declining status internationally by ending the war in Gaza.\nThough the United States, Israel's closest ally, has broadly supported Israel's decision to go to war in Gaza, it has increasingly signaled its displeasure over the mounting death toll and warned against a major ground assault in Rafah. The support the United States provided Israel on Sunday in shooting down Iranian drones and missiles could give it more leverage over its Israeli counterparts.\nWhile General Eiland said such an outcome could help Israel develop good will in the international community and contribute to reaching a solution to end the war in Gaza and skirmishes with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, he was doubtful that Mr. Netanyahu would purse such a path.\n'He says he wants to achieve \u2018total victory' in Gaza and conquer Rafah, a process that could last two or three months,' he said, referring to the prime minister. 'It's clear Netanyahu has a different mind-set and priorities.'\nAaron Boxerman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.\nWhere air defense systems were seen intercepting missiles or drones Damage or other evidence of attack visible\nWhere air defense systems were seen intercepting missiles or drones Damage or other evidence of attack visible United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addresses the United Nations Security Council during an emergency meeting at U.N. headquarters on Sunday. Credit... Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss Iran's attack on Israel, with diplomats urging restraint by all parties to prevent conflict in the region from escalating.\nThe brazen attack this weekend, when Iran launched a barrage of drones and missiles in retaliation for Israel's attacking its embassy compound in Syria earlier in the month, was the first time Iran had launched open attacks against Israel from its soil. The attack has unnerved a region already roiling in conflict, raising concerns among diplomats and U.N. officials that a new, potentially wide and destructive war could spark if both sides don't stand down.\nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres, the Secretary General of the U.N., told the Council that it was 'time to step back from the brink,' and that its members, as well as the United Nations at large, had the collective responsibility 'to actively engage all parties concerned to prevent further escalation.'\nThe meeting on Sunday was convened at the request of Israel. The Council has not collectively issued a statement condemning Iran's attack, and it has also not issued a statement condemning Israel's attack on Iran's embassy in Damascus that killed several senior commanders. All 15 members of the Council must reach a consensus for a statement to be issued and none was reached on both issues.\nThe Security Council is one of the few venues where adversaries engaged in conflict come face to face and sit in the same chamber. On Sunday, both Israel and Iran's ambassadors were present and delivered fiery comments about the other's country, blaming each other for actions they both called terrorism.\nGilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador, said Iran's attack had 'crossed every red line' and Israel reserved the right to retaliate. Mr. Erdan called for the Council to take severe action against Iran, including 'crippling' sanctions and statements of condemnation.\n'The fact that Israel's air defense proved to be superior does not change the brutality of Iran's attack,' he said.\nIran's ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, said his country had an 'inherent right to self-defense' after Israel's attack on its diplomatic compound. Mr. Iravani said that Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region,' but that if its interests, people or national security came under attack it would 'respond to any such threat or aggressions vigorously and in accordance with international law.'\nThe United States and Iran both said that they do not seek war with one another, but that if one attacks the other's interests, there would be a defensive response.\nRobert A. Wood, a U.S. representative to the U.N., told the Security Council that the 'U.S. is not seeking escalation, our actions have been defensive in nature,' and said the U.S. goal was to 'de-escalate' and then get back to securing an end to the conflict in Gaza. Mr. Wood said the U.S. planned to bring further action on Iran at the Council and called on the Council to unequivocally condemn Iran's actions.\nAny resolution against Iran put forth by the U.S. at the Council would likely be vetoed by Russia and China, two of Iran's close allies, who sharply criticized Israel for what they said was reckless violation of international law when it attacked Iran's embassy compound.\n'What happened in the night of the 14th of April did not happen in a vacuum,' said Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's ambassador to the U.N.\nChina's ambassador, Dai Bing, called on the Council to 'exercise maximum calm and restraint' and said the implementation of an immediate cease-fire is the 'top priority.'\nIsrael has said that the embassy compound was a legitimate military target because senior commanders from Iran's Quds Forces, the external branch of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, were holding a meeting inside the building.\nApril 14, 2024, 7:11 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 7:11 p.m. ET Michael D.

Credit... Ramadan Abed/Reuters As thousands of displaced Palestinians attempted to return to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, Israeli troops fired at the crowd, forcing people to turn back in panic, according to an emergency worker and two people who tried to make the journey.\nWafa, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency, reported that five people were killed and 23 wounded by Israeli gunfire and artillery in the incident on Al-Rashid Street south of Gaza City as a crowd of Gazans headed north to their homes.\nThe circumstances of the deaths could not be confirmed independently, and the Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions about whether its forces opened fire on Palestinian civilians trying to cross to northern Gaza.\nFor months, the Israeli military has barred Palestinians who have been displaced by the war in Gaza from returning to their homes in northern Gaza. It has become a sticking point in negotiations between Israel and Hamas.\nIt was not clear why some Palestinians believed that Israel would not block them from returning on Sunday. But they were making the journey on a day when Iran had launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel.\nMore than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its assault there in October, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health. The assault occurred in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people.\nOn Sunday morning Jamila Ibrahim, 39, said that she began hearing of some Palestinians who left early and managed to get back to the north. She later spoke with friends who were able to return north. But there were very few.\nAround 10:30 a.m. she and her three children \u2014 who are between 10 and 17 \u2014 set out, joining other people on the journey.\nShe said there were no official notices from the Israel military, which has occupied large parts of Gaza after it launched a ground invasion, that residents would be allowed to return to their homes. It was just based on word of mouth, as well as people seeing others leaving and being encouraged to join the trek home, she said.\n'Some people were scared, they didn't know what fate they were heading to, they didn't know what would happen,' she said. 'Some were happy that they were going to return.'\nMost people were on foot \u2014 carrying what little food they had or their few belongings in bags and luggage \u2014 and some paid large sums of money to go by car, trucks or donkey carts, she said. But they all took the same seaside road, heading north toward an Israeli checkpoint that has cut off southern Gaza from the north.\n'There was lots of tension, lots of tension among the people, they were scared they could be shot,' she said.\nThose who tried to cross north in the middle of the night \u2014 around 4 a.m. \u2014 managed to make it to the north, she said, based on her conversation with friends who crossed successfully.\nBut later that morning, by the time she and other displaced Palestinians tried to follow, Israeli forces opened fire on them, she said.\n'Around 12:30 the Israelis started shooting,' she said.\nMazen Al-Harazeen, a first responder in Gaza, said Israeli forces fired weapons and he did not know how many had been killed, but he said, 'There was shooting and martyrs.'\nEarly Sunday morning, Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces, or I.D.F., wrote on social media that the rumors that the army was allowing residents to return to their homes in the northern Gaza Strip were false.\n'The I.D.F. will not allow the return of residents,' he added. 'For your safety, do not approach the forces operating there.'\nNearly 2 million Gazans have been displaced by the war between Hamas and Israel, now in its sixth month. One of their biggest concerns is when and if they will be allowed to return to their homes, or whether they will be permanently displaced, as previous generations were.\nAround 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes in 1947 and 1948 during the wars surrounding Israel's establishment as a state.\nBilal Shbair contributed reporting.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:49 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:49 p.m. ET Aaron Boxerman\nAaron Boxerman Reporting from Jerusalem While Israel's war cabinet members didn't issue a formal statement after the meeting, an Israeli official familiar with the discussions indicated that Israel would undoubtedly respond \u2014 although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how.

Credit... Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times The hospital waiting room was quiet on Sunday: There was no crowd of relatives, no flood of patients. Israel's air defenses had just fended off a large-scale Iranian attack, with only one serious casualty recorded.\nBut there was no sense that a crisis had been averted outside the pediatric intensive care unit at Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel's city of Beersheba. Instead, tension filled the air until the doors to the ward swung open and a gasping mother stumbled out, her face contorted. Then raw emotion quickly took its place as she crumbled into a chair, crying.\nWhile Israel suffered little in the way of significant damage overnight, this one family was dealt a devastating blow. Amina al-Hasoni, 7, was clinging to life \u2014 the sole serious casualty of the Iranian barrage. And were it not for systemic inequities in Israel, her relatives said, maybe she too could have been spared.\nThere are roughly 300,000 Arab Bedouins in the Negev desert. About a quarter of them live in villages that are not recognized by Israeli officials. Without state recognition, those communities have long suffered from a lack of planning and basic services like running water, sewers and electricity. And few have access to bomb shelters, despite repeated requests to the state.\nThe Hasoni family lives in one such community, sharing a hilltop in the Negev village of al-Fur'ah with a plot of disconnected houses. When rocket warning sirens went off on Saturday night, Amina's uncle Ismail said he felt stuck \u2014 there was nowhere to go.\nBooms overhead signaled air defenses intercepting missiles before there was a big explosion. Then he heard a woman screaming \u2014 his sister \u2014 and 'I started running,' he said.\nIsmail, 38, found his sister outside her house holding Amina, who was bleeding from the head. Her family had decided to flee the rockets, running out the front door. But Amina, who slept in a back room with pink walls covered in painted butterflies, didn't make it.\nA missile fragment ripped through the home's thin metal roof, shearing a hole with sharp metallic edges. It made impact just in front of the door \u2014 which is where Amina was knocked unconscious.\n'I think it hit her while she was running away,' Ismail said.\nHe said he took the injured Amina from his sister and lifted the girl into his own arms. Ismail then tracked down a car that raced her toward the hospital, more than 40 minutes away on a rutted, winding road that fades out in some places, with camels crossing in others.\nOnly then, with Amina on her way, did he go inside the house, where he said he saw a large, black piece of shrapnel about the size of a pretzel jar. And 'there was blood,' he said, a puddle that had turned into a stream across the tile floor, to the front door.\nBy Sunday afternoon, the orange patterned tiles had been cleaned. None of the dozen or so relatives there could say who had done it, only that 'it was bad for the children to see' all the blood. But Ismail hasn't gone back inside.\n'It's difficult,' he said, his jeans and boots still spattered with blood. Not far from where he sat, a pink Minnie Mouse blanket and a small black-and-white girl's dress hung on a family clothesline.\n'We could have built shelters here,' Ismail added.\nHe dismissed any suggestions that what happened to Amina was bad luck.\n'It's part of a policy,' he said. 'We can't do anything.'\nThe missile fragment that tore into Amina's home was one of more than 150 collected in the area on Sunday by police bomb disposal teams, and the family said officers had taken away the piece that hit their home. The teams combed the desert for hours, searching for debris and carting away huge hunks of twisted metal \u2014 efforts repeated across Israel.\nThe Hasoni home is not far from a military base, Nevatim, that was reportedly a target of the Iranian assault and that Israeli officials said was lightly damaged.\nThat is little consolation to Amina's father, Muhammad, who spent the morning at the hospital taking turns at her bedside. He didn't say much to her, he said, and just repeated her name.\nAmina \u2014 the youngest of his 14 children \u2014 'likes to laugh and have fun all the time,' said Muhammad, 49. She's a good student with a 'strong personality,' he added, who doesn't always listen to instructions. And she loves to draw.\nHe called Iran's actions 'inhumane.'\n'May God demolish them,' he said, without hesitation.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET Iran's ambassador to the U.N., Amir Saeid Iravani, addressed the Council after his Israeli counterpart and defended his country's actions as the 'inherent right to self-defense' in response to the attack on its diplomatic compound in Syria two weeks ago.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:38 p.m. ET Iravani said Iran 'does not seek escalation or war in the region' and has 'no intention' of engaging in conflict with the United States, but warned that it would respond proportionately if Israel or the U.S. military were to attack Iran or its interests.\nApril 14, 2024, 5:26 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 5:26 p.m. ET Israel's U.N. ambassador, Gilad Erdan, who had requested the emergency meeting of the Security Council, assailed Iran and its proxies, saying Iran had crossed every red line in its attack and that Israel reserved the right to retaliate.

Some parents kept their children home from school on Sunday. Tehran's airport closed down, and will remain that way until at least Monday morning.\nIranians living inside the country said in interviews that they were worried the confrontation with Israel would spiral out of control and hoped both sides would avoid escalating the conflict.\nSoheil, a 37-year-old engineer in Isfahan who, like several other Iranians, asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution, said all he and his colleagues could talk about at work on Sunday was the prospect of a broader conflict.\n'I'm afraid of war,' he said. 'It will have a great impact on our daily lives, especially on the economy and the price of dollar, and the anxiety will affect our mental health.'\nSince a strike two weeks ago on the Iranian Embassy complex in Syria that killed three top military commanders, Iran's currency, the rial, has fallen sharply against the U.S. dollar, shrinking purchasing power as Iran's leaders vowed to respond.\nNafiseh, a 36-year-old high school teacher in Tehran, said that many of her students did not attend school on Sunday because parents were worried about counterattacks from Israel. 'It's all everyone is talking about, from teenagers to teachers and family members, it's all about the war and attacks,' she said.\nSupporters of the government hailed the attacks as Iran's showcasing its military might to defend itself on Saturday, with several hundred gathering in Tehran's Palestine Square to celebrate with fireworks and chants of 'Death to Israel.' A large mural on the square depicted Iranian missiles with a message written in Farsi and Hebrew that read, 'Next time the slap will be harder.' On Sunday night, a crowd formed again in the square, carrying signs and chanting anti-Israel slogans.\nOthers took to social media to say they would fight for their country unconditionally if Iran were to go to war.\n'When a foreign enemy is involved, honor means standing with our country even at the cost of our lives,' Reza Rashidpour, a civil engineer, wrote on social media. 'Long live Iran, long live soldiers of Iran.'\nBut critics of the government denounced the attacks, seeing them as a misadventure that risks harming ordinary Iranians.\nMany Iranians oppose government policies that include funding, arming and training groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed group that has increasingly traded fire with Israel since the Oct. 7 attacks that set off the current fighting in Gaza.

'There's a sense that the rockets from Iran are more sophisticated than the ones from Gaza,' he said, adding that there was a higher level of anxiety as a result.\nBut on Sunday, a relatively steady amount of foot traffic flowed in downtown Jerusalem as Israelis returned to work. Ron Cohen, a 37-year-old engineer, said he had hoped that the Israeli government would immediately strike back at Iran, but he did not expect a significant Israeli response.\n'Not much, maybe a few small things,' he said. 'Our government knows how to defend, but not how to attack.'\nFor the Israelis among the tens of thousands forced to flee communities along the borders with Gaza and Lebanon, the assault compounded six exhausting months of war.

'We're going to try again this week, and the details of that package are being put together. Right now, we're looking at the options and all these supplemental issues.'\nU.S. funding for both Israel and Ukraine has languished in Congress; Mr. Johnson initially refused to take up a $95 billion aid package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan passed by the Senate, and the Senate refused to take up a House Republican proposal that conditioned aid to Israel on domestic spending cuts.\nIn recent weeks, Mr. Johnson has repeatedly vowed to ensure that the House moves to assist Ukraine. He has been searching for a way to structure a foreign aid package that could secure a critical mass of support amid stiff Republican resistance to sending aid to Kyiv and mounting opposition among Democrats to unfettered military aid for Israel.\nBut the attacks from Iran have ratcheted up the pressure on Mr. Johnson to bring some kind of package to the floor this week, potentially forcing him to make a decision he has been agonizing over for weeks.\nHe left it unclear on Sunday whether the legislation he said the House would advance this week would also include aid for Ukraine.\nMr. Johnson said he believed that some proposals around Ukraine aid enjoyed broad support among House Republicans. He noted that he met with former President Donald J. Trump on Friday at his estate in Florida and that Mr. Trump had been supportive of conditioning the aid as a loan.\n'I think these are ideas that I think can get consensus, and that's what we've been working through,' Mr. Johnson said. 'We'll send our package. We'll put something together and send it to the Senate and get these obligations completed.'\nBefore the attacks in Israel over the weekend, Mr. Johnson had privately floated bringing up the $95 billion spending package for Ukraine and Israel passed by the Senate in February \u2014 and moving it through the House in tandem with a second bill containing policies endorsed by the conservative wing of his party. That plan envisioned two consecutive votes \u2014 one on the Senate-passed bill and another on a package of sweeteners geared toward appeasing Republicans who otherwise would be infuriated by Mr. Johnson's decision to push through a bipartisan aid package for Ukraine.\nRepresentative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Sunday that the two conflicts were tied together, and that he hoped they would be addressed together. 'What happened in Israel last night happens in Ukraine every night,' he said on CBS's 'Face The Nation.'\nMr. McCaul said that he had previously secured a 'commitment' from Mr. Johnson that a broad national security bill would be brought to the House floor for a vote, but that the timing was unclear.\n'My preference,' he said, 'is this week.'\nMinho Kim contributed reporting.\nApril 14, 2024, 1:02 p.m. ET April 14, 2024, 1:02 p.m. ET Adam Sella\nAdam Sella Reporting from Tel Aviv The Israeli military said in a statement that it is calling up 'approximately two reserve brigades for operational activities on the Gaza front.'

Jim Hollander/EPA, via Shutterstock In a deeply divided Israel, even the dramatic scene above the country's skies on Sunday is open to political interpretation.\nFor supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's display of defensive technology against an Iranian salvo that included hundreds of drones and missiles proves Mr. Netanyahu has long been right to warn about the threat posed by Iran.\nHis opponents are loath to give him any credit, reserving their praise for the air force.\n'Like everything in Israel in recent years, the story is split into two narratives,' said Mazal Mualem, an Israeli political commentator for Al-Monitor, a Middle East news site, and the author of a recent biography of the Israeli leader.\n'The division and polarization in Israeli society prevents people from seeing the full picture,' Ms. Mualem added.\nIran's barrage on Sunday, launched in response to an Israeli attack on an Iranian Embassy building this month in Damascus that killed several high-ranking commanders in Iran's armed forces, came at a perilous time for Mr. Netanyahu.\nAt home, he is an unpopular leader whom many hold responsible for his government's policy and intelligence failures that led to the deadly Hamas-led attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, which prompted Israel to go to war in Gaza. Abroad, he is the focus of international censure over Israel's prosecution of that war, which has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Gazans.\nHow he ultimately emerges from this episode may depend on what happens next.\nMr. Netanyahu now must make a choice. Will he respond to Iran with a forceful counterattack and potentially entangle Israel and other countries in a broader war? Or will he absorb the attack, which gravely injured one 7-year-old girl but otherwise did limited damage, and defer to the coalition that helped defend Israel in the interests of regional stability?\nIsrael's allies have been urging restraint.\n'The question is whether Israel is going to retaliate immediately, or surprise the Iranians in one way or another,' said Efraim Halevy, who served as director of Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, during the latter part of Mr. Netanyahu's first term in the 1990s.\nNo Israeli leader has warned about Iran so consistently as Mr. Netanyahu or, for that matter, has spent so long in office. Israel's longest serving prime minister, he has been in power for about 17 years overall.\nSince his first year in office in 1996, Mr. Netanyahu warned that a nuclear Iran would be catastrophic and that time was running out. For the nearly three decades since, he has been sounding the same alarm.\nIran maintains a network of proxy militias across the region, including in Gaza, which the government funds and supplies with weapons. Some of those militias in Yemen, Syria and Lebanon have battled with Israel, creating distractions for the Israeli government and military amid the war with Hamas.\nBut perhaps more troubling, experts say, is that Iran is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon. Mr. Netanyahu's backers still credit him with having put Iran's nuclear program on the world agenda then, and they praise him now for investing in the mighty, multilayered air defense system that allowed Israel and its allies, including the United States, to intercept the vast majority of Iranian drones and missiles this weekend before they reached Israel.\nSometimes resorting to gimmicks and antics to draw attention to Iran's nuclear progress, Mr. Netanyahu has in the past made opposing Iran a key part of his global diplomacy. Once, at the United Nations General Assembly he held up a cartoonish drawing of a bomb marked with red lines depicting enrichment levels. Another time, at the Munich Security Conference, he waved around a piece of wreckage from what he said was an Iranian drone sent from Syria and shot down by Israel.\n'Everywhere he went he was talking about it,' recalled Jeremy Issacharoff, a former Israeli ambassador to Germany and for years the Ministry of Foreign Affairs point man coordinating diplomatic efforts on regional security and the Iranian threat.\nAt times, Mr. Netanyahu's campaign against Iran has severely strained Israel's relations with American presidents, though bipartisan U.S. support for Israel has long been considered a strategic asset.\nAround 2012, Mr. Netanyahu infuriated the Obama administration by pushing hard for President Barack Obama to set clear 'red lines' on Iran's nuclear progress that would prompt the United States to undertake a military strike. Before that, the Israeli prime minister was making plans for a unilateral Israeli strike in the face of tough opposition from Washington and public criticism from a string of former Israeli security chiefs. It was never clear if Mr. Netanyahu was bluffing, and the prospect of an imminent strike receded.\nHe further challenged Mr. Obama in 2015 with an impassioned speech to a joint meeting of Congress denouncing what he called a 'bad deal' being negotiated by the United States and other world powers with Iran to curb its nuclear program.\nWhen President Donald J. Trump came to power, Mr. Netanyahu encouraged him to withdraw from the agreement \u2014 a move that many Israeli experts have called a dire mistake and a failure of Mr. Netanyahu's Iran policy.\n'Since then, there have been no constraints on the program,' Mr. Issacharoff said, adding, 'It has never been more advanced.'\nBut it was also under Mr. Netanyahu's watch that Israel forged diplomatic relations with more Arab states that are considered part of the moderate, anti-Iranian axis, including the United Arab Emirates.\nRegardless of what comes next, Ms. Mualem, the Netanyahu biographer, said, 'Bibi is still in the game,' referring to him by his nickname. 'He's a central player, and it isn't over, diplomatically or politically. And he plays a long game.'\nMourners on Sunday with the bodies of Palestinians in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip. Credit... Ramadan Abed/Reuters As the world's attention shifted to Iran's attack on Israel, Palestinians in Gaza experienced a relatively calm night for the first time in more than six months but were quickly jolted back to reality when airstrikes there continued on Sunday morning.\nWhile Iranian drones and aircraft were making their way to Israeli territory on Saturday night, the incessant noise of Israeli drones and warplanes disappeared from Gaza's skies, residents said.\n'Finally some calmness after six months of buzzing and noises!' Yousef Mema, a Gazan activist with a significant social media following, wrote on Instagram.\nAnother influencer, Mahmoud Shurrab, recorded himself walking in the middle of the street, the skies overhead quiet. 'I can't believe it, silence,' he said in a video posted on Instagram.\nThe calm did not last. The Israeli military said on Sunday that its forces were pressing on with a raid in the central Gaza Strip for the fourth day, where they 'eliminated dozens of terrorists in face-to-face battles and with air support.' And Wafa, the Palestinian Authority news agency, reported that several Palestinians had been killed in a strike on a home in Nuseirat in central Gaza, and that at least eight others were wounded in a strike on three homes in Beit Hanoun, a city in the northeast of the strip.\nSome Palestinians worried that an escalation between Israel and Iran would distract from the dire situation in the Gaza Strip, potentially diverting international attention from the Israeli bombardment and looming famine there.\n'I think it is not at all in the Palestinians' side or favor to have a new front open with Israel,' said Amer Nasser, 64. 'This will distract the people around the world from seeing what is happening in Gaza,' he added.\nFor many, the Iranian attack was unexpected.\nFayez al-Samman, a 76-year-old car trader from Gaza City who is sheltering in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza, said he spent the night listening to the news on the radio. 'It was a surprise for me when I heard the missiles were targeting Israeli sites,' he said.\nOsama al-Hato, 53, another man from Gaza City staying in Deir al-Balah, said he was happy that Iran had targeted Israel. 'However, I did not follow the news nor expect the Iranian reaction to this extent,' he added.\nAymen Zidan, 57, a wholesale vegetable supplier from Deir al-Balah, said he had had little expectation that Iran would target Israel, although he believed Iran's attack was for its own interests, not for the sake of Palestinians in Gaza like him.\nEven so, he said, he felt 'relieved that there is a country that said no to Israel.'\nRaja Abdulrahim contributed reporting from New York.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Adam Rasgon","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/15/multimedia/15mideast-crisis-gaza-war-analysis/pwlt-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":2.2879739,"_id":"41f4176586c824d22abb8e1aedc1dcde"},{"title":"The case centers on an unusual use of the Eighth Amendment.","author":"Abbie Van Sickle","published_date":"2024-04-22 13:02:47","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/22/us/supreme-court-homelessness/the-case-centers-on-an-unusual-use-of-the-eighth-amendment","clean_url":"nytimes.com","excerpt":"A group of homeless plaintiffs argue that local laws aimed at banning sleeping outside violated their constitutional rights. The city claims that's not what the Eighth Amendment means.","summary":"Skip to contentSkip to site index\nSkip to contentSkip to site index The Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis. The case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces. The issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years. The dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. A group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter. City officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond. Here's what else to know: The case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution. 'The city of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town,' the lawsuit said. 'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness \u2014 policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances \u2014 the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks. April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET The argument is scheduled for 65 minutes. But it will probably last more than twice that long. April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET The stakes are high. In San Francisco, which is embroiled in a lawsuit over encampments, city officials have complained for months that a sweeping injunction based on the Grants Pass decision and other Ninth Circuit rulings has complicated law enforcement around downtown tent camps. Over the weekend, I asked Senator Scott Wiener, a Democratic legislator who represents San Francisco, what he was hoping for from the Supreme Court. 'Certainty,' he told me, 'because things have been chaotic here.'  April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET In briefs on the case, California leaders have tried to take a nuanced position, arguing, in essence, that they don't want to criminalize homelessness but need more flexibility to clear the most dangerous encampments and compel people to take shelter when it is offered. This tricky balance was reflected in Gov. Gavin Newsom's brief 'in support of neither party.' April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET Outside the Supreme Court building this morning, activists hoping to protect the rights of homeless people have gathered with signs that call for 'Housing Not Handcuffs.'

According to leaders across the political spectrum who have asked the Supreme Court to address homelessness, those are the consequences of a sharp increase in homelessness that have forced many cities to 'a breaking point.' Although the case before the court on Monday centers on the narrow issue of whether the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment shields homeless people with no options for shelter from fines, fees and jail time, officials and advocates across the country are watching the case closely for its potential to reshape homelessness policy. The case underscores deep divisions over how best to address homelessness and how much leeway to give to local and state officials to help solve the problem. Theane Evangelis, a lawyer for the city of Grants Pass, Ore., who also represented the city of Boise, Idaho, in a similar case in 2018, warned that 'the stakes could not be higher for every city in the country.' If the Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling on behalf of the homeless plaintiffs, she added, cities everywhere 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.' Those who side with the homeless plaintiffs counter that the issue before the court is a focused one, on how to interpret the Constitution. The cities' willingness to embrace solutions like more affordable housing will determine whether the homelessness crisis will begin to abate, they say. 'The first thing for folks who aren't in this field \u2014 or understanding the nuances of this case \u2014 to understand is that nobody wants a country where people are forced to sleep outside,' said Ann Oliva, chief executive of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, an advocacy group founded in the 1980s with bipartisan roots. In briefs, supporters of Grants Pass have contended that local and state policymakers, not judges, are best placed to devise homelessness policies. The cases from Grants Pass and Boise had allowed 'federal judges to serve as the nation's \u2018homelessness policy czars,'' wrote the Cicero Institute, a Texas policy group critical of longstanding federal policy that channels funds to programs to provide the homeless with permanent housing without requiring people to undergo mental health or drug treatment. Lawyers for the National Alliance to End Homelessness say that imposing penalties, rather than providing housing and services, ignores the roots of the issue. In its brief to the court, the group said that the city of Grants Pass and its defenders, 'rather than working to end it,' sought 'to banish homeless people out of sight and out of mind.' 'The threat of criminal penalties does not reduce homelessness,' the brief argued. 'At most, it drives unsheltered homeless people into hiding, leading to greater health and safety concerns for localities. Criminal punishment for peaceably sleeping outside as an unsheltered homeless person is not only cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but unnecessary, expensive and counterproductive.'  April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET It is early in California, but today's arguments are being closely watched here. California has about 12 percent of the nation's population, but roughly a third of the nation's homeless people. A lot of factors play into that, including the sunny weather to a crippling housing shortage. But rulings by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit constraining tent camp enforcement have made California's homelessness crisis particularly wrenching and visible. April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET This is the start of a big week at the court, featuring the final arguments of the term. In addition to the homelessness case today, the justices will hear an abortion case on Wednesday and a case on Trump's claim that he is immune from prosecution on Thursday. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has said that he opposes criminalizing homelessness but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass have impeded the ability of the local authorities to move people into shelters and temporary housing. Credit... Jeff Chiu/Associated Press The Goldwater Institute and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ordinarily have little in common. One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states. But for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West. On Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis \u2014 the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing. The conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them. Advocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless. In the nine Western states in the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, however, officials have increasingly begged the court to explicitly define the point at which a community can reclaim its shared spaces without triggering lawsuits. Some echo conservative appointees on the Ninth Circuit like Judge Daniel Bress, who issued a scathing response last year after the liberal majority voted not to give the Grants Pass case a rehearing before the full appeals court. (The three-judge had panel found that penalties for bunking outdoors violated the Constitution if the local population of homeless people exceeded the city's shelter capacity.) The Ninth Circuit, he wrote, need only look to its doorstep to see the fruit of its decision \u2014 a dystopia of 'homelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics dealing, severe mental health impairment' and post-Covid 'hollowing out.' In Phoenix, where a massive encampment near the Arizona State Capitol consumed millions of state dollars and years of litigation, Timothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs of the Goldwater Institute, noted that both sides had asked the court for clarification. 'It just shows,' he said, 'that across the board, the Ninth Circuit ruling that you have a constitutional right to sleep in a public park is unworkable and has got to be reversed.' In California, where more than 180,000 people are homeless, Mr. Newsom wrote in his brief to the court that he opposes criminalizing homelessness, but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass 'have impeded not only the ability to enforce basic health and safety measures, but also the ability to move people into available shelter beds and temporary housing.' Since his election in 2018, California has pumped more than $20 billion into programs to address homelessness, including specialized housing, a new court-based approach for dealing with addiction and mental illness and a $6.38 billion bond. At a news conference last week, he recalled pitching in to dismantle one tent camp in Oakland that 'felt like a scene out of a \u2018Raiders of the Lost Ark' where, you know, thousands and thousands of rats appeared running all around us.' 'This is to me just about common sense, not about ideology,' the governor said.  'Suddenly, I found myself homeless,' Laura Gutowski said. 'I never expected it to come to this.' Credit... Mason Trinca for The New York Times Inside a warming shelter, Laura Gutowski detailed how her life had changed since she became homeless two and a half years ago in Grants Pass, a former timber hub in the foothills of southern Oregon. Her husband's death left her without steady income. She lived in a sedan, and then in a tent, in sight of the elementary school where her son was once a student. She constantly scrambled to move her belongings to avoid racking up more fines from the police. 'I never expected it to come to this,' said Ms. Gutowski, 55. She is one of several hundred homeless people in this city of about 40,000 that is at the center of a major case before the Supreme Court on Monday with broad ramifications for the nationwide struggle with homelessness. After Grants Pass stepped up enforcement of local ordinances that banned sleeping and camping in public spaces by ticketing, fining and jailing homeless people, lower courts ruled that it amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishment' by penalizing people who had nowhere else to go. Many states and cities that are increasingly overwhelmed by homelessness are hoping the Supreme Court overturns that decision \u2014 or severely limits it. They argue that it has crippled their efforts to address sprawling encampments, rampant public drug use and fearful constituents who say they cannot safely use public spaces. That prospect has alarmed homeless people and their advocates, who contend that a ruling against them would lead cities to fall back on jails, instead of solutions like affordable housing and social services. The case highlights the fierce divide over the thorny issue of how to regulate homelessness. Theane Evangelis, a lawyer representing Grants Pass, said the Supreme Court's decision would reverberate widely. If it does not overturn the lower-court decision, she said, cities around the United States 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.' Ed Johnson, a lawyer for the Oregon Law Center, a nonprofit legal aid group, who represents the homeless residents, said a ruling against them would strip them of their few protections. 'Can a city make it illegal on every inch of city land, every minute of the day, for people to live outside when they have nowhere else to go?' he said. Homelessness across the country climbed to the highest total on record last year, increasing by 12 percent to more than 650,000 people, according to a count by the federal government. Lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Credit... Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times At the core of the Supreme Court battle over a small Oregon town's treatment of its homeless people is a narrow question: Does the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual treatment apply to a city's efforts to crack down on public sleeping and camping? The Eighth Amendment is most commonly applied to punishments, not to laws themselves, and it is often the focus of litigation around the death penalty, solitary confinement and life without the possibility of parole. But in the case on Monday, lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Because the town, Grants Pass, has no homeless shelter, unaffiliated with any religious group, that is open to everyone, they argue, all homeless people there are involuntarily homeless and cannot be punished for having nowhere to go. To make that argument, the homeless plaintiffs have looked to rulings that apply the amendment beyond punishments themselves and to the concept that a person cannot be penalized for their state of being. In one landmark 1962 decision, Robinson v. California, the court found that a person could not be punished for being addicted to drugs, paving the way for subsequent applications. Because those rulings found that the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishing people for having 'an involuntary status,' the homeless plaintiffs say that it would also be relevant to their situation. They add that they are being disciplined for circumstances outside their control, in this instance 'universal biological necessities like sleeping and using a blanket to survive cold temperatures when they have no choice but to be outside.' The city argues that this is an inappropriate use of the Eighth Amendment and a fundamental misunderstanding of its purpose. Two legal experts, in filing a friend-of-the-court brief siding with Grants Pass, argued that the Constitution did bar criminalizing someone's state of being, rather than their specific conduct. But that prohibition, the law professors \u2014 Peter W. Low of the University of Virginia and Joel S. Johnson of Pepperdine \u2014 added, had a 'shaky Eighth Amendment footing.'  \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences\nThe Supreme Court will consider on Monday how far cities and states can go to police homelessness, a case that could have profound implications for how the country addresses an escalating crisis.\nThe case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces.\nThe issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years.\nThe dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces.

The case reflects a broader fight over regulating homelessness and the complexity of balancing the civil rights of homeless people with concerns about health and safety in public spaces. The issue has united people across the political spectrum, with some leaders of left-leaning cities and states joining with conservative groups to urge the justices to clarify the extent of their legal authority in clearing encampments that have proliferated across the West in recent years. The dispute centers on Grants Pass, a city of about 40,000 in southern Oregon that, through a series of overlapping ordinances, outlawed sleeping and camping with any kind of bedding in public spaces. The question before the justices is whether those laws went so far that they punished people for being homeless and violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. A group of homeless residents is challenging the city's enforcement of the ordinances as unconstitutional, arguing that they are involuntarily homeless in the city because there are not shelter beds available and that the city may not punish them without offering shelter. City officials in Grants Pass counter that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment. They warn that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would fuel homeless encampments across the country and hamstring the ability of local governments to respond. Here's what else to know: The case began in October 2018, when Debra Blake, a homeless woman in Grants Pass, sued the city, accusing officials of breaching the Constitution. 'The city of Grants Pass is trying to run homeless people out of town,' the lawsuit said. 'On any given day or night, hundreds of individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, are forced to live outside due to the lack of emergency shelter and affordable housing in their community.'\nThe plaintiffs' argument rests in part on a 1962 case, Robinson v. California, in which the Supreme Court held that laws imposing penalties on people for narcotics addiction violated the Eighth Amendment because they punished a state of being, not a specific action, like drug possession or sale. In a similar fashion, the plaintiffs contend, Grants Pass is punishing people for being involuntarily homeless, not for specific actions.\nThat argument held sway in a separate case, Martin v. Boise, in 2018. In that case, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Boise, Idaho, had violated the constitutional rights of homeless people by imposing criminal penalties for sleeping and camping outdoors, even though the city did not have enough shelter beds.\nLawyers for Grants Pass point to the Boise case as a cautionary tale. The decision only hastened 'sprawling encampments, rising deaths and widespread harms to the community, as localities are forced to surrender their public spaces,' the lawyers wrote in a brief. The lawyers added that lawmakers, not courts, were best suited to address homelessness and the complexity of its root causes.\nUnderlining the tricky balance inherent in the case, a number of groups have sought to strike something of a compromise. The Biden administration, the city and county of Los Angeles, the city and county of San Francisco, California and the state's governor have weighed in, all seeking to find a careful balance between support for homeless residents and for broader communities.\nThe Biden administration, which will participate in the oral arguments, has not chosen a side in the dispute. Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness \u2014 policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances \u2014 the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks. April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET The argument is scheduled for 65 minutes. But it will probably last more than twice that long. April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:57 a.m. ET The stakes are high. In San Francisco, which is embroiled in a lawsuit over encampments, city officials have complained for months that a sweeping injunction based on the Grants Pass decision and other Ninth Circuit rulings has complicated law enforcement around downtown tent camps. Over the weekend, I asked Senator Scott Wiener, a Democratic legislator who represents San Francisco, what he was hoping for from the Supreme Court. 'Certainty,' he told me, 'because things have been chaotic here.'  April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:52 a.m. ET In briefs on the case, California leaders have tried to take a nuanced position, arguing, in essence, that they don't want to criminalize homelessness but need more flexibility to clear the most dangerous encampments and compel people to take shelter when it is offered. This tricky balance was reflected in Gov. Gavin Newsom's brief 'in support of neither party.' April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET Outside the Supreme Court building this morning, activists hoping to protect the rights of homeless people have gathered with signs that call for 'Housing Not Handcuffs.'

The case underscores deep divisions over how best to address homelessness and how much leeway to give to local and state officials to help solve the problem.

Even as it was sharply critical of laws that in effect criminalize homelessness \u2014 policies that it argues can make it harder for people to escape their circumstances \u2014 the administration said local governments had a basic responsibility to maintain the cleanliness and safety of public spaces like parks and sidewalks.\nApril 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET The argument is scheduled for 65 minutes.

In San Francisco, which is embroiled in a lawsuit over encampments, city officials have complained for months that a sweeping injunction based on the Grants Pass decision and other Ninth Circuit rulings has complicated law enforcement around downtown tent camps. Over the weekend, I asked Senator Scott Wiener, a Democratic legislator who represents San Francisco, what he was hoping for from the Supreme Court.

This tricky balance was reflected in Gov. Gavin Newsom's brief 'in support of neither party.'\nApril 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:46 a.m. ET Outside the Supreme Court building this morning, activists hoping to protect the rights of homeless people have gathered with signs that call for 'Housing Not Handcuffs.'

According to leaders across the political spectrum who have asked the Supreme Court to address homelessness, those are the consequences of a sharp increase in homelessness that have forced many cities to 'a breaking point.'\nAlthough the case before the court on Monday centers on the narrow issue of whether the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment shields homeless people with no options for shelter from fines, fees and jail time, officials and advocates across the country are watching the case closely for its potential to reshape homelessness policy.\nThe case underscores deep divisions over how best to address homelessness and how much leeway to give to local and state officials to help solve the problem.\nTheane Evangelis, a lawyer for the city of Grants Pass, Ore., who also represented the city of Boise, Idaho, in a similar case in 2018, warned that 'the stakes could not be higher for every city in the country.'\nIf the Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling on behalf of the homeless plaintiffs, she added, cities everywhere 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.'\nThose who side with the homeless plaintiffs counter that the issue before the court is a focused one, on how to interpret the Constitution. The cities' willingness to embrace solutions like more affordable housing will determine whether the homelessness crisis will begin to abate, they say.\n'The first thing for folks who aren't in this field \u2014 or understanding the nuances of this case \u2014 to understand is that nobody wants a country where people are forced to sleep outside,' said Ann Oliva, chief executive of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, an advocacy group founded in the 1980s with bipartisan roots.\nIn briefs, supporters of Grants Pass have contended that local and state policymakers, not judges, are best placed to devise homelessness policies.\nThe cases from Grants Pass and Boise had allowed 'federal judges to serve as the nation's \u2018homelessness policy czars,'' wrote the Cicero Institute, a Texas policy group critical of longstanding federal policy that channels funds to programs to provide the homeless with permanent housing without requiring people to undergo mental health or drug treatment.\nLawyers for the National Alliance to End Homelessness say that imposing penalties, rather than providing housing and services, ignores the roots of the issue.\nIn its brief to the court, the group said that the city of Grants Pass and its defenders, 'rather than working to end it,' sought 'to banish homeless people out of sight and out of mind.'\n'The threat of criminal penalties does not reduce homelessness,' the brief argued. 'At most, it drives unsheltered homeless people into hiding, leading to greater health and safety concerns for localities. Criminal punishment for peaceably sleeping outside as an unsheltered homeless person is not only cruel and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but unnecessary, expensive and counterproductive.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:38 a.m. ET It is early in California, but today's arguments are being closely watched here. California has about 12 percent of the nation's population, but roughly a third of the nation's homeless people. A lot of factors play into that, including the sunny weather to a crippling housing shortage. But rulings by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit constraining tent camp enforcement have made California's homelessness crisis particularly wrenching and visible.\nApril 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET April 22, 2024, 9:28 a.m. ET This is the start of a big week at the court, featuring the final arguments of the term. In addition to the homelessness case today, the justices will hear an abortion case on Wednesday and a case on Trump's claim that he is immune from prosecution on Thursday.\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California has said that he opposes criminalizing homelessness but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass have impeded the ability of the local authorities to move people into shelters and temporary housing. Credit... Jeff Chiu/Associated Press The Goldwater Institute and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ordinarily have little in common. One is a conservative think tank in Arizona, the other a Democrat leading one of the nation's most liberal states.\nBut for the past six years, they have been aligned on one highly charged issue: the need for some legal way to clear homeless encampments that have proliferated in cities throughout the West.\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court will consider an Oregon case that could reshape homelessness policy nationally. On its face, The City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks.\nThe City of Grants Pass v. Johnson asks how far cities can constitutionally go to restrict sleeping and camping in parks and on sidewalks. More broadly, however, the case deals with one of the thorniest aspects of the homelessness crisis \u2014 the balance between the government's responsibility to protect public health and the human right to exist without housing.\nThe conflict has been particularly acute in the West, where the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, has issued opinions over the past six years that officials blame for the sprawling tent encampments in public spaces that have spread since the pandemic. As voters' frustration has grown, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have called for greater authority to ban such camping, only to have the courts reject them.\nAdvocates for homeless people, the American Psychiatric Association and several left-leaning states, including New York, Illinois and Minnesota, argue that criminalizing homelessness only worsens the problem. More effective, they say, is focusing on housing, treatment, education and jobs for people who are homeless.\nIn the nine Western states in the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, however, officials have increasingly begged the court to explicitly define the point at which a community can reclaim its shared spaces without triggering lawsuits. Some echo conservative appointees on the Ninth Circuit like Judge Daniel Bress, who issued a scathing response last year after the liberal majority voted not to give the Grants Pass case a rehearing before the full appeals court. (The three-judge had panel found that penalties for bunking outdoors violated the Constitution if the local population of homeless people exceeded the city's shelter capacity.)\nThe Ninth Circuit, he wrote, need only look to its doorstep to see the fruit of its decision \u2014 a dystopia of 'homelessness, drug addiction, barely concealed narcotics dealing, severe mental health impairment' and post-Covid 'hollowing out.'\nIn Phoenix, where a massive encampment near the Arizona State Capitol consumed millions of state dollars and years of litigation, Timothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs of the Goldwater Institute, noted that both sides had asked the court for clarification.\n'It just shows,' he said, 'that across the board, the Ninth Circuit ruling that you have a constitutional right to sleep in a public park is unworkable and has got to be reversed.'\nIn California, where more than 180,000 people are homeless, Mr. Newsom wrote in his brief to the court that he opposes criminalizing homelessness, but that decisions like the one in Grants Pass 'have impeded not only the ability to enforce basic health and safety measures, but also the ability to move people into available shelter beds and temporary housing.' Since his election in 2018, California has pumped more than $20 billion into programs to address homelessness, including specialized housing, a new court-based approach for dealing with addiction and mental illness and a $6.38 billion bond.\nAt a news conference last week, he recalled pitching in to dismantle one tent camp in Oakland that 'felt like a scene out of a \u2018Raiders of the Lost Ark' where, you know, thousands and thousands of rats appeared running all around us.'\n'This is to me just about common sense, not about ideology,' the governor said.\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT 'Suddenly, I found myself homeless,' Laura Gutowski said. 'I never expected it to come to this.' Credit... Mason Trinca for The New York Times Inside a warming shelter, Laura Gutowski detailed how her life had changed since she became homeless two and a half years ago in Grants Pass, a former timber hub in the foothills of southern Oregon.\nHer husband's death left her without steady income. She lived in a sedan, and then in a tent, in sight of the elementary school where her son was once a student. She constantly scrambled to move her belongings to avoid racking up more fines from the police.\n'I never expected it to come to this,' said Ms. Gutowski, 55. She is one of several hundred homeless people in this city of about 40,000 that is at the center of a major case before the Supreme Court on Monday with broad ramifications for the nationwide struggle with homelessness.\nAfter Grants Pass stepped up enforcement of local ordinances that banned sleeping and camping in public spaces by ticketing, fining and jailing homeless people, lower courts ruled that it amounted to 'cruel and unusual punishment' by penalizing people who had nowhere else to go.\nMany states and cities that are increasingly overwhelmed by homelessness are hoping the Supreme Court overturns that decision \u2014 or severely limits it. They argue that it has crippled their efforts to address sprawling encampments, rampant public drug use and fearful constituents who say they cannot safely use public spaces.\nThat prospect has alarmed homeless people and their advocates, who contend that a ruling against them would lead cities to fall back on jails, instead of solutions like affordable housing and social services.\nThe case highlights the fierce divide over the thorny issue of how to regulate homelessness.\nTheane Evangelis, a lawyer representing Grants Pass, said the Supreme Court's decision would reverberate widely. If it does not overturn the lower-court decision, she said, cities around the United States 'would find their hands tied just like Grants Pass, and the problem of growing encampments will spread throughout the country.'\nEd Johnson, a lawyer for the Oregon Law Center, a nonprofit legal aid group, who represents the homeless residents, said a ruling against them would strip them of their few protections. 'Can a city make it illegal on every inch of city land, every minute of the day, for people to live outside when they have nowhere else to go?' he said.\nHomelessness across the country climbed to the highest total on record last year, increasing by 12 percent to more than 650,000 people, according to a count by the federal government.\nLawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Credit... Anna Rose Layden for The New York Times At the core of the Supreme Court battle over a small Oregon town's treatment of its homeless people is a narrow question: Does the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual treatment apply to a city's efforts to crack down on public sleeping and camping?\nThe Eighth Amendment is most commonly applied to punishments, not to laws themselves, and it is often the focus of litigation around the death penalty, solitary confinement and life without the possibility of parole.\nBut in the case on Monday, lawyers for a group of homeless residents argue that the Eighth Amendment bars the city from enforcing a series of local ordinances that, taken together, ban sleeping outside with bedding or camping in any public space in the city. Because the town, Grants Pass, has no homeless shelter, unaffiliated with any religious group, that is open to everyone, they argue, all homeless people there are involuntarily homeless and cannot be punished for having nowhere to go.\nTo make that argument, the homeless plaintiffs have looked to rulings that apply the amendment beyond punishments themselves and to the concept that a person cannot be penalized for their state of being.\nIn one landmark 1962 decision, Robinson v. California, the court found that a person could not be punished for being addicted to drugs, paving the way for subsequent applications. Because those rulings found that the Eighth Amendment prohibits punishing people for having 'an involuntary status,' the homeless plaintiffs say that it would also be relevant to their situation. They add that they are being disciplined for circumstances outside their control, in this instance 'universal biological necessities like sleeping and using a blanket to survive cold temperatures when they have no choice but to be outside.'\nThe city argues that this is an inappropriate use of the Eighth Amendment and a fundamental misunderstanding of its purpose.\nTwo legal experts, in filing a friend-of-the-court brief siding with Grants Pass, argued that the Constitution did bar criminalizing someone's state of being, rather than their specific conduct. But that prohibition, the law professors \u2014 Peter W. Low of the University of Virginia and Joel S. Johnson of Pepperdine \u2014 added, had a 'shaky Eighth Amendment footing.'\nAdvertisement\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT \u00a9 2024 The New York Times Company Manage Privacy Preferences","rights":"nytimes.com","rank":40,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Abbie Van Sickle","media":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/22/multimedia/22scotus-homeless-grants-pass-pjmq/22scotus-homeless-grants-pass-pjmq-facebookJumbo.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":null,"_score":2.2185535,"_id":"1b53274ea77c256adcc5ba7ab6dbb7c6"}],"user_input":{"q":"Trump","search_in":["title_summary_en"],"lang":["en"],"not_lang":null,"countries":null,"not_countries":null,"from":"2024-04-15 00:00:00","to":null,"ranked_only":"True","from_rank":null,"to_rank":null,"sort_by":"relevancy","page":2,"size":100,"sources":["nytimes.com"],"not_sources":[],"topic":null,"published_date_precision":null}}
