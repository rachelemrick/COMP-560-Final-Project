The private sector gained roughly 8,000 jobs, and the labor force increased by 3,000 people. The unemployment rate remained at a steady 2.7%, according to the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development.\n\"Our strong job and labor force growth shows that Minnesota's economy continued to provide great opportunities for Minnesota residents as well as those who would like to call Minnesota home,\" said DEED Commissioner Matt Varilek.\nThe supersectors that gained the most jobs were leisure and hospitality, government, education and health services, and construction.\nOver the last year, Minnesota gained more than 47,000 jobs, which is up 1.6%. As a whole, U.S. employment ticked up 1.9% compared to last year. Nationally, the unemployment rate sits at 3.8%, the U.S. Department of Labor said earlier this month.\nKey metrics and economists say that the U.S. is showing a strong and resilient economy, though experts say that consumers are still frustrated with their financial reality.\nRELATED: Is the U.S. in a \"vibecession\"?

            "excerpt": "Many Americans see an economic cost to combating climate change.",
            "summary": "For many years addressing climate change has been framed, at least in political debates, as one that carries an economic tradeoff: Could we afford to do it, even if we think it's otherwise a good idea, or would it cost jobs and money in a world so dependent on fossil fuels?\nThis framing endures today in many ways — especially on a personal level, if not a macro one.\nPeople are far more likely to oppose U.S. efforts to combat climate change if they think it will hurt their personal finances.\nIn fact, a majority of those who think efforts to reduce climate change will hurt them financially are in principle opposed to the U.S. taking steps on climate change, even as the rest of the nation breaks heavily in favor of that.\nMoreover these Americans extrapolate out and think a switchover to renewable energy, in particular, hurts the U.S. economy and hurts jobs.\nSo, who are they? For one thing, these folks seem highly sensitive to the price of gas — which may be one of the most immediate ways people believe they can measure any impact. If they report the price of gas has been a hardship or difficult for them, they are — by a double-digit-point difference — more likely to think efforts to reduce climate change hurt them.\nBut there's another way to measure personal economic impact, too, and that's in damage from weather events.\nA third of the country says their community has suffered damage from hurricanes, floods, fires and heat.\nThose people are much more likely to favor efforts to fight climate change and almost twice as likely to say efforts to fight climate change would help them financially.\nFinally, having said all that, there are a lot of people who outright reject the tradeoff framing in the first place — at least as it concerns energy production. Almost eight in 10 think it is possible to both increase energy production and protect the climate.\nAnd so, when people turn and look at the macro picture, there is little consensus on whether or not fighting climate change helps or hurts the larger economy.\nBiden climate agenda\nAnd half of Americans have heard not much or nothing about what the Biden administration has done about climate change. Only 14% say they've heard a lot.\nAnd two-thirds don't know if their state has gotten federal funds for climate change projects.\nWhen people are specifically asked about some of the Biden administration's policy programs, a lot of them gain at least net favor over opposition, at least in principle, though many still have not heard about them.\nBut the fact that people more broadly don't feel they know a lot about Biden administration plans for climate change — while at the same time a large majority say they support U.S. efforts to combat it, at least in principle — could signal that people aren't connecting the president's specific plans and policies to that larger goal.\nOf course, this is an argument the Biden administration, like many Democrats, has been making — that renewable energy and helping the climate makes financial sense, too.\nTake a closer look at one initiative — the move toward electric vehicles. There's a slight majority in favor of that move.\nBut here too, one of the reasons people oppose such a policy, when they do, centers around economics: They think it will hurt the economy and jobs. (The other is a more general opposition to what they see as imposing a choice.)\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,230 U.S. adult residents interviewed between April 16-19, 2024. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. The margin of error is ±2.7 points.\nToplines",

            "excerpt": "Neither Iran's leaders nor its people appear fearful of an imminent Israeli counterstrike, but they all know the real risks of a war.",
            "summary": "Tehran — Not long after Iranian state TV informed the nation that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had launched hundreds of drones and missiles, people poured into the streets in Tehran and other cities to show their support for Iran's first-ever direct military action against Israel.\nIran had vowed to retaliate for the killing of seven IRGC officers about two weeks earlier, in an airstrike that hit an Iranian consulate in Syria's capital. Israel hasn't acknowledged carrying out that strike, but it hasn't denied it, either.\nThe world is still waiting to see four days later how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government will respond to the Iranian attack, which caused \"very little damage,\" according to the Israel Defense Forces. The IDF said 99% of the 300-plus weapons launched were intercepted or fell out of the sky before they even reached Israeli territory, thanks to the country's robust air defenses and help from its U.S. and European allies.\nAs the U.S. works to prevent Israel's ongoing war against the Iran-backed Palestinian group Hamas from spreading into a much wider regional conflict, President Biden urged his Israeli counterpart right after the Iranian attack was thwarted, \"to think about what that success says all by itself to the rest of the region,\" according to National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby.\nKirby said the U.S. was \"working with international partners to work up options to hold Iran appropriately accountable.\"\nBut the White House has made it clear that the decision on how to retaliate will be Israel's to make, and that leaves plenty of room for anxiety across the tinderbox Middle East. But not too much, it would seem, in Iran.\nLife goes on in Iran\nSince the Iranian attack on Israel, there have been no signs that the Islamic republic is preparing for a war. Far from political and military leaders running for bunkers in fear of an Israeli reprisal strike, there have been no military drills, schools remain open. Iranian authorities haven't imposed any restrictions on air traffic.\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi looks at members of the armed forces during the National Army Day parade ceremony in Tehran, Iran, April 17, 2024.\nMajid Asgaripour/WANA/REUTERS\nEven ordinary Iranians appear relatively relaxed. There has been no obvious rush on supermarkets by people trying to stock up on essentials, and everyday life has gone on largely as normal.\nThe only direct impact thus far has been a predictable hike in the value of foreign currencies compared to Iran's. The ensuing rise in some commodity prices has brought back long lines for gas, but those are familiar in the heavily-sanctioned nation.\nBut there is cause for concern among Tehran's ruling class, and most of it's rooted in those financial factors. Stifled under some of the toughest international sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its allies on any nation, Iran's economy has been crippled for years. There's sky-high inflation and Iran remains mired in a deep recession.\nIran's economic woes\nFor Iran's leaders, the economy is likely a first concern. A wave of resentment over the country's dire finances and its strict interpretation of Islamic law has manifested in political unrest and street protests in recent years. Some have even seen people chanting risky calls for a change of leadership.\nBut Iranian political analyst Hadi Mohammadi told CBS News he believes Iran walked the right line with its attack on Israel, and Mohammadi says Iran's leaders have their nation's backing.\n\"The Iranian people's social behavior against common enemies in wars and frictions has proven that they mostly stay united,\" he told CBS News, suggesting a sense of national unity in the face of a perceived foreign threat is greater than any quarrel Iranians might have with their own leaders.\nHe pointed to opinion polls carried out just days before the Iranian reprisal against Israel that showed a majority of people supporting the looming operation.\n\"Even some of them who were critical of the administration were supportive of a military response, so that the enemy would not be persuaded to repeat its actions,\" he said. \"Of course, some of them were in favor of a diplomatic reaction and some of them totally disagreed with any military retaliation, but the majority agreed with a military response.\"\nIranians fear economic impact of \"a war of any scale\"\nThe Iranian people do appear divided, however, over their leaders' last move, even if most hope recent events won't snowball into an all-out war with Israel.\nAn anti-Israel billboard with a picture of Iranian missiles is seen on a street in Tehran, Iran, April 15, 2024.\nMajid Asgaripour/WANA/REUTERS\nVery few Iranians are willing to speak openly against their government's policies, given Iran's strict laws governing political speech, but several shared their views with CBS News on the condition they not be fully identified.\nSali, a 30-year-old art graduate who's unemployed and lives in Tehran with her parents, said a war with Israel would be \"devastating for the economy.\"\n\"I believe Iran's government is spending too much money on its proxies in the region and cares about the Palestinian issue more than taking care of its own people,\" she said. \"That is the reason why people have so many economic problems.\"\n\"I totally disagree with any war. It is not good for people anywhere,\" said Reza, who works in the private sector. \"The economy is already in a bad state, and a war of any scale will make it much worse. People cannot tolerate it, and I want peace for both nations.\"\nA huge Palestinian flag is seen draped on a building in Tehran, Iran, April 15, 2024.\nMajid Asgaripour/WANA/REUTERS\nIran's leaders — who have always refused to recognize Israel as a legitimate state — have threatened to respond to any Israeli counterattack with a much more lethal attack of their own.\n\"It was quite right to give a strong message to Israel,\" retired Iranian Air Force pilot Rahim Gasemi told CBS News this week. \"If Israel attacks us again, we will strike again, too.\"\nMany Iranians will be hoping it doesn't come to that.",

            "summary": "The nation is rapidly approaching \"peak 65\" as younger baby boomers turn 65 this year, initiating the biggest wave of retirements in U.S. history. Yet most of those Americans are financially unprepared to stop working, and many risk living in poverty, according to a new analysis.\nThe retirements of the youngest boomers — those born between 1959 and 1965 — are likely to reshape the U.S. economy, and not in entirely positive ways, according to the study from the ALI Retirement Income Institute, a non-profit focused on retirement education.\nThe new research underscores the impact that income and wealth inequality has had on a generation that, at least on aggregate, is the nation's wealthiest. Boomers who are White, male or have college degrees are the most likely to be financially prepared for retirement, but many people of color, women and those with only high school educations are lagging, the study found.\n\"America has never seen so many people reaching retirement age over a short period, and well over half of them will find it challenging to meet their needs through their retirements, let alone maintain their current standard of living,\" said Robert J. Shapiro, a co-author of the study and the chairman of economic consulting firm Sonecon, in a statement.\nThe findings echo other research that has found more than 1 in 4 older workers are nearing retirement without a penny in savings. While many younger people have yet to start putting money for their later years, it's more concerning for younger boomers approaching retirement age given they have only a few years left to sock money away.\nAbout 53% of \"peak boomers,\" or the tail end of the generation who will turn 65 between 2024 and 2030, have less than $250,000 in assets, the new study found. But huge disparities exist between within the group, the study found, based on its analysis of data from the Federal Reserve and the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study.\nFor instance, peak boomer men have a median retirement balance of $268,745, while women of the same age have savings of only $185,086. Peak boomers with only a high school degree have saved a median of $75,300 for retirement, compared with $591,158 for college graduates.\nMany of those peak boomers will be unable to maintain their standard of living in retirement, and also are likely to be reliant on Social Security as their primary source of income, the report noted. For instance, one-third of these younger boomers will rely on Social Security benefits for at least 90% of their retirement income when they are 70, the analysis found.\nSocial Security is designed to replace only 40% of a person's working income, while the average benefit is about $23,000 per year — far from enough to provide a comfortable retirement. Additional problems could arise if the Social Security system isn't shored up before its trust funds are slated to be depleted in 2033, which could lead to across-the-board benefit cuts.\nThe wave of retirements by younger boomers is likely to reshape the economy, the report noted. Productivity could slow as they exit the workforce, while consumer spending could also take a hit as they pare spending.\nHowever, there could be an upside, at least for younger workers, the report notes. With the last of the baby boom generation retiring, Gen X, millennial and even younger workers will be able to fill their vacated jobs.",

            "summary": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, that aired on April 21, 2024.\nThe following is a transcript of an interview with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, that aired on April 21, 2024.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro. He joins us this morning from Abington, Pennsylvania. And, Governor, thank you for sticking with us. We've been having some transmission technical issues. So hopefully, we don't get interrupted. I'll get- I'll get straight to it--\nGOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA): Good. I look forward to the conversation.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'll get straight to it, Governor. You have been outspoken against the rising and troubling antisemitism in this country. I know the FBI director said just a few days ago that federal law enforcement is concerned about lone actors targeting gatherings ahead of the start of Passover, which starts tomorrow. Are there known threats in your state?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Well, there's not known threats right now. And I can tell you, the Pennsylvania State Police working in coordination with our federal and local partners are all over this. And we'll let folks know, and communities, if there are specific threats. But we continue to work closely with law enforcement and community leaders to do everything we can to take down the temperature, to address the rise in antisemitism, Islamophobia, other forms of hate. There should be no place for that here in Pennsylvania. Of course, Pennsylvania, founded on the vision of William Penn, a place that would be a place of tolerance and welcome and peace, a place where people could come together and practice their faith, whatever their faith is, we have a special relationship with that, here in this commonwealth, where we respect all, no matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love, or who you choose to pray to. And we're going to continue to do everything we can to make sure everyone feels protected in this commonwealth.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there should be no place for it anywhere in America. I- and I know you agree with that. But let me get to the politics of the moment. President Biden won the state of Pennsylvania in 2020, narrowly. He spent a lot of time in your state this past week. We've seen in our polling, his approval rating among young voters aged 18 to 29 has dropped 12 points since February, from 55% to 43% today. How does the president get that back?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: I think the president gets it back by doing exactly what he's doing: showing up, talking about his record, addressing things like climate change, which are incredibly important issues for young voters, along with many others, obviously. Making sure that young people feel included in the conversation, not just as a vote, but as part of the governing coalition going forward. Young people helped propel me to victory as governor. One of the first things I did was start what I believe is the first ever Next Gen Engagement Commission here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, a place where young people quite literally advise me on policy, meet with me regularly, give me their perspective on what's happening in the community. I think part of the frustration by young people is that they- they oftentimes don't feel heard, and they feel like their voices and their votes are taken advantage of, come election time. This is a moment where the young people deserve to be at the table. And the fact that the President is showing up in these communities and talking about these issues that are going to help young people in the future, I think is a really important step.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So last weekend, Donald Trump was campaigning in Pennsylvania, it's so key. Here's what he said.\n[START SOUND ON TAPE]\nDONALD TRUMP: Biden has imposed a savage natural gas export ban that's putting countless Pennsylvania jobs at risk. He's risking your lives. He's risking your jobs. But he doesn't care, because all he cares about is the green new scam.\n[END SOUND ON TAPE]\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He is speaking to real fear among some of your constituents about President Biden's decision to, at least temporarily, put a pause on new natural gas projects. How do you respond to that?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Look, I've been very clear with the White House, and publicly, I hope that this policy that they put in place is very quick, and then we move forward. Here in Pennsylvania, our energy economy has powered this nation, and it has done so over many generations. And going forward, I think Pennsylvania has an opportunity to be the center of the clean energy economy. Thanks to the president, we're the only state in the nation with two regional hydrogen hubs.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But just to- just--\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Thanks to the president, we've been able to work together.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry, just- you broke up at the beginning. I think you said you've been very clear to the White House that you hope this is a short pause. Does that mean you agree, it is costing your state jobs and money?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Well, I think if the pause goes on for a long time, it has the potential to cost us jobs. That's why I want this to be as quick as possible. And what I went on to say, though, is we have an opportunity here in Pennsylvania to be the center of the clean energy economy. Thanks to President Biden, we have two regional hydrogen hubs. Thanks to President Biden, we are capping methane emissions from abandoned wells, we have billions of dollars of tax credits and other resources coming from the Department of Energy to help us through a transition. Here in Pennsylvania, we're showing that we can both protect the jobs that exist today and create more energy jobs tomorrow. Energy is critical to the future of our commonwealth. Now, listen, the bravado and the bluster from the former president do nothing to actually create jobs in Pennsylvania. He's got an abysmal track record when it comes to that. President Biden has a strong record. And we're going to continue to lead on energy here in Pennsylvania.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned young voters and how key the issue of climate is to them. The Biden administration touts the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, as a green energy bill even though it wasn't named that. But CBS polling shows half of Americans have not heard much, or nothing at all, about what the administration has done. Only 14% say they've heard a lot. Two thirds don't know if their state has gotten federal funds for climate change projects. This seems a real vulnerability for Democrats when it comes to young voters.\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Well, let me be very clear, climate change is real, it is serious, and we have to address it. And Joe Biden understands that. Donald Trump has made fun of climate change and denies its existence. So there's a clear contrast in this race. Because of the federal dollars that have flown- flowed to Pennsylvania, as I mentioned a moment ago, we are positioned to get two regional hydrogen hubs that are going to help us combat climate change. We're addressing all kinds of infrastructure needs here in this commonwealth, from repairing roads and bridges, to making sure people are connected to the internet, to making sure families in Esplen, which is a minority- predominantly minority community in Pittsburgh, no longer need to drink water out of the lines that contain lead, thanks to Joe Biden cleaning that up. So when it comes to infrastructure investments, when it comes to the kinds of investments that are going to help spur on a clean energy economy, President Biden has been there. Now, we have to make that case. And we've got to make sure folks understand that and hear that, that's why you run a campaign. That's why you'll see stark differences when it comes to combating climate change between the policies of President Biden and what Donald Trump has done in the past and wants to do in the future.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the messaging needs work, is what you're saying?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Well, I think the case- I think the case needs to be made. There's a wonderful track record. There's a wonderful body of work. They need to make that case, and I'll be helping make that case alongside the president.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask about something that has been really damaging your state and that is drug addiction. Pennsylvania, has- I'm sorry, excuse me. The number one public health crisis in Pennsylvania, according to the state, is opioids. The CDC says Pennsylvania recently saw the highest number of xylazine-related deaths in the country. What is driving the addiction?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Listen, 13 Pennsylvanians die every single day from an opioid overdose. It is unacceptable. And here in Pennsylvania, we're trying to come at it with a- a multi-pronged approach. First, we have to understand that drug addiction is a disease, not a crime. Now we have to invest in law enforcement. And I have. We've increased the number of state troopers by 400, and I'm looking to add another 400. As Attorney General, I arrested over 8,000 drug dealers. So we're not going soft on those who are peddling these poisons in our community. But we also have to make sure the treatment is available. As Attorney General I led a national coalition that ended up holding those drug companies accountable, the very people that brought this crisis into our communities, and brought $2 billion back to Pennsylvania for treatment--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm- I'm sorry to interrupt you--\nGOV. SHAPIRO: --this is really critical stuff and it's going to require a multi-pronged approach.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry, I have to interrupt you. We have to leave it there, Governor. Thank you. We'll be back.",

            "summary": "YORK, Pa. (KDKA) -- Pennsylvania is pledging to get half of the state government's electricity from solar power by next year, with leaders calling the commitment the first of its kind in the country.\nTen new solar arrays around the commonwealth will power 50% of the state government, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced on Earth Day.\nThe Pennsylvania Department of General Services entered into a contract with Constellation for a 15-year fixed price agreement, so Pennsylvania's rate will stay the same, even as energy costs rise, \"saving Pennsylvania taxpayer dollars while providing reliable, sustainable, and affordable electricity in the long term,\" the Shapiro administration said.\n\"When I announced my energy plan last month, I made clear that we must reject the false choice between protecting jobs and the economy and protecting the environment,\" Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a news release. \"The historic PA PULSE initiative, which began under the previous Administration, is proof we can do both – investing in reliable, affordable power in the long-term.\"\nShapiro said with his energy plan and projects like PA PULSE, his administration will create energy jobs, take \"real action\" to address climate change and ensure consumers pay less on their bills.\nThe Shapiro administration says the project will supply 361,000 megawatt-hours of electricity annually to more than a dozen commonwealth agencies, reducing the state's carbon footprint by nearly 158,000 metric tons of CO2 a year -- the equivalent of about 34,000 gas-powered cars. It's also expected to create 200 jobs.\nThe PA PULSE initiative includes ten solar arrays in Columbia, Juniata, Crawford, Northumberland, Snyder and York counties.",

            "excerpt": "Cuba's deputy foreign minister tells CBS News that his country is willing to accommodate more than one deportation flight per month.",
            "summary": "Washington — Cuba's government is willing to accept more deportation flights from the U.S. of Cuban migrants, who have traveled to the southern border in record numbers over the past three years, a top Cuban official told CBS News in an exclusive interview.\nAfter a two-year pause, the U.S. restarted deportation flights to the island last year. Since then, the U.S. has been sending one flight with Cuban deportees to Havana each month.\nBut in an interview with CBS News this week, Cuba's Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Fernández de Cossío said Cuban officials are willing to accommodate more than one flight per month.\n\"We're open to having more\" deportation flights, said Fernández de Cossío, who visited Washington this week to meet with Biden administration officials for the latest round of migration talks between the two countries.\nSince the 1959 Cuban Revolution, the U.S. and Cuba have had a deeply contentious relationship. The Cold War-era rivals still bitterly disagree on many issues, from Cuba's human rights record and its ties to China and Russia to the decades-long American embargo on Cuban imports and exports.\nBut Washington and Havana have worked together on immigration, including by signing the 1994 U.S.-Cuba Migration Accords, which officials from both nations are discussing this week. The two countries' work on immigration has intensified in recent years amid the record arrival of hundreds of thousands of Cubans to the U.S.-Mexico border.\nSince the start of fiscal year 2021, the U.S. has processed more than 450,000 Cuban migrants at the southern border, according to Customs and Border Protection data. The flow of Cuban migrants to the U.S. border has slowed since last year, when the Biden administration created programs that have allowed some Cubans to fly into the U.S. legally or appear at an official border crossing.\nIn the interview this week, Fernández de Cossío blamed the exodus from Cuba in recent years on the U.S. embargo and other American policies, including the 1960s Cuban Adjustment Act, which created a special pathway to permanent U.S. residency for certain Cuban migrants. Only Congress can change that law.\nFernández de Cossío said the U.S. is \"aiming at destroying the Cuban economy\" through its sanctions. He did not concede that economic mismanagement and repressive policies by Havana have also driven Cubans to flee the island, as the U.S. government has argued.\n\"You can speak about other factors, but if you have a consistent policy by the most powerful economy in the world to try to destroy the livelihood of a whole population, 11 million Cubans, it is logical to expect people, a segment of the population, to want to leave the country,\" he said.\nIn 2023, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security assessed that \"Cuba's deteriorating economic conditions and political repression continue to increasingly drive Cubans out of their country.\"\nFernández de Cossío also cited the lack of some legal channels for Cuban citizens to come to the U.S. for illegal crossings along the southern border by Cubans.\nHe urged the State Department to resume the processing of tourist and short-term visas in Havana. The Biden administration restarted immigrant visa processing in Cuba, but short-term visa seekers in Cuba still have to travel to a third country to have their cases processed.\nFernández de Cossío said U.S. officials informed him they would resume full visa processing in Cuba in the future.\nRepresentatives for the State Department did not respond to requests to comment on Fernández de Cossío's remarks.\nFernández de Cossío expressed some concern about additional U.S. sanctions if former President Donald Trump is elected in November. During Trump's tenure, the U.S. had a more aggressive stance towards Cuba, reversing the Obama administration's attempt to normalize relations with Havana.\n\"Of course we're concerned if there are additional economic measures [against] Cuba, regardless of who wins the election. The Biden administration has very faithfully applied the policies put in place by the Trump administration and added some,\" he said. \"So we would not [be] surprised they would do it. It would be unfair, and we believe it would be immoral, but we have to acknowledge that would happen and [it] gives us room for concern.\"",

American workers face \"unfair competition\" from Chinese imports, and high-quality U.S. products are undercut by \"artificially low-priced\" Chinese alternatives that use higher emissions,\" the White House says.\nThe Biden administration is also pursuing anti-dumping investigations against countries that try to saturate markets with Chinese steel, and the U.S. is working with Mexico to make sure Chinese companies can't avoid tariffs by shipping steel there first. Tai is also launching an investigation into China's practices in the maritime, shipbuilding and logistics sectors, the White House says.\nThe announcement comes amid the planned sale of U.S. Steel to the Japanese-owned Nippon Steel, which the president strongly opposes.\nAs the president continues his three-day swing through Scranton, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, his campaign is launching a six-figure, five-day ad blitz highlighting Mr. Biden's pro-labor stances. Pennsylvania is a battleground state this November, with former President Donald Trump and Mr. Biden neck-and-neck in polls.\n\"Scranton values or Mar-a-Lago values,\" Mr. Biden said during a speech in Scranton Tuesday, referencing Trump's luxurious Florida resort. \"These are the competing visions for our economy, and they raise questions of fundamental fairness at the heart of his campaign.\"\n— Bo Erickson contributed to this report",

And if they're not going to work, maybe that business cuts its hours.\"\nJuggling parenting and work, while figuring out childcare arrangements is stressful for Juan Sebastian Cordova, a server and bartender at Mac's.\n\"It's continuous work with our schedules, our work, our managers,\" said Cordova, whose wife is also in the restaurant industry.\nThey stagger their shifts so one of them can be with their two daughters, who are six and 14 years old.\n\"It's quite a bit of a sacrifice and we definitely need help from everyone we can get,\" he said. \"Usually our mothers.\"\nThey're lucky to have family who can help fill in the gaps. Childcare centers cost an average of $611 per child, per month in Texas.\nInfant care is even more expensive at more than $9,000 a year, according to a policy brief recently published by the University of Texas at Austin. That's a higher cost than a year of in-state tuition at a four-year public college.\nThe expense is a huge burden for many families.\nOn top of the cost, there are holidays, sick days, and unexpected events to work around. Sometimes Cordova has no choice but to call out to take care of his kids.\n\"There are days when I just may not be able to work or she may not be able to work and that's just something we have to do,\" Cordova said.\nHe isn't alone. Nearly 75 percent of parents in Texas reported missing work in the past three months when surveyed for a report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation. Close to seven percent chose to leave their jobs entirely because of childcare struggles.\n\"It costs companies a lot of money when they either can't fill vacant positions or when they lose talented folks and then have to do the whole recruitment, hiring and retraining process,\" said Kelsey Erickson Streufert, the chief public affairs officer for the Texas Restaurant Association. \"And restaurants experience that every day.\"\nThe Texas Restaurant Association helped launch the Employers for Childcare Task Force this year.\nMore than 50 restaurants – including Mac's on Main, chambers of commerce, financial groups and a variety of other businesses across the state are teaming up to tackle this issue.\n\"You're already paying for this dysfunctional system,\" Streufert said. \"You're paying for it in employee turnover and the retraining costs and all those costs you bear to hire folks. So if we can shift the focus from the Band-Aids and plugging of the holes if you will, and actually come up with a workable model, that's going to be a cost savings – not only for individual businesses, but for our state as a whole.\"\nIt's the first time the business community is making a unified effort to lobby state lawmakers for change. The task force plans to spend the next year developing public policy options to advocate for during the upcoming 2025 legislative session.\n\"We brag a lot about Texas being pro-business, the best place to have a business, but if we don't tackle this challenge, we cannot maintain that momentum, especially when states all around us are making significant investments in childcare,\" said Streufert.\nCordova is glad the problem is getting the attention it deserves.\n\"Every parent knows it takes a lot to raise a kid,\" he said. \"We're not special. But it would definitely help us out to have peace of mind when it comes to childcare issues.\"\nHe's optimistic something will be done to improve the situation for working families.\nAdvocates say the need for change is even more urgent after the pandemic. Thousands of childcare centers and licensed family homes across the state permanently shut down, leaving Texas with 27 percent fewer childcare programs.\nThe state has made some efforts to alleviate the burdens on childcare providers.\nLast November, almost 65% of voters approved a constitutional amendment allowing local governments to give some property tax exemptions to certain childcare facilities.\nHowever, not all counties and cities in North Texas have opted into utilizing that policy yet.\nThe task force hopes to make childcare reform one of the top issues for the legislature when it reconvenes in January 2025.",

            "summary": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\nThe Federal Reserve could cut rates at some point later this year, and if it does, it could have a hefty impact on CD and high-yield savings account rates.\nGetty Images\nWith the economy improving and inflation down quite a bit since its peak a few years ago, some experts think that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates later on this year. Should that happen, rates on high-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) are likely to fall, too. Opinions on rate cuts in 2024 are mixed, however, as the inflation rate has ticked back up over the last couple of months.\nStill, if rate cuts do occur, they could have a big impact on these types of deposit accounts. Right now, the average regular savings account offers just 0.46%, but it's easy to find high-yield savings accounts offering rates that are 10 to 12 times higher than the rates offered on regular savings accounts. And, depending on the CD term, rates on CD accounts can be even higher than what's being offered on high-yield savings accounts. So a rate cut in the future could mean earning less on these types of accounts.\nBut how far will these rates fall if the Fed makes that move? And will both types of accounts be affected similarly?\nCompare your top account options online now to earn more on your savings.\nCDs vs. high-yield savings accounts: What to consider if the Fed cuts rates\nHere's what you need to know — and which option you should focus on to be prepared if the Fed cuts rates.\nThe fall has already begun\nThe Fed has indicated over the last few months that rate cuts could be on the horizon. As such, some banks have already started adjusting savings rates in preparation.\n\"Savings account rates and CD rates have already started to fall just due to the expectation that the Fed will start cutting rates sometime this year,\" says Ken Tumin, president of bank review platform DepositAccounts. \"The fall of online deposit rates in the first quarter of 2024 shows that banks will likely cut rates quickly when the Fed starts cutting.\"\nThose cuts could be drawn out, too.\n\"Based on current data, it appears likely that the Fed will cut rates this year by one to three times at about 0.25% each time. It appears they have the ability to be patient, and history shows that the risks of moving too fast, especially when the labor market is holding at the target level and the economy is growing,\" Stacy Johnson, senior portfolio manager at TIAA in Minneapolis, explains.\nFind out the best CD rates you could earn on your savings now.\nLower savings account rates will be felt faster\nBoth savings account and CD rates will fall once the Fed starts making its moves, but experts say it's likely savings account rates will drop faster. This is because rates on these accounts are variable, and banks can implement them immediately with existing customers.\nCD rates, on the other hand, are locked in for months or even years. Due to this, lower CD rates will only be felt for those opening new accounts — not those who already have CDs in place.\n\"High-yield savings accounts tend to be more responsive to changes in the Fed's rates because they are more closely tied to the short-term interest rates that the Fed influences,\" says Leslie Tayne, a financial attorney in New York. \"CDs, particularly those with longer terms, might not immediately reflect rate cuts.\"\nOne locks in your rate longer\nWith rates poised to potentially fall on both CDs and savings accounts, understanding how the two differ will be critical if you're opening a new account.\nOn CDs, you're guaranteed a fixed interest rate for the entire account term. It may be for one month or three months, or it could be for up to 10 years. For this reason, they may be better options now, as most experts see rate cuts on the horizon.\n\"CD rates are likely to continue to fall this year,\" Tumin says. \"So buying a CD as early as you can will keep you earning a relatively high rate well after the series of Fed rate cuts take place.\"\nSavings accounts, on the other hand, have rates that shift often based on market conditions. This means you'll feel the brunt of rate cuts more quickly.\nThe perk, however, is that you retain access to your money no matter what. Unlike CDs, there are no penalties for withdrawing funds at any point.\n\"It's important to choose a CD that fits within your savings timeline and doesn't lock up your money for too long, otherwise you'll have to pay an early withdrawal penalty to get your money out sooner,\" Tayne says. \"One strategy that can mitigate this risk is CD laddering, or spreading out your savings across multiple CDs with varying terms.\"\nThe bottom line\nRate cuts may coming at some point, but with rates as high as they are now, they should remain beneficial for any consumer looking to grow their wealth. Just keep in mind: The longer you wait, the more likely rates will fall, so if you're eyeing a CD or savings account, opening one now may be the best way to maximize your interest earned. You should also shop around for your account, as fees and rates vary from one bank to the next. In many cases, online banks offer the highest APYs, as they have lower overhead costs.",

For one, the latest version gives TikTok's owner more time to divest, providing 9 months for a sale with the potential for an additional 3 month grace period, according to a copy of the bill released on Wednesday.\nThe earlier bill would have given ByteDance six months to divest TikTok or face a nationwide ban.",

So we submitted our amendment and they took it into consideration and it looks like it's getting ready to happen, so I'm excited,\" Tiffany Fulton of Silent Voices United said.\nState Assemblywoman Jennifer Rajkumar introduced the Smokeout Act earlier in the year. If passed, it would allow local municipalities to shutter smoke shops caught selling illegal cannabis products.\nGov. Kathy Hochul has said she wants to make it easier to for authorities to get court orders to padlock the illegal shops. She's also asked companies like Google and Yelp to make sure the illegal shops are excluded from search results.\nA survey released in March showed illegal marijuana shops are on the rise in New York City. New York City Councilmember Gale Brewer has said part of the problem is that New York City can't enforce strict cannabis rules, and amendments to the state's cannabis law are needed.\nThe operator of a legal cannabis dispensary said the illicit shops hurt New York's economy.\n\"It's going to be a $7 billion industry in New York state, and so you're diverting taxes away from public good,\" Housing Works president Matthew Bernardo said in March.\nIn Nov. 2023, officials estimated there were some 1,500 illegal marijuana shops citywide.",

            "summary": "Ever dream of working from the picturesque Amalfi Coast? You might now be able to with a new \"digital nomad\" visa that Italy is offering foreigners who wish to pack up their laptops and venture abroad.\nThe Italian government signed the program into law in March 2022, but only opened applications on April 5 — nearly two years later. In doing so, Italy follows dozens of other countries in establishing a program to attract foreign remote workers who want to experience a European lifestyle while keeping their earnings tied to U.S.-based companies.\nDrawing foreigners in can help boost local economies, particularly in smaller Italian towns where populations are dwindling as local residents age. But some experts warn that an influx of people earning U.S. salaries could drive up prices for local residents earning far less.\nThe new digital nomad visas are valid for one year, and can be renewed.\nAm I eligible?\nApplicants must meet a range of criteria in order to be eligible for the visas. For one, a worker must have the ability to do their job remotely, using a laptop or other tech tools. Workers must also be able to provide proof of employment or contract work with a firm based outside of Italy. Both employees of companies and freelance workers are invited to apply.\nCandidates must have either a college-level degree or the equivalent in job experience. Additionally, a worker must be able to demonstrate that they've perviously worked remotely for a period of at least six months.\nThere's an income threshold, too, of roughly $30,000 to apply. And, you can't have been convicted of a crime within the past five years. You must also have health insurance, and be able to demonstrate that you have a place to live in Italy.\nHow do I apply?\nVisit your local Italian consulate's website for instructions, which vary by location. While application forms vary by consulate, the Italian consulate in New York has a form on its site that asks for basic information like one's place of birth and passport information.\nThe application fee is just over $120, according to Italian law firm Studio Legale Metta.\nWithin eight days of arrival in Italy, digital nomads must also apply for a residence permit.\nPreviously Italy had a 90 day rule that meant visitors could only stay for that long without a work visa.",

I am a big swiftie at heart,\" said Alyssia Miller De Rutte, the professor of the course at CSU.\nMiller De Rutte said the idea of the course isn't new, as other universities already offer courses that examine Taylor Swift's career.\nHowever, she said this is the first course in the United States that is using Swift's influence to further educate students in Spanish.\n\"It is a little bit of everything. And it is designed to show students what you can do with linguistics outside of school,\" Miller De Rutte told CBS News Colorado's Dillon Thomas.\nSwift is releasing her latest album on Thursday night, with many students on campus at CSU saying they were hosting listening parties at the 10 p.m. release time.\n\"I have grown up with her music. So, her releasing a new album with new songs, it is a big deal,\" said Avery Coates, a junior at CSU. \"I am super excited. I am planning on having a listening party with my roommates.\"\nMost students Thomas spoke with said they didn't even know their university was offering any courses about Taylor Swift.\n\"I didn't know,\" said Anna Shikuma, a junior. \"That is pretty cool.\"\nThe course is a 300-level class that will only have room for 20 students. The students must have intermediate Spanish speaking experience in order to qualify for the course.\nWhen asked why CSU needed a course for students to study Swift in Spanish, Mille De Rutte said she had one simple answer.\n\"Why not, is my answer. Why not build proficiency, learn a language, learn about culturally impact and global economies in another language?\" Miller De Rutte said.\nAs of right now, CSU only plans to offer the course for the summer semester of 2024. However, depending on interest from the students, there is hope that the course will be extended.\nTaylor Swift has an upcoming concert in Madrid, a concert in which students and educators plan to use as material in their summer course.\n\"I think it is awesome. I have been wanting them to do a Taylor Swift course. I may have to look at my schedule and change it around,\" Coates said.\nFor more information on the course check out the Spanish For Swiftie Purposes flyer.",

            "summary": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\nIf you want to buy 1-ounce gold bars now that prices are surging, there are lots of good options to choose from.\nGetty Images\nGold has long been sought after by investors due to its intrinsic value, the finite supply and the multiple benefits it offers. But with persistent inflation and high rates now impacting the economy, gold has become even more alluring to investors, especially those who are focused on protecting their portfolios.\nThis uptick in interest has had a big impact on the price trends recently. With more investors flocking to the precious metal, the price of gold has hit several new milestones in recent weeks, starting with a new record high of $2,160 per ounce in early March — up from just over $1,990 per ounce in mid-February. And, since that time, the value of gold has continued its upward trend and is now hovering just under $2,400 per ounce.\nConsidering today's economic conditions, it's likely that the uptick in gold demand will continue, at least over the short term. So, it could be a smart time to buy in and capitalize on any future price increases that may occur. There are lots of gold investing options to choose from, but if you're looking for 1-ounce gold bars in particular, there are several good buying options available to you.\nFind out what your best gold investing options are online now.\nGold prices are surging: Where to buy 1-ounce gold bars now\nHere are some of the top options to consider if you want to buy 1-ounce gold bars right now:\nOnline gold retailers\nA wide variety of online gold dealers specialize in the sale of precious metals, including 1-ounce gold bars. These platforms often have a vast selection of gold options to choose from and may offer convenient shipping options, making them a popular choice for investors who prefer the ease and flexibility of online shopping.\nThe main benefit of purchasing 1-ounce gold bars from an online retailer is the convenience and accessibility it provides. These platforms typically offer a broader selection of products and may be able to provide more competitive pricing due to their economies of scale.\nHowever, there are some potential drawbacks, such as the possibility of shipping delays and concerns about the authenticity of the gold bars, which can be especially concerning for first-time gold buyers.\nFind out more about how gold investing could benefit your portfolio today.\nPrecious metal dealers\nDedicated precious metals dealers are another option for those looking to purchase 1-ounce gold bars. These companies typically have deep expertise in the market and can provide guidance on the best purchase options, as well as information on the current market trends and economic factors influencing gold prices.\nInvesting in 1-ounce gold bars through a specialized precious metals dealer can be advantageous for those seeking personalized advice and a high level of expertise. These dealers often have a strong understanding of the market dynamics and can assist you with guidance about your purchases. That said, the selection at precious metal dealers may be more limited compared to larger online retailers, and the prices may be slightly higher due to higher overhead and the added value of the dealer's expertise and services.\nLocal coin shops\nMany local coin shops offer 1-ounce gold bars for sale. These establishments can provide personalized service and may offer competitive prices, particularly for those willing to negotiate. The employees also typically have deep expertise in the precious metals market and can provide valuable insights to help you make informed purchasing decisions.\nThe main advantage of buying from a local coin shop is the opportunity to interact with knowledgeable dealers who can walk you through the purchase process and provide recommendations based on your specific needs. And, these shops may be more willing to negotiate on prices, allowing you to potentially get a better deal.\nThe selection of gold bars may be more limited at local coin shops, though, and the inventory may be less consistent compared to larger retailers or online platforms. So, keep those factors in mind when determining where to buy your 1-ounce gold bars.\nBanks\nSome banks also offer the sale of 1-ounce gold bars. While the prices may not be as competitive as other options, the convenience and security of purchasing through a financial institution may be appealing to some investors, especially those who prioritize the institutional backing and reputation of the seller.\nBuying 1-ounce gold bars through a bank can provide a sense of security and reliability to you as an investor. And, the institutional reputation and regulatory oversight of banks can offer peace of mind, especially if you're unfamiliar with the precious metals market. The downside is that the selection and pricing may not be as favorable as other options, and the convenience factor may be outweighed by the potential for higher costs.\nRetailers like Costco and Walmart\nCostco began selling 1-ounce gold bars to its members on its website late last year, and demand from its members was so high that the warehouse retailer had trouble keeping gold in stock. Since that point, Costco has begun selling other precious metals, including silver coins, in addition to its gold offerings.\nIf you're a Costco member, the convenience and competitive pricing of purchasing 1-ounce gold bars through the warehouse club can make it an attractive option. However, the high demand and limited inventory can be a drawback, as you may have to wait for new stock to become available or face the possibility of missing out on a purchase altogether.\nAnother major retailer that recently entered the gold market is Walmart, and the company's vast presence makes it an accessible option for those seeking to buy 1-ounce gold bars. Still, the retailer's selection of precious metals may be more limited compared to specialized dealers.\nThe bottom line\nAs the price of gold continues to rise, the demand for physical gold bars is likely to remain strong. So, it could be a good time to invest in gold bars to diversify your portfolio and gain the many other benefits of gold investing. But when considering where to buy 1-ounce gold bars, it's important to research each option carefully and compare prices, premiums and delivery times. And, be sure to only purchase from reputable and trusted sources to ensure the authenticity and quality of the gold bars. That way, you can be sure that the moves you're making will help maximize your investment potential.",

On Tuesday, April 23, the center will be open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on weekdays until further notice.\nLast week, the Maryland Department of Labor announced the launch of the Workers Retention Program to help Port of Baltimore businesses keep their employees as the Port recovers from Key Bridge collapse.\nThree additional programs established by the governor's executive order and authorized by the PORT Act will launch on Monday, April 22, through the Maryland Department of Commerce and the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development.\n\"Port of Baltimore workers are critical to our state and our economy. It's urgent we get them the financial help they need now to support their families as they remain ready and available to get back to work when the Port fully reopens,\" Portia Wu, Maryland Secretary of Labor, said.\nInformation on the Port of Baltimore Worker Support Program, including the application, can be found at labor.maryland.gov/portworkersupport.",

The program was initiated by the city last year to highlight businesses making a difference.\nMolly Duplechian with Denver's Department of Excise and Licenses says they created the program so consumers can learn about these businesses and shop where their values align.

            "summary": "Tokyo — In North Korea, the release of Taylor Swift's new double album was completely eclipsed by the surprise drop of another brand-new song, complete with an elaborately produced music video. There were no tortured poets in sight for the release of \"Friendly Father,\" an energetic pop-style piece of state propaganda praising North Korea's dictatorial leader Kim Jong Un.\nThe accompanying music video, dropped on the North Korean public by its state-controlled media this week, features dozens of seemingly ecstatic residents of all ages belting out catchy lines such as: \"May this night never end, dear beautiful night of Pyongyang. The people believe and follow him with one heart! Let's boast of Kim Jong Un, a friendly father!\"\nThe tune has all the subtlety of a beerhall polka — and the makings of a propaganda classic.\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as seen in a photo featured in a music video for a propaganda song released by the country's state-run media on April 19, 2024, entitled \"Friendly Father.\"\nReuters/KRT\n\"Friendly Father\" was also performed live at a lavish event, clips of which were aired by North Korean state TV, to mark the opening of a new apartment complex said to contain 10,000 homes in the capital, Pyongyang.\nKim, as portly as ever and wearing a black leather jacket, was pictured arriving at the ceremony in an armored limousine believed to have been gifted to him by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nThe video, featuring cheering soldiers, beaming children, amped-up pop singers and an ecstatic marching band, was professionally shot and edited. Analysts say it's part of a push to recreate and reenergize the leadership cult around Kim, whose family has ruled over North Korea since the country's founding in 1948.\nThe happy utopia it depicts, however, is a cruel lie, and it likely won't fool many people inside or outside the Hermit Kingdom.\nNot far beyond the cheering crowds and shiny new buildings, more than 25 million North Koreans live in crumbling housing with restricted access to health care and modern amenities, and no freedom of movement or expression.\nNorth Korea remains one of the poorest countries on earth. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization said almost half of its population was undernourished as recently as 2022.\nMore recent statistics aren't available, as Kim sealed his country's borders completely during the pandemic.\nSince then, the Kim regime has spent vast amounts of money on fencing and guard posts along North Korea's border with China, to stop its people from escaping. While his country's sanctions-battered economy languishes, the \"Friendly Father\" has also lavished fortunes on developing and test-firing ballistic missiles designed to carry nuclear warheads.\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un is seen in a music video for a propaganda song released by the country's state-run media on April 19, 2024, entitled \"Friendly Father.\"\nReuters/KRT\nKim may come off in the video as a good sport with a bad haircut, but if — as the song says — people follow him, it's because they have no choice. He will stop at nothing to stay in power.",

            "excerpt": "Hogan hopes to become the first Republican in more than 40 years to win a Senate seat in deep-blue Maryland, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1 statewide.",
            "summary": "STEVENSVILLE, Md. (AP) — Andy DePaola welcomed Larry Hogan to his family's restaurant with a big smile and a handshake. The warning came a few minutes later.\nDePaola, the 64-year-old namesake of DePaola's Bagel and Brunch here in Maryland's conservative Eastern Shore, whispered to a reporter that Hogan better avoid disparaging former President Donald Trump.\n\"I'm a Trumper,\" DePaola said as Hogan posed for pictures and made small talk with the excited breakfast crowd on a recent Friday morning. \"I think Larry would be better off if he kept how he felt about Trump under his breath.\"\nThe brief exchange during a weeks-long bus tour illustrates a stark political reality for the popular Republican former governor, who has single-handedly transformed Maryland's sleepy Senate race into a top-tier contest in the national fight for the Senate majority. Hogan, who was perhaps the most outspoken anti-Trump Republican governor in the nation, can ill afford to lose any pieces of his delicate and diverse political coalition.\nHe's hoping to become the first Republican in more than 40 years to win a Senate seat in this deep-blue state, where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1 statewide, with much of the Democratic support in Baltimore and the suburbs of Washington. Over the next six months, Hogan will have to fend off political threats from all sides.\nAs Trump loyalists eye the 67-year-old businessman with skepticism, Democrats are counting on abortion rights to make Hogan's historic challenge even harder. But the R after his name may ultimately prove the most serious liability for Hogan in a state Trump lost by 33 points four years ago.\nIf Hogan wins Maryland's open Senate seat, Republicans would almost certainly claim the majority in the U.S. Senate — and with it, the power to control the agenda and judicial nominations for the next two years, at least.\nIn an interview, Hogan confirmed he would caucus with Republicans in Washington, despite his concerns about Trump's grip on the party. He also vowed not to leave the GOP after the election, even if Trump returns to the White House.\n\"I'm a real Republican,\" Hogan told The Associated Press, noting that he does not identify with Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement.\nWhen pressed to explain his concerns about MAGA, and whether he views Trump as a threat to U.S. democracy, Hogan parsed his words carefully.\n\"I think certainly there has been some threats,\" Hogan said. \"But you know, I think that's not what this campaign is really all about.\"\nMeanwhile, Hogan's opponents on the left are only just beginning to organize as Democrats wade through their own nomination process. While Hogan faces token opposition in the GOP, Democrats will pick Hogan's general election opponent next month.\nOn Tuesday, a coalition of labor, immigration and progressive groups gathered in the state capital to criticize the former governor for using his veto powers to block legislation to increase abortion access while undermining other Democratic priorities, including health care, environmental protection and education funding.\nThe anti-Hogan event was a reminder that voters in his gubernatorial elections may have been more willing to overlook party affiliation than they will be in a Senate contest that could tilt the balance of power in Washington toward Republicans.\n\"Despite him claiming to be a moderate, we know his actions show that he's a staunch Republican,\" said 1199 SEIU political director Ricarra Jones, who slammed Hogan's veto of legislation to increase the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\"The Senate race in November is bigger than just Maryland,\" she continued. \"A Republican-dominated Senate would pursue a drastically different agenda, one that could unwind years of progressive achievements and reshape Maryland's policy landscape in ways that could take generations to reverse.\"\nMeanwhile, Hogan is trying to avoid divisive political disputes as he reintroduces himself to Maryland voters during a low-profile \"Back to Work\" bus tour across the state.\nPerhaps the nation's most vocal anti-Trump Republican governor while in office, Hogan barely mentions Trump's name unless asked about him. He's just as eager to ignore abortion, even though Maryland is among the states that will vote on an abortion referendum this fall — a winning issue for Democrats in red and blue states alike where ballot questions have appeared since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022.\nDemocrats suggest he would support a federal abortion ban, but Hogan insisted in an interview that he would not.\nHe also said he strongly supports in-vitro fertilization and would introduce legislation to protect the practice, an apparent attempt to clarify his position after he declined to say in an Axios interview last month whether he would support such federal protections.\nHe also said he \"would consider voting for\" a Maryland ballot measure this fall that would preserve abortion rights, although he argues that it's unnecessary.\nHogan said abortion doesn't comes up much on the campaign trail. He predicted it wouldn't be \"a deciding issue\" in the election.\nAsked about the issues that matter most to him, Hogan said he's most focused on ending the divisiveness in Washington, followed by the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, crime and the economy.\nBut Hogan largely avoided talking politics at all on his weekend bus tour, preferring to connect with voters on a personal level. He was eager to jump behind restaurant counters to chat with the kitchen staff or pose for pictures welcoming small business owners. And voters, regardless of their party affiliation, embraced him enthusiastically at nearly every stop.\nLanda Mitchell, a 46-year-old old African American woman from Hanover, Maryland, flagged down the governor as he toured small business booths at a weekend boat show. She had met him years ago at a fundraiser for the homeless.\nMitchell said she's not a Republican, but she'd likely vote for Hogan.\n\"He's not far right wing. He's over there, but he's not far far over there,\" Mitchell said with a laugh, adding that she's not sure whether she'll support President Joe Biden this fall because of the state of the economy. \"I'm far from a Trump supporter, but I go into the grocery store today and I cry.\"\nCaroline County Sheriff Donald Baker, who welcomed Hogan on a tour through his office, said he also appreciates the former governor's strong support for law enforcement, noting that the sheriff's office didn't get a single applicant for a recent job posting.\n\"It's gonna be a tough road for him to navigate,\" Baker said of Hogan's political challenge. \"If anybody can do it, I believe Larry Hogan can do it. Why? Because he is a middle-of-the-road kind of guy. He knows how to work with people.\"\nAnd as Democrats fight to link him to Trump's Republican Party, Hogan will take pains to distance himself from Trump — but not too far.\n\"We don't want to alienate Trump voters,\" Hogan told the AP. \"We need Trump voters. And we need a lot of Biden voters. Maryland is tough.\"\nBut he doesn't expect Trump or any other MAGA celebrities to campaign in Maryland on his behalf in the coming months. He said he's not sure if he'll even attend this summer's Republican National Convention, where Trump will formally become the GOP presidential nominee; Hogan skipped Trump's last two nominating conventions as well.\n\"I don't think Trump would help me at all. I ran 46 points ahead of him,\" Hogan said, noting that Trump lost Maryland in 2020 by a bigger margin than any other state in the nation. \"I don't think he needs to campaign in Maryland.\"",

That is major,\" she said.\nDuggan said while major improvements have been made, there is still work to do.\n\"[The year] 2024 will be the year we finally rid Detroit of the abandoned and the illegal vehicles.\"\nThe city has increased parking officers to patrol public areas, and the Detroit Police Department now has more code enforcement officers to police abandoned cars on private property.

As well as the restoration of the Brewster Rec Center. It's a place where Dianna Ross used to go and where Joe Louis trained. The building will be restored, including the actual ring that Louis trained in.",

The president told supporters in the crowd that, \"You've had my back and I promise I have your back.\"\n\"The backbone of America has a steel spine,\" Mr. Biden said. \"It really does have a steel spine. You've heard me say it before — Wall Street didn't build America; the middle class built America, and you guys built the middle class — unions built it. And that's why I'm here today: to announce a series of actions that (show) I stand by you, the American steelworker.\"\nMr. Biden said he would urge the U.S. trade representative, Katherine Tai, to triple Chinese steel and aluminum tariffs from their current rate of 7.5% if the USTR finds during an ongoing investigation that the Chinese are exercising anti-competitive trade practices in the steel and aluminum industry. The White House believes American workers face \"unfair competition\" from Chinese imports, and high-quality U.S. products are undercut by \"artificially-low priced\" Chinese alternatives that use higher emissions, according to a White House fact sheet.\nThe president said China is also sending steel and aluminum through Mexico first in order to avoid U.S. tariffs, which the U.S. will be working with Mexico to prevent. Tai is also launching an investigation into China's practices in the maritime, shipbuilding and logistics sectors, the White House says.\nMr. Biden took opportunities during his speech Wednesday to blast former President Donald Trump, whom the president referred to only as \"my predecessor.\" Without mentioning the former president's ongoing criminal trial in New York, Mr. Biden noted that his predecessor is \"busy,\" eliciting laughs from the audience.\n\"Taken together, these are strategic and targeted actions that are going to protect American workers and ensure fair competition,\" Mr. Biden said Wednesday. \"Meanwhile, my predecessor and the MAGA Republicans want across-the-board tariffs on all imports from all countries that could badly hurt American consumers.\"\nThe president later told reporters he's not concerned the potential tariffs could affect his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nPresident Joe Biden, right, and United Steelworkers Union International President, David McCall, center, both step out from behind a curtain to begin to greet steelworkers at United Steelworkers Headquarters, Wednesday, April 17, 2024, in Pittsburgh, Pa.\nAlex Brandon / AP\nThe steel and aluminum announcement comes amid the planned sale of U.S. Steel to the Japanese-owned Nippon Steel, which the president strongly opposes. U.S. Steel should remain an American company, Mr. Biden said Wednesday, and \"that's going to happen, I promise you.\"\nAs the president continues his three-day swing through Scranton, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, his campaign is launching a six-figure, five-day ad blitz highlighting Mr. Biden's pro-labor stances. Pennsylvania is a battleground state this November, with Trump and Mr. Biden neck-and-neck in national polls.\n\"Scranton values or Mar-a-Lago values,\" Mr. Biden said during a speech in Scranton Tuesday, referencing Trump's luxurious Florida resort. \"These are the competing visions for our economy, and they raise questions of fundamental fairness at the heart of his campaign.\"\nBo Erickson contributed to this report",

            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump's allies have been encouraging foreign countries to send diplomats and official emissaries to Mar-a-Lago to reconnect ahead of another potential Trump stint in the White House, sources with direct knowledge of the meetings confirmed to CBS News.\nTrump advisers and allies believe he'll be able to capitalize on the decline in Americans' approval of President Joe Biden's foreign policy decisions. An April CBS News poll found that only 33% of Americans approve of Mr. Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict, down from 44% in October.\nIt is rare for foreign ambassadors and ministers to meet with the presumptive GOP presidential nominee half a year before the presidential election and suggests that they're laying the groundwork for another Trump administration.\n\"The biggest handle Biden had on Trump was that this guy is unpredictable, especially on the world stage,\" said Terry Sullivan, who ran Sen. Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign. \"When you take your opponent's strength and your personal weakness and turn them on their head, that's a big move.\"\nThe 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Sen. Mitt Romney, implemented a similar strategy of meeting foreign leaders shortly before he won the GOP presidential nomination in 2012. On a trip to London for a fundraiser that year, Romney met with several British leaders. At the time, CBS News chief political analyst John Dickerson told \"CBS This Morning\" that Romney's campaign had calibrated his talking points about the meetings to project a presidential aura.\n\"It's something every campaign does to some degree if they can get away with it and show they have gravitas and can handle major foreign policy situations,\" said Sullivan, who also worked on Romney's earlier presidential bid in 2008 and is now a CBS News contributor.\nForeign leaders have made stops at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Florida club, too. The former president recently hosted British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, whose spokesperson said it was \"standard practice for ministers to meet with opposition candidates as part of their routine international engagement.\" The two spoke about the war in Ukraine, NATO spending and upcoming elections, according to the Trump campaign.\nBut unlike recent presidential nominees, Trump has also hosted controversial foreign leaders. The willingness by some Trump advisers to contact these foreign governments reflects the approach another Trump administration could take on foreign policy.\nLast month, the former president hosted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, the closest European Union ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, at Mar-a-Lago. The two also discussed the war in Ukraine, Orban later told state media.\nFormer President Donald Trump with Hungarian President Viktor Orbán.\nScreenshot from Orbán Facebook video\nMr. Biden reacted swiftly, criticizing the rendezvous on the day it took place.\n\"You know who he's meeting with today down at Mar-a-Lago? Orbán of Hungary, who stated flatly he doesn't think democracy works. He's looking for dictatorship,\" Mr. Biden said at a rally near Philadelphia. \"That's who he's meeting with.\"\nTrump also spoke recently with Saudi Arabia's Prince Mohammed bin Salman, The New York Times reported, who was found by U.S. intelligence to have signed off on killing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi,\" a longtime U.S. resident and Washington Post journalist.\nThe former president has also spoken with government officials from other Western countries, including Finland last year, a source familiar with the conversations told CBS News.\nThe outreach by Trump's allies to foreign dignitaries was first reported by Politico.\nIn a CBS News national poll in March, Trump was leading Mr. Biden, as voters remembered the economy under Trump as being better than it is under the president. The Biden campaign and Democratic National Committee are trying to close the gap by exploiting their considerable financial advantage over the Trump campaign and Republican Party, placing multimillion-dollar ad buys in key battleground states.",

Kennedy Jr.'s family, including six of his siblings, are endorsing President Biden in Philadelphia Thursday even as he makes his own bid for Biden's job as an independent candidate.\nKennedy's sister, Kerry Kennedy, is expected to praise Mr. Biden as a leader in the mold of her father, Robert F. Kennedy, who \"stood for equal justice, human rights and freedom from want and fear — just as President Biden does today,\" according to excerpts of her remarks released by the Biden campaign.\nHer father served as attorney general in John F. Kennedy's administration and was running for president himself when he was assassinated in 1968.\nSpeaking for the family members who are endorsing Mr. Biden, Kerry Kennedy will also have harsh words for presumptive Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump.\n\"I can only imagine how Donald Trump's outrageous lies and behavior would have horrified my father,\" she's expected to say, and will accuse Trump of \"running to take us backwards, attacking the most basic rights and freedoms that are core to who we are as Americans.\"\nThe excerpts did not contain any mention of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but several of his family members have already expressed their opposition to his candidacy.\nWhen Kennedy announced in October that he would drop his campaign for the presidency as a Democrat and run instead as an independent, four of his siblings — documentary filmmaker Rory Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, former Rep. Joe Kennedy II and former Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend — called his decision to oppose Mr. Biden \"dangerous to our country.\" In a statement at the time, they said, \"Bobby might share the same name as our father, but he does not share the same values, vision or judgment.\" The four said of his decision to run as an independent that, \"We denounce his candidacy and believe it to be perilous for our country.\"\nIn addition to Kerry Kennedy, RFK Jr.'s siblings, Rory Kennedy, Joe Kennedy II, Christopher Kennedy, Maxwell Kennedy and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, as well as several other relatives, are endorsing Mr. Biden Thursday.\nKennedy said in a social media post Thursday morning that he's \"pleased\" his family is being politically active, calling it a family tradition. He added that they are \"divided in our opinions but united in our love for each other,\" adding that the sentiment could also be shared by Americans to \"restore civility and respect to public discourse.\"\n\"My campaign, which many of my family members are working on and supportive of, is about healing America — healing our economy, our chronic disease crisis, our middle class, our environment, and our standing in the world as a peaceful nation,\" he said.\nMr. Biden's campaign noted that the president has long admired the Kennedys and has cited the Kennedy family's devotion to the causes of justice and human rights.\nThe president has had a bust of Robert F. Kennedy in the Oval Office and has said RFK inspired him to work as a public defender and later run for office.\nA bust of Robert F. Kennedy is visible behind President Biden in the Oval Office as he speaks during a virtual meeting with Ireland's Prime Minister Micheal Martin on St. Patrick's Day, March 17, 2021.\nAndrew Harnik / AP\nLast month, on St. Patrick's Day, Mr. Biden gave members of the extended Kennedy family a private tour of the Oval Office and West Wing and celebrated with them and hundreds of guests at a holiday reception. Kennedy family members posted photos with the president, signaling that they stand with him rather than with the Kennedy running against him.\nSeveral of the Kennedys will be joining Mr. Biden for a grassroots organizing event and will help with voter outreach, according to the campaign.\nKristin Brown, Allison Novelo and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "summary": "President Joe Biden made addressing climate change a key issue in his 2020 campaign. Three years into his presidency, what do those who care about the issue most think about what he's done? How much do they know?\nFew Americans say they've heard a lot about what the administration has done on climate change. That extends to those in the president's own party and to those who rate the issue of climate change as very important. Half of them have heard little or nothing at all about what the administration has done.\nAnd perhaps as a result, those who prioritize climate change are feeling somewhat unsatisfied — more of them feel the president has done too little, rather than the right amount on trying to reduce it.\nBut they do like the Biden administration's policies when they hear about them.\nClimate change: An issue important to Biden's base\nClimate change is not the most important issue for Americans overall; it trails economic issues and matters like crime and immigration. But most Democrats, liberals, those who voted for Mr. Biden in 2020 and many younger people place a lot of importance on the issue. These groups will be crucial to Mr. Biden in November.\nJust 10% of Americans who say climate change is a very important issue have heard or read a lot about what the Biden administration has done so far to deal with it. And when evaluating the Biden administration, many think it has done too little to address it.\nWhen presented with some of the Biden administration's climate change policies, a majority of those who place a lot of importance on climate change — from enhanced regulations, to reducing toxic chemicals in drinking water, to tax rebates for buying an electric vehicle — favored the policies.\nEven people who feel the administration has done too little on climate change support these policies. So this may be more about Mr. Biden needing to get his message out there than having to convince this \"climate constituency\" — those who call the climate issue very important — of the substance of his policies.\nWhat is the \"climate constituency\" looking for?\nNine in 10 of those who call the climate issue very important support the country taking steps to stop or slow the rate of climate change, and if they had to choose, they overwhelmingly would prioritize protecting the earth's climate over energy production.\nAnd most agree with the administration and Democratic leaders that efforts to reduce climate change would help the economy, not hurt it, putting them at odds with those who place little or no importance on the issue.\n2024 presidential candidates and climate change\nWhile this \"climate constituency\" would like to see Mr. Biden do more, they do prefer his approach to climate change and energy policy to former President Donald Trump's. It's the public at large that is not convinced, and that adds up to Mr. Biden running about even with Trump among people who are asked whose approach to the issue they agree with more. More than a quarter pick neither.\nAmericans who think the issue of climate change is very important and those who want an energy policy that moves away from fossil fuels in favor of renewable energy sources prefer Mr. Biden's approach on both climate and energy, while those who place little importance on climate change and who want to encourage greater production of fossil fuels favor Trump's approach.\nThis cuts heavily to partisanship as well, though independents — who think efforts to fight climate change will hurt rather than help their finances — lean more towards Trump's approach than Mr. Biden's.\nLooking ahead, there's skepticism that either candidate can do much about climate change if elected in November.\nOn balance, more think Mr. Biden will slow the rate of climate change and more think Trump will increase it, while half don't think it will make any difference, regardless of who wins in 2024.\nAmericans with a more fatalistic view on climate change — who think humanity can't do anything about climate change or who think it doesn't exist in the first place — are the most likely to say the election will make no difference.\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,230 U.S. adult residents interviewed between April 16-19, 2024. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. The margin of error is ±2.7 points.\nToplines",

            "summary": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\nHomeowners contemplating using their home equity may want to act promptly before the rate climate changes.\nGetty Images\nNews last week that inflation is on the rise again has millions of Americans resetting their expectations. With the latest report showing an uptick in inflation in March, which followed an increase in February, many are now wondering when, exactly, economic relief will come. Higher inflation has led to higher interest rates courtesy of the Federal Reserve, and that benchmark rate range is currently stuck at its highest point in 23 years. But with inflation stubborn, a cut to that rate appears delayed.\nIn a time of higher costs for everyday items and higher rates for borrowing, then, it's worth exploring alternative options. But with the Fed's next meeting set for April 30, it's important to get the timing right. If not, borrowers could risk paying more than they would have if they had acted earlier.\nAgainst this backdrop, it's worth considering a home equity loan before the Fed's April meeting. Below, we'll break down three reasons why you may want to pursue this option now.\nSee what home equity loan interest rate you could secure online today.\nShould you get a home equity loan before the Fed's April meeting?\nHere are three compelling reasons why homeowners may want to turn to their home equity in the next few weeks.\nInterest rates are lower than the alternatives\nHave you seen the interest rate many credit card companies are now charging? The average is over 20%. Personal loans are much better but the average rate there is still in the double digits. Alternatively, both home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) both come with rates under 10% right now. Because your home is the collateral in these circumstances, borrowers can often get a better rate than they would with alternative forms of credit.\nAnd while the rates are competitive right now, circumstances evolve quickly, particularly with another Fed meeting approaching. So it makes sense to lock in a lower rate now while they're still widely available.\nGet started with a home equity loan here now.\nInterest rates may rise yet again\nWhile hope was high at the start of the year that interest rates would be cut in 2024, the trio of recent inflation reports has dashed that optimism. And while many would be surprised to see the Fed hike rates in their April meeting, it's certainly more realistic than many would have thought a few months ago.\nOne Fed official recently floated the idea of no rate cuts at all this year — and that was before the most recent inflation report release. Understanding this dynamic is key, then, and it may be a motivator for homeowners to tap into their home equity while it's still cost-effective to do so.\nYou may have a lot to utilize\nInflation and interest rates haven't been the only big numbers in the news. Recent data has also shown the amount of home equity the average homeowner currently has in their home — and it's significant. With around $299,000 of equity right now, around $190,000 of which can potentially be tapped into, homeowners are sitting on a substantial sum of money to use as they please.\nBut that equity is largely affected by home prices, so it makes sense to use it now, while values are elevated. Any action by the Fed later this month could have a ripple effect across the economy, including the real estate market. Plus, if you use your home equity for specific spring home repairs and renovations, you may be eligible to write the interest off when you file your taxes next year.\nLearn more about home equity loans today.\nThe bottom line\nAll eyes will be on the Federal Reserve at the end of the month as they meet amid a still-inflationary climate. But homeowners in need of extra financing may want to act now before the Fed announces their next move. By being proactive today homeowners can secure a relatively low interest rate on a home equity loan — and they can lock it in ahead of any potential rate increases. And with the average owner currently having a significant amount of equity to utilize, now may be the time to do so. As with all financial considerations, however, it's crucial to weigh home equity borrowing against the risks because you may lose your home if you can't pay back what you borrow on time.",

That has raised concerns among lawmakers and security experts that the Chinese government could tap TikTok's trove of personal data about millions of U.S. users.\nMeanwhile, TikTok has asked its users to contact their lawmakers to argue against the bill's passage, an effort that appears to have failed to sway opinions in Washington, D.C., noted Eurasia Group director Clayton Allen.\nTikTok has sent push alerts to users of the social media platform, urging them to contact their lawmakers about a congressional bill that would require its Chinese owner ByteDance to sell it or face a U.S. ban.\nAimee Picchi\nAs recently as last week, TikTok was sending push notifications to some of its users urging them to reach out to their lawmakers, saying that the bill could \"take away YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT to access TikTok.\"\n\"It's a low-cost exercise if you have access to the user base,\" Allen told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But it seems like it has backfired.\"\nSome lawmakers had argued that TikTok's ability to send bulk push notifications to its users, many of them minors, underscored the risks of the app.\nIn a statement, TikTok said it is \"unfortunate\" that lawmakers are \"using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually.\"\nHere's what to know about what could happen next to the TikTok bill.\nWhen will the Senate vote on the TikTok bill?\nThe Senate is expected to take up the bill as early as Tuesday, although the vote could come on Wednesday, said CBS News congressional correspondent Scott MacFarlane.\nThe clock is ticking on a crucial 24 hours for TikTok, as a bill that could lead to the app being banned in the U.S. is now racing through Congress.@MacFarlaneNews has the latest as the Senate prepares to vote on the bill: pic.twitter.com/VdRT2knKY6\n— CBS News (@CBSNews) April 22, 2024\nPresident Joe Biden has indicated he would sign the bill, which is primarily focused on providing foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel.\nWhy does Congress want to ban TikTok?\nActually, lawmakers want ByteDance to sell its stake in TikTok. Barring such a deal, the legislation would, in fact, ban the social media app in the U.S.\nLawmakers are increasingly concerned about the company's ties in China, with fears that ByteDance or TikTok could share data about U.S. users with China's authoritarian government.\n\"The idea that we would give the Communist Party this much of a propaganda tool, as well as the ability to scrape 170 million Americans' personal data, it is a national security risk,\" Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" on Sunday.\nWhat is the timeline for a possible TikTok sale or shutdown?\nIf passed, the bill would give TikTok's owner nine months to arrange a sale, with the potential for an additional three-month grace period, according to a copy of the bill released earlier this month.\nBut, Allen of Eurasia Group noted, that would put the nine-month mark in mid- to late January, which could also coincide with the U.S. presidential inauguration. If former President Donald Trump wins in November, he could very well take a different tack with TikTok, the analyst noted.\n\"This might become a question for the next administration,\" Allen said. \"Looking at the language of the bill, I'm not sure Trump would be as bound to pursue what the Biden administration would want. He could use it as a point of leverage with China.\"\nIf TikTok is sold, who might buy it?\nLikely bidders include Microsoft, Oracle or private equity groups, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.\nHowever, Ives think ByteDance would be unlikely to sell TikTok with its core algorithms, the vital software that provides video recommendations to users based on their interests and viewing habits.\n\"The value of TikTok would dramatically change without the algorithms and makes the ultimate sale/divestiture of TikTok a very complex endeavor, with many potential strategic/financial bidders waiting anxiously for this process to kick off,\" Ives said in a research note.\nCould other social media platforms benefit from the bill?\nRivals such as Meta could benefit from the bill if it becomes a law, Ives noted.\nWedbush estimates that roughly 60% of TikTok users would shift to Meta's Instagram and Facebook if TikTok went dark in the U.S. Google would also beneti, he added.",

            "summary": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\nThere are a few reasons you may, or may not, want to lock in your mortgage rate before the April Fed meeting.\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\nThe Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings happen regularly, with the next meeting scheduled for April 30, 2024 through May 1, 2024. These meetings are important because the Federal Reserve typically discusses the state of the economy and potential changes to monetary policy. That means the Federal Reserve usually makes federal funds rate decisions at these meetings (whether it will increase, decrease or leave its target rate the same).\nThat's important because the federal funds rate is the primary benchmark rate that consumer interest rates (like mortgage rates) are based on. So, if you're in the market for a new home, it may be wise to lock in your mortgage rate before the April FOMC meeting.\nLock in your mortgage rate now before any potential hikes materialize.\nShould you lock in your mortgage rate before the April Fed meeting?\nWhen you're in the market for a new home, and you're pre-approved for a mortgage, you may have the option to lock your mortgage rate in before you close on the home. That may prove advantageous, especially when mortgage rates are on the rise (which has been the case as of late). Then again, there are valid reasons you may want to hold off on locking your mortgage rate in as well. Here are a few reasons why you may (and why you may not) want to lock in your mortgage rate before the next Fed meeting:\nWhy you may want to lock in your mortgage rate\nPerhaps the biggest reason to lock in your mortgage rate before the April Fed meeting is to guarantee that your rate won't rise. That's a valuable prospect at the moment as 30-year mortgage rates have already climbed from 6.82% on April 4, 2024 to today's average rate of 7.29% - nearly a half a percentage point difference.\nThose rates are largely up as a result of a strong recent jobs report and inflation growth. Should the Federal Reserve suggest it will delay rate cuts following this data, mortgage companies could respond with further increases to the rates they charge. But, if you lock in your rate before the next Fed meeting, you won't be subject to those potentially higher mortgage rates.\n\"If you are in the process of buying a house and have already made a commitment, then I believe it would be prudent to lock in your rates at this point,\" explains Aaron Cirksena, founder and CEO of the financial planning firm, MDRN Capital.\nIt's worth noting that locking in your rate can put more control in your hands. That is, as long as the rate you lock in has a float-down option. If it does, and the average mortgage rate rises, you won't be subject to a higher mortgage rate when you purchase your home. On the other hand, if rates fall, your float-down option means you can take unlock your current rate and secure the new, lower one, instead.\nFinally, mortgage rates are cyclical. So, rates will go through upward and downward cycles. But, locking in your mortgage rate, and even closing on your home, doesn't necessarily mean you'll be stuck paying the rate you locked in or closed on until you pay your home off. Instead, you can refinance your home later, when a downward mortgage rate cycle comes into play.\nTake control of your mortgage rate by locking it in now.\nWhy you may not want to lock in your mortgage rate\nThough it may be wise to lock in your mortgage rate before the April Fed meeting, there are a few reasons you may want to hold off on locking your rate in.\nRates are high : The federal funds rate is frozen at a 23-year high\n: The Rates could fall : The Federal Reserve typically moves the federal funds rate target in response to inflation. When inflation is high, rates tend to rise and when inflation cools, rates tend to fall. So, if inflation cools ahead, lower mortgage rates could be on the horizon\n: The Federal Reserve typically moves the federal funds rate target in response to inflation. When inflation is high, rates tend to rise and when inflation cools, rates tend to fall. So, if inflation cools ahead, Locks are limited: Most lenders make it possible to lock your rate in for anywhere from 30 to 120 days. If you haven't started the house hunt, or are at the very beginning of it, a 30 to 120-day lock could rush your shopping process - which may result in you making rash decisions in an attempt to beat the rate lock deadline.\nCompare your mortgage options today to find out what rate you'll qualify for.\nThe bottom line\nIf you're in the market for a new home, deciding whether or not to lock in your mortgage rate before the April Fed meeting can be tough. On one hand, locking in your mortgage rate guarantees that it won't climb ahead. And, if you have a float-down option, you'll be able to take advantage of a lower mortgage rate if rates do fall before you close on your home. Not to mention, you can always refinance later if more appealing mortgage rates come to fruition.\nOn the other hand, locking in your mortgage rate may not be the best option in today's high interest rate environment. After all, rates could fall ahead. And, since rate locks are relatively limited, locking in yours could rush your house hunting process.\nIf you're not sure whether locking in your rate makes sense or not, get in touch with a mortgage expert now to discuss your options.",

            "summary": "The House passed legislation Saturday that would ban TikTok in the United States if the popular social media platform's China-based owner doesn't sell its stake within a year, but don't expect the app to go away anytime soon.\nThe decision by House Republicans to include TikTok as part of a larger foreign aid package, a priority for President Joe Biden with broad congressional support for Ukraine and Israel, fast-tracked the ban after an earlier version had stalled in the Senate. A standalone bill with a six-month selling deadline passed the House in March by an overwhelming bipartisan vote as both Democrats and Republicans voiced national security concerns about the app's owner, the Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd.\nThe modified measure, passed by a 360-58 vote, now goes to the Senate after negotiations that produced a compromise.\nEven if the legislation becomes law, though, the company would have up to a year to find a buyer and would likely try to challenge the law in court, arguing it would deprive the app's millions of users of their First Amendment rights. Court challenges could significantly delay the timeline set out by Congress or block the law from going into effect.\nThe company lobbied hard against the legislation, pushing the app's 170 million U.S. users — many of whom are young — to call Congress and voice opposition. But the ferocity of the pushback angered lawmakers on Capitol Hill, where there is broad concern about Chinese threats to the U.S. and where few members use the platform themselves.\nTikTok.\nCBS News\n\"We will not stop fighting and advocating for you,\" TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said in a video that was posted on the platform last month and directed toward the app's users. \"We will continue to do all we can, including exercising our legal rights, to protect this amazing platform that we have built with you.\"\nThe bill's quick path through Congress is extraordinary because it targets one company and because Congress has taken a hands-off approach to tech regulation for decades. Lawmakers have failed to act despite efforts to protect children online, safeguard users' privacy and make companies more liable for content posted on their platforms, among other measures.\nThe TikTok ban reflects widespread concerns from lawmakers about China.\nMembers of both parties, along with intelligence officials, have worried that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over American user data or direct the company to suppress or boost TikTok content favorable to its interests. TikTok has denied assertions that it could be used as a tool of the Chinese government and has said it has not shared U.S. user data with Chinese authorities.\nThe U.S. government has not publicly provided evidence that shows TikTok shared U.S. user data with the Chinese government or tinkered with the company's popular algorithm, which influences what Americans see.\nThe company has good reason to think a legal challenge could be successful, having seen some success in previous legal fights over its operations in the U.S.. In November, a federal judge blocked a Montana law that would ban TikTok use across the state after the company and five content creators who use the platform sued.\nIn 2020, federal courts blocked an executive order issued by then-President Donald Trump to ban TikTok after the company sued on the grounds that the order violated free speech and due process rights. His administration brokered a deal that would have had U.S. corporations Oracle and Walmart take a large stake in TikTok. The sale never went through for a number of reasons; one was China, which imposed stricter export controls on its technology providers.\nDozens of states and the federal government have put in place TikTok bans on government devices. Texas' ban was challenged last year by The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which argued in a lawsuit that the policy was impeding academic freedom because it extended to public universities. In December, a federal judge ruled in favor of the state.\nOrganizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union have backed the app. \"Congress cannot take away the rights of over 170 million Americans who use TikTok to express themselves, engage in political advocacy, and access information from around the world,\" said Jenna Leventoff, a lawyer for the group.\nSince mid-March, TikTok has spent $5 million on TV ads opposing the legislation, according to AdImpact, an advertising tracking firm. The ads have included a range of content creators, including a nun, extolling the positive impacts of the platform on their lives and arguing a ban would trample on the First Amendment. The company has also encouraged its users to contact Congress, and some lawmakers have received profanity-laced calls.\n\"It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,\" said Alex Haurek, a spokesman for the company.\nNadya Okamoto, a content creator who has roughly 4 million followers on TikTok, said she has been having conversations with other creators who are experiencing \"so much anger and anxiety\" about the bill and how it's going to impact their lives. The 26-year-old, whose company \"August\" sells menstrual products and is known for her advocacy around destigmatizing menstrual periods, makes most of her income from TikTok.\n\"This is going to have real repercussions,\" she said.",

Kennedy Jr., as she stood alongside the president.\n\"We want to make crystal clear our feelings that the best way forward for America is to reelect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to four more years,\" she added.\nKerry Kennedy praised Mr. Biden as a \"hero,\" and she referred to him as a leader in the mold of her father, Robert F. Kennedy, who \"stood for equal justice, human rights and freedom from want and fear — just as President Biden does today.\"\nHer father served as attorney general in John F. Kennedy's administration and was running for president himself when he was assassinated in 1968.\nSpeaking for the family members who are endorsing Mr. Biden, Kerry Kennedy had harsh words for presumptive Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump.\n\"I can only imagine how Donald Trump's outrageous lies and behavior would have horrified my father,\" she said, and she accused Trump of \"running to take us backwards, attacking the most basic rights and freedoms that are at the core of who we are as Americans.\" She accused Trump of planning to \"use his power to punish his enemies, silence his opponents and incite more chaos.\"\nShe did not mention her brother's presidential run. On Thursday, RFK Jr. qualified for the ballot in Michigan, as the nominee of the Natural Law Party, the office of the secretary of state confirmed. He is now on the ballot in two states, having qualified in Utah, too.\nJoseph P.

You put the name Kennedy on the ballot and Democrats are going to feel torn. We are trying to make them understand that this is an issue that they do not have to feel torn about,\" he told reporters while attending a post-rally meet-and-greet with Philadelphia voters.\nDuring the rally, Mr. Biden called the endorsement by the Kennedy family members \"an incredible honor\" and throughout his speech, he spoke of about how Robert F. Kennedy had been a hero to him. He cited a speech Robert F. Kennedy delivered in Indianapolis the night that Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated.\nMr. Biden also mentioned that in the Oval Office, he has busts of both King and Robert F. Kennedy. \"I keep looking to remind myself of what they would do in tough calls,\" he said.\nHe also said he spoke recently with Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F. Kennedy, to wish her a happy 96th birthday.\n\"Your dad, I never got to meet him,\" Mr. Biden told the Kennedys, but recalled a visit by Robert F. Kennedy to Syracuse while he was in law school. \"But he inspired me. And his passion and clarity inspired a generation.\"\nSeveral of RFK Jr.'s family members have already expressed their opposition to their brother's independent candidacy. When he announced in October that he would drop his campaign for the presidency as a Democrat and run instead as an independent, four of his siblings — documentary filmmaker Rory Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, former Rep. Joe Kennedy II and former Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend — called his decision to oppose Mr. Biden \"dangerous to our country.\" In a statement at the time, they said, \"Bobby might share the same name as our father, but he does not share the same values, vision or judgment.\" The four said of his decision to run as an independent that, \"We denounce his candidacy and believe it to be perilous for our country.\"\nIn addition to Kerry Kennedy, RFK Jr.'s siblings, Rory Kennedy, Joe Kennedy II, Christopher Kennedy, Maxwell Kennedy and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, as well as several other relatives, endorsed Mr. Biden Thursday.\nKennedy said in a social media post Thursday morning that he's \"pleased\" his family is being politically active, calling it a family tradition. He added that they are \"divided in our opinions but united in our love for each other,\" adding that the sentiment could also be shared by Americans to \"restore civility and respect to public discourse.\"\n\"My campaign, which many of my family members are working on and supportive of, is about healing America — healing our economy, our chronic disease crisis, our middle class, our environment, and our standing in the world as a peaceful nation,\" he said.\nA bust of Robert F.

The results will be certified if no objections are filed within five days.\nVW thanked its workers for voting in the \"democratic election,\" the company said in a brief statement.\n\"Congratulations to the workers at Volkswagen in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on their historic vote for union representation with the United Auto Workers,\" President Biden said in a statement late Friday.\n\"Pivotal moment\"\nDespite the obstacles to organizing labor in the South, \"The UAW showed last night we need to go and rethink all those negative statements that we've been telling workers that it can't be done,\" Sharon Block, professor and executive director the Center for Labor and a Just Economy, Harvard University Law School, said on Saturday in a call organized by the Economic Speakers Bureau.\n\"Companies like VW have a long legacy of going to the South to chase those lower wages. I've interviewed workers who thought it was illegal to unionize in the South,\" said Alex Hertel-Fernandez, associate professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University.\n\"This is a pivotal moment for the workers in Chattanooga, but much more broadly for workers in the South and for organized labor more generally,\" Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, told CBS MoneyWatch.\nThe chances for a UAW win were seen as high, given that about 70% of the plant's workers pledged to vote in favor of unionization before it requested the vote, according to the union. Voting that began on Wednesday concluded Friday at 8 p.m. Eastern time.\n\"We are going to win this, with the support we've gotten over the past week from our co-workers, from people who were on the fence,\" Victor Vaughn, an employee at the plant for nearly two years and a member of the organizing committee, said before the ballots were counted. \"We are very intelligent, hard workers, family-oriented and we care about our jobs. That is what we're doing throughout the South.\"\nPeople celebrate while watching the vote tally at a United Auto Workers (UAW) vote watch party on April 19, 2024, in Chattanooga, Tennessee.Job safety and health care costs are two of the primary issues that workers at the plant hope to address, Vaughn added. At the time VW proposed an 11% wage increase late last year, workers were unaware the company planned to hike health insurance premiums 15%, Vaughn said.\n\"That was a shock to a lot of us,\" he said.\n\"If they can't organize at Volkswagen, you'd have to question their ability to organize at any of these Southern auto plants,\" John Logan, chair of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University, told CBS MoneyWatch.\nA regional foothold?\nThe UAW for decades has unsuccessfully attempted to organize at auto factories in the South, making progress only at a few heavy truck and bus plants in the region. The vote is the UAW's third try at the plant, where workers narrowly spurned union membership in both 2014 and 2019. The UAW was also defeated in a 2017 vote at a Nissan plant in Canton, Mississippi.\nThe UAW win gives the union a key foothold in the region, where organizing usually means fighting not only the company but the entire community, including the political and business establishment, Logan said.\n\"When we secure our contract with the UAW, I think it is going to open the door for so many other plants, Mercedes-Benz included,\" said Vaughn, referencing an upcoming election next month by autoworkers at Mercedes plant in Vance and Woodstock, Alabama.\nEarlier in the week, the governors of six states — Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas — decried the unionization effort, saying it jeopardized jobs.\n\"Interest in the UAW has been fueled by spectacular gains in the Detroit Three contract talks last year. Almost all 13 of the non-union automakers have boosted wages to diminish interest in organizing and these gains are widely referred to as the 'UAW bump,' Shaiken said. \"Paradoxically, automakers are confirming the UAW does deliver.\"\nIn the case of Germany's Volkswagen, which has unionized workers around the globe, the opposition to the UAW's efforts has been less fierce than those seen with other corporate entities, Logan noted.\nIn fact, the Chattanooga plant is Volkswagen's sole facility of about 120 globally that does not have some form of employee representation.\nFain thanked a VW German works council — an elected group of employees who collaborate with a company's management on behalf of workers — for going to bat for the UAW in its campaign in Chattanooga.\n\"That's what a global movement looks like, these companies are global, they take us on globally, and we have to stand together and fight back globally, and that's what we are doing now,\" he said.",

            "excerpt": "President Biden believes painting former President Trump as a \"threat\" to democracy is a crucial contrast to highlight in his campaign.",
            "summary": "When Vice President Kamala Harris dropped by a campaign office in Madison, Wisconsin, in March, those who attended were handed some poster board and asked to write down why they're supporting President Joe Biden's reelection.\nDemocratic voter Frank Pohlkamp wrote, \"because democracy matters.\"\n\"There was quite a bit of planning [from Trump's side] that went into the idea of the transfer of power,\" Pohlkamp said of the period between the 2020 election and the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the U.S. Capitol. \"That is concerning to me. The rule of law and democracy matters to the United States.\"\nFormer President Donald Trump has placed Jan. 6 at the center of his presidential campaign, as both he and other Republicans downplay the severity of the attack and the baseless claims of election fraud that inspired it.\nMr. Biden believes reminding voters again about this rhetoric from Trump, and painting him as a \"threat\" to democracy is a crucial contrast to highlight. It's a variation on the theme of his 2020 campaign, which he referred to as a fight for the \"soul of the nation,\" and one that he returned to during the 2022 midterm elections.\nBut beyond Democratic base voters like Pohlkamp, it remains to be seen whether a focus on Jan. 6 is an effective argument in the rematch against Trump, since voters may be facing more immediate concerns, such as the economy and cost of living.\n\"Absolutely we have to focus on pocketbook issues,\" said Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is running for reelection in the battleground state of Wisconsin. \"But if you don't have your democracy, those may pale in comparison at some point in the future.\"\nTrump has said one of his \"first acts\" if elected this November would be to free January 6 \"hostages.\" At a March rally in Ohio, he saluted a rendition of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" performed by a choir of men imprisoned for their alleged involvement on Jan. 6. He has said if he doesn't win in November, he doesn't think there will be \"another election in this country.\"\nLast Friday, Trump held a press conference with GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson at his Florida Mar-a-Lago residence to announce a new \"election integrity\" bill that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote, though it has been illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections for decades.\nWhile a CBS News January poll showed Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the attacks on Jan. 6, polling reveals a mixed picture of who voters think would be \"better\" for democracy, despite Trump's role in creating and spreading election denialism.\nIn a March CBS News poll of voters in the battleground state of Georgia, where Trump is being investigated for alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election, more people thought Trump would make democracy stronger (48%) than Biden (43%). An April New York Times/Siena College poll of likely voters found that 46% believed Mr. Trump is \"bad for democracy\" while 39% said the same about Mr. Biden.\nCongressional Democrats urge Biden to emphasize democracy, Jan. 6 on campaign trail\n\"You gotta tie it in with other challenges,\" New Jersey Democratic Rep. Andy Kim, who was pictured cleaning up debris in the Capitol after Jan. 6, said about how the Biden campaign should campaign on democracy.\nAbortion has been the biggest contrast issue for the Biden campaign, which has directed its political muscle and considerable cash at highlighting how Trump's appointment of Supreme Court justices led to the overturning of the federal right to an abortion and in the wake of that, to more restrictive abortion bans in Republican-led states.\nBut Jan. 6 has its role in the president's reelection effort, too. For Mr. Biden, it's a testament to character and a marker of the binary choice between him and Trump.\n\"Are there challenges that we deal with every day, whether it be the challenges of inflation that we're still battling or the challenges of global conflict? Absolutely. But those will pale in comparison to the great challenges that we will face as a crumbling America, should Trump be elected,\" said Texas Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Biden campaign co-chair.\n\"Whether democracy is still America's sacred cause is the most urgent question of our time. And it's what the 2024 election is all about,\" Mr. Biden said in Blue Bell, Pa., in January, on the third anniversary of the Jan. 6 riots.\nIn April, the Biden campaign held a press conference with two police officers who were at the Capitol during the Jan. 6 assault. Former Capitol Police Sergeant Aquilno Gonell argued voters should be worried about threats to democracy because \"if you don't have democracy, then your job is probably gonna go; your liberties are probably gonna go.\"\n\"As President Biden said, Donald Trump's campaign is obsessed with the past, not the future. He's willing to sacrifice our democracy to put himself in power,\" said Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer. \"Our campaign will continue to underscore the choice in this election and defend the truth against Donald Trump's Big Lie.\"\nNow less than seven months out from Election Day, Trump's baggage from Jan.6 — and the Biden campaign's tactic of highlighting it — isn't going away.\n\"Their entire narrative is a lie, and Americans know that Joe Biden is the true threat to democracy as he continues to allow an invasion of our borders, his weakness is leading our country straight into World War III, and he weaponizes our justice system,\" said Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\nYet some Republicans don't appear to be worried. Asked by CBS News if Jan. 6 is a vulnerability for Trump on the campaign trail, Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley said, \"That issue's been so litigated, and I think people have made up their minds about it completely.\"\n\"What is there left to say that hasn't been said? And what political advantage is there left to wring from it that Democrats have shamelessly not yet attempted to wring,\" said Hawley, who was among more than 100 Republicans in Congress who objected to certifying Biden's win in two swing states after the attack.\nCalifornia Rep. Mike Garcia, a battleground district Republican whose seat will likely be critical as the GOP tries to hold its tiny majority this fall, said he didn't like what happened on Jan. 6 — and neither do voters. At the same time, he dismissed it as an ineffective campaign issue for Mr. Biden.\n\"If this president is trying to resurrect that issue and run on that – then it's an indication that he's failed to accomplish things in the last three and a half years of his presidency,\" argued Garcia, who voted against certifying Mr. Biden's win in two battleground states in the hours after the attack.\nThere are practical contradictions in Trump's campaign rhetoric, though. He has attempted to champion police and the need for law and order. But on Jan. 6, a mob of his supporters clashed with police and injured over 100 people in law enforcement.\nThe Department of Justice announced recently on its website that close to 500 people \"have been charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees, including approximately 129 individuals who have been charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer.\"\nThat violence doesn't get much attention from Trump and his most ardent allies.\nStill, there are some who are clearly uncomfortable with the friendly tenor Trump is taking with people who attempted to upset the peaceful transfer of power over three years ago.\n\"Jan. 6 is not going to be a good selling point to the American public long term,\" South Dakota GOP Sen. Mike Rounds said.\nJacob Rosen contributed to this report.",

            "summary": "CBS Essentials is created independently of the CBS News editorial staff. We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\nDating? In this economy? If you're hesitant to put yourself out there, you're not alone. One random survey of 2,000 Americans conducted in December 2023 found that some adults -- 37% of those surveyed -- are going on fewer dates due to things like high expenses. That might be why online dating apps like the easy and straightforward Dating.com are so popular these days.\nDating apps make it easy to meet new people and make meaningful connections without all the stress, time, and money that can come with bad matches, blind dates, or meeting people at spendy social functions. The best dating apps are ones that eventually get deleted off your phone altogether -- but before you get to your \"happily ever after,\" you have to find the right app for you.\nAnd with so many dating apps to choose from (do you steer clear of paid apps or look for premium subscriptions with extra features? Do you care who makes the first move? Are you looking for certain shared interests or beliefs?), that can feel like a challenge. To help you make that first move confidently, we outline the top dating apps of 2024 and why you should sign up below.\nWhat is the best dating app in 2024?\nIf you're ready to put your best foot forward into the world of online dating, these are the apps you should consider putting on your phone.\nBest overall dating app: Hinge\nBest for women who want to make the first move: Bumble\nBest for long-term dating: eHarmony\nBest free dating app: OKCupid\nBest video dating: Match\nFrom classic mainstays to newer dating apps, here is everything you need to know about the top five dating apps of 2024.\nBest modern dating app overall\n: Hinge\nHinge\nWhen it comes to finding long-term (or short-term, live your life) love, Hinge has really climbed to the top of our list in recent years. Hinge doesn't disclose how many people use the mobile app to find connections, but according to one 2022 survey, 39% of adults aged 18 to 29 used it at least once.\nHinge stands out from the crowd by being more than just a swipe-based app. Users reach out using likes and comments instead, which can lead to more meaningful connections since this forces users to be more deliberate and thoughtful when sending someone a like.\nHinge is free to use, but users can unlock additional features, such as unlimited likes, with a premium account, which costs between $33 and $50 per month.\nPros:\nPros:\nDetailed profile options that let users stand out such as personal details and dating intention information.\nAn award-winning algorithm (Nobel-prize-winning Gale Shapley algorithm) is used to help users find potential matches.\nVoice prompts, video prompts, and prompt polls give users plenty of room to express themselves.\nLikes and comments can lead to more meaningful connections than other swipe-based mobile apps.\nCons:\nCons:\nFeatures like weekly \"roses\" (\"super likes\" by another name) can feel a bit tacky.\nSome potential matches are walled off as \"standout profiles\" and can only be reached with a rose, which can feel like a limiting factor for some users.\nPremium accounts (Hinge Plus and Hinge X) are expensive.\nBest for women making the first move\n: Bumble\nBumble\nIf a traditional swipe-based app is more your speed, we recommend adding Bumble to your phone. This dating app is all about shaking things up a bit when it comes to what people expect from a dating app.\nOne way Bumble goes about this is by offering more than just romantic connections. In addition to Bumble date, there are two other modes for interested users: Bumble BFF for making friendships and Bumble bizz for networking with potential professional connections.\nThe other standout feature of Bumble is the way communication works, particularly for people looking for heterosexual romance. Women are required to make the first move, which takes away some of the concern women and female-presenting people may have on other dating apps, where it's possible for one to be bombarded with unsolicited messages.\nBumble is free to use, but users also have the option of paying for Bumble premium ($35) and premium plus ($50) subscriptions for perks like unlimited swipes, a backtrack option, and access to other trending users (a premium plus exclusive).\nPros:\nPros:\nThe \"ladies first\" approach to matchmaking can be refreshing for women looking for heterosexual romance who want the ability to pick and choose who they talk to.\nBumble has full accessibility for members of the LGBTQIA+ community, where anyone can make the first move.\nAdditional features like audio and video calls can help people get to know one another more easily in those early days and weeks.\nCons:\nCons:\nMatches are lost if a message isn't sent within the first 24 hours of connecting with someone.\nExtra features like unlimited likes come with a hefty price point thanks to Bumble's not-terribly-budget-friendly premium plans.\nBest for long-term dating\n: eHarmony\neHarmony\nGoing strong since its launch in 2000, eHarmony is a mainstay in the world of dating apps thanks to its comprehensive approach to bringing people together.\nIf you don't like filling out a detailed profile, maybe check out other mobile apps on our list first, because eHarmony starts users off with a compatibility quiz full of 80 questions. These help clarify details such as user likes and dislikes, communication styles, and what an ideal match might look like.\nUsers are then scored on their quiz results, with these numbers determining other potential matches. Find someone with a high enough compatibility score and you may be in luck.\nA basic eHarmony membership is free, but premium memberships are available: premium light six-month plan ($66 per month), premium plus 12-month plan ($46 per month), and premium extra 24-month plan ($36 per month). Since you're paying for at least six months of premium features at a time, we recommend getting started with a free membership before determining whether a premium account is right for you.\nPros:\nPros:\neHarmony's detailed approach to matchmaking, including the 80-question compatibility quiz and scoring system, can be great for those who know what they want and are ready for long-term commitment.\nAccording to eHarmony, users find love on its app every 14 minutes, which at the very least indicates users will have options once they sign up.\nCons:\nCons:\nPricing information can be confusing. Users aren't informed about eHarmony's tiered premium plan setup until after making an account and completing the compatibility quiz.\nSome notable features, like being able to see all of another user's photos, are locked behind the premium paywall.\nCanceling your eHarmony account could be easier -- users have to reach out to customer care from the eHarmony website to start the process.\nBest free dating app\n: OKCupid\nOKCupid\nIf you want a quality mobile app that doesn't cost an arm and a leg to use all of the best features, we recommend OKCupid. Users can create an account, upload photos, and send messages to potential matches with a free account (other users will have to swipe right on your profile as well to read your message, however).\nOffering users a match score and questionnaire similar to eHarmony's compatibility quiz (although less time-consuming), OKCupid uses user info to find potential matches. OKCupid is also a great dating app for inclusivity: the mobile app lets users choose from 13 different sexual orientations and 22 gender identities.\nOKCupid has a free tier as well as several paid subscriptions: OKCupid basic ($30 per month), premium ($40 per month), and incognito ($20 per month), the last of which lets you stay active while only showing up for other users who you've liked or messaged.\nPros:\nPros:\nGetting started with a free account is relatively quick and easy.\nUser-friendly mobile app and website.\nA great place for gender nonconforming people or those with sexual orientations that fall outside of the norm for other, more traditional dating apps\nCons:\nCons:\nPotential matches need to swipe right on your profile as well in order to read your messages.\nSubscriptions are automatically renewed unless canceled manually.\nBest video dating\n: Match\nMatch\nOne of the oldest dating sites around, Match has been bringing people together online since its launch in 1995. Setting up an account is super easy: no long quizzes or requirements to fill out every prompt before you can start matching with people (you can come back to add more prompts on your own time).\nMatch also offers a few features that make connecting with new people online easier than ever -- namely, a video chat feature that becomes available once you connect with someone. Users also have access to Match-approved in-person events like hikes, food tours, and speed dating get-togethers.\nLike all of the best dating apps on our list, Match offers a free plan as well as two paid subscriptions: standard ($35 per month) and premium ($40 per month).\nPros:\nPros:\nUnlimited likes for free users.\nUsers have the right to cancel immediately at any time with no hassle.\nCons:\nCons:\nProfiles may have limited or incomplete info since Match doesn't require you to fill everything out before matching with people.",

Josh Shapiro, a Democrat\nClick here to browse full transcripts of \"Face the Nation.\"\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.\nAnd this week on Face the Nation: The House passes a massive aid package with tens of billions of dollars for Ukraine, widening the divide within the Republican Party. But is it coming too late to help Ukraine defeat Vladimir Putin?\nAfter six months of party infighting over aid to Ukraine, Speaker Johnson did an end run around his MAGA conservative critics and worked with Democrats to get a $95 billion package of foreign aid through the House, a move that could cost him his job.\n(Begin VT)\nREPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON (R-Louisiana): I said these are not normal times. They're not. The world is destabilized and it's a tinderbox.\n(End VT)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But will it revive the weary Ukrainian war effort?\nWe will talk with Senate Intelligence Chair Mark Warner. Plus, we will hear from Republican Congressman Tom Cole and Senator Dan Sullivan about all this and more.\nPlus: As former President Trump prepares for opening statements in the New York hush money trial, bad weather kept him off the campaign trail this weekend.\n(Begin VT)\nDONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States (R) and Current U.S. Presidential Candidate): They're saying the weather is really getting bad, really, really getting bad.\n(End VT)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden spent three days in a state that's a must-win for him.\n(Begin VT)\nJOE BIDEN (President of the United States): You're my ticket to the White House, you, Pennsylvania. No, it's not hyperbole.\n(End VT)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk with that state's Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro.\nFinally, ahead of Earth Day, what impact is the recent run of extreme weather having on American views on climate change?\nIt's all just ahead on Face the Nation.\nGood morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.\nSix months to the day after President Biden requested the funding for Ukraine, it has finally passed the House. The $95 billion foreign aid package includes $61 billion for Ukraine and rebuilding U.S. weapons stockpiles, $26 billion in aid for Israel – that includes some humanitarian aid for Palestinians – and $8 billion for parts of the Indo- Pacific region, which includes Taiwan.\nA bill also forces the Chinese-owned firm ByteDance to sell TikTok or risk a U.S. ban.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, along with a minority of Republicans, worked with a majority of Democrats to get the Ukraine aid through. That bipartisan effort has made some ultraconservative House Republicans livid, and they're threatening to remove the speaker from his job just six months after a similar scenario cost Kevin McCarthy the speakership. The Senate is expected to pass the funding bill later this week.\nWe begin today with the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner.\nGood morning, and good to have you here.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia): Thank you, Margaret.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, Senator, $61 billion in aid to Ukraine, about 60 percent of that stays as an investment into the U.S. industrial base, as I understand it.\nPresident Zelenskyy said this morning on another network it's important that they get crucial long range artillery like ATACMS. Is that what this money will pay for? And, if so, when will they actually get them?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, the great news is, this is finally happening.\nIt should have happened six months ago. The next best time is right now, this week. We've seen the Ukrainians overperform.\nIf you step back for a moment and think about the fact that, for most of my life, most of America's defense forces were focused on Russia, getting this additional equipment as quickly as possible – I hope, once this gets to the president by Tuesday or Wednesday, that these shipments will be literally launched with that longer-range ATACM.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: By next week?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: I hope, once the president signs, we've been told that there is – it is the president's signature, making sure Congress does its job, that these materials will be in transit by the end of the week.\nAnd on that schedule, what it will do is, it's clearly been the case that the Ukrainians, morale has been great, but it's been undermined over the last couple of months, when they have been – literally given out rationed bullets, eight to 10 bullets a day, and on artillery shells, Russians 10-1.\nYou can't underestimate the Ukrainians' grit, determination. But if they don't have the materiels…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … they can't carry this fight to the Russians.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Will they get those long-range artillery?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Not just ammunition?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: The ATACMS – I believe the administration…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … was prepared over the last couple of months to prepare – or to provide ATACMS. It is written into this legislation.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: According to the State Department, China has helped Russia rebuild its defense industrial base, which has an impact on the battlefield as well here.\nHow have they been able to just blow through U.S. sanctions or defy them to help the Russians, who are fighting Ukraine?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, if we look back again, I think we would all acknowledge that the sanctions regime has not been as tight as we would have like to have seen it, China being the worst offender with direct military support, India, a country I'm very supportive of, but India in terms of purchasing Russian oil that give that hard currency to Russia for them to go out into the marketplace and acquire arms.\nIt's one of the reasons why I think this package, which the House just passed, we will take up this week…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … that says, we have to be ready to be prepared for our national security interests, not only in Ukraine and Russia, also in terms of military assistance to Israel, but with additional humanitarian aid for the Palestinians who are…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … in such great challenges.\nAnd there's about $8 billion or $9 billion for the Indo-Pacific region…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … because of the concern that we have about China's aggressiveness towards Taiwan.\nClearly, the Chinese linkage to Russia, combined with the fact that the Iranians are – are providing drones, for example…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … for Russia and the outlier nation, North Korea, I know the terminology used to be Axis of Evil. This may be the 2024 Axis of Evil combination of nations.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And Speaker Johnson has used that language.\nOne of the other things that the House voted to do was move this TikTok bill through. So this would force the Chinese-owned parent company, ByteDance, to divest it, to sell it. But they have the better part of a year to do so. The Chinese government says they're not going to allow that.\nByteDance doesn't want to sell it. So, if this just gets stuck in the courts, isn't the reality that TikTok is not going away?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: TikTok, 170 million Americans a day, 90 minutes a day…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … that's, frankly, more than the power of eyes that your network reaches on a daily basis.\nAnd that information – and many young people on TikTok get their news.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: The idea that we would give the Communist Party this much of a propaganda tool, as well as the ability to scrape 170 million American – million Americans' personal data, it is a national security risk.\nWhat – what our goal…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But it is a national security risk, according to U.S. intelligence community, that has a direct impact potentially on U.S. elections. TikTok accounts…\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: On U.S. elections, on elections this year.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, targeted candidates from both political parties during the midterm cycle in 2022. That's the Worldwide Threat Assessment.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: This is a world…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But TikTok is not going away before November.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, here is the question – the issue.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, that means it's an active threat.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: There is plenty of creativity on TikTok. There are people that make their living off of TikTok as social influencers. I don't want that to go away.\nI simply want to make sure that the individuals pulling the strings…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … are not ultimately functionaries of the Communist Party of China.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I understand.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: And given…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But even with this significant bill, the timeline is such that it doesn't take it away as a risk for the election. And it seems the U.S. government is so limited in so many ways when it comes to these election influence efforts.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: The – the timeline of giving – this is going to be a complicated transaction.\nTo give it up to a full year, I think, just from a business standpoint, makes sense. The one thing we do have in place – and I'm not putting a whole lot of solace in this.\nBut I was at the Munich Security Conference earlier in the year, when all 20 of the major social media companies, including TikTok, including Twitter, X, including Facebook, Google, Amazon, you name it, they have all said they would have a voluntary agreement about disinformation and misinformation in elections, because, with artificial intelligence…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … the ability for people to see this, our images here, maybe having words that we don't speak…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: … is – ought to scare the dickens out of all of us.\nAnd the truth is, you know, these 20 companies have a – guaranteed a voluntary agreement. They'll take on watermarking, which will indicate altered – altered content, be willing to take this content down.\nBut the proof is going to be in the pudding. The parliamentary elections in Europe start in less than 60 days. So we are going, along with our European partners, to say, all right, companies you promised.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Show us what you're doing.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, this other measure that was approved as well, Section 702, it's a key surveillance tool…\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Mm-hmm.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … was reauthorized for two years, instead of five.\nTake a listen to what the CIA director told my colleague Norah O'Donnell Friday about how his agency is using this authority.\n(Begin VT)\nWILLIAM BURNS (CIA Director): Its reauthorization, its passage, I think, is a crucial tool to fight fentanyl, because something like 70 percent of all the successful disruptions of fentanyl traffic moving into the United States that we've been a part of have come directly from intelligence derived from 702.\n(End VT)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, these changes to 702, how does it help fight the trafficking of fentanyl? What – what difference is there?\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, let's – let's remember what 702 is.\nIt is the ability for the United States government to surveil, listen in, on non-Americans, foreigners who are abroad. And many times, the fentanyl drug cartels are being run out of Mexico, many times supplied with basic goods out of China.\nAnd this ability to listen in on the bad guys' communications is extraordinarily powerful. Matter of fact, the president gets a daily brief of all of the intelligence hot spots around the world. Sixty percent, 60 percent of what he reads each day is material that comes out of the 702 program.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Now, let me be clear. There have been times in the past where particularly the FBI didn't even follow its own rules on making sure that a foreign individual, a foreign terrorist that might be talking to American, that we put appropriate protections on that American.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That led to some of this Republican criticism.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: It's led to some of the concern.\nFive years ago, the FBI itself was screwing up on 30 percent of their queries just meeting their own criteria. We put in place reforms. The screw-up level has dropped from about 30 percent to less than 1 percent.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: We put requirements so that you can no longer do batch queries. We got to make sure FBI agents have to show a national security purpose.\nIf a journalist or a political figure or a religious figure were even to be queried – queried about, you have to get approval from either the director to the deputy director or head of the National Security Division. We think we've got a very strong reform bill. It's why it passed the Senate.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, so much to talk to you about. Good to have you here in person.\nSENATOR MARK WARNER: Thank you, Margaret.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Alaska Republican Senator Dan Sullivan, who is also here with us.\nIt was a busy weekend here in Washington.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN (R-Alaska): Yes, Margaret, good to be back on the show.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, Senator, this Ukraine aid that finally has moved, President Zelenskyy was on another network this morning, and he said: \"The U.S. will send a signal with this that this will not be a second Afghanistan. The U.S. will stay with Ukraine.\"\nIf Donald Trump wins this next election, can you guarantee the U.S. will stay with Ukraine?\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, listen, I can't guarantee anything, but I – it's actually good that the president, President Zelenskyy, mentioned Afghanistan, because, Margaret, this gets lost too much.\nI think we got to look at how we got to the situation of Ukraine. I believe strongly that the weakness coming out of the Biden White House – they cut defense spending, you know, every – every year, in terms of the president's budget, their energy policies exude weakness, and the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan – emboldened Putin to undertake the invasion of Ukraine.\nSo, we got to remember, kind of broadly, more strategically, where we are. But, as you know, I was a supporter of the defense supplemental. And I think it's not just going to be important for Ukraine. As you and I have talked about before…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … it's going to be really important for the industrial base of America, which has atrophied dramatically. Sixty percent of this bill goes into building weapons…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … everything from submarines to 155…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: In many Republican districts too, which is why it's so surprising it took so long to get through the House.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, all over the place.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: So, I think it's important.\nBut, again, you know, a lot of this, in terms of where we are on Ukraine…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … from my perspective, comes from the weakness of the Biden administration…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … and, you know, the president's inability…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … to actually make the case on Ukraine. He's given two speeches on Ukraine in the last two years.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And all his speeches do is kind of villain – villainize another part of the Congress.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You – you – we – we could…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: He hasn't tried to bring people together.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We could have a historical argument for the next hour…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, the history's important.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … going – .. going back years about green lights being given to Vladimir Putin around the world by leaders in many countries.\nSo, let's talk about…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: The history on this is important.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm not saying it's not, but let's talk about the future here…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Sure. Sure.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … and the signals being sent.\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban met in March with Donald Trump at Mar-A-Lago, and then he gave an interview. And in that interview, he said that Trump told him: \"He will not give a penny to fund Ukraine. And that is why the war will end because Ukraine cannot stand on its own feet.\"\nWe know he's not a fan of President Zelenskyy. So why do you think he will be persuaded? He might win this election.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nWell, listen, I mean, President Trump put out a statement recently where he thought it was important to support – support Ukraine. He actually also mentioned the Europeans need to do more. And he actually mentioned something, as I just said, that it was very unlikely the war would have started had he still been in the White House. So…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Russia hadn't withdrawn from Ukraine. You know, they'd gone in 2014. So, this argument over Trump would have made a difference, it didn't make a difference during his four years in office.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, I mean, I think the – again, the broader – the broader issue…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … particularly between Biden and Trump right now, you know, where are we? Is the world a safer place for the United States and our allies today as it was four years ago?\nI think the – the answer to that is unequivocally no. But let – let's get back to your question.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I do think that the Republican Party in the House and in the Senate is still very much the peace-through-strength party.\nThis is the tradition of Republicans, Reagan, the Bush presidencies, Eisenhower, Teddy Roosevelt, and – and…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you just talking about the Senate, or the House? Because there were more Republicans in the House who voted against Ukraine aid than voted for it.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, but, actually, look at some of the other votes. There was a vote. Republicans in the House 2-1 rejected an amendment to strip funding for Ukraine, 2-1 one in the House. And I – and, look…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That was Marjorie Taylor Green's effort you're talking about.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Correct. And – and, you know, we'll see what the Senate does this Tuesday on this bill.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: One of the things that I think the speaker did a good job on with regard to this legislation is, actually, – he actually improved it for a whole host of reasons.\nBut I – I predict that you'll probably see a majority of Senate Republicans supporting this legislation.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And, like I said, peace through strength, this is important because…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … Donald Trump was part of that tradition very much. You remember President Obama cut defense spending by 25 percent his second term.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: He gutted readiness. This is what Democrats sen – con – presidents do.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Biden did it. Obama did it.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to – I'm going to talk about some of these mixed messages in the House with our congressmen ahead, Senator.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: OK, but, look, I mean…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But it's not – it's not so clear.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: But I think our party is the peace through strength party. One of the dangers, in my view…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, as just said, you can't guarantee a Trump administration and what they do.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, nobody can guarantee anything. But…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But he hasn't even endorsed this bill publicly.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, he came out with a statement…\n(LAUGHTER)\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … just last week saying something that, you know, Ukraine was important.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: No, he says: \"Everyone agrees Ukrainian survival and strength should be much more important to Europe than to us, but it's also important to us.\"\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \"Get moving, Europe.\"\nThat was the best that Republicans got out of him.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, look, I – I think – I – I…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: David Cameron from U.K.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Let me make one other point on this.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The Polish president.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: I think that we're – we're…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … kind of giving Joe Biden a bit of a pass on, not just, as I mentioned how we got here, but the execution of the Ukraine effort.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: As you know, literally, every major weapon system that the Ukrainians have said they need, from HIMARS, Patriots, Stingers, tanks, F-16s, now ATACMS, every single weapon system, this administration delays, delays, because they're scared of, you know, making Vladimir Putin mad.\nThe Senate – you saw Mark Warner there a second ago.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: You interviewed him. In a bipartisan way, we come in and we say, Mr. President, you have to give them these weapons systems.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: They finally relent. Think about where we'd be Margaret, if, you know, a year-and-a-half ago, we would have gotten all these weapons systems to Ukrainians. They have…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Or six months ago, if Republicans in the House actually held a vote to do what they did just yesterday.\nBut I need to move on to the climate…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: OK. OK.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … because I know you're also passionate about this and what the Biden administration just announced about your state of Alaska.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The president wants to conserve 30 percent of U.S. lands as part of his climate change efforts.\nAnd he has limited oil and gas drilling in parts in the National Petroleum Reserve…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … to protect polar bears and other things. And then he also blocked a role – road – excuse me – crucial to operating a copper and zinc mine.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yes.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You said this is suicidal and lawless.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: It was. And…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Those are strong words.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Well, it's lawless. He doesn't have the authority to do it.\nAnd I could go into all the laws that support me on that. It's, as I say, national security suicide. Look, this president won't sanction the Iranian oil and gas regime. You may have seen Senator Blumenthal and I put a – sent a letter to the president on Friday, saying you need to do that.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: But he has no problem sanctioning Alaska.\nThis – this administration has issued 63 executive orders and executive actions singularly focused on Alaska to shut our state down. Now, that, of course, hurts my constituents. But, Margaret, the national resources, energy, critical minerals, that's an American strength.\nThis should concern all kinds of Americans. I will mention one final thing that I really wanted to highlight here. You know, I have been in the Senate nine years. I have never seen such a cynical and dishonest display coming out of any presidency…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … when this president on Friday, with Secretary Haaland…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … announced that they did this because the Alaska Native, the indigenous people…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … on the North Slope of Alaska asked them to, they wanted them to.\nThese – the leaders of the North Slope of Alaska were unanimous in opposition to this.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: They tried to meet with Secretary Haaland. She wouldn't meet with them.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: This is a rule that focuses on their lands…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: … where they've been living for thousands of years.\nAnd then the president says, well, I did it because the indigenous people of Alaska wanted it.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Yes.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: That is a lie.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Wow.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And I – it is a lie. And go…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Go see what the indigenous people of Alaska from that part of my state said.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: They're very upset.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I know there's – there's some…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: And the president was canceling their voices and now stealing their voices. It was really a despicable move.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, we have to leave it there because of the break, but I know you could talk with me on this perhaps again in the future…\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Thank you.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … more in depth.\nWe'll be right back.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Oklahoma Republican Congressman Tom Cole.\nGood morning.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE (R-Oklahoma): Morning.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, you were the lead sponsor on Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan bills. And I know this was a big decision for the speaker to hold the vote at all.\nThe Polish prime minister tweeted: \"Speaker Johnson, thank you. Better late than too late. And I hope it is not too late for Ukraine.\"\nHow do you measure the cost of inaction over the past six months?\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, first of all, the Senate only passed the bill 65 days ago.\nAnd it's not like the speaker didn't have other things to do. He had to get all the appropriations done, had to do FISA.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: This was an emergency. They were running out of ammunition…\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: You know, and – well, again…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … when they asked for it.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: The – the…\n(LAUGHTER)\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: … administration waited a while. The Senate took a while, and we had other business under way.\nBut it got done, got done in a bipartisan way. He showed incredible leadership. And, frankly, he gave us a rule that is a structure in which we considered all these different matters where every single member got to vote the way they wanted to on every single issue.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: That wasn't the case in the Senate. And I think, actually, when they follow the example we have, you will see more support for Ukraine than we probably saw in their original vote.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, to be fair, we're not talking about a policy debate – debate that doesn't have a direct impact on the battlefield.\nI mean, the supreme allied commander testified before Congress on April 10 the Ukrainians are being outshot by the Russian side 5-1 because of this debate, the delay.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: I'm sorry. Democracy is a – kind of a messy business.\nAnd the reality is, it's done. So it moved through. It moved through on a very bipartisan basis.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: More Republicans voted against it than voted for it.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, look, it's about an even split.\nAnd, quite frankly, if you want to – want to look at the hardcore Republican opposition, go to the motion to recommit, or look at the bill to strip funding from Ukraine. It's about 2-1, actually 3-1 one on the motion to recommit.\nThis is politics. There is such a thing as a \"Vote no, hope yes\" crowd in every caucus. I can go down that list and tell you the members who said, OK, you got the votes. You don't need me. So, I think there's actually much more…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That would be a fun game with you, actually.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, it is a fun game.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Because I – I could pick a few of those names off that list.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: And, look, it's – it's – it's politics. I'm not critical of anybody.\nThe reality is, we have overwhelming bipartisan support for each part of this package. It was structured in a way that it allowed members to both make the points they wanted to make and, frankly, if they needed political cover, do it. But it got done.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: So, I'm – I'm pretty proud of the speaker.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I – I want to talk to you more on the other side of this break, but just you are in there acknowledging, when you say, \"Vote no, hope yes,\" that there were Republicans who had to vote no…\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, they felt they had to.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … because of the political pressure and the fight within your own party.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: People don't – no, it's not – again, people make…\n(CROSSTALK)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But who wanted it to pass?\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: You think nobody makes political calculations in the United States Senate or in the administration?\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Yes.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Welcome to American politics.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: But the point is, look at the numbers. Look at overwhelming bipartisan numbers…\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to do that…\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: … over and over.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … on the other side of this break.\nStay here, please.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Got it.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be back in just a moment.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.\nWe want to continue our conversation now with Oklahoma Republican Congressman Tom Cole.\nCongressman, before the break we'd been talking about this vote the House had yesterday to approve the $95 billion package. There was a decision here for Speaker Johnson that was an important one. He basically put his job on the line. As we know, there's this movement among House conservatives, led by Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, to try to oust him from power, in part because of this Ukraine aid bill.\nDo you think this is a real threat to his leadership?\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, I take anything seriously. But, no, I don't. Look, I think it's a relatively small number of Republican members, frankly just as it was in McCarthy's case. There were only eight people.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: But the point is, I don't think there's unified Democratic support. There was unified Democratic support to remove the speaker. I think both sides have now seen how dangerous this is, how irresponsible it is. And, quite frankly, I think it's unlikely that Democrats who supported Ukraine, not as many supported Israel as we would have liked, but they did support Ukraine, I think they're unlikely to remove the speaker over that. All told to be fair, they removed McCarthy after he did what he asked them to do, which was keep the government funded. But, again, I don't think that's going to happen in this case. But if somebody wants to do it, it's within the rules and they can take their shot.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But what you're saying there is that Democrats you trust would protect Speaker Johnson from being ousted because they wouldn't vote to -\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, I think, frankly - I don't think you'd lose very many Republicans. We didn't lose very many Republicans with McCarthy. So, it doesn't take very many Democrats to either not vote or oppose it. And I don't - frankly, I don't think we'd lose the same number of Republicans that we lost with Kevin McCarthy. I think even people that disagree with the speaker -\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You wouldn't get to eight Republicans?\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: I don't think so.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: They've gotten to three, Marjorie Taylor Greene says there's (ph) three.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Look, I think there's a lot of people that like this speaker, that respect this speaker, even when they disagree with him. They know he's honest, he's a straight shooter. They also had a taste of what it's like to go without a speaker for three weeks. I don't think they want that again. I certainly don't think they want it close to an election.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Former Speaker Gingrich said, \"the demons that Matt Gaetz unleashed by going after Kevin McCarthy are still out there. You can't govern by shooting yourself in the head every day.\"\nHow does Speaker Johnson get anything done?\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Well, first of all, he just got a lot done. He's gotten every appropriations bill passed. He's gotten FISA through. He just got this consequential - so he's actually been -\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he has to rely on Democratic votes, which he's being faulted for by members of his party.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: No. Well, that's fine. I mean, honestly - no, there - every appropriations bill is bipartisan at the end of the day. They just work that way. So, most of these - and something like FISA ought to be bipartisan. I actually think he's, you know, empowered the center, and marginalized the extremes on - on each side.\nNow, is there some risk to that? Sure. But the point is, he's gotten a lot done. I think people admire him. They genuinely like him. They all respect him. Every single Republican voted for him. I don't think that any other person could have done that at the time other than Mike Johnson. So, the reservoir of goodwill is enormous. I think he's much stronger than the people seem to think, and I think he's demonstrated that by what he's passed.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: (INAUDIBLE) Republicans - first of all, do you think Republicans, after November, will have the majority?\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: I do.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And if so, he could be re-elected.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: I do because I think we're likely to win the presidency. I think this is pretty simple. I used to do politics for a living. I guess I still do. But the reality is, the person that wins a presidency is probably going to take the House. It's close enough that that probably makes a difference. I think we'll win. So, I think we will have the House.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, good to have you here in person.\nREPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Great privilege. Thank you.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Overnight, Israeli defense forces launched a deadly series of air strikes on the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, but there's also been an uptick of violence in the West Bank.\nOur Debora Patta reports.\n(BEGIN VT)\nDEBORA PATTA (voice over): Every ten minutes a child is killed in Gaza says the United Nations. That's nearly 15,000 children in almost seven months.\nHere, paramedics rush to save the injured after yet another Israeli air strike in Rafah. For this little girl, it was too late. Her grief-stricken father is inconsolable. He is not alone. In this room there are only the bodies of children.\nOvernight, at least ten more names added to that endless list of horror. The youngest, just two years old.\nOur CBS News team in Gaza reports that among the dead was a pregnant woman. Miraculously, doctors saved her baby girl.\nHere, Israel Defense Force soldiers prepare for a mission, but this is not in Gaza. It's IDF footage of a two-day operation in the West Bank city of Tulkarm, where they say they have been rooting out militants. At least 14 Palestinians were killed.\nDEBORA PATTA: The IDF pulled out last night, leaving this massive destruction in its wake. It's on a scale, residents say, they've never seen before.\nDEBORA PATTA (voice over): This morning, they were mopping up the damage. Israeli soldiers used bulldozers to smash through the area, destroying streets, buildings and infrastructure.\nThe West Bank has reached a boiling point. Nearly 500 Palestinians have been killed since October 7th and there are ongoing clashes with Israeli settlers, which escalated after a 14-year-old settler was found dead over a week ago.\nThe U.S. has imposed new sanctions on West Bank settlers and a U.S. official told CBS News that since 2022 it's been investigating an IDF unit of ultra-orthodox soldiers accused of human rights atrocities with an announcement expected this week.\nDEBORA PATTA: The unit is stationed here in the West Bank. Media reports suggesting it could be blacklisted from receiving U.S. military aid prompted an angry outburst from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said any sanctions imposed on the IDF would be a moral low when it is fighting in Gaza.\n(END VT)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: That was our Debora Patta.\nAnd we're joined now by \"New York Times\" White House and national security correspondent David Sanger. His latest book \"New Cold Wars\" is out now.\nDavid, good to see you again.\nDAVID SANGER (White House and National Security Correspondent, \"New York Times\"): Great to be with you, Margaret.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Where do we begin? The world truly is on fire.\nDAVID SANGER: It is.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And one of the things I like about your book is, you write, going all the way back to listening to the Nixon-Kennedy debates, and hearing those candidates hash out America's role in the world, and geostrategy. In this election, we don't even know if the candidates will have a debate. Meanwhile, the world's on fire.\nHow do the American – members of the American public need to think about the global competition the United States is in the middle of?\nDAVID SANGER: Well, it's a very different competition than what we had in the Cold War. You know, those Nixon-Kennedy debates were, you know, at the height of the moment of a U.S. contest against the Soviet Union, which was terrifying and nuclear. But there was a simplicity about it. You know, there was a predictability about it. We understood who controlled their nuclear weapons. They understood who controlled ours. We knew who to call.\nThe new cold wars are quite different, Margaret. We've got Russia and China coming together in a periodic partnership. I wouldn't say it's a full alliance. We have other players, like Iran and North Korea, as you were discussing with earlier guests, supplying them, becoming sort of what the Iranians call an axis of resistance to the U.S. It is a far more volatile, I think far more dangerous period than we had even then.\nAnd yet, as you point out, our ability to discuss it as a nation has somewhat degraded. You watch those Kennedy-Nixon debates and put aside who was sweating and who looked young and vigorous and all that -\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\nDAVID SANGER: It was an incredibly sophisticated argument largely about nuclear deterrence. I'm afraid that we're not having that incredibly sophisticated argument today, you know, 60 years - more than 60 years later.\nBut the vote yesterday, which you've been discussing about Ukraine, at the end of the day turned out to be a fairly overwhelming vote in favor of the U.S. pushing against the Russians in Ukraine and perhaps beyond.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Certainly overwhelmingly yes for Democrats. A bit split for Republicans.\nDAVID SANGER: A majority of Republicans voted - voted against.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nDAVID SANGER: But it passed - it passed comfortably.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: It passed. It did.\nAnd I - it's just - I think it's such an interesting point you make, though, in sort of changing how we think about competition with Russia and China. We learned Friday that the U.S. is likely to lose a significant counterterrorism base in the African country of Niger because the government demanded troop withdraw. I think a lot of Americans didn't even know that there was 1,000 U.S. troops there fighting or working in the counterterrorism space. Russia is moving in.\nDAVID SANGER: That's right.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: China is getting and carving out a large amount of influence in Africa. What are the fronts in the new cold war?\nDAVID SANGER: Well, there are a couple of different ones. You point out one in Africa. Also an area that China has been wiring up with Huawei equipment and so forth. So, we are concerned, you know, rightly so, that U.S., in not having a competitor straight on to put in 5G equipment may be losing the opportunity to help bind the continent together.\nIn the book I take you to the Solomon Islands, a place the U.S. fought for in World War II, and scored a big victory, but now has basically moved over into China's camp. There's still some contest underway.\nBut to answer your question more broadly, if you believe that there is something of a new iron curtain coming down, a place where you're going to divide the U.S., the NATO nations, against China, Russia, Iran, others, it's somewhere in that border land between Ukraine and Russia. And that's why the bill that went through Congress was so important.\nI don't know if it's enough to turn the tide. The Ukrainians may have lost so much time and ammunition here that it may be too late. But certainly had it not passed, that was pretty much, by the judgment of the CIA director, Bill Burns, and others, going to be the end of the contest. The Russians almost certainly would have surged forward.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And China has made clear they have a stake in Russia winning in Ukraine. It is this competition.\nDAVID SANGER: That's right. And, you know, if we had those debates again, and as you say, who knows if we will, I think the most interesting -\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Or even those interviews.\nDAVID SANGER: Or even - that's right.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Substantial interviews with conversations about national security interests of America. I mean, we should.\nDAVID SANGER: That's right. And, you know, President Biden has been reluctant to have, you know, major sit down interviews, at least with the print organizations. But I think if we did have those interviews, I think one of the big questions is, what is your plan to get in the midst of the Russia-China combination?\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nDAVID SANGER: Because the core of what Nixon and Kissinger were doing in the early '70s, in recognizing China, was to prevent Russia and China from coming together.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You also make this interesting point about the dynamic that's so different given, first of all, they're so economically intertwined, the United States and China. But also the business community and technology and the role that plays in this version of competition.\nA top U.S. cyber official told you companies, not the U.S. government, have all the insight these days. How do we know when an attack's coming?\nDAVID SANGER: Yes. The book opens with the days running up to the war in Ukraine. And while there was certainly lots of indicators coming from American satellites and signals intelligence and so forth, in the end one of the key indicators that the Russians were getting ready to roll came from Microsoft, whose engineers were noticing that malware that had been placed by the Russians on Ukrainian government agencies were being activated and sent a notice through their channels, which ultimately went to the White House.\nAt the end of the day, what kept Ukraine running was some combination of Microsoft and Amazon moving all of their data to the cloud and then Elon Musk coming in and providing Starlink so they could communicate to that cloud.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Incredible.\nDAVID SANGER: Something we never saw in the old cold wars.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: David, it's a fascinating read. It's good to see you in person. And we'll have to leave it there.\nDAVID SANGER: Thank you.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Pennsylvania's governor, Josh Shapiro, is standing by waiting for us.\nWe'll be right back.\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro. He joins us this morning from Abington, Pennsylvania.\nAnd, Governor, thank you for sticking with us. We've been having some transmission technical issues, so hopefully we don't get interrupted.\nI'll get - I'll get straight to it.\nGOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA): Good, I look forward to the conversation. Thanks.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'll get straight to it, Governor.\nYou have been outspoken against the rising and troubling anti-Semitism in this country. I know the FBI director said just a few days ago that federal law enforcement is concerned about lone actors targeting gatherings ahead of the start of Passover, which starts tomorrow. Are there known threats in your state?\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Well, there's not known threats right now. And I can tell you, the Pennsylvania State Police, working in coordination with our federal and local partners, are all over this and will let folks know in communities if there are specific threats.\nBut we continue to work closely with law enforcement and community leaders to do everything we can to take down the temperature, to address the rise in anti-Semitism, islamophobia, other forms of hate. There should be no place for that here in Pennsylvania. Of course, Pennsylvania founded on the vision of William Penn, a place that would be a place of tolerance and welcome and peace. A place where people could come together and practice their faith, whatever their faith is.\nWe have a special relationship with that here in this commonwealth where we respect all, no matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love or who you choose to pray to. And we're going to continue to do everything we can to make sure everyone feels protected in this commonwealth.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there should be no place for it anywhere in America. And I know you agree with that.\nLet me get to the politics of the moment.\nPresident Biden won the state of Pennsylvania in 2020 narrowly. He spent a lot of time in your state this past week. We've seen in our polling his approval rating among young voters aged 18 to 29 has dropped 12 points since February, from 55 percent to 43 percent today.\nHow does the president get that back?\nJOSH SHAPIRO: I think the president gets it back doing exactly what he's doing, showing up, talking about his record, addressing things like climate change, which are incredibly important issues for young voters, along with many others, obviously. Making sure that young people feel included in the conversation, not just as a vote, but as part of the governing coalition going forward.\nYoung people helped propel me to victory as governor. One of the first things I did was start what I believe is the first ever next gen engagement commission here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. A place where young people, quite literally, advise me on policy, meet with me regularly, give me their perspective on what's happening in the community.\nI think part of the frustration by young people is that that - they oftentimes don't feel heard.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: And they feel like their voices and their votes are taken advantage of come election time. This is a moment where the young people deserve to be at the table. And the fact that the president is showing up in these communities and talking about these issues that are going to help young people in the future I think is a really important step.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So, last weekend Donald Trump was campaigning in Pennsylvania. It's so key. Here's what he said.\n(BEGIN VC)\nDONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Biden has imposed a savage natural gas export ban that's putting countless Pennsylvania jobs at risk. He's risking your lives. He's risking your jobs. But he doesn't care because all he cares about is the green new scam.\n(END VC)\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He is speaking to real fear among some of your constituents about President Biden's decision to, at least temporarily, put a pause on new natural gas projects. How do you respond to that?\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Look, I've been very clear with the White House and publicly. I hope that this pause that they put in place is very quick and then we move forward.\nHere in Pennsylvania, our energy economy has powered this nation, and it has done so over many generations. And going forward I think Pennsylvania has an opportunity to be the center of the clean energy economy. Thanks to the president, we're the only state in the nation with two regional hydrogen hubs.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But just to - just -\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Thanks to the president, we've been able to work together -\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry, just - you broke up at the beginning. I think you said you've been very clear to the White House that you hope this is a short pause. Does that mean you agree it is costing your state jobs and money?\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Well, I think if the pause goes on for a long time it has the potential to cost us jobs. That's why I want this to be as quick as possible.\nAnd what I went on to say, though, is, we have an opportunity here in Pennsylvania to be the center of the clean energy economy. Thanks to President Biden, we have two regional hydrogen hubs. Thanks to President Biden, we are capping methane emissions from abandoned wells. We have billions of dollars of tax credits and other resources coming from the Department of\nEnergy to help us through a transition.\nHere in Pennsylvania, we're showing that we can both protect the jobs that exist today and create more energy jobs tomorrow. Energy is critical to the future of our commonwealth.\nNow, listen, the bravado and the bluster from the former president do nothing to actually create jobs in Pennsylvania. He's got an abysmal track record when it comes to that. President Biden has a strong record. And we're going to continue to lead on energy here in Pennsylvania.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned young voters and how key the issue of climate is to them. The Biden administration touts the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, as a green energy bill, even though it wasn't named that. But CBS polling shows half of Americans have not heard much or nothing at all about what the administration has done. Only 14 percent say they've heard a lot. Two-thirds don't know if their state has gotten federal funds for climate change projects. This seems a real vulnerability for Democrats when it comes to young voters.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Let me be very clear, climate change is real, it is serious and we have to address it. And Joe Biden understand that. Donald Trump has made fun of climate change and denies its existence. So, there's a clear contrast in this race.\nBecause of the federal dollars that have flowed to Pennsylvania, as I mentioned a moment ago, we are positioned to get two regional hydrogen hubs that are going to help us combat climate change. We're addressing all kinds of infrastructure needs here in the commonwealth, from repairing roads and bridges, to making sure people are connected to the internet, to making sure families in Esplen, which is a minority - predominantly minority community in Pittsburgh, no longer need to drink water out of the lines that contain lead thanks to Joe Biden cleaning that up.\nSo, when it comes to infrastructure investments, when it comes to the kind of investments that are going to help spur on a clean energy economy, President Biden has been there.\nNow, we have to make that case. And we've got to make sure folks understand that and hear that. That's why you run a campaign. That's why you'll see stark differences when it comes to combatting climate change between the policies of President Biden and what Donald Trump has done in the past and wants to do in the future.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the messaging needs work is what you're saying?\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Well, I think the case - I think the case needs to be made.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: There's a wonderful track record. There's a wonderful body of work. They need to make that case.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: And I'll be helping make that case alongside the president.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask about something that has been really damaging your state, and that is drug addiction. Pennsylvania has - I'm sorry, excuse me, the number one public health crisis in Pennsylvania, according to the state, is opioids. The CDC says Pennsylvania recently saw the highest number of xylazine related deaths in the country.\nWhat is driving the addiction?\nJOSH SHAPIRO: Well, listen, 13 Pennsylvanians die every single day from an opioid overdose. It is unacceptable. And here in Pennsylvania we're trying to come at it with a multipronged approach.\nFirst, we have to understand that drug addiction is a disease, not a crime. Now, we have to invest in law enforcement. And I have. We've increased the number of state troopers by 400 and I'm looking to add another 400. As attorney general, I arrested over 8,000 drug dealers. So, we're not going soft on those who are peddling these poisons in our community.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: But we also have to make sure that treatment is available. As attorney general, I led a national coalition that ended up holding those drug companies accountable.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Yes.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: The very people that brought this crisis into our communities and brought $2 billion back to Pennsylvania for treatment.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: OK. I'm - I'm sorry to interrupt you.\nJOSH SHAPIRO: This is really critical stuff and it's going to require a multipronged approach.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry I have to interrupt you. We have to leave it there, Governor. Thank you.\nWe'll be back.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
