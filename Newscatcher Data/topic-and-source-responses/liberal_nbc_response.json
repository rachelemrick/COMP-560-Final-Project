            "excerpt": "Uri Berliner wrote in an essay in The Free Press last week that NPR has an 'absence of viewpoint diversity.'",
            "summary": "An editor for National Public Radio resigned Wednesday just days after he inflamed the ongoing culture war about mainstream media with an essay about what he considers the news outlet's liberal leanings.\nUri Berliner, who was a senior business editor, wrote an essay for the right-leaning online publication The Free Press in which he said he believes NPR is losing the public's trust.\nNPR, a nonprofit radio network, has an 'absence of viewpoint diversity,' he wrote in the essay, which was published April 9. It 'has always had a liberal bent,' but now an 'open-minded spirit no longer exists within NPR,' he wrote.\nThe essay triggered a wave of scrutiny of NPR from conservatives, some of whom responded to it with calls to defund the news organization, which receives federal funding through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. NPR says on its website that federal funding is 'essential' to NPR but that 'less than 1% of NPR's annual operating budget comes in the form of grants from CPB and federal agencies and departments.'\nUri Berliner in 2017. JP Yim / WireImage file In a resignation statement on X, Berliner briefly elaborated on the reason for his departure, which came days after NPR reported that it had suspended him for five days without pay following the op-ed's release.\nNPR's chief business editor, Pallavi Gogoi, had told Berliner about its requirement to secure approval before he appeared in outside media, according to NPR's report.\n'I don't support calls to defund NPR,' Berliner wrote. 'I respect the integrity of my colleagues and wish for NPR to thrive and do important journalism. But I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new CEO whose divisive views confirm the very problems at NPR I cite in my Free Press essay.'\nBerliner did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. A representative for NPR said it 'does not comment on individual personnel matters.'\nBerliner's essay gained traction on X, with many conservatives homing in on his thoughts about NPR's political makeup. He wrote: 'In D.C., where NPR is headquartered and many of us live, I found 87 registered Democrats working in editorial positions and zero Republicans. None.'\nHe also criticized NPR's coverage, or lack thereof, of certain stories, such as the Mueller report, Hunter Biden's laptop, the origins of Covid-19 and systemic racism following the murder of George Floyd.\nHigh-profile supporters of Berliner's essay, including former President Donald Trump and X owner Elon Musk, shared criticism of NPR and its CEO, Katherine Maher.\n'NO MORE FUNDING FOR NPR, A TOTAL SCAM! EDITOR SAID THEY HAVE NO REPUBLICANS, AND IS ONLY USED TO ‘DAMAGE TRUMP.' THEY ARE A LIBERAL DISINFORMATION MACHINE. NOT ONE DOLLAR!!!' Trump wrote on Truth Social on April 10.\nMusk wrote on X that the 'head of NPR hates the Constitution of the USA' in response to a clip of Maher discussing the challenges in fighting disinformation and honoring the First Amendment right to free speech.\nMeanwhile, some journalists at NPR pushed back against Berliner's accusations.\n'Morning Edition' co-host Steve Inskeep shared his take in a post on his Substack newsletter, saying he believes Berliner failed to 'engage anyone who had a different point of view.'\n'Having been asked, I answered: my colleague's article was filled with errors and omissions,' he wrote, adding, 'The errors do make NPR look bad, because it's embarrassing that an NPR journalist would make so many.'\nNPR's chief news executive, Edith Chapin, also denied Berliner's assessment of the newsroom in a memo to staff members, according to NPR.\n'We're proud to stand behind the exceptional work that our desks and shows do to cover a wide range of challenging stories,' she wrote. 'We believe that inclusion — among our staff, with our sourcing, and in our overall coverage — is critical to telling the nuanced stories of this country and our world.'\nMaher also said Monday in a statement to NPR: 'In America everyone is entitled to free speech as a private citizen. What matters is NPR's work and my commitment as its CEO: public service, editorial independence, and the mission to serve all of the American public. NPR is independent, beholden to no party, and without commercial interests.'",

            "excerpt": "The Idaho measure, which seeks to block treatments such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy, is one of more than 20 enacted by conservative states targeting care for transgender youth.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — A divided Supreme Court on Monday allowed Idaho to mostly enforce a law that bans gender-affirming health care for transgender teens.\nGranting an emergency request filed by Idaho officials, the court said the law enacted last year could go into effect statewide but cannot be applied against the two plaintiffs who challenged it.\nThe court's three liberal justices objected to the decision, saying the law should have remained blocked in full.\nU.S. District Court Judge Lynn Winmill ruled in December that the state could not enforce the law while litigation continues. The state has appealed to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals but it has yet to rule.\nThe law, like measures enacted by other states, prevents the use of what Winmill called 'generally accepted medical treatment' for transgender minors, including puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries.\nOfficials subsequently turned to the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, saying the injunction was too broad and that the law should only be blocked for the two plaintiffs in the lawsuit.\nConservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, in an opinion explaining his vote to allow the law to be enforced, said the lower court had gone 'much further' than needed in putting the entire law on hold. The Supreme Court's intervention should be viewed as a \"welcome development,\" he said.\nIn a dissenting opinion, liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the case 'presents numerous reasons for exercising restraint' but instead, the court had decided to step in and was guilty of \"micromanaging\" the lower courts.\nLawyers for the plaintiffs, two transgender teenagers, said it was necessary that the judge blocked the entire law because if it went into effect it might imperil all gender-affirming healthcare in the state.\nThe plaintiffs, named in court papers only as Pam Poe and Jane Doe, say the law, called the Vulnerable Child Protection Act, among other things violates the Constitution's 14th Amendment by discriminating on the basis of sex.\nPoe is a 16-year-old transgender girl who has been prescribed puberty blockers. Doe is a 17-year-old transgender girl who was also prescribed puberty blockers and has begun hormone therapy.\nBoth say medical treatment has improved their mental health.\nMore than 20 states have enacted similar bans, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ rights think tank.\nThe Supreme Court will likely weigh in on the broader legal question in future as challenges to the laws make their way through the court system.\nIn the coming weeks, appeals concerning similar laws in Tennessee and Kentucky will be up for consideration by the justices.\nLawrence Hurley",

            "excerpt": "Abortion. Immigration. Health care. Taxes. Judges and the Supreme Court. Trade. Foreign policy. The policy contrasts between Joe Biden and Donald Trump are sharpening.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The policy contrasts between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are sharpening as the general election campaign gets fully underway.\nBut what does the choice represent for ordinary voters and the economic and cultural issues they care about? A rematch between the Democratic incumbent and his Republican predecessor may feel uninspiring to many voters, but the policy stakes are enormous for tens of millions of Americans — and the world.\nHere are seven big issues at stake in the 2024 election.\nAbortion The contrast: Biden favors federal abortion protections; Trump opposes them. Trump supported nationwide restrictions on abortion as president but now downplays the need for a federal ban, as Republicans are divided over the issue. Biden does not support federal limits.\nThe contrast: Biden favors federal abortion protections; Trump opposes them. Trump supported nationwide restrictions on abortion as president but now downplays the need for a federal ban, as Republicans are divided over the issue. Biden does not support federal limits. Biden has championed the Women's Health Protection Act, a bill to protect abortion rights in all 50 states under federal law and prohibit medically unnecessary hurdles to accessing the procedure. He has asked voters to send him a Democratic Congress that supports legal abortion to achieve that.\nTrump has boasted that he \"broke Roe v. Wade\" by picking three of the five Supreme Court justices who overturned it, delivering on a four-decade goal of the GOP. More recently, Trump has openly fretted that the backlash may cost him and his party the election. Last week, Trump said the issue should be left to states, a shift from his support for nationwide restrictions when he was president. His new stance has drawn pushback from GOP allies, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and anti-abortion-rights advocates, who say that he is wrong and that Republicans should not be deterred from their long-standing goal of enacting some nationwide abortion limits.\nSome Republicans downplay the prospects of federal abortion restrictions' passing Congress, even if they win full control. Biden and his allies are telling voters to look at the GOP's long history of championing federal restrictions and not their recent rhetoric.\nImmigration The contrast: Trump has promised a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration and tougher executive actions; Biden is asking Congress to give him more tools to manage an overwhelmed border and create new legal pathways to immigrate to the U.S.\nThe contrast: Trump has promised a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration and tougher executive actions; Biden is asking Congress to give him more tools to manage an overwhelmed border and create new legal pathways to immigrate to the U.S. Trump has called existing border laws an existential threat to the U.S., saying migrants are 'poisoning the blood of our country' and bringing new 'languages.' His campaign website says: 'President Trump will shut down Biden's border disaster. He will again end catch-and-release, restore Remain in Mexico, and eliminate asylum fraud. In cooperative states, President Trump will deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement to assist with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals.'\nAfter having rescinded some of Trump's policies, Biden has recently shifted to support stricter immigration laws as the system remains overwhelmed. He championed a bipartisan bill to raise the bar for gaining asylum, grant more U.S. resources to process asylum claims and turn away migrants who do not qualify, and empower the president to temporarily shut down the border if migration levels hit certain triggers. (Republicans blocked the bill in the Senate amid lobbying by Trump, who wants to use the border as an election issue.) Biden has also endorsed the U.S. Citizenship Act, which would grant a pathway to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally if they pass background checks and pay their taxes.\nFundamentally, Trump has aligned with forces who want less immigration into the country, while Biden has embraced the belief that immigrants make the U.S. better.\nHealth care and prescription drugs The contrast: Biden wants to extend Affordable Care Act provisions and empower Medicare to negotiate more prescription drugs; Trump has aggressively criticized the ACA but not offered a health care plan.\nThe contrast: Biden wants to extend Affordable Care Act provisions and empower Medicare to negotiate more prescription drugs; Trump has aggressively criticized the ACA but not offered a health care plan. Biden, who was vice president when the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, sees it as a cherished achievement to protect and strengthen. The law, also known as \"Obamacare,\" which has extended coverage to 45 million people through subsidies, insurance mandates and a Medicaid expansion, continues to face conservative opposition.\nSeparately, Biden has touted a provision in his party-line Inflation Reduction Act that empowers Medicare to negotiate lower prices for 10 prescription drugs. He said he wants to boost that to 50 if he is re-elected, with the goal of $200 billion in savings.\nTrump spent his four years as president fighting unsuccessfully to repeal and unravel the law — through legislation and executive action and endorsing lawsuits to wipe it out. In November, Trump called for revisiting plans to \"terminate\" the ACA. He has recently sought to downplay that and insists he only wants to improve the law. But he has not offered a health care plan. Many of his GOP allies in Congress still favor repealing or undoing the ACA, including a budget by the Republican Study Committee, which boasts about 80% of the House GOP conference as members, including Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana.\nTaxes The contrast: Trump's 2017 tax cuts expire at the end of next year, and he has called for extending them; Biden has called for raising taxes on families earning over $400,000 to fund various priorities.\nThe contrast: Trump's 2017 tax cuts expire at the end of next year, and he has called for extending them; Biden has called for raising taxes on families earning over $400,000 to fund various priorities. A series of Trump tax cuts, which Republicans passed on a party-line basis in 2017, expire at the end of 2025. Congress and the winner of the election will decide what happens to them.\nIn a recent private speech to wealthy donors, Trump said his policies include \"extending the Trump tax cuts\" if he is elected, according to a Trump campaign official. That would preserve lower rates across the income spectrum, with the biggest benefits for top earners.\nBiden has attacked that law as a giveaway to the wealthiest Americans, vowing to make \"big corporations and the very wealthy finally pay their fair share.\" He has backed a corporate tax rate hike from 21% to 28% and said that \"nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny in federal taxes.\" Biden is also calling for a $3,600-per-child tax cut for families, an $800 average tax break for \"front-line workers\" and a 25% minimum tax on billionaires, according to a newly released campaign plank.\nThe expiration of the Trump tax cuts will restore the unlimited federal deduction for state and local taxes, which Republicans had capped at $10,000 in the 2017 law. Republicans broadly support preserving the cap, with some exceptions, while most Democrats want to lift it.\nJudges and the Supreme Court The contrast: Their track records tell a clear story. Trump has picked young conservative judges to serve on the federal bench, while Biden has picked liberals with a focus on professional and personal diversity.\nThe contrast: Their track records tell a clear story. Trump has picked young conservative judges to serve on the federal bench, while Biden has picked liberals with a focus on professional and personal diversity. One of the clearest contrasts is what kinds of judges Trump and Biden would pick for lifetime appointments on the federal courts. A simple way for voters to think about it is whether they prefer new judges with the conservative views of Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump's first Supreme Court pick, or with the liberal views of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, Biden's (so far only) high court pick.\nAs president, Trump nominated young conservative judges who will serve for generations. Biden has focused on finding judges with diverse backgrounds and résumés, including more civil rights lawyers and public defenders.\nPerhaps the biggest question is whether a Supreme Court vacancy will open up in the next four years. The presidential election winner and the party that controls the Senate would fill it.\nTrade The contrast: Trump is pushing a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports; Biden's White House opposes that, saying it would raise inflation.\nThe contrast: Trump is pushing a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports; Biden's White House opposes that, saying it would raise inflation. Trump, long a skeptic of U.S. trade deals, has proposed to impose a 10% tariff on all imported goods if he returns to the White House. He recently told Fox News that it could be 60% — or potentially 'more than that' — on imports of Chinese goods.\nBiden opposes that idea. In a memo over the weekend, the White House slammed the idea of \"across-the-board tariffs that would raise taxes and prices by $1,500 per American family,\" without naming Trump; it referred to an estimate by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, that Trump's 10% tax on imports could cost an average American household $1,500 per year.\nBiden, instead, has sought to boost domestic manufacturing with major federal investments in semiconductors and electric vehicles.\nForeign policy and NATO The contrast: Biden favors Ukraine aid, while Trump is skeptical of it; Biden supports NATO and a traditional view of American power, while Trump has criticized NATO and voiced some isolationist views.\nThe contrast: Biden favors Ukraine aid, while Trump is skeptical of it; Biden supports NATO and a traditional view of American power, while Trump has criticized NATO and voiced some isolationist views. The clearest example of the foreign policy differences between the two concerns the fate of Ukraine, which is running low on ammunition and says it needs U.S. assistance to continue holding off Russia's aggression. Biden is an ardent proponent of helping Ukraine, while Trump has poured cold water on U.S. aid to Ukraine and successfully pressured House Republicans to block it since they took the majority in January 2023.\nAnd that points to a deeper divide: Biden is an outspoken supporter of the NATO alliance as a bulwark against adversaries like Russia and China and of preserving the post-World War II order. Trump has dialed up his criticisms of NATO and aligned with a growing isolationist wing in the U.S. that wants to be less involved in global affairs. Trump recently said that as president, he 'would encourage' Russia 'to do whatever the hell they want' to member countries who are 'delinquent' in their dues.\nSahil Kapur",

            "excerpt": "Trump is taking aim at Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as several recent polls show he may have more to lose from the independent's presence on the ballot.",
            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he's confident that independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will pull more votes away from President Joe Biden than from him — a net win for the Republican's candidacy.\n'He is Crooked Joe Biden's Political Opponent, not mine,' Trump wrote on Truth Social late last month. 'I love that he is running!'\nBehind closed doors, however, Trump is less sure. A Republican who was in the room with Trump earlier this year as the former president reviewed polling said Trump was unsure of how Kennedy would impact the race, asking the other people on hand whether or not Kennedy was actually good for his candidacy.\nAnd after mostly ignoring Kennedy early in his campaign, Trump has stepped up his efforts to brand the independent candidate as left-wing and make him Biden's problem, suggesting that he and allies are concerned about Kennedy's ability to attract Republican voters. In the same post in which he called Kennedy Biden's political opponent, Trump called Kennedy 'the most Radical Left Candidate in the race, by far,' someone who was 'a big fan of the Green New Scam' and 'other economy killing disasters.'\nIn a video monologue he posted to his social media page this month, Trump described Kennedy as being to Biden's left but said Kennedy has 'got some nice things about him' and 'I happen to like him.'\n'If I were a Democrat, I'd vote for RFK Jr. every single time over Biden because he's frankly more in line with Democrats,' Trump said, adding, 'I do believe that RFK Jr. will do very well. And I do believe he's going to take a lot of votes away from crooked Joe Biden.'\nTrump's increased focus on Kennedy comes as Democrats have increased their attention on third-party contenders, standing up super PACs and other anti-spoiler efforts meant to kneecap independent challengers who could pull from Biden and reduce the vote share Trump needs to get over the top this fall. And in defiance of earlier conventional wisdom about the 2024 race, new polling shows that right now Trump might have the most to lose with Kennedy on the ballot.\nAn NBC News national poll released Sunday found that Kennedy cut deeper into Trump's support than Biden's. The survey found that 15% of voters who picked Trump in a head-to-head matchup with Biden switched to choose Kennedy in a five-way ballot test, while just 7% of those who initially selected Biden in the head-to-head switched to Kennedy when third-party candidates were added.\nThat trend meant Trump went from leading Biden by 2 percentage points in a head-to-head survey to trailing him by 2 points when the race is expanded to five named candidates, including Kennedy. The survey's margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\nRepublican voters view Kennedy much more favorably than Democrats. The poll found that 40% of self-identified Republicans viewed Kennedy favorably, while 15% held negative views of the independent candidate. For Democrats, just 16% had positive views of Kennedy, while 53% expressed a negative view of him.\nThat's in part the result of conservative media and Trump allies heaping praise on Kennedy when he was initially running in the Democratic primary against Biden, as well as prior to this election cycle as Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, railed against the medical establishment and so-called social media 'censorship.'\nA Republican who worked on a door-knocking effort in an early state for a Trump primary opponent told NBC News that Kennedy often came up as the second choice among people who said they were backing Trump.\nA changing posture Trump himself has offered kind words for Kennedy in the past. During a June 2023 interview on the Howie Carr Show, Trump described Kennedy as 'a common sense guy.' Right-wing allies like Steve Bannon, Alex Jones and Roger Stone openly pined for Trump to pick Kennedy as his running mate.\nThe vibe is different now.\nThe pro-Trump PAC MAGA Inc. this month launched a 'Radical F---ing Kennedy' website dedicated to promoting the candidate's left-wing positions. Kennedy, meanwhile, has criticized Trump from the right, hitting him for taking advice from Dr. Anthony Fauci during the pandemic and for running up the deficit. He said another Trump term 'would be bad for the country.'\n'President Trump calls me an ultra-left radical,' Kennedy posted on X in response to the MAGA Inc. website. 'I'm soooo liberal that his emissaries asked me to be his VP. I respectfully declined the offer.' (Trump's campaign has denied that Kennedy was ever approached about being the former president's running mate.)\n'I am against President Trump, and President Biden can't win,' Kennedy's post continued. 'Judging by his new website, it looks like President Trump knows who actually can beat him.'\nOn the whole, there have been public surveys showing both major party candidates suffering more as a result of Kennedy's campaign. The dynamic also may change depending on which state is being surveyed — and which states feature Kennedy on the ballot in November, a battle that is still in progress.\n'Nobody has conducted more polls than I have on Kennedy and his place in the race — and continuously I have seen him draw equally from Biden and Trump,' said Jeremy Zogby, a managing partner at John Zogby Strategies who has polled for Kennedy's campaign. 'Sometimes a point or two towards one side in a poll, and vice versa in another poll. The fact remains Kennedy has crossover appeal among those disaffected within both parties,' like the 'double haters' who dislike both Biden and Trump.\nDemocrats have long worried that Kennedy's association with his famous father and uncles will win over some liberals who are fond of the family. Plus, Kennedy for years gained acclaim as an environmental activist and an anti-corporate crusader, two causes that have him finding common ground with Democratic voters.\nLast week, Biden held an event with Kennedy family members who touted the president and warned of the danger their relative's campaign posed. And on Monday, the Democratic National Committee announced it was launching billboards in Arizona depicting Kennedy as a pro-Trump spoiler candidate.\nA strategist working on the Democrats' anti-third party effort said the data shows Kennedy is clearly taking a slice from both major party candidates, as well as a portion of voters who wouldn't be open to voting for either Trump or Biden.\n'I think the data's moved a little bit over the last month-plus,' this person said. 'But it's all on the margins, it's tough to tell whether this is RFK appealing more to Trump voters, or some Trump voters just looking for an off-ramp, or both. Ditto on the Biden end — is this just reflecting the fact that Biden's ticked up a few points?'\nOne Trump ally said the presumptive GOP nominee should hold off on hitting Kennedy for now, arguing there will be time later this fall to go after him as 'too liberal for America' if these polling trends continue.\n'The second you start attacking him or even addressing him, you start giving credibility to and you start firming up those votes,' this person said, 'At the moment, he's irrelevant. As you get close and votes start hardening in terms of who people are voting for and when and why and how, then you've got to start making moves.'\nIn a statement, Trump's campaign railed against Kennedy's environmental positions and described him as 'no independent , ' while also hitting Democrats for challenging his efforts to get on the ballot.\n,' while also hitting Democrats for challenging his efforts to get on the ballot. 'RFK Jr. is an AOC lover and opposes really any human advancement, preferring that we all live in caves by candlelight, except of course supports charging stations for your $150,000 electric car that can only drive a few miles before dying just like his presidential campaign,' said Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director.\nTony Lyons, a co-founder of the pro-Kennedy super PAC American Values 2024 and the president of Skyhorse Publishing, said there will be a 'pendulum swinging back and forth' throughout the campaign that shows Kennedy at times being better for Trump and at other times boosting Biden's candidacy.\nLyons said Kennedy will soon be promoting a 30-minute infomercial posted online that aims to hit back on the attacks he's facing from his rivals.\n'The fascinating part of it is that Trump says he's ultra left-wing,' Lyons said. 'And Biden says that he's ultra right-wing.'\nAllan Smith Alex Seitz-Wald and Vaughn Hillyard contributed.",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court is allowing Idaho to enforce its ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth while lawsuits over the law proceed, reversing lower courts.\nThe justices' order Monday allows the state to put in a place a 2023 law that subjects physicians to up to 10 years in prison if they provide hormones, puberty blockers or other gender-affirming care to people under age 18. Under the court's order, the two transgender teens who sued to challenge the law still will be able to obtain care.\nThe court's three liberal justices would have kept the law on hold.\nA federal judge in Idaho had blocked the law in its entirety after determining that it was necessary to do so to protect the teens, who are identified under pseudonyms in court papers.\nOpponents of the law have said it will likely increase suicide rates among teens. The law's backers have said it is necessary to 'protect children' from medical or surgical treatments for gender dysphoria, though there's little indication that gender-affirming surgeries are being performed on transgender youth in Idaho.\nGender-affirming care for youth is supported by every major medical organization, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association.\nMedical professionals define gender dysphoria as severe psychological distress experienced by those whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth.\nThe action comes as the justices also may soon consider whether to take up bans in Kentucky and Tennessee that an appeals court allowed to be enforced in the midst of legal fights.\nAt least 23 states have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, and most of those states face lawsuits. A federal judge struck down Arkansas' ban as unconstitutional. Montana's ban also is temporarily on hold.\nThe states that have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors are Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.\nThe Associated Press",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Rejecting an appeal brought by Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson, the Supreme Court on Monday skipped deciding whether the leader of a demonstration can be sued for an injury to a police officer caused by another protester.\nMckesson, who was leading a protest in Baton Rouge in July 2016 following the police killing of a Black man, faces a lawsuit from an officer who was hit in the head by a rock or piece of concrete thrown by an unidentified person.\nThe protest was sparked by the death of Alton Sterling after an altercation outside a convenience store where he was selling CDs.\nMckesson, who is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, says his actions leading the protest are protected under the Constitution's First Amendment, which guarantees both free speech and the right to assemble.\nNo justices dissented from the court's decision not to hear the case, but liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a statement explaining why the court did not need to intervene. She mentioned a recent Supreme Court ruling raising some of the same issues that could benefit Mckesson as the litigation continues.\nThe court's refusal to hear the case \"expresses no view about the merits of Mckesson's claim,\" she added.\nThe officer says Mckesson was negligent under Louisiana law by failing to foresee that the protest could lead to violence. The lawsuit alleged that the officer lost teeth and suffered a brain injury.\nThe case has already bounced around the courts. Initially, a federal judge ruled in 2017 that Mckesson could not be sued, but the New Orleans-based 5th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that finding.\nMckesson appealed to the Supreme Court, leading to a detour in the litigation as the justices ordered further analysis on whether Louisiana law even allowed for a claim like the one the officer was bringing.\nThe Louisiana Supreme Court was asked to weigh in on the state law question and confirmed that the claim could be brought. The appeals court in 2022 then reaffirmed that the officer's lawsuit could move forward, prompting Mckesson to turn to the U.S. Supreme Court for a second time.\nAmong other things, the appeals court said the officer had plausibly alleged that Mckesson helped create an unsafe situation by assembling outside the police station, failing to take any action to prevent looting, and leading the protesters onto a public highway, which is illegal in Louisiana.\nLawyers for the unnamed officer say that the First Amendment \"does not protect against tort liability for the reasonably foreseeable consequences of one's own negligent, illegal and dangerous activity.\"\nMckesson has been a key figure in the Black Lives Matter movement, which has strongly criticized overly aggressive policing against Black people.\nLawrence Hurley",

            "summary": "TBILISI — Georgia's parliament on Wednesday approved the first reading of a bill on 'foreign agents' that has provoked several days of protests by critics who see it as authoritarian and Russian-inspired, Georgian media reported.\nEighty-three out of 150 deputies voted in favour of the bill, while opposition MPs boycotted the vote. It must pass two more readings before becoming law.\nThe bill would require organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as agents of foreign influence, and has been compared by critics to a law that Russia has used extensively to crack down on dissent.\nIts fate is widely seen as a test of whether Georgia, 33 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, intends to pursue a path of integration with the West or move back closer towards Russia.\nOn Tuesday, protesters clashed with riot police who used pepper spray to clear the area around parliament of thousands of demonstrators shouting slogans against what they call 'the Russian law'.\nEleven people were arrested and one police officer was injured. Opposition groups have called for more protests on Wednesday night.\nRussia is widely disliked in the South Caucasus country of 3.7 million, which lost a brief war with Russia over the Moscow-backed breakaway territory of South Ossetia in 2008.\nThe United States, Britain and European countries have all warned against passing the bill. The EU, which gave Georgia candidate status in December, has said the draft law is incompatible with its values.\nThe Kremlin said on Wednesday that it had nothing to do with the foreign agent bill, which it defended as a 'normal practice'. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was being used by outside actors to stoke anti-Russian sentiment.\nDemonstrators protest against the reintroduction of the 'Foreign Agents' bill in Tbilisi on Tuesday night. Mirian Meladze / Anadolu via Getty Images The ruling Georgian Dream party, which has faced accusations of authoritarianism and excessive closeness to Russia, says the bill is necessary to promote transparency and combat 'pseudo-liberal values' imposed by foreigners.\nThe bill, which was initially introduced in March 2023 but shelved after two nights of violent protests, has increased divisions in an already deeply polarised Georgia.\nA coalition of opposition groups, civil society, celebrities, and the country's figurehead president have rallied against the ruling party to oppose it.\nOn Wednesday, the captain of Georgia's national soccer team, which is riding high after qualifying for Euro 2024, its first major tournament, posted a picture on Instagram of two protesters staring down riot police on Tuesday night, adding the message 'Fuck Russia'.",

Chu, an alumnus of USC, was to give the keynote commencement address and was to receive an honorary degree, the university had announced.

Although it's in international waters, China considers the passage of foreign military aircraft and ships through it a challenge to its sovereignty.\nChina claims the island of Taiwan, threatening to defend it by force if necessary despite U.S. military support for the island.\nChina scrambled fighter jets to 'monitor the U.S. plane's passage' and operated 'in accordance of laws and regulations, naval Col.

Dong Jun, on Tuesday in the latest U.S. effort to improve communications with the Chinese military and reduce the chances of a clash in the region.\nIt was the first time Austin has talked to Dong and the first time he has spoken at length with any Chinese counterpart since November 2022. The call, which lasted a bit more than an hour, came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to travel to China this month for talks.\nMilitary-to-military contact stalled in August 2022, when Beijing suspended all such communication after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. China responded by firing missiles over Taiwan and staging a surge in military maneuvers, including what appeared to be a rehearsal of a naval and aerial blockade of the island.\nThe Associated Press",

            "excerpt": "The latest gun rights dispute concerns the Biden administration's effort to regulate gun-making kits the same way as commercially available firearms.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to consider whether the Biden administration can lawfully regulate so-called ghost guns — firearms that are made from kits available online that people can assemble at home.\nThe justices took up a Biden administration appeal in defense of regulations that a lower court invalidated. The provisions in question are currently in effect while litigation continues.\nIn August of last year, the Supreme Court allowed the regulation to be enforced on a 5-4 vote, with Chief Justice John Roberts and fellow conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the three liberal justices in the majority.\nThe federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, commonly known as ATF, issued the regulations in 2022 to tackle what it claims has been an abrupt increase in the availability of ghost guns. The guns are difficult for law enforcement to trace, with the administration calling them a major threat to public safety.\nThe rule clarified that the parts used to make ghost guns fit within the definition of 'firearm' under the federal Gun Control Act, meaning the government has the power to regulate them the same way it regulates firearms manufactured and sold through the traditional process.\nThe regulations require manufacturers and sellers of the kits to obtain licenses, mark the products with serial numbers, conduct background checks and maintain records.\nTexas-based U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor last year ruled in favor of Jennifer VanDerStok and Michael Andren, who own components they want to use to build guns. Plaintiffs also include gun rights groups and makers and sellers of ghost guns.\nAfter the Supreme Court allowed the regulation to remain in effect while litigation moved forward, the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals mostly ruled for the challengers.\n\"Because Congress has neither authorized the expansion of firearm regulation nor permitted the criminalization of previously lawful conduct, the proposed rule constitutes unlawful agency action, in direct contravention of the legislature's will,\" the ruling said.\nIf that decision were allowed to go into effect, \"anyone could buy a kit online and assemble a fully functional gun in minutes — no background check, records, or serial number required,\" Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in court papers.\n\"The result would be a flood of untraceable ghost guns into our nation's communities, endangering the public and thwarting law-enforcement efforts to solve violent crimes,\" she added.\nThe challengers agreed with the Biden administration that the Supreme Court should take up the case, citing its nationwide importance.\nTheir lawyers wrote that it is not the job of the ATF to expand the meaning of \"firearm\" under the Gun Control Act.\n\"If that definition has become obsolete or unsatisfactory in any way, that is an issue for Congress to address,\" they wrote.\nThe Supreme Court's conservative majority has backed gun rights in multiple cases, including the landmark 2022 ruling that for the first time recognized that the Constitution's Second Amendment includes a right to bear arms outside the home.\nThe court is currently weighing the scope of that decision in a case concerning whether people accused of domestic violence have a right to own firearms.\nThe ghost guns case, however, is on a separate legal question related to ATF's regulatory authority, not the right to bear arms.\nThe justices are set to decide a similar case in the coming weeks, a challenge to another ATF regulation that banned \"bump stocks,\" an accessory that allows semi-automatic rifles to be fired rapidly.\nLawrence Hurley",

Exactly this type of leadership is required to maintain a rules-based international order and predictability for all nations,' he said.\nThe Ukrainian president noted that his country's 'warriors on the front lines' would feel the benefit of the aid package.\nOne such 'warrior' is infantry soldier Oleksandr, fighting around Avdiivka, the city in the Donetsk region that Ukraine lost to Russia in February after months of intense combat.\n'For us it's so important to have this support from the U.S. and our partners,' Oleksandr told The Associated Press. He did not give his full name for security reasons.\n'With this we can stop them and reduce our losses. It's the first step to have the possibility to liberate our territory.'\nAmmunition shortages linked to the aid holdup over the past six months have led Ukrainian military commanders to ration shells, a disadvantage that Russia seized on this year — taking the city of Avdiivka and currently inching towards the town of Chasiv Yar, also in the Donetsk region.\n'The Russians come at us in waves — we become exhausted, we have to leave our positions. This is repeated many times,' Oleksandr said. 'Not having enough ammunition means we can't cover the area that is our responsibility to hold when they are assaulting us.'\nOther Western leaders lauded the passing of the aid package.\n'Ukraine is using the weapons provided by NATO Allies to destroy Russian combat capabilities. This makes us all safer, in Europe & North America,' NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg wrote on X.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that 'Ukraine deserves all the support it can get against Russia.'\nIn Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the approval of aid to Ukraine 'expected and predictable.'\nThe decision 'will make the United States of America richer, further ruin Ukraine and result in the deaths of even more Ukrainians, the fault of the Kyiv regime,' Peskov was quoted as saying by Russian news agency Ria Novosti.\n'The new aid package will not save, but, on the contrary, will kill thousands and thousands more people, prolong the conflict, and bring even more grief and devastation,' Leonid Slutsky, head of the Russian State Duma Committee on International Affairs, wrote on Telegram.\nThe whole aid package will go to the U.S. Senate, which could pass it as soon as Tuesday. President Joe Biden has promised to sign it immediately.\nThe Associated Press",

            "summary": "The University of Southern California has sparked condemnation from a leading Muslim group after it canceled a planned commencement speech by its valedictorian, citing security concerns due to tensions over 'the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.'\nAsna Tabassum said she was told Monday that she would no longer be able to give a speech as she and other graduates at the Los Angeles university are celebrated on May 10.\n'I am both shocked by this decision and profoundly disappointed that the University is succumbing to a campaign of hate meant to silence my voice,' Tabassum said in a statement released by the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\nUSC Provost Andrew Guzman said in an announcement Monday that 'over the past several days, discussion relating to the selection of our valedictorian has taken on an alarming tenor.\"\n'The intensity of feelings, fueled by both social media and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, has grown to include many voices outside of USC and has escalated to the point of creating substantial risks relating to security and disruption at commencement,' Guzman said.\nAt least two pro-Israel and Jewish groups complained to USC about the choice, pointing to her social media activity.\nTabassum's Instagram account links to a slideshow encouraging people to 'learn about what's happening in palestine, and how to help.' It calls for 'one palestinian state,' which it says 'would mean palestinian liberation, and the complete abolishment of the state of israel.'\nTrojans for Israel said this 'must be denounced as antisemitic bigotry.'\nTabassum said she added that link on her social media account five years ago and was not the author, according to NBC Los Angeles.\nTabassum is a first-generation South Asian-American Muslim from Chino Hills, a city east of Los Angeles, she said in her personal statement about USC's decision. She is a major in biomedical engineering and a minor in resistance to genocide.\nTabassum said that in her studies and in her life, she 'learned that ordinary people are capable of unspeakable acts of violence when they are taught hate fueled by fear.'\n'And due to widespread fear, I was hoping to use my commencement speech to inspire my classmates with a message of hope,' she said. 'By canceling my speech, USC is only caving to fear and rewarding hatred.'\nTabassum was selected by a committee out of almost 100 applicants for valedictorian, who applied based on their 'perfect or near-perfect GPAs,' Guzman said.\n'The committee assessed each application based on various criteria — which did not include social media presence — and made a recommendation to me,' the provost continued. 'Based on these faculty recommendations, I made the final decision.'\nTabassum in her statement also claimed that in a meeting Sunday, 'I asked about the alleged safety concerns and was told that the University had the resources to take appropriate safety measures for my valedictory speech, but that they would not be doing so since increased security protections is not what the University wants to ‘present as an image.''\nA university spokesperson said of the claim: 'It's not accurate.'\nThe Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas against Israel, and the war Israel has waged against Hamas in Gaza as a response, have generated strong feelings on college campuses across the country, including allegations of antisemitism and Islamophobia.\nGuzman, in his announcement about the change, did not single out any website or side of the conflict in saying that the valedictorian would not give a speech as originally planned.\nHe wrote that there has been harassment and even violence on other campuses, and he denied the issue had anything to do with freedom of speech.\n'There is no free-speech entitlement to speak at a commencement,' he wrote. 'The issue here is how best to maintain campus security and safety, period.'\nCanceling the speech is 'disappointing,' he said, but 'tradition must give way to safety.'\nThe Los Angeles chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, condemned the cancellation.\n'USC cannot hide its cowardly decision behind a disingenuous concern for ‘security,'' CAIR-LA Executive Director Hussam Ayloush said in a statement.\n'The dishonest and defamatory attacks on Asna are nothing more than thinly-veiled manifestations of Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian racism, which have been weaponized against college students across the country who speak up for human rights — and for Palestinian humanity,' Ayloush said.\nThe commencement event will celebrate 19,000-plus graduates and is expected to draw around 65,000 people to the campus in the University Park section of Los Angeles, according to USC.\nPhil Helsel",

            "excerpt": "A series of early-1900s Supreme Court rulings included discriminatory language and helped ensure that people in U.S. territories would not have the same rights as other Americans.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — A mostly Democratic group of lawmakers are among those launching a renewed push for the Justice Department to condemn racist Supreme Court rulings from a century ago that shaped a legal landscape in which people living in U.S. territories were essentially treated as second-class citizens.\nCivil rights groups and professional legal associations are also joining the effort targeting the so-called \"Insular Cases,\" beginning with a letter sent to the Attorney General Merrick Garland this week.\nLawmakers, including members of the Senate and House of Representatives, are also holding a press conference Wednesday to bring attention to the issue.\nAmong the 43 lawmakers signing the new letter are Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the ranking member of House Judiciary Committee.\n\"Today, the Department of Justice has the opportunity to redress this historic error by unequivocally rejecting the discriminatory and racist doctrine of territorial incorporation established by the Insular Cases ,\" the lawmakers wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by NBC News.\n,\" the lawmakers wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by NBC News. Two Republicans who serve as their territories' delegates in Congress, James Moylan of Guam and Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon of Puerto Rico, also signed on. The other signatories are all Democrats.\nThe Insular Cases were a series of rulings issued in the 1900s soon after the U.S. had acquired Puerto Rico and other territories in which the court said people in those jurisdictions did not have all the constitutional rights of those living in the mainland.\nJustice Henry Billings Brown in a 1901 case referred to territories as lands 'inhabited by alien races' who might not abide by 'Anglo-Saxon principles.' Five years earlier, Brown had authored the notorious Plessy v. Ferguson ruling, which endorsed racial segregation.\nIn a separate opinion in the 1901 case, Justice Edward Douglass White said the U.S. had the right to acquire 'an unknown island, peopled with an uncivilized race,' without having to confer full constitutional protections. Several further rulings developed the theory that certain rights but not others applied to people in territories.\nTo date, the Supreme Court itself has not been receptive to pleas that it officially distance itself from the insular cases. Only two of the nine justices, conservative Neil Gorsuch and liberal Sonia Sotomayor, have expressed concerns about the precedents remaining on the books.\nIn a 2022 opinion, Gorsuch suggested the court take up a case in which the Insular Cases could be reversed, saying they include \"ugly racial stereotypes\" and that their flaws are 'as fundamental as they are shameful.'\nLater in 2022, the court declined to take up a case concerning the rights of American Samoans that could have given the justices the opportunity to address the matter.\nCivil rights groups and some lawmakers have previously asked the Justice Department to abandon reliance on the cases. The department has made some statements distancing itself from the rulings but has not expressly repudiated them.\nIn a March court filing, for example, Justice Department lawyers wrote that the government agreed with critics that \"aspects of the Insular Cases' reasoning and rhetoric, which invoke racist stereotypes, are indefensible and repugnant.\"\nNeil Weare, co-director of an advocacy group called Right to Democracy that has taken aim at the Insular Cases, said the Justice Department \"continues to take a step in the right direction but has fallen short of unequivocally condemning the Insular Cases.\"\nThe new letter would be followed by other actions, which could include new legal filings, he added.\nRep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., who is ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee and helped organize the letter, said in a statement that the Justice Department should \"go further and unequivocally reject these racist decisions, much as it has for other Supreme Court opinions that relied on racist stereotypes that do not abide by the Constitution's command of equality and respect for rule of law.\"\nThere is precedent for such an action, with the Justice Department in 2011 issuing an \"admission of error\" for its role in the 1944 Supreme Court ruling in a case called Korematsu v. United States, which upheld the interment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.\nThe Supreme Court in 2018 officially repudiated Korematsu, with Chief Justice John Roberts saying it was \"gravely wrong on the day it was decided.\"\nA Justice Department spokesman had no immediate comment on the new letter.\nThere are five U.S. territories: Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands. Puerto Rico, with about 3 million residents, is by the far the largest by population.\nLawrence Hurley",

            "summary": "LOS ANGELES — Some students at the University of Southern California said their sense of pride was dashed this week when the school canceled Muslim student Asna Tabassum's valedictorian speech out of security concerns.\nThey said the announcement of Tabassum's selection as valedictorian this month made them feel seen and heard.\n'It showed me that our people have a voice on campus,' said USC student Abdullah Khlefat, who is Muslim.\nAnother student, named Layan, who asked that her last name not be used because she was afraid of being harassed for speaking out, said the announcement had brightened her outlook about the future.\n'For a sliver of a moment, I had a sense of hope. I felt like one day I could be like Asna,' said Layan, a first-year student majoring in political science.\nThose dreams were crushed when USC Provost Andrew Guzman rescinded Tabassum's invitation to speak at graduation, citing security concerns over tensions related to 'the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.\"\nHe said in an announcement Monday that 'over the past several days, discussion relating to the selection of our valedictorian has taken on an alarming tenor.'\n'The intensity of feelings, fueled by both social media and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, has grown to include many voices outside of USC and has escalated to the point of creating substantial risks relating to security and disruption at commencement,' the announcement read in part.\nUniversity officials did not respond to a request for details about threats the school may have received since the announcement or whether Tabassum had been made aware of them.\nFirst-year student Danica Gonzalez, who supports Tabassum as valedictorian, said she believes the university is using security as pretext. She pointed to last year's commencement, which former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, attended when their daughter Sasha graduated.\n\"There is no way the university can't protect her,\" Gonzalez said of Tabassum. \"It's just that they're choosing not to.\"\nAfter Tabassum was selected as valedictorian, at least two pro-Israel and Jewish groups complained to USC about the choice. They pointed to her social media activity, including her Instagram account, which links to a slideshow encouraging people to 'learn about what's happening in palestine, and how to help.'\nIt calls for 'one palestinian state,' which it says 'would mean palestinian liberation, and the complete abolishment of the state of israel.'\nBrandon Tavakoli, president of Trojans for Israel, called Tabassum's post 'antisemitic.'\n'The university has to make the decision about whether this valedictorian and her propagation of antisemitic vitriol online is worthy of being the representative of the class of 2024,' he told NBC News. 'Commencement is supposed to be an inclusive and welcoming space for all students, including Jewish graduates and their families.'\nTrojans for Israel said in a statement on Instagram that university officials failed to vet Tabassum's social media posts and condemn what it described as antisemitic content.\n\"We call on the University to speak with more moral clarity and hold our esteemed leaders to the highest standards of University standards,\" the statement read in part.\nThe recent controversy at USC underscores rising tensions across college campuses since the Israel-Hamas war started on Oct. 7.\nLast week, a University of California, Berkeley, professor confronted a Muslim student during a dinner for graduating law students, an incident that was recorded on video and triggered an outpouring of anger and frustration from both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel groups.\nEarlier this month, 20 students at Pomona College in Southern California were arrested after they stormed and occupied the college president's office.\nAt Columbia University in New York, several students were suspended this month after they hosted an unsanctioned event on campus featuring a speaker linked to a terrorist organization.\nTensions at USC reached a boiling point this month after Tabassum was selected as valedictorian, Gonzalez said. Students who disagreed with Tabassum's support for the Palestinian cause berated her on social media, and her supporters used those same platforms to defend her and denounce the school when her speech was canceled.\n\"It's been very jarring,\" Gonzalez said. \"It feels like the university is just trying to protect its image.\"\nTabassum was born in the Southern California community of Chino Hills and majored in biomedical engineering with a minor in resistance to genocide, which included studying how technology, immigration and literacy play roles in the type of medical care people receive, according to a statement USC released when she was named valedictorian.\nLayan, who was born in Syria and moved to the U.S. in the fifth grade, described Tabassum as a mentor and a role model.\n'She wears a hijab, and I wear a hijab and am also Muslim,' Layan said. 'I feel so connected to her.'\nLayan first met Tabassum at the Muslim Student Union this year, she said. Tabassum introduced herself and swapped phone numbers with Layan, promising to keep her updated on events where Layan could meet new people.\n'She is genuinely such a sweet person. I just know from the bottom of my heart she wouldn't wish violence on anyone,' Layan said.\nIn a statement, Tabassum said the university's decision is thinly veiled racism.\n'Although this should have been a time of celebration for my family, friends, professors, and classmates, anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian voices have subjected me to a campaign of racist hatred because of my uncompromising belief in human rights for all,' she said.\nAlicia Victoria Lozano",

            "excerpt": "The agenda is heavy on economics and lighter on cultural issues, carrying echoes of FDR's New Deal. It omits some issues that lack Democratic consensus, like \"Medicare for All.\"",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Top House progressives will unveil a sweeping agenda Thursday to lay down a marker for the policies they'll push next year if Democrats win the 2024 election, from a higher minimum wage and strengthening antitrust laws to new federal benefits for seniors on Social Security and parents raising kids.\nThe Congressional Progressive Caucus agenda, first shared with NBC News, doubles as a blueprint of political advice for how it believes President Joe Biden can win over progressives and young voters who are uninspired by his re-election bid ahead of a rematch with former President Donald Trump.\n'If the progressive base is not excited and enthusiastic — and if they don't feel like we are trying to earn their votes and that they are important — then I think the horrific idea of a second Donald Trump presidency could become reality,' Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the progressive caucus chair, said in an interview. 'We cannot afford to let that happen. And we won't.'\nThe seven-point agenda is heavily focused on economics and lighter on cultural issues, carrying echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. It begins with provisions to boost the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour by 2028 and pass the PRO Act to strengthen unions, as well as other provisions, such as guaranteeing overtime pay. It includes policies to reduce the cost of living — by capping child care costs at 7% of income for all families; expanding Social Security benefits by closing tax loopholes; adding dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare; and enacting a series of policies to protect renters and make housing more affordable.\n2028 and pass the PRO Act to strengthen unions, as well as other provisions, such as guaranteeing overtime pay. It includes policies to reduce the cost of living — by capping child care costs at 7% of income for all families; expanding Social Security benefits by closing tax loopholes; adding dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare; and enacting a series of policies to protect renters and make housing more affordable. 'It's really about worker power and raising wages and lowering costs for poor people, middle-class Americans and the working people across this country,' Jayapal said.\nThe five other planks are investments in education, including universal pre-K and kindergarten; aggressive clean energy standards to tackle climate change; 'making our democracy work' with federal voting rights mandates, Washington, D.C., statehood and elimination of the Senate filibuster; taking on corporations and monopolies; and 'advancing justice' though abortion rights, pro-LGBTQ measures, pro-immigrant policies and setting national policing standards.\nThe agenda is also notable for what's not included. 'Medicare for All,' a rallying cry of the left for years, is excluded. Foreign policy issues like Israel and Gaza, which have sparked fiery pro-Palestinian protests across the country, are also kept out. Jayapal said that's partly because the caucus decided to make it a domestic-issue-only blueprint and partly out of pragmatism — to focus more on unifying issues for Democrats and steer clear of the ones that divide them.\n'The way we came to this agenda is to say that we were going to put into this agenda things that were populist and possible ... and affected a huge number of people,' she said. 'We haven't taken a position on particularly Israel and Gaza in the progressive caucus, and so that's not on here.'\nA supermajority of the 103 lawmakers in the caucus weighed in on the agenda, and 98% supported it, a spokesperson said.\nMuch of the agenda will have no realistic chance of passage unless Democrats sweep control of the White House, the House and the Senate this fall. And Jayapal emphasized that, in addition, Democrats would need 50 senators ready to pierce the 60-vote filibuster rule to get around likely GOP opposition. That would be a herculean task, as Democrats face a daunting map in 2024 Senate races, defending a slew of seats in purple and red states.\n'We are assuming that this is an agenda for a Democratic president with a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House,' Jayapal said.\nProgressives have had a rough two years, having been marginalized after Republicans took control of the House and steered the agenda rightward. Biden has broken with the left on issues like tougher asylum laws and crime. Some prominent Democrats, like Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, have eschewed the 'progressive' label as conservatives have found success in associating it with the left's most divisive ideas. Gallego, who is running for the Senate in his purple state, quietly left the progressive caucus. The caucus recently missed an opportunity to elect one of its members to a rare open Senate seat in deep-blue California, with two of them running and losing.\nStill, Jayapal said she believes that if Democrats win the 2024 elections, the progressive caucus will be well-positioned to advance the ideas in its new agenda, as it did with it opening bid that shaped two of Biden's signature laws, the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act. She has sought to institute changes to make the caucus more cohesive. It recently raised its dues for members.\nSome of the provisions in the new agenda represent items in Biden's 'Build Back Better' agenda that were left on the cutting room floor because of the thin majorities. Others could spark intraparty disagreements, including a far-reaching liberalization of the immigration system with a path to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally. Yet other pieces resemble popular causes that progressives want Biden to get behind, like expanding Social Security and legalizing marijuana.\n'We have to excite our base. We have to show them what the path forward is — not just say, ‘This is the most important election of your life, and we expect you to vote.' I don't think that's going to turn people out. And so I think this agenda, really, speaks to the needs of poor people, working people, progressives across the country who want us to make that case to them,' Jayapal said. 'We are not seeing the momentum that we would like to see. We're going to have a tough election. ... We know we're going to have to put together that progressive coalition. And I think this is the thing that allows us to say, ‘Look, here's what we're fighting for.''\nSahil Kapur",

            "summary": "PITTSBURGH — In the heart of one of America's most prominent historically Jewish neighborhoods, Dan and Baila Cohen keep the front entrance of their 70-year-old Judaica store locked during business hours.\nIt's not how they'd prefer it. But in light of Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack in Israel, Israel's ongoing military campaign in Gaza and tensions at home, they said, the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh told them they needed to be vigilant about who enters their business.\n'That's the reality of the world,' Dan Cohen said.\nIt's not the first time they've had to take additional safety precautions. The couple completed their purchase of Pinsker's Books and Judaica in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood in 2018 just days after a white supremacist gunned down 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue a few blocks away in the deadliest antisemitic attack in American history. But this time feels different.\n'Oct. 27 really unified' Squirrel Hill and Pittsburgh, Baila Cohen said of the Tree of Life massacre. 'Oct. 7 … really started polarizing the community itself, because that's when we started seeing much more of the infighting and conflicts.'\nConversations with more than 30 political strategists, activists and voters outlined how that tension has put Jewish voters in an unfamiliar spot ahead of the 2024 elections: on the front lines of the fight for control of the White House and Congress. Nowhere is that more apparent than in Pennsylvania, the swing state with the largest Jewish population — about 300,000 voting-age Jews in a state President Joe Biden won by roughly 80,000 votes in 2020.\nWhat's more, the congressional district that includes Squirrel Hill features a primary Tuesday that is among the first electoral tests of sentiment on both sides of the conflict in Gaza and concerns over rising antisemitism in the U.S. Democratic Rep. Summer Lee, a 'squad'-aligned progressive critical of Israel's handling of the war and one of the first lawmakers to call for a cease-fire last year, will face Bhavini Patel, an Edgewood Borough Council member who has painted Lee's advocacy as harmful to Biden's re-election chances and out of step with her district.\n'We have communities that are hurting. The Jewish community is one of them. And there are people who are … not going to agree 100% on everything that you say,' Lee said in an interview, adding she has been 'very clear and very upfront' about her cease-fire position. 'I have condemned Hamas. We've worked with the families of hostages; we've done everything that I think is necessary to do that. And at the end of the day, we disagree.'\nA dozen Jewish voters in the district who spoke to NBC News, whether supporting Lee or Patel, almost universally said their votes in November would be driven by issues beyond Israel, saying that the Jewish electorate isn't a 'monolith' and that democracy, abortion rights and the economy weighed heavily on them.\nMost Jewish voters in Squirrel Hill — and nationally — align with the Democratic Party. A Pew Research Center survey released this month found 69% of Jews leaning Democratic, while 29% aligned Republican.\nBut Republicans aren't looking for a massive defection. GOP strategists and Republicans involved in Jewish outreach expressed confidence that Democratic divisions over Israel will help move a small but potentially significant number of Jewish voters into their camp in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona. They pointed to surveys showing President Donald Trump's improved performance among Jews in 2020, compared with his 2016 race, as evidence of a slow shift that could continue.\n'Before Oct. 7, most candidates would say this issue is so messy. … It's not necessarily something that I want to focus on in my campaign,' said Tali deGroot, political director for the liberal Jewish group J Street. 'And I would have said, ‘Absolutely, this isn't a voting issue for people we poll year after year.' And it's too soon to tell if it's going to be a voting issue. But not talking about it is not an option.'‘Playing with fire' In Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, the war and its impact at home took center stage last week at a campaign event where Lee launched her 'Jews for Summer' coalition.\nLee talked about 'how our liberation is tied together,' whether 'in western Pennsylvania or the West Bank.' She spoke about how the district still needs 'deep healing' following both the Oct. 7 attack and the killing of Jews at Tree of Life. And she framed her primary as a covert Republican effort to divide a multiethnic, cross-religious support base by using splits over Israel.\n'There are people who have to convince you that the only reason why I could believe in peace is because I actually hate some of our neighbors, not because we love each other,' said Lee, who overcame significant spending by groups aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group, when she narrowly won her first congressional primary in 2022.\nIsrael didn't have the salience it does now. Lee has accused the Israeli government of committing 'war crimes,\" called for an end to unconditional military aid to the country and joined a handful of other progressives in mid-2022, before the Israel-Hamas war, who voted against a GOP-led resolution that said Israel wasn't 'a racist or apartheid state.' She has also condemned Hamas' attack and repeatedly spoken out against antisemitism.\nOn Saturday, she joined 36 Democrats and 21 Republicans in voting against an aid package to the country, which passed overwhelmingly. She and Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., were the only Pennsylvania members to vote against it.\nHer early call for a cease-fire is now largely in step with Democratic voters, but Jewish leaders have expressed unease with how Lee and some of her allies have discussed the issue. Last month, more than 40 Pittsburgh-area rabbis wrote in a letter, after an earlier meeting with Lee, that she has 'continued to use divisive rhetoric' that the group has at times 'perceived as openly antisemitic.'\nTheir letter didn't describe that rhetoric, but it said Lee opposed House measures to condemn antisemitism and criticized her calls for an 'unconditional cease-fire from one side,' which they said 'devalues the lives and beliefs of one group.' They also called on her to return campaign contributions 'from people who have voiced virulently antisemitic sentiments.' In February, Lee canceled an appearance before the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations amid backlash over other speakers' antisemitic and homophobic remarks, which she condemned.\nKaren Hochenberg, president of a local Democratic club that has endorsed Patel, said Lee has lost considerable support in the Jewish community, including hers. While Hochenberg aligns with Lee on many issues, she and others have been 'hurt' by some of her votes and actions, and she said she wished Lee had been more vocal about the Hamas attack.\n'Many Jews now are starting to question where are we on the road map of intersectionality,' Hochenberg said. 'Jews are starting to really take a look at how comfortable we are and if we're going to send candidates to Congress who's going to be there and have the voice of the Jewish community in mind, as well.'\nJeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgher leading a new Jewish voter group, said the pushback Lee faces isn't so much about Israel but about what he called an unwillingness to meet with constituents who don't share her views.\n'She finds the individuals who agree with her already who are anti-Zionist, who are extremist or fringe of the left of politics, and she will hold them up on a pedestal while spreading things' that, Kazzaz said, make local Jews 'less safe.'\nBut overall, Lee is looking stronger in her district now than in her first run, even to some opponents. AIPAC-linked groups aren't getting involved in her primary this time. Lee has framed her campaign around efforts to counter MAGA Republicans and bring federal dollars to the district.\nJonathan Mayo, a Squirrel Hill resident co-leading the Jews for Summer coalition, told NBC News he aligns with Lee's position on Israel but emphasized that he's not a single-issue voter.\n'It is so important to speak out and show that there are members of the Squirrel Hill Jewish community who still very much support Summer Lee,' he said.\nPatel, meanwhile, is framing her challenge to Lee around who offers Biden the most support, hitting Lee for not criticizing activists and groups calling for 'uncommitted' votes against the president in Tuesday's primary.\n'It's essentially playing with fire,' Patel said in an interview, arguing it could boost Trump.\nLee allies have countered that anti-Biden GOP megadonors support Patel's campaign. An outside group boosting Patel recently disclosed that it received an $800,000 donation from right-wing billionaire Jeffrey Yass. (Patel said she 'denounces' Yass, calling any focus on him a distraction.)\nLee has said she is supporting Biden in the fall. She's endorsed by congressional Democratic leadership and by Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has become arguably the most staunchly pro-Israel Democrat in Congress. And in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, Biden shouted out Lee as someone 'who had my back.'\n'We're going to make sure that the person who's sitting in the White House is not going to be replaced,' Lee said at her event on a recent Sunday.\nSeveral attendees said they were casting anti-Biden protest votes Tuesday. But most said they would support him this fall.\nOne of them, Harry Hochheiser, said Biden 'is the only legitimate choice' against Trump. He said the divisions opened up in the Jewish community over the war have been devastating.\n'I don't think any of us enjoy these divisions,' Hochheiser, a University of Pittsburgh professor and pro-Palestinian activist voting uncommitted in the primary but backing Biden against Trump, said of tensions in the Jewish community over Israel.\n‘More salient than it has been' The fight for Jewish votes in Pittsburgh is only part of a bigger landscape. Across Pennsylvania, Republican Dave McCormick has put Israel at the forefront of his campaign against Democratic Sen. Bob Casey. Nationally, groups in both parties are preparing for what they say could be the largest investment ever made to court the Jewish vote at the presidential level.\nBiden's handling of the war is the main flashpoint. Initially, he was more deferential to Israel. But as the death toll mounted in Gaza and left-wing blowback intensified at home, he has sharpened his criticism of Israeli leadership, pushed for increased humanitarian aid and ramped-up efforts to reach a cease-fire agreement. Still, he hasn't gone as far as his critics to his left would like.\nAs for whether Republicans can pick up voters disaffected by the Democratic divide over Israel, Mark Mellman, president of Democratic Majority for Israel, said it's 'mostly noise' but cautioned 'there is a serious chance' depending how the coming months play out.\nJewish voters have 'been extraordinarily appreciative of the support that President Biden and Democratic leaders have given Israel over the course of this conflict,' he said. 'I hear from some people that is beginning to change as people perceive some change in the positions of those Democratic leaders. But look … Biden has been extraordinary.'\nA 2021 Pew Research Center survey found a wide split in partisanship among Jewish voters depending on which movement they aligned with. Orthodox Jews favored Republicans over Democrats by 75% to 20%, while 70% of Conservative Jews and 80% of Reform Jews backed Democrats.\nSam Markstein, national political director at the Republican Jewish Coalition, said much of the Jewish vote is based in states where Republicans have no shot at all, contributing to the gulf in support between Republicans and Democrats. Pointing to an Associated Press VoteCast survey after the 2020 election that found Trump improved on his 2016 performance among Jewish voters, Markstein predicts the Republican Jewish Coalition will make its 'largest investment at the top of the ticket ever' this cycle to target Jewish voters in battlegrounds.\n'That's where you're going to see the most success this year,' he said.\nSome other surveys had more positive trends for Democrats. This month's Pew survey found the share of Jewish voters who align with Democrats has increased 8 points since 2020.\nDan Siegel, who led Jewish outreach for Biden's 2020 campaign, said Jewish voters' foremost concerns are similar to those of any other voting group: the economy, health care and education.\n'I do think [Israel] may be a little bit more top of mind. But I also think at the end of the day, elections are a binary choice,' Siegel said, predicting Jewish voters 'are going to want that strong, steady hand, not an authoritarian demagogue who is unwieldy at best in a crisis.'\nTrump, who strongly favored Israel as president, has offered limited commentary on the war. Speaking last month with Israel Hayom, an Israeli newspaper, Trump said, 'You have to finish up your war. You have to get it done. We have to get to peace. We can't have this going on.'\nBiden's campaign has zoomed in on recent comments Trump has made about Jewish voters; he said on Real America's Voice that 'any Jewish person who votes for Biden does not love Israel and, frankly, should be spoken to.'\nIn a statement, Karoline Leavitt, Trump's national press secretary, slammed Democrats for caving in 'to the demands of far-left Palestinian extremists.\"\nAsked about Trump's comments on the war, Markstein said he believed Trump 'was just giving voice to the frustration of … people [who] want this to be concluded, with Israel defeating Hamas and rescuing the hostages.' On Trump's remarks about Jewish voters, Markstein said Trump 'was just trying to say in a Trumpian way … why haven't they been more vocal in their opposition to what their own leaders of their party are doing?'\nBack in Pittsburgh, Kipp Dawson, a Jewish civil rights activist backing Lee, said she would be horrified by Trump's re-election and expressed hope that Lee would be able to bring skeptical Democrats back on board with Biden this fall.\n'My sense is that things are extraordinarily in flux in this country right now,' she said. 'The big issue for November is who's going to come out to vote.'\nAt Pinsker's, the Cohens declined to say whom they'd support in next week's primary or the general election, though they said a number of Jews in Squirrel Hill were eager to back Patel.\n'The Jewish community really feels that if they don't take the stand now, [U.S. support for Israel] is not going to be assured,' Baila Cohen said. 'Everyone's very interested in getting actively involved and being part of the political scene in a way that doesn't always play out.'\nAllan Smith Emma Barnett",

            "summary": "The House seat representing southwest Washington state is among Republicans' top targets to expand their slim majority in the 2024 elections — if they can nominate a candidate who can win.\nFormer GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler represented the area for over a decade, but a year after voting to impeach then-President Donald Trump, she lost her 2022 GOP primary to Joe Kent, an Army veteran who had challenged Herrera Beutler from the right.\nKent then lost the general election to Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez in a campaign that focused on Kent's right-wing ties — even as the GOP's Senate candidate, Tiffany Smiley, carried the same district by 8 points. (Smiley lost to the Democratic incumbent, Patty Murray.)\nKent is running for the seat again this year, hoping for an opposite result, but Camas City Council Member Leslie Lewallen is hoping to take that spot on the general election ballot for herself. She is pitching herself as a Republican who is more palatable to the district's voters.\n'Joe Kent had his opportunity in 2022. He lost. He'll lose again, by an even wider margin,\" Lewallen told NBC News during a trip to Washington, D.C.\nShe added that she worries that if Kent and Gluesenkamp Perez are on the general election ballot again, 'we could lose this seat for a very long time and we could lose the majority in the House of Representatives.'\n'There's frankly just too much at stake. We should never have lost that seat,' Lewallen said.\nA tough path to beat Kent in the primary Across the country in 2022, Republicans blamed the absence of a \"red wave\" on poor candidate quality, pointing to Kent as one example.\nKent questioned the integrity of the 2020 election, called Jan. 6 defendants \"political prisoners\" and attended a \"Justice for J6\" rally organized by one of his advisers. The Associated Press also investigated his ties to far-right groups during the campaign.\nBut Republicans in the state and nationally say Kent's place on the general election ballot this year is almost a foregone conclusion, with Lewallen's campaign struggling to define a clear path to finishing ahead of him in the top-two primary.\nLewallen's campaign struggling to define a clear path to finishing ahead of him in the top-two primary. 'Joe Kent has the support of all seven county Republican Parties in [the district] and also the Washington State Republican Party,' Kent's campaign said in a statement, adding, 'Grassroots and mainstream voters in the district are unified in support of replacing the extreme Democrat incumbent with common sense conservative, Joe Kent.'\nOne national Republican strategist said that Lewallen \"seems like a good candidate with a nice bio, but the question is can she win the primary? From what we've seen of her campaign so far, it doesn't look likely.'\nIn the first three months of 2024, Kent raised just over $225,000, while Lewallen raised just over $193,000. That's a closer spread than the last quarter of 2023, but Kent is still outraising Lewallen. And both paled in comparison to Gluesenkamp Perez, who raised over $850,000 in the same period.\nthree months of 2024, Kent raised just over $225,000, while Lewallen raised just over $193,000. That's a closer spread than the last quarter of 2023, but Kent is still outraising Lewallen. And both paled in comparison to Gluesenkamp Perez, who raised over $850,000 in the same period. Meanwhile, the Washington state Republican Party decided to officially endorse Kent last year.\n\"This is politics,\" said the party's chair, Jim Walsh, adding, \"Nothing is ever certain, certain, certain, but Kent's path looks pretty clear.\"\nAbove all, Walsh said, Republicans in the state and the district should be focused on beating Gluesenkamp Perez.\nHe pointed to what he thought should be the biggest issue in the race: \"Dissatisfaction with Marie Perez's track record\" in Congress.\n\"While Perez has a very effective PR campaign and operation and gets lots of photo ops, the fact is her voting record is really not representative of what Washington's 3rd's values are,\" Walsh added.\nFor their part, Democrats are convinced that Kent will be their opponent in November and hope to run a similar campaign to the one that defeated him in 2022.\n\"Joe Kent will be my opponent in the general election, and I invite Republicans and conservatives who can't stomach Joe Kent's angry, dangerous, divisive view of the world to support my campaign instead, like they did in 2022,' Gluesenkamp Perez said in a statement.\nMarching forward But Lewallen isn't mounting her campaign alone. She's backed by many of the strategists who worked on Smiley' campaign in 2022, as well as Smiley herself.\nWinning for Women, a national group that backs female Republicans running for office, has endorsed Lewallen, too. The group's super PAC has spent millions of dollars supporting female GOP candidates in recent elections.\n\"The choice here is simple: If Leslie is our nominee, Republicans win back this seat. Joe Kent has already shown he cannot win, and nominating him effectively guarantees two more years of Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a liberal extremist who is out of touch with the voters of this district,\" WFW Action Fund executive director Danielle Barrow said in a statement.\nBarrow added that the group raised over $40,000 for Lewallen in a single event in the first quarter of this year and it already has additional fundraisers planned for the second quarter.\nSo far this year, a few GOP House candidates who lost swing seats in 2022 have failed in repeat runs. In Ohio, J.R. Majewski, who was seeking a rematch against Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, dropped out ahead of this year's primary amid a cascade of unflattering news stories and other revelations.\nAnd in North Carolina, far-right candidate Sandy Smith lost the GOP primary this year to retired Army Col. Laurie Buckhout, who was backed by an outside group tied to House Republican leadership. Smith, the GOP nominee in 2022, lost to Democratic Rep. Don Davis.\nBut every race is different.\n\"Joe Kent has the support of all seven county Republican Parties in [the district] and also the Washington State Republican Party,\" Kent's campaign said in a statement, adding, \"Grassroots and mainstream voters in the district are unified in support of replacing the extreme Democrat incumbent with common sense conservative, Joe Kent.\"\nLewallen said she found Kent's 2022 campaign \"very frustrating\" because he \"did not talk about anything important to southwest Washington. \"\n\"did not talk about anything important to southwest Washington.\" \"The entire campaign focused on this Washington instead of our Washington,\" she said. \"I want to move forward.

            "excerpt": "How moderate Democrats joined with old enemies on the left to stop their own friends in the center from challenging Joe Biden.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Once upon a time, before the multimillion-dollar negative campaigns and allegations of running 'a conspiracy to commit extortion, voter intimidation, and other criminal behavior,' they were friends. Good friends.\nThe people who run No Labels and Third Way, two of the most prominent centrist organizations in Washington, had all come up together in the small world of Clinton-era center-left politics.\nNancy Jacobson, an early Bill Clinton hire and the founder of No Labels, helped raise the initial money and secure the necessary political blessings to start Third Way. The think tank was co-founded by Jon Cowan, whom Jacobson viewed as something of a mentee. Cowan, now Third Way's president, even signed the ketubah (the Jewish wedding contract) at Jacobson's wedding to Mark Penn, whose firm conducts No Labels' polls.\nThen came the 2024 election — and No Labels' decision to try to field a bipartisan 'unity ticket' against both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, backed by a reported budget of $70 million. Third Way, which may be centrist but is firmly Democratic, viewed this as a misguided, no-hope effort that could only spoil the election for Biden and help to re-elect Trump, with potentially disastrous consequences.\n\"There were deep personal stakes and relationships,\" Cowan said.\nA centrist civil war broke out in the C-suites and steakhouses of Washington and Manhattan. Like so many insider conflicts, it was deeply personal. There were betrayal, a double agent, a secret team of political operatives, some very unlikely allies — and a decisive victory for one side that left the other seething and bitter.\nEven some people close to No Labels acknowledge the campaign against it largely succeeded in its mission: dissuading any potential candidates from joining its ticket. But the cost, they say, will be a gaping wound at the center of what's left of American centrism.\n\"What does Third Way go back to?\" asked former Rep. Max Rose, a moderate New York Democrat who spoke to NBC News at Jacobson's request. \"Because it doesn't seem logical that an organization that considers itself a centrist policy organization randomly makes war on another organization like this.\"\nOr as Holly Page, a longtime moderate Democratic strategist who has worked for both groups but ended up in No Labels' camp put it of Third Way: 'They sold out the center so they could get a seat at the table with [former Biden chief of staff] Ron Klain.\"\nNo Labels was so incensed by what Page referred to as the anti-No Labels campaign's \"little fraternity games\" that the group lodged a complaint with the Justice Department. In a letter and an indignant news conference, they accused their old friends and their new allies of violating anti-racketeering laws, typically used to prosecute the mafia, by engaging in an \"unlawful conspiracy to subvert Americans' voting rights.\" There is no sign the Justice Department took any action on the compliant.\nThird Way and its allies, meanwhile, believe they're the real moderates here. They forged an actual bipartisan coalition of groups spanning Republicans to progressives to support a moderate Democratic president and to stop Trump, few people's idea of a moderate, whom they note No Labels praised as a \"problem solver\" during his 2016 campaign.\nthey're the real moderates here. They forged an actual bipartisan coalition of groups spanning Republicans to progressives to support a moderate Democratic president and to stop Trump, few people's idea of a moderate, whom they note No Labels praised as a \"problem solver\" during his 2016 campaign. 'You're not building a pro-Biden coalition; it's an anti-Trump coalition,' said Sarah Longwell, a Republican strategist and publisher of the conservative website The Bulwark, who supported the anti-No Labels effort. 'They absolutely would subtract people who, when push comes to shove, will vote for Joe Biden.'\nSimilar beginnings go separate ways In many ways, Third Way was an unlikely marshal for a No Labels counterstrike.\nBoth have long been dismissed by the left as stodgy corporatists and crypto-Republicans, and Third Way and No Labels exist in overlapping social circles, draw from similar funders and promote a common ideology. Third Way's previous campaigns took on the left, like when it fought progressive challengers in House primaries and tried to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., from winning the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.\n'Everybody in the centrist donor universe knew No Labels was doing this ticket, and everybody knew we were leading the opposition. You were on one side or the other,' Cowan said. 'And on the other side were some of the wealthiest people in the country and they were very angry at us.'\nThird Way lost a board member who sided with No Labels, and its leaders received word from several other unhappy donors that they should not expect another cent.\nBut while Third Way is fundamentally a Democratic organ, Jacobson has fallen (or been pushed, depending on whom you ask) out of the party's ranks, and now, No Labels views itself as the only group righteous and innovative enough to think outside the red-blue divide.\nStill, that familiarity meant Third Way spoke enough of No Labels' language to understand it and the people funding it — and how to reach the potential candidates it tried to recruit.\nAnd Third Way's moderate credentials helped it pick off potential No Labels allies, from its affiliated members of Congress to New York Times columnist David Brooks — the first major voice to hoist the unity ticket flag, only to later lower it — to the Clintons, the first family of Democratic centrism.\nThe former president and secretary of state hardly needed convincing of the threat a third-party campaign posed to Biden — Hillary Clinton had partly blamed the Green Party for her 2016 loss. So over lunch last July at their home in Chappaqua, New York, the Clintons, each joined by a top aide, talked through strategy with Cowan and Third Way Vice President Matt Bennett and vowed to help privately through their networks, according to three sources familiar with the meeting.\nBill Clinton joined the anti-recruiting team working against No Labels, making personal appeals to two prominent No Labels targets — Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican — that a third-party candidate could not win.\n'Pearl Harbored' Jacobson expressed anger, dismay and a sense of betrayal about Third Way's actions. 'We were Pearl Harbored,' she told supporters on a call, first reported by Puck.\nBill Clinton's lobbying effort was part of a broader campaign, which included dozens groups and prominent figures from the left, the center and the anti-Trump right, built around Third Way's 'war room.'\nAs Bennett put it in the first large gathering of the group, they had to 'build the idea in the minds of the political elites and the people that they talk to ... that if you get involved with this ... you're really risking your entire reputation and your legacy.'\nThird Way identified a long list of potential No Labels targets and set about finding common friends and allies between the potential candidates and the anti-No Labels coalition — people who would be seen as credible messengers. No Labels said 30 candidates passed. And by the end, the opposing coalition says, it reached every name that surfaced.\nThird Way leaders worked the Democratic side of the aisle after securing the blessing of party leaders in the White House, on Capitol Hill and in the Democratic National Committee. Meanwhile, its anti-Trump GOP allies and a clandestine team of 10 to 20 Republican operatives worked to 'surround' potential candidates with appeals, including survey research commissioned from former Rep. Liz Cheney's pollster, which concluded that they could not win running with No Labels.\nEvery potential candidate got a message tailored to their pressure points — their financial needs, their legacies, their future political prospects — from credible figures like local business leaders, clergy and former aides.\nThe chief goal was to make it impossible for No Labels to deliver the kind of big-name ticket it had promised.\n\"This was elite-driven,\" Bennett said. \"We knew they had enough donors that we couldn't deny them money. But we also knew enough about their donors to know they would expect a high-level candidate with a certain stature and would not accept someone who was not obviously credible.\"\nTheir targets included highly publicized suspects like Manchin, Hogan and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, though they were particularly worried about Bill Haslam, the former governor of Tennessee, because he is a billionaire who could self-fund.\nUnlikely allies It wasn't just anti-Trump Republicans like the Lincoln Project and former Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol who joined Third Way's efforts to brush back No Labels. Mainstream Democrats like Klain and former Democratic Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama were joined by leaders on the left who were used to warring, not collaborating, with Third Way.\nLunching with Bennett and working with his group helped 'humanize' people she had viewed as 'an enemy,' said Melissa Byrne, a left-wing activist who has often sparred with moderate Democrats over issues like student debt.\nByrne stressed — 'print this in all caps, bold,' she said — that she will go to war again with Third Way over policy if and when the time comes.\nBennett and the executive director of the liberal group MoveOn, Rahna Epting, ended up working together closely, playing up an odd-couple routine in a series of meetings on Capitol Hill, in the media and even in a public debate against No Labels strategists.\n'Our partnership with Third Way to come together and stop No Labels may be surprising to some, but it is a testament to how high the stakes are to keep Trump out of the White House,' Epting said.\nMeanwhile, some Republicans joined a campaign run by Democrats thanks to a similar calculation: Despite their policy differences, they were united by opposition to Trump and a shared belief that a third-party candidate could be a decisive boon to him.\n\"If you want to go experiment with third-party stuff, go crazy — just not this year,\" said Rick Wilson, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project, another cornerstone of the anti-No Labels campaign.\nThe broad coalition even included a secret member from the most unlikely of sources: No Labels itself.\nNo Labels did its best to keep the names of its delegates, donors and potential candidates under wraps. But the anti-No Labels campaign felt it had a good idea what was going on behind the curtain, thanks to a No Labels delegate who had grown disillusioned and started leaking to the other side.\nThe turncoat, whom Cowan and Bennett would only say was an 'average citizen' who initially joined No Labels out of a sincere belief in its mission, 'was incredibly helpful to us and did so at some personal sacrifice and risk,' Bennett said.\nPeople familiar with No Labels' thinking did not dispute that they had a leaker and said they were unaware of who it might be.\nBut No Labels allies say these kinds of cloak-and-dagger tactics highlight the hypocrisy, as they see it, of supposed champions of democracy and voting rights opposing another party's ballot access.\n'It's just discouraging to see partisans and politicians protecting their turf,' said former Rep. Joe Cunningham, a Democrat from South Carolina who worked with No Labels.\nRose, the former New York congressman, said No Labels' presidential ticket was always a long shot, so its opponents' victory lap is just \"someone seeing where things were going anyway and trying to claim credit.\"\n\"No Labels considered something that didn't really have legs and made a pretty noble decision to not pursue it,' he said.\nWhile No Labels' 2024 push is over, third-party candidates are still in the campaign, especially another ex-Democrat who could affect Biden's chances in November: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Countering Kennedy, though, will be a very different kind of conflict, even as Third Way remains committed to battling Biden's third-party foes.\nThird Way turned out to be the right group for the job of taking down No Labels. Can they take down an outsider too?\nAlex Seitz-Wald",
