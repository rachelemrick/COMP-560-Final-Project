Kennedy Jr.'s family, including six of his siblings, are endorsing President Biden in Philadelphia Thursday even as he makes his own bid for Biden's job as an independent candidate.\nKennedy's sister, Kerry Kennedy, is expected to praise Mr. Biden as a leader in the mold of her father, Robert F. Kennedy, who \"stood for equal justice, human rights and freedom from want and fear \u2014 just as President Biden does today,\" according to excerpts of her remarks released by the Biden campaign.\nHer father served as attorney general in John F. Kennedy's administration and was running for president himself when he was assassinated in 1968.\nSpeaking for the family members who are endorsing Mr. Biden, Kerry Kennedy will also have harsh words for presumptive Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump.\n\"I can only imagine how Donald Trump's outrageous lies and behavior would have horrified my father,\" she's expected to say, and will accuse Trump of \"running to take us backwards, attacking the most basic rights and freedoms that are core to who we are as Americans.\"\nThe excerpts did not contain any mention of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but several of his family members have already expressed their opposition to his candidacy.\nWhen Kennedy announced in October that he would drop his campaign for the presidency as a Democrat and run instead as an independent, four of his siblings \u2014 documentary filmmaker Rory Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, former Rep. Joe Kennedy II and former Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend \u2014 called his decision to oppose Mr. Biden \"dangerous to our country.\" In a statement at the time, they said, \"Bobby might share the same name as our father, but he does not share the same values, vision or judgment.\" The four said of his decision to run as an independent that, \"We denounce his candidacy and believe it to be perilous for our country.\"\nIn addition to Kerry Kennedy, RFK Jr.'s siblings, Rory Kennedy, Joe Kennedy II, Christopher Kennedy, Maxwell Kennedy, and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, as well as several other relatives, are endorsing Mr. Biden Thursday.\nMr. Biden's campaign noted that the president has long admired the Kennedys and has cited the Kennedy family's devotion to the causes of justice and human rights.\nThe president has had a bust of Robert F. Kennedy in the Oval Office and has said RFK inspired him to work as a public defender and later run for office.\nA bust of Robert F. Kennedy is visible behind President Biden in the Oval Office as he speaks during a virtual meeting with Ireland's Prime Minister Micheal Martin on St. Patrick's Day, March 17, 2021.\nAndrew Harnik / AP\nLast month, on St. Patrick's Day, Mr. Biden gave members of the extended Kennedy family a private tour of the Oval Office and West Wing and celebrated with them and hundreds of guests at a holiday reception. Kennedy family members posted photos with the president, signaling that they stand with him rather than with the Kennedy running against him.\nSeveral of the Kennedys will be joining Mr. Biden for a grassroots organizing event and will help with voter outreach, according to the campaign.\nKristin Brown, Allison Novelo and the Associated Press contributed to this report.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/18/3e757dee-651e-4c36-8694-2fc66d2436ab/thumbnail/1200x630/37b6f794aa597bb57ddb1d3dbea57ca9/ap21076646239597.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSPolitics","_score":7.4290504,"_id":"6f41ec66fc7b8223f21e2320afe1de00"},{"title":"President Biden visits Philly to campaign for 2024 presidential election","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-18 23:09:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/video/president-biden-visits-philly-to-campaign-for-2024-presidential-election","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"The trip marks Biden's third stop in Pennsylvania this week.

Three years into his presidency, what do those who care about the issue most think about what he's done? How much do they know?\nFew Americans say they've heard a lot about what the administration has done on climate change. That extends to those in the president's own party and to those who rate the issue of climate change as very important. Half of them have heard little or nothing at all about what the administration has done.\nAnd perhaps as a result, those who prioritize climate change are feeling somewhat unsatisfied \u2014 more of them feel the president has done too little, rather than the right amount on trying to reduce it.\nBut they do like the Biden administration's policies when they hear about them.\nClimate change: An issue important to Biden's base\nClimate change is not the most important issue for Americans overall; it trails economic issues and matters like crime and immigration. But most Democrats, liberals, those who voted for Mr. Biden in 2020 and many younger people place a lot of importance on the issue. These groups will be crucial to Mr. Biden in November.\nJust 10% of Americans who say climate change is a very important issue have heard or read a lot about what the Biden administration has done so far to deal with it. And when evaluating the Biden administration, many think it has done too little to address it.\nWhen presented with some of the Biden administration's climate change policies, a majority of those who place a lot of importance on climate change \u2014 from enhanced regulations, to reducing toxic chemicals in drinking water, to tax rebates for buying an electric vehicle \u2014 favored the policies.\nEven people who feel the administration has done too little on climate change support these policies. So this may be more about Mr. Biden needing to get his message out there than having to convince this \"climate constituency\" \u2014 those who call the climate issue very important \u2014 of the substance of his policies.\nWhat is the \"climate constituency\" looking for?\nNine in 10 of those who call the climate issue very important support the country taking steps to stop or slow the rate of climate change, and if they had to choose, they overwhelmingly would prioritize protecting the earth's climate over energy production.\nAnd most agree with the administration and Democratic leaders that efforts to reduce climate change would help the economy, not hurt it, putting them at odds with those who place little or no importance on the issue.\n2024 presidential candidates and climate change\nWhile this \"climate constituency\" would like to see Mr. Biden do more, they do prefer his approach to climate change and energy policy to former President Donald Trump's. It's the public at large that is not convinced, and that adds up to Mr. Biden running about even with Trump among people who are asked whose approach to the issue they agree with more. More than a quarter pick neither.\nAmericans who think the issue of climate change is very important and those who want an energy policy that moves away from fossil fuels in favor of renewable energy sources prefer Mr. Biden's approach on both climate and energy, while those who place little importance on climate change and who want to encourage greater production of fossil fuels favor Trump's approach.\nThis cuts heavily to partisanship as well, though independents \u2014 who think efforts to fight climate change will hurt rather than help their finances \u2014 lean more towards Trump's approach than Mr. Biden's.\nLooking ahead, there's skepticism that either candidate can do much about climate change if elected in November.\nOn balance, more think Mr. Biden will slow the rate of climate change and more think Trump will increase it, while half don't think it will make any difference, regardless of who wins in 2024.\nAmericans with a more fatalistic view on climate change \u2014 who think humanity can't do anything about climate change or who think it doesn't exist in the first place \u2014 are the most likely to say the election will make no difference.\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,230 U.S. adult residents interviewed between April 16-19, 2024. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as past vote.

The rule of law and democracy matters to the United States.\"\nFormer President Donald Trump has placed Jan. 6 at the center of his presidential campaign, as both he and other Republicans downplay the severity of the attack and the baseless claims of election fraud that inspired it.\nMr. Biden believes reminding voters again about this rhetoric from Trump, and painting him as a \"threat\" to democracy is a crucial contrast to highlight. It's a variation on the theme of his 2020 campaign, which he referred to as a fight for the \"soul of the nation,\" and one that he returned to during the 2022 midterm elections.\nBut beyond Democratic base voters like Pohlkamp, it remains to be seen whether a focus on Jan. 6 is an effective argument in the rematch against Trump, since voters may be facing more immediate concerns, such as the economy and cost of living.\n\"Absolutely we have to focus on pocketbook issues,\" said Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is running for reelection in the battleground state of Wisconsin. \"But if you don't have your democracy, those may pale in comparison at some point in the future.\"\nTrump has said one of his \"first acts\" if elected this November would be to free January 6 \"hostages.\" At a March rally in Ohio, he saluted a rendition of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" performed by a choir of men imprisoned for their alleged involvement on Jan. 6. He has said if he doesn't win in November, he doesn't think there will be \"another election in this country.\"\nLast Friday, Trump held a press conference with GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson at his Florida Mar-a-Lago residence to announce a new \"election integrity\" bill that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote, though it has been illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections for decades.\nWhile a CBS News January poll showed Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the attacks on Jan. 6, polling reveals a mixed picture of who voters think would be \"better\" for democracy, despite Trump's role in creating and spreading election denialism.\nIn a March CBS News poll of voters in the battleground state of Georgia, where Trump is being investigated for alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election, more people thought Trump would make democracy stronger (48%) than Biden (43%). An April New York Times/Siena College poll of likely voters found that 46% believed Mr. Trump is \"bad for democracy\" while 39% said the same about Mr. Biden.\nCongressional Democrats urge Biden to emphasize democracy, Jan. 6 on campaign trail\n\"You gotta tie it in with other challenges,\" New Jersey Democratic Rep. Andy Kim, who was pictured cleaning up debris in the Capitol after Jan. 6, said about how the Biden campaign should campaign on democracy.\nAbortion has been the biggest contrast issue for the Biden campaign, which has directed its political muscle and considerable cash at highlighting how Trump's appointment of Supreme Court justices led to the overturning of the federal right to an abortion and in the wake of that, to more restrictive abortion bans in Republican-led states.\nBut Jan. 6 has its role in the president's reelection effort, too. For Mr. Biden, it's a testament to character and a marker of the binary choice between him and Trump.\n\"Are there challenges that we deal with every day, whether it be the challenges of inflation that we're still battling or the challenges of global conflict? Absolutely. But those will pale in comparison to the great challenges that we will face as a crumbling America, should Trump be elected,\" said Texas Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Biden campaign co-chair.\n\"Whether democracy is still America's sacred cause is the most urgent question of our time. And it's what the 2024 election is all about,\" Mr. Biden said in Blue Bell, Pa., in January, on the third anniversary of the Jan. 6 riots.\nIn April, the Biden campaign held a press conference with two police officers who were at the Capitol during the Jan. 6 assault. Former Capitol Police Sergeant Aquilno Gonell argued voters should be worried about threats to democracy because \"if you don't have democracy, then your job is probably gonna go; your liberties are probably gonna go.\"\n\"As President Biden said, Donald Trump's campaign is obsessed with the past, not the future. He's willing to sacrifice our democracy to put himself in power,\" said Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer. \"Our campaign will continue to underscore the choice in this election and defend the truth against Donald Trump's Big Lie.\"\nNow less than seven months out from Election Day, Trump's baggage from Jan.6 \u2014 and the Biden campaign's tactic of highlighting it \u2014 isn't going away.\n\"Their entire narrative is a lie, and Americans know that Joe Biden is the true threat to democracy as he continues to allow an invasion of our borders, his weakness is leading our country straight into World War III, and he weaponizes our justice system,\" said Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\nYet some Republicans don't appear to be worried. Asked by CBS News if Jan. 6 is a vulnerability for Trump on the campaign trail, Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley said, \"That issue's been so litigated, and I think people have made up their minds about it completely.\"\n\"What is there left to say that hasn't been said? And what political advantage is there left to wring from it that Democrats have shamelessly not yet attempted to wring,\" said Hawley, who was among more than 100 Republicans in Congress who objected to certifying Biden's win in two swing states after the attack.\nCalifornia Rep. Mike Garcia, a battleground district Republican whose seat will likely be critical as the GOP tries to hold its tiny majority this fall, said he didn't like what happened on Jan. 6 \u2014 and neither do voters. At the same time, he dismissed it as an ineffective campaign issue for Mr. Biden.\n\"If this president is trying to resurrect that issue and run on that \u2013 then it's an indication that he's failed to accomplish things in the last three and a half years of his presidency,\" argued Garcia, who voted against certifying Mr. Biden's win in two battleground states in the hours after the attack.\nThere are practical contradictions in Trump's campaign rhetoric, though. He has attempted to champion police and the need for law and order. But on Jan. 6, a mob of his supporters clashed with police and injured over 100 people in law enforcement.\nThe Department of Justice announced recently on its website that close to 500 people \"have been charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees, including approximately 129 individuals who have been charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer.\"\nThat violence doesn't get much attention from Trump and his most ardent allies.\nStill, there are some who are clearly uncomfortable with the friendly tenor Trump is taking with people who attempted to upset the peaceful transfer of power over three years ago.\n\"Jan. 6 is not going to be a good selling point to the American public long term,\" South Dakota GOP Sen. Mike Rounds said.\nJacob Rosen contributed to this report.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Aaron Navarro,Hunter Woodall,Election Cycles.","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/16/99f8c328-f3e3-4a95-bacc-f17d49f01067/thumbnail/1200x630g2/794a621d02e6463accd385d2619f7f41/gettyimages-2069476012.jpg?v=6450b1292090ace5f47bbb23ced2a4e3","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@https://twitter.com/aaronlarnavarro","_score":7.239358,"_id":"9eb440528807c787f38f3e045fba42da"},{"title":"Biden condemns antisemitism amid wave of college protests","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-22 22:51:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/biden-condemns-antisemitism-amid-college-protests","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"President Biden is condemning antisemitism in the U.S. as protests against the Israel-Hamas war break out at universities across the nation.

Ambrose J. Finnegan Jr., whom he said was shot down over Papua New Guinea, which was a theater of heavy fighting.\n\"They never found the body because there used to be \u2014 there were a lot of cannibals for real in that part of New Guinea,\" Biden said, referring to the country's main island.\nMarape said in a statement on Sunday that Biden \"appeared to imply his uncle was eaten by cannibals.\"\n\"President Biden's remarks may have been a slip of the tongue; however, my country does not deserve to be labeled as such,\" Marape said in a statement provided by his office to The Associated Press on Monday.\n\"World War II was not the doing of my people; however, they were needlessly dragged into a conflict that was not their doing,\" Marape added.\nThe rift comes as Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese began a visit on Monday to Papua New Guinea, Australia's nearest neighbor. Albanese and Marape will commemorate strong defense ties between the two countries by walking part of a pivotal battle ground known as the Kokoda Track later this week.\n\"I'm very confident that PNG has no stronger partner than Australia and our defense and security ties have never been stronger,\" Albanese told reporters before departing Australia.\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Friday Biden was speaking to the bravery of his uncle and the many U.S. service members that put their lives on the line.\n\"He takes this very seriously. His uncle, who served and protected this country, lost his life serving. And that should matter,\" she said.\nBiden's account that Finnegan's plane was shot down was not supported by military records. Finnegan was a passenger on a Douglas A-20 Havoc transport plane that crashed into the ocean after both engines failed on May 14, 1944, according to a Pentagon report.\nOne crew member survived but no trace was found of the plane or three other people on board, including Finnegan.\nMarape's statement was released on the same day he met China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Port Moresby to discuss building closer relations.\nMarape also called on the U.S. to find its war dead in Papua New Guinea's jungles and to clean up the wreckage of war.\n\"The remains of WWII lie scattered all over PNG, including the plane that carried President Biden's uncle,\" Marape said.\n\"Perhaps, given President Biden's comments and the strong reaction from PNG and other parts of the world, it is time for the USA to find as many remains of World War II in PNG as possible, including those of servicemen who lost their lives like Ambrose Finnegan,\" he said.\n\"The theaters of war in PNG and Solomon Islands are many, and littered with the remains of WWII including human remains, plane wrecks, ship wrecks, tunnels and bombs.

An April CBS News poll found that only 33% of Americans approve of Mr. Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict, down from 44% in October.\nIt is rare for foreign ambassadors and ministers to meet with the presumptive GOP presidential nominee half a year before the presidential election and suggests that they're laying the groundwork for another Trump administration.\n\"The biggest handle Biden had on Trump was that this guy is unpredictable, especially on the world stage,\" said Terry Sullivan, who ran Sen. Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign. \"When you take your opponent's strength and your personal weakness and turn them on their head, that's a big move.\"\nThe 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Sen. Mitt Romney, implemented a similar strategy of meeting foreign leaders shortly before he won the GOP presidential nomination in 2012. On a trip to London for a fundraiser that year, Romney met with several British leaders. At the time, CBS News chief political analyst John Dickerson told \"CBS This Morning\" that Romney's campaign had calibrated his talking points about the meetings to project a presidential aura.\n\"It's something every campaign does to some degree if they can get away with it and show they have gravitas and can handle major foreign policy situations,\" said Sullivan, who also worked on Romney's earlier presidential bid in 2008 and is now a CBS News contributor.\nForeign leaders have made stops at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Florida club, too. The former president recently hosted British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, whose spokesperson said it was \"standard practice for ministers to meet with opposition candidates as part of their routine international engagement.\" The two spoke about the war in Ukraine, NATO spending and upcoming elections, according to the Trump campaign.\nBut unlike recent presidential nominees, Trump has also hosted controversial foreign leaders. The willingness by some Trump advisers to contact these foreign governments reflects the approach another Trump administration could take on foreign policy.\nLast month, the former president hosted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the closest European Union ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, at Mar-a-Lago. The two also discussed the war in Ukraine, Orban later told state media.\nFormer President Donald Trump with Hungarian President Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\nScreenshot from Orb\u00e1n Facebook video\nMr. Biden reacted swiftly, criticizing the rendezvous on the day it took place.\n\"You know who he's meeting with today down at Mar-a-Lago?

As a result of the regulation, covered manufacturers and sellers have to obtain licenses, mark their products with serial numbers, run background checks and keep purchase records, which are all required for firearms made and sold in the U.S.\nThe rule applies to all ghost guns, including those made with 3D printers or sold as assembly kits.\nA group of gun owners, advocacy groups and ghost gun distributors filed a lawsuit against ATF in August 2022, arguing that the two portions of its rule, regarding the term \"frame or receiver\" and definition of \"firearm,\" exceeded its authority. A federal district court in Texas sided with the challengers, finding that the Gun Control Act doesn't \"cover weapon parts, or aggregations of weapon parts,\" regardless of whether they can be assembled into \"something that may fire a projectile.\"\nThe district court invalidated the entire regulation, including those that were not at issue in the lawsuit.\nThe Biden administration appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit halted the lower court's order as to the unchallenged portions of the rule. The Supreme Court then paused the full decision in a 5-4 ruling, allowing ATF to enforce the restrictions while legal proceedings continued. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the three liberal justices in the majority.\nThe 5th Circuit later ruled that the Gun Control Act's definition of \"firearm\" doesn't encompass weapon parts kits, and invalidated the provision of the rule involving the term \"frame or receiver.\"\nThe Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to review the appeals court's decision in February, arguing that it contradicts the plain text of the Gun Control Act.\n\"Under the Fifth Circuit's interpretation, anyone could buy a kit online and assemble a fully functional gun in minutes \u2014 no background check, records, or serial number required,\" it told the Supreme Court. \"The result would be a flood of untraceable ghost guns into our nation's communities, endangering the public and thwarting law-enforcement efforts to solve violent crimes.\"\nThe Biden administration told the court that weapon parts kits can be converted into a fully functional firearm in just 21 minutes, and ghost guns allow felons, minors and others barred from buying firearms to circumvent the law.\nIf left in place, the 5th Circuit's ruling would give the manufacturers and distributors of weapons parts the \"green light to resume unfettered distribution\" without background checks, records, or serial numbers, posing an \"acute threat\" to public safety, the Biden administration said.\nIt noted that since 2017, there has been a 1,000% increase in the number of ghost guns recovered by law enforcement each year.\nThe challengers to ATF's rule also urged the Supreme Court to decide its validity \"once and for all.\" They told the high court in a filing that the provisions of the rule are \"fundamentally incompatible\" with the Gun Control Act's definition of firearm.\n\"This expanded definition upsets the delicate balance struck by Congress between the commercial production and sale of firearms and the non-commercial making of firearms by law-abiding citizens,\" the group said.\nThey accused the Biden administration of seeking to destroy the industry that caters to law-abiding citizens making their own guns and said that if the definition of \"firearm\" is now considered unsatisfactory, it's an issue for Congress to address.\n\"ATF is not free to expand the scope of the GCA without Congress's blessing,\" the challengers argued.\nThe case will be argued in the Supreme Court's next term, which begins in October.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Melissa Quinn,Daily Signal,Federal Courts.","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/03/12/9158231c-ed3f-442b-a1ef-5eed634f7458/thumbnail/1200x630g8/8a574848e718d408b41acc3bb2c5fb23/ap24072559614498.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@@MelissaQuinn97","_score":6.6685643,"_id":"3afc83a7362effd8624933bdd82d3864"},{"title":"Senators request renewed assessment of Havana Syndrome cause after 60 Minutes report","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-21 22:50:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/push-for-renewed-havana-syndrome-assessment-60-minutes-video-2024-04-21","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"A bipartisan group of senators sent a letter to President Biden calling for \"renewed assessment by the U.S. government\" of Havana Syndrome in the wake of a 60 Minutes investigation.","summary":"Senators request renewed assessment of Havana Syndrome cause after 60 Minutes report A bipartisan group of senators sent a letter to President Biden calling for \"renewed assessment by the U.S. government\" of Havana Syndrome in the wake of a 60 Minutes investigation.\nSenators request renewed assessment of Havana Syndrome cause after 60 Minutes report A bipartisan group of senators sent a letter to President Biden calling for \"renewed assessment by the U.S. government\" of Havana Syndrome in the wake of a 60 Minutes investigation.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/21/1e4651f9-c342-475b-b658-970107f92ab7/thumbnail/1200x630/041c1f6d8f365fe4506dfb06d2256cd4/0421-60mins-tlm-2852850-640x360.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSNews","_score":6.654774,"_id":"fa08a3a5310112a99b7be2bf7ca3683b"},{"title":"Voter apathy could impact turnout in 2024 election","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-16 15:23:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/video/voter-apathy-could-impact-turnout-in-2024-election","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"As the 2024 election inches closer, polling shows a big chunk of voters are unenthusiastic about the rematch between President Biden and former President Trump.

Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, that aired on April 21, 2024.","summary":"The following is a transcript of an interview with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, that aired on April 21, 2024.\nThe following is a transcript of an interview with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, that aired on April 21, 2024.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro. He joins us this morning from Abington, Pennsylvania. And, Governor, thank you for sticking with us. We've been having some transmission technical issues. So hopefully, we don't get interrupted. I'll get- I'll get straight to it--\nGOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA): Good. I look forward to the conversation.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'll get straight to it, Governor. You have been outspoken against the rising and troubling antisemitism in this country. I know the FBI director said just a few days ago that federal law enforcement is concerned about lone actors targeting gatherings ahead of the start of Passover, which starts tomorrow. Are there known threats in your state?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Well, there's not known threats right now. And I can tell you, the Pennsylvania State Police working in coordination with our federal and local partners are all over this. And we'll let folks know, and communities, if there are specific threats. But we continue to work closely with law enforcement and community leaders to do everything we can to take down the temperature, to address the rise in antisemitism, Islamophobia, other forms of hate. There should be no place for that here in Pennsylvania. Of course, Pennsylvania, founded on the vision of William Penn, a place that would be a place of tolerance and welcome and peace, a place where people could come together and practice their faith, whatever their faith is, we have a special relationship with that, here in this commonwealth, where we respect all, no matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love, or who you choose to pray to. And we're going to continue to do everything we can to make sure everyone feels protected in this commonwealth.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there should be no place for it anywhere in America. I- and I know you agree with that. But let me get to the politics of the moment. President Biden won the state of Pennsylvania in 2020, narrowly. He spent a lot of time in your state this past week. We've seen in our polling, his approval rating among young voters aged 18 to 29 has dropped 12 points since February, from 55% to 43% today. How does the president get that back?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: I think the president gets it back by doing exactly what he's doing: showing up, talking about his record, addressing things like climate change, which are incredibly important issues for young voters, along with many others, obviously. Making sure that young people feel included in the conversation, not just as a vote, but as part of the governing coalition going forward. Young people helped propel me to victory as governor. One of the first things I did was start what I believe is the first ever Next Gen Engagement Commission here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, a place where young people quite literally advise me on policy, meet with me regularly, give me their perspective on what's happening in the community. I think part of the frustration by young people is that they- they oftentimes don't feel heard, and they feel like their voices and their votes are taken advantage of, come election time. This is a moment where the young people deserve to be at the table. And the fact that the President is showing up in these communities and talking about these issues that are going to help young people in the future, I think is a really important step.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So last weekend, Donald Trump was campaigning in Pennsylvania, it's so key. Here's what he said.\n[START SOUND ON TAPE]\nDONALD TRUMP: Biden has imposed a savage natural gas export ban that's putting countless Pennsylvania jobs at risk. He's risking your lives. He's risking your jobs. But he doesn't care, because all he cares about is the green new scam.\n[END SOUND ON TAPE]\nMARGARET BRENNAN: He is speaking to real fear among some of your constituents about President Biden's decision to, at least temporarily, put a pause on new natural gas projects. How do you respond to that?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Look, I've been very clear with the White House, and publicly, I hope that this policy that they put in place is very quick, and then we move forward. Here in Pennsylvania, our energy economy has powered this nation, and it has done so over many generations. And going forward, I think Pennsylvania has an opportunity to be the center of the clean energy economy. Thanks to the president, we're the only state in the nation with two regional hydrogen hubs.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But just to- just--\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Thanks to the president, we've been able to work together.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry, just- you broke up at the beginning. I think you said you've been very clear to the White House that you hope this is a short pause. Does that mean you agree, it is costing your state jobs and money?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Well, I think if the pause goes on for a long time, it has the potential to cost us jobs. That's why I want this to be as quick as possible. And what I went on to say, though, is we have an opportunity here in Pennsylvania to be the center of the clean energy economy. Thanks to President Biden, we have two regional hydrogen hubs. Thanks to President Biden, we are capping methane emissions from abandoned wells, we have billions of dollars of tax credits and other resources coming from the Department of Energy to help us through a transition. Here in Pennsylvania, we're showing that we can both protect the jobs that exist today and create more energy jobs tomorrow. Energy is critical to the future of our commonwealth. Now, listen, the bravado and the bluster from the former president do nothing to actually create jobs in Pennsylvania. He's got an abysmal track record when it comes to that. President Biden has a strong record. And we're going to continue to lead on energy here in Pennsylvania.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned young voters and how key the issue of climate is to them. The Biden administration touts the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, as a green energy bill even though it wasn't named that. But CBS polling shows half of Americans have not heard much, or nothing at all, about what the administration has done. Only 14% say they've heard a lot. Two thirds don't know if their state has gotten federal funds for climate change projects. This seems a real vulnerability for Democrats when it comes to young voters.\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Well, let me be very clear, climate change is real, it is serious, and we have to address it. And Joe Biden understands that. Donald Trump has made fun of climate change and denies its existence. So there's a clear contrast in this race. Because of the federal dollars that have flown- flowed to Pennsylvania, as I mentioned a moment ago, we are positioned to get two regional hydrogen hubs that are going to help us combat climate change. We're addressing all kinds of infrastructure needs here in this commonwealth, from repairing roads and bridges, to making sure people are connected to the internet, to making sure families in Esplen, which is a minority- predominantly minority community in Pittsburgh, no longer need to drink water out of the lines that contain lead, thanks to Joe Biden cleaning that up. So when it comes to infrastructure investments, when it comes to the kinds of investments that are going to help spur on a clean energy economy, President Biden has been there. Now, we have to make that case. And we've got to make sure folks understand that and hear that, that's why you run a campaign. That's why you'll see stark differences when it comes to combating climate change between the policies of President Biden and what Donald Trump has done in the past and wants to do in the future.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But the messaging needs work, is what you're saying?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Well, I think the case- I think the case needs to be made. There's a wonderful track record. There's a wonderful body of work. They need to make that case, and I'll be helping make that case alongside the president.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask about something that has been really damaging your state and that is drug addiction. Pennsylvania, has- I'm sorry, excuse me. The number one public health crisis in Pennsylvania, according to the state, is opioids. The CDC says Pennsylvania recently saw the highest number of xylazine-related deaths in the country. What is driving the addiction?\nGOV. SHAPIRO: Listen, 13 Pennsylvanians die every single day from an opioid overdose. It is unacceptable. And here in Pennsylvania, we're trying to come at it with a- a multi-pronged approach. First, we have to understand that drug addiction is a disease, not a crime. Now we have to invest in law enforcement. And I have. We've increased the number of state troopers by 400, and I'm looking to add another 400. As Attorney General, I arrested over 8,000 drug dealers. So we're not going soft on those who are peddling these poisons in our community. But we also have to make sure the treatment is available. As Attorney General I led a national coalition that ended up holding those drug companies accountable, the very people that brought this crisis into our communities, and brought $2 billion back to Pennsylvania for treatment--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm- I'm sorry to interrupt you--\nGOV. SHAPIRO: --this is really critical stuff and it's going to require a multi-pronged approach.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry, I have to interrupt you. We have to leave it there, Governor. Thank you.

Burritt promises the sale will make the company and the domestic steel industry stronger but the deal has raised questions from President Biden and numerous elected officials representing Pennsylvania and the Pittsburgh area.\nPennsylvania's two Democratic senators, Sens. Bob Casey and John Fetterman, have both voiced opposition to the sale. Fetterman lives across the street from U.S. Steel's Edgar Thomson plant in Braddock.\nBurritt says U.S. Steel will keep its name and remain headquartered in Pittsburgh.

I also condemn those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians.\" A reporter cut off the president's sentence before he could finish.\nMore than 100 people have been arrested at Columbia University since pro-Palestine protesters began occupying the grounds last week, and police arrested 45 protesters at Yale University on Monday after the demonstrators repeatedly refused to vacate the plaza voluntarily. Students at Yale and Columbia are calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and demanding their universities divest from companies connected to Israel. But some Jewish students at Columbia say many of the chants are antisemitic, and they're concerned about their safety.\nSimilar protests have been taking place at other college campuses, including at MIT, Boston University, Emerson College and Tufts University.\nOther top Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, both of New York, have criticized the demonstrations, too. The protests come as Passover is set to begin at sundown Monday.\nCalls are growing for Columbia's president, Nemat \"Minouche\" Shafik, to resign, as Columbia goes fully remote in an effort to deescalate the situation.\nThe entire Republican congressional New York delegation called for Shafik's resignation Monday, accusing her of failing to keep students safe.\n\"The ongoing situation that has unfolded is a direct symptom of your continued lax enforcement of policy and clear double standards,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"Your failure to enforce the rules on campus has created an environment in which students and outside agitators know they are able to operate with impunity and without any accountability. While the rot is systemic, the responsibility rests squarely on your shoulders.\"\nGOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, who was just outside Columbia University Monday, \"Everybody has the right to protest. They have the right to voice their opinion. The moment you turn that into physical assaults or threats against others is the moment you lose that right.\"\nShafik testified before Congress for several hours last week, telling Congress, \"Antisemitism has no place on our campus and I am personally committed to doing everything I can to confront it directly.\"\nSome Jewish congressional Democrats also went to Columbia's campus to offer their support for Jewish students. They did not echo the calls for Shafik's resignation, but demanded the restoration of order.\nAddressing his remarks to the university's administrators, Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, said, \"Stop the double talk and start acting now. Discipline harassers, restore civility on this campus, encourage peaceful, constructive dialogue.\"\nMr. Biden declined Monday to weigh in on Shafik's fate.\nAt the same Earth Day event with Mr. Biden, progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York cited the \"peaceful student-led protests\" at Columbia University and other campuses, highlighting how politically sensitive the politics are with respect to the Israel-Hamas conflict.\nThe president also condemned antisemitism at protests at university campuses in a written statement Sunday night.\n\"Silence is complicity,\" he said. \"Even in recent days, we've seen harassment and calls for violence against Jews. This blatant antisemitism is reprehensible and dangerous \u2013 and it has absolutely no place on college campuses, or anywhere in our country.\"\nIsrael continues near-daily aid raids on Rafah, a city in southern Gaza, resulting in the deaths of many civilians, including children.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Kathryn Watson","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/22/a4ed5d1e-a37e-4c9e-ab3b-d383130710df/thumbnail/1200x630/98aff3c67df66d296ec907eed1710486/ap24113686956758.jpg?v=57e8fa9efcf044a821348136ff26ed69","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSPolitics","_score":6.5862765,"_id":"609771628dd12e2dc499c8dc333821d5"},{"title":"U.S. officials on conflict between Israel, Iran","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-19 11:04:19","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/us-officials-on-conflict-between-israel-iran","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"President Biden warned about risking a wider war in the Middle East, and while the White House is monitoring the situation, there has been no official response.

In this country, the people are the highest authority.' I know because I was there when he said it, as the first American President to walk a picket line,\" said Biden.\nBiden discussed the historic strike and its impact.\n\"Shawn and I share a basic view of how workers deserve to be treated,\" Biden wrote. \"Just as they sacrificed when their employers were on the brink, they deserve record contracts when those companies have record profits. It's only fair. The historic wage increases the UAW won under Shawn's leadership carry forward the powerful legacy of labor leader and fellow UAW president Walter Reuther, and have led virtually every auto-maker across the country to follow suit. They remind us that when unions win, all workers benefit.\"\nThe union started its historic strike, in which it targeted all three Detroit automakers simultaneously for the first time, when their contracts expired on Sept. 14. Automakers and the union could not reach agreements in various areas, including increased wages, annual cost-of-living adjustments, and more benefits.\nThe six-week strike ended on Oct. 30, 2023, after the union reached an agreement with General Motors, the last of the three automakers left to reach a deal with the UAW.\nBiden also pointed out how Fain represents the \"hard-won success\" that unions, not just the UAW, had last year.\n\"Shawn represents the hard-won success that unions\u2014from the Teamsters, to the SEIU, to writers and actors, dockworkers and health care workers, baristas, warehouse workers, and more\u2014had in making 2023 the year of the union,\" Biden said in the Time story. \"They proved what I've always said: Wall Street didn't build America. The middle class built America. And unions built the middle class.\"\nThe announcement of Fain being included on the list comes as Republican governors are criticizing the efforts of the UAW. The criticism came a day before 4,300 Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga, Tenn., began voting on whether to join the union.\nThe governors of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas released a joint statement in which they said, \"We do not need to pay a third party to tell us who can pick up a box or flip a switch.\"\nFain is included in the Innovators section of Time's list.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Sara Powers,Politics,Often Focusing On Crime","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/10/20/ec8af204-2502-4042-99b5-6997e3a67f93/thumbnail/1200x630/193f19d2d44cf413278c04824b8784c3/gettyimages-1712272796.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSDetroit","_score":6.432461,"_id":"ee0148ad8f81c5c65cc4ad2f6d9702f2"},{"title":"Israel hits Iran with retaliatory missile strike; U.S. urges de-escalation","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-19 19:33:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/video/israel-hits-iran-with-retaliatory-missile-strike-u-s-urges-de-escalation","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Tensions in the Middle East remain high after Israel's retaliatory missile strike on Iran Thursday night.

Mr. Biden thanked congressional leaders for their work.\n\"In the nick of time, we are reauthorizing FISA right before it expires at midnight,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said when voting on final passage began 15 minutes before the deadline. \"All day long, we persisted and we persisted in trying to reach a breakthrough and in the end, we have succeeded.\"\nWhat is Section 702 of FISA?\nU.S. officials have said the surveillance tool, first authorized in 2008 and renewed several times since then, is crucial in disrupting terrorist attacks, cyber intrusions, and foreign espionage, and has also produced intelligence that the U.S. has relied on for specific operations, such as the 2022 killing of al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri.\n\"If you miss a key piece of intelligence, you may miss some event overseas or put troops in harm's way,\" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said. \"You may miss a plot to harm the country here, domestically, or somewhere else. So in this particular case, there's real-life implications.\"\nSection 702 permits the U.S. government to collect, without a warrant, the communications of non-Americans located outside the country to gather foreign intelligence. The reauthorization faced a long and bumpy road to final passage Friday after months of clashes between privacy advocates and national security hawks pushed consideration of the legislation to the brink of expiration.\nThough the spy program was technically set to expire at midnight, the Biden administration had said it expected its authority to collect intelligence to remain operational for at least another year, thanks to an opinion earlier this month from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which receives surveillance applications.\nStill, officials had said that court approval shouldn't be a substitute for congressional authorization, especially since communications companies could cease cooperation with the government if the program is allowed to lapse.\nHours before the law was set to expire, U.S. officials were already scrambling after two major U.S. communication providers said they would stop complying with orders through the surveillance program, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations.\nAttorney General Merrick Garland praised the reauthorization and reiterated how \"indispensable\" the tool is to the Justice Department.\n\"This reauthorization of Section 702 gives the U.S. the authority to continue to collect foreign intelligence information about non-U.S. persons located outside the United States, while at the same time codifying important reforms the Justice Department has adopted to ensure the protection of Americans' privacy and civil liberties,\" Garland said in a statement Saturday.\nSome lawmakers hesitant to renew Section 702\nBut despite the Biden administration's urging and classified briefings to senators this week on the crucial role they say the spy program plays in protecting national security, a group of progressive and conservative lawmakers who were agitating for further changes had refused to accept the version of the bill the House sent over last week.\nThe lawmakers had demanded that Schumer allow votes on amendments to the legislation that would seek to address what they see as civil liberty loopholes in the bill. In the end, Schumer was able to cut a deal that would allow critics to receive floor votes on their amendments in exchange for speeding up the process for passage.\nThe six amendments ultimately failed to garner the necessary support on the floor to be included in the final passage.\nOne of the major changes detractors had proposed centered around restricting the FBI's access to information about Americans through the program. Though the surveillance tool only targets non-Americans in other countries, it also collects communications of Americans when they are in contact with those targeted foreigners. Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber, had been pushing a proposal that would require U.S. officials to get a warrant before accessing American communications.\n\"If the government wants to spy on my private communications or the private communications of any American, they should be required to get approval from a judge, just as our Founding Fathers intended in writing the Constitution,\" Durbin said.\nIn the past year, U.S. officials have revealed a series of abuses and mistakes by FBI analysts in improperly querying the intelligence repository for information about Americans or others in the U.S., including a member of Congress and participants in the racial justice protests of 2020 and the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\nBut members on both the House and Senate intelligence committees as well as the Justice Department warned requiring a warrant would severely handicap officials from quickly responding to imminent national security threats.\n\"I think that is a risk that we cannot afford to take with the vast array of challenges our nation faces around the world,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/04/08/fd7a3330-743f-4de9-874a-77cf4bde36bd/thumbnail/1200x630/62d087b7bd411cc3011c4016a1ded522/fbi.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSPolitics","_score":6.263893,"_id":"aefa4f7c1341ea576d766388bf203b75"},{"title":"Climate politics and the bottom line \u2014 CBS News poll","author":"Anthony Salvanto","published_date":"2024-04-22 18:17:40","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-politics-opinion-poll-cbs-news-4-22-2024","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Many Americans see an economic cost to combating climate change.","summary":"For many years addressing climate change has been framed, at least in political debates, as one that carries an economic tradeoff: Could we afford to do it, even if we think it's otherwise a good idea, or would it cost jobs and money in a world so dependent on fossil fuels?\nThis framing endures today in many ways \u2014 especially on a personal level, if not a macro one.\nPeople are far more likely to oppose U.S. efforts to combat climate change if they think it will hurt their personal finances.\nIn fact, a majority of those who think efforts to reduce climate change will hurt them financially are in principle opposed to the U.S. taking steps on climate change, even as the rest of the nation breaks heavily in favor of that.\nMoreover these Americans extrapolate out and think a switchover to renewable energy, in particular, hurts the U.S. economy and hurts jobs.\nSo, who are they? For one thing, these folks seem highly sensitive to the price of gas \u2014 which may be one of the most immediate ways people believe they can measure any impact. If they report the price of gas has been a hardship or difficult for them, they are \u2014 by a double-digit-point difference \u2014 more likely to think efforts to reduce climate change hurt them.\nBut there's another way to measure personal economic impact, too, and that's in damage from weather events.\nA third of the country says their community has suffered damage from hurricanes, floods, fires and heat.\nThose people are much more likely to favor efforts to fight climate change and almost twice as likely to say efforts to fight climate change would help them financially.\nFinally, having said all that, there are a lot of people who outright reject the tradeoff framing in the first place \u2014 at least as it concerns energy production. Almost eight in 10 think it is possible to both increase energy production and protect the climate.\nAnd so, when people turn and look at the macro picture, there is little consensus on whether or not fighting climate change helps or hurts the larger economy.\nBiden climate agenda\nAnd half of Americans have heard not much or nothing about what the Biden administration has done about climate change. Only 14% say they've heard a lot.\nAnd two-thirds don't know if their state has gotten federal funds for climate change projects.\nWhen people are specifically asked about some of the Biden administration's policy programs, a lot of them gain at least net favor over opposition, at least in principle, though many still have not heard about them.\nBut the fact that people more broadly don't feel they know a lot about Biden administration plans for climate change \u2014 while at the same time a large majority say they support U.S. efforts to combat it, at least in principle \u2014 could signal that people aren't connecting the president's specific plans and policies to that larger goal.\nOf course, this is an argument the Biden administration, like many Democrats, has been making \u2014 that renewable energy and helping the climate makes financial sense, too.\nTake a closer look at one initiative \u2014 the move toward electric vehicles. There's a slight majority in favor of that move.\nBut here too, one of the reasons people oppose such a policy, when they do, centers around economics: They think it will hurt the economy and jobs.

If enough signatures are obtained, Nevadans will get to vote during the general election on enshrining abortion access for up to 24 weeks in the state's constitution.\nAccording to the campaign official, Vice President Harris will encourage Nevada voters to support the efforts, as they are \"an important step to protect against extremist state lawmakers who may try to adopt another 'Trump abortion ban' in the future.'\"\nAs of early April, Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom announced the collection of over 110,000 signatures ahead of the June 26 qualification deadline.

It also comes on the heels of the vice president's trip to Arizona on Friday after the state's supreme court upheld an 1864 law that severely restricts abortions.\n\"Former President Donald Trump did this,\" Harris told her crowd in Tucson. \"Donald Trump is the architect of this healthcare crisis.\"\nIn Nevada, Harris is expected to once again blame abortion bans on Trump and warn voters that a second-Trump term would put women's reproductive freedoms at risk.

The visit has been thrust into the spotlight as tensions in the region escalate following the strike, which included drone and missile launches that overflew Iraqi airspace and others that were launched from Iraq by Iran-backed groups.\nMichigan holds one of the largest populations of Iraqis in the nation, and many local Democrats have pushed back against U.S. support for Israel's war in Gaza following the Hamas attack on Oct. 7.

Since then, the U.S. has been sending one flight with Cuban deportees to Havana each month.\nBut in an interview with CBS News this week, Cuba's Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez de Coss\u00edo said Cuban officials are willing to accommodate more than one flight per month.\n\"We're open to having more\" deportation flights, said Fern\u00e1ndez de Coss\u00edo, who visited Washington this week to meet with Biden administration officials for the latest round of migration talks between the two countries.\nSince the 1959 Cuban Revolution, the U.S. and Cuba have had a deeply contentious relationship. The Cold War-era rivals still bitterly disagree on many issues, from Cuba's human rights record and its ties to China and Russia to the decades-long American embargo on Cuban imports and exports.\nBut Washington and Havana have worked together on immigration, including by signing the 1994 U.S.-Cuba Migration Accords, which officials from both nations are discussing this week. The two countries' work on immigration has intensified in recent years amid the record arrival of hundreds of thousands of Cubans to the U.S.-Mexico border.\nSince the start of fiscal year 2021, the U.S. has processed more than 450,000 Cuban migrants at the southern border, according to Customs and Border Protection data. The flow of Cuban migrants to the U.S. border has slowed since last year, when the Biden administration created programs that have allowed some Cubans to fly into the U.S. legally or appear at an official border crossing.\nIn the interview this week, Fern\u00e1ndez de Coss\u00edo blamed the exodus from Cuba in recent years on the U.S. embargo and other American policies, including the 1960s Cuban Adjustment Act, which created a special pathway to permanent U.S. residency for certain Cuban migrants. Only Congress can change that law.\nFern\u00e1ndez de Coss\u00edo said the U.S. is \"aiming at destroying the Cuban economy\" through its sanctions. He did not concede that economic mismanagement and repressive policies by Havana have also driven Cubans to flee the island, as the U.S. government has argued.\n\"You can speak about other factors, but if you have a consistent policy by the most powerful economy in the world to try to destroy the livelihood of a whole population, 11 million Cubans, it is logical to expect people, a segment of the population, to want to leave the country,\" he said.\nIn 2023, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security assessed that \"Cuba's deteriorating economic conditions and political repression continue to increasingly drive Cubans out of their country.\"\nFern\u00e1ndez de Coss\u00edo also cited the lack of some legal channels for Cuban citizens to come to the U.S. for illegal crossings along the southern border by Cubans.\nHe urged the State Department to resume the processing of tourist and short-term visas in Havana. The Biden administration restarted immigrant visa processing in Cuba, but short-term visa seekers in Cuba still have to travel to a third country to have their cases processed.\nFern\u00e1ndez de Coss\u00edo said U.S. officials informed him they would resume full visa processing in Cuba in the future.\nRepresentatives for the State Department did not respond to requests to comment on Fern\u00e1ndez de Coss\u00edo's remarks.\nFern\u00e1ndez de Coss\u00edo expressed some concern about additional U.S. sanctions if former President Donald Trump is elected in November. During Trump's tenure, the U.S. had a more aggressive stance towards Cuba, reversing the Obama administration's attempt to normalize relations with Havana.\n\"Of course we're concerned if there are additional economic measures [against] Cuba, regardless of who wins the election. The Biden administration has very faithfully applied the policies put in place by the Trump administration and added some,\" he said. \"So we would not [be] surprised they would do it. It would be unfair, and we believe it would be immoral, but we have to acknowledge that would happen and [it] gives us room for concern.\"","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Camilo Montoya-Galvez,He Covers Immigration Policy","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/18/35d4238f-8791-438c-9c6d-641e362efd80/thumbnail/1200x630/0be5dfac1251762bf5d81b5acdcdaa53/cbsn-fusion-cuban-official-denies-existence-chinese-spy-base-on-island-thumbnail.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSPolitics","_score":6.1547184,"_id":"6eddb0846455dc65fb483086e0672499"},{"title":"NPR suspends Uri Berliner, editor who accused the network of liberal bias","author":"Aimee Picchi","published_date":"2024-04-17 12:18:38","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/npr-uri-berliner-editor-suspended-essay","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Uri Berliner, who has worked at NPR for 25 years, was suspended after he claimed the network pushed progressive viewpoints.","summary":"Misinformation spreads online as some in Congress fight what they see as censorship\nNational Public Radio has suspended Uri Berliner, a senior editor who earlier this month claimed in an essay that the network had \"lost America's trust\" by pushing progressive views in its coverage while suppressing dissenting opinions.\nBerliner's suspension was reported by NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik, who said that the senior editor was suspended for five days without pay starting on Friday. A formal rebuke from NPR said Berliner had violated its policy of securing prior approval to write for other news outlets, and warned that he would be fired if he breached those guidelines in future, Folkenflik reported.\nNPR declined to comment to CBS News. \"NPR does not comment on individual personnel matters, including discipline,\" a spokesperson said.\nBerliner's essay in the Free Press caused a firestorm of debate, with some conservatives, including former President Donald Trump, calling on the government to \"defund\" the organization. Some of Berliner's NPR colleagues also took issue with the essay, with \"Morning Edition\" host Steve Inskeep writing on his Substack that the article was \"filled with errors and omissions.\"\n\"The errors do make NPR look bad, because it's embarrassing that an NPR journalist would make so many,\" Inskeep wrote.\nIn the essay, Berliner wrote that NPR has always had a liberal bent, but that for most of his 25 year tenure it had retained an open-minded, curious culture. \"In recent years, however, that has changed,\" he wrote. \"Today, those who listen to NPR or read its coverage online find something different: the distilled worldview of a very small segment of the U.S. population.\"\nBerliner added, \"[W]hat's notable is the extent to which people at every level of NPR have comfortably coalesced around the progressive worldview. The \"absence of viewpoint diversity\" is \"is the most damaging development at NPR,\" he wrote.\nAfter the essay's publication, NPR's top editor, Edith Chapin, said she strongly disagrees with Berliner's conclusions and is proud to stand behind NPR's work.\nCOVID coverage, DEI initiatives\nBerliner criticized coverage of major events at NPR, singling out its reporting on COVID and Hunter Biden as problematic. With the first topic, he wrote that the network didn't cover a theory that COVID-19 had been created in a Chinese lab, a theory he claimed NPR staffers \"dismissed as racist or a right-wing conspiracy.\"\nHe also took NPR for task for what he said was failing to report developments related to Hunter Biden's laptop. \"With the election only weeks away, NPR turned a blind eye,\" Berliner wrote.\nBerliner also criticized NPR for its internal management, citing what he claims is a growing focus on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI.\n\"Race and identity became paramount in nearly every aspect of the workplace,\" Berliner wrote. \"A growing DEI staff offered regular meetings imploring us to 'start talking about race'.\"\nInskeep said Berliner's essay left out the context that many other news organizations didn't report on Hunter Biden's laptop over questions about its authenticity. He also disputed Berliner's characterization that NPR editors and reporters don't debate story ideas.\n\"The story is written in a way that is probably satisfying to the people who already believe it, and unpersuasive to anyone else \u2014 a mirror image of his critique of NPR,\" Inskeep wrote.\n\u2014With reporting by the Associated Press.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Where She Covers Business,Consumer Reports.,Alain Sherter,Has Written,Aimee Picchi","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/05/01/c9f34cd8-88d1-44c8-81c1-43737e5a6ac8/thumbnail/1200x630/6c6e87fa12dbb31fa0d4a98d8afc3be0/npr-sign-1920.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@@aimeepicchi","_score":5.984219,"_id":"acc66b674dbcc55c62ac8f28a7a5b6d0"},{"title":"Former President Donald Trump meets with Manhattan bodega workers after 2nd day in court","author":"Ali Bauman","published_date":"2024-04-16 22:14:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/former-president-donald-trump-meets-nyc-bodega-workers","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Former President Donald Trump planned to meet with bodega workers in Manhattan after his second day in court Tuesday\u200b.","summary":"NEW YORK -- Former President Donald Trump planned to meet with bodega workers in Manhattan after his second day in court Tuesday.\nNEW YORK -- Former President Donald Trump planned to meet with bodega workers in Manhattan after his second day in court Tuesday.\nSecret Service and the NYPD had the area surrounded West 139th Street locked down.

Kennedy Jr. was on the ballot as an independent presidential candidate in Utah and Michigan, though his campaign says it is working to get him on the ballot in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nKennedy's backers insist he's not pursuing his White House bid just to hand the election to another candidate. They say he's the real deal and has a shot at winning the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidential election.\nGetting on the ballot in enough states to secure 270 votes \u2014 just over half the 538 votes in the Electoral College \u2014 is no small feat for a third-party contender. But it's possible.\n\"I think he has a very good chance of getting onto all 50 ballots,\" said Bernard Tamas, an associate professor of political science at Valdosta State University who studies third parties. \"The short answer is, I can't say definitively that he will, but it looks like he's on track for it.\"\nFile: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., during a campaign event in Oakland, California, on Tuesday, March 26, 2024.\nDavid Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\nKennedy's campaign says it has completed signature gathering in seven other states in addition to Utah and Michigan \u2014 Nevada, Idaho, Hawaii, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Nebraska and Iowa.\nThe super PAC supporting Kennedy, American Values 2024, says it has collected enough signatures in Arizona, Georgia and South Carolina.\nAnd yet, the campaign has yet to complete the paperwork and submit the petitions in those states. It noted that it still has months in most states to submit the paperwork because most states' deadlines aren't until July or August.\nThe campaign says it's trying to evade legal battles by picking the right time to hand in the petitions, holding onto the signatures until the 11th hour in hopes that the signatures will face fewer challenges.\nKennedy has already run into a paperwork snafu in Nevada. In March, the campaign learned that it would likely have to start the signature process all over again after failing to include a vice presidential candidate on the petition it used to collect signatures in the state.\n\"After successfully collecting all of the signatures we need in Nevada, the DNC Goon Squad and their lackeys in the Nevada Secretary of State's office are outright inventing a new requirement for the petition with zero legal basis,\" Kennedy campaign ballot access attorney Paul Rossi complained.\nIn addition to varying state regulations for ballot access and expensive legal battles, Kennedy faces opposition from Democratic groups aiming to undermine third-party campaigns.\nEarlier this year, the Democratic National Committee formed a team to challenge third-party and independent presidential candidates. The effort will depend on other groups like Third Way, MoveOn, and a new super PAC, Clear Choice, backed by allies of President Biden.\n\"Only two candidates have a path to 270 electoral votes \u2014 President Biden and Donald Trump,\" said DNC spokesperson Matt Corridoni. \"The stakes are high and we know this is going to be a close election. That's why a vote for any third-party candidate is a vote for Donald Trump.\"\nThe Kennedy campaign said it plans to secure ballot access in all 50 states, dismissing suggestions that Kennedy aims to help former President Donald Trump's bid for the presidency by taking votes from Mr. Biden.\n\"Our campaign is a spoiler. I agree with that. It's a spoiler for President Biden and for President Trump,\" Kennedy said when he revealed his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, last month.\nIn some states, the time frame for collecting signatures is brief. Others have provisions for signature thresholds to be reached in every county of a state. More than half the states require independent candidates to have a running mate.\nCollecting enough signatures isn't difficult in every state. Many only require 1,000 to 5,000 signatures, Tamas said. Louisiana requires no signatures and a $500 fee. Other states have higher thresholds. Texas requires over 113,000 signatures, and Florida requires more than 145,000.\nAnd those are the number of valid signatures required. Any third-party candidate needs to overshoot that target in order to make sure they have enough in case some of the signatures are found to be invalid.\nIn states like Hawaii, where the Kennedy campaign claims to have gathered enough signatures, it's more convenient to run under a party affiliation rather than as an independent candidate. Kennedy supporters are also collecting signatures in California, Mississippi, North Carolina and Delaware to establish the \"We The People\" party, which can then nominate Kennedy as its presidential candidate.\nThe Kennedy campaign says it's aiming to collect 60% over the signature threshold in each state.\n\"We have the field teams, volunteers, legal teams, paid circulators, supporters, and strategists ready to get the job done,\" said campaign press secretary Stefanie Spear. \"We are exceeding all our benchmarks and will be announcing new states each week.\"\nBut Tamas says Kennedy should be aiming higher \u2014 closer to double the required number of signatures.\n\"I'm surprised they're saying it's as low as 60, you just can't take any chances,\" Tamas said.\nCollecting signatures is expensive. Kennedy's super PAC estimates that it will cost around $40 to $50 million just to collect all the necessary signatures, although Tamas noted RFK Jr.'s running mate, Shanahan, the billionaire ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, has the financial resources.\nCollecting the signatures isn't the hardest part \u2014 it's the battle over the signatures that's the real fight, Tamas said. The Democratic Party will be fighting hard to invalidate Kennedy's signatures.\n\"You really have to prepare for a battle, so a lot of the cost is not actually getting the signatures, but actually the legal fees of fighting each state,\" Tamas said.\nDemocratic Party members are already trying to block Kennedy from getting on the ballot in Hawaii and Michigan.\nHistorically, there have been independent candidates who secured ballot access across nearly all states. In 1968, George Wallace, the former governor of Alabama, and in 1992, businessman Ross Perot both appeared on the ballot in all 50 states. Ralph Nader's candidacy in 2000 extended to 43 states.\nOnly Wallace managed to win any electoral votes. Perot's impressive 19% of the popular vote in 1992 did not translate to the Electoral College.\nPerot's former campaign manager, Russell Verney, said third-party candidates must overcome more obstacles today than in the past.\n\"Every time there's a reasonably successful independent candidate, the state legislatures, which are made up of Republicans and Democrats, who by definition do not like competition, increase the state barriers to getting on the ballot,\" Verney said. \"The requirements to get on these state ballots continues to get more onerous in every election cycle.\"\nBut \"someone in RFK's position, I don't think the Democrats are going to stop him,\" Tamas said. \"I think he's going to be on \u2014 if not all \u2014 then probably most of the ballots.\"\nA successful third-party candidate has to focus on individuals who aren't being represented by the major parties, Tamas said, and that's a problem for Kennedy.\n\"He's all over the place, and it's really not clear what's the disaffected group he's trying to tap into,\" Tamas said. \"He's running on conspiracy theories is part of it. But if someone's a conspiracy theorist, chances are they're going to support Donald Trump.\"\nAt this point, if Kennedy's ballot petitions were validated in all of the states where his website says the signature gathering is complete \u2014 Nevada, Hawaii, Idaho, Nebraska, Iowa, North Carolina and New Hampshire \u2014 plus Louisiana, which, as noted, does not have a signature requirement, and the two states where he is on the ballot \u2014 he could win 73 electoral votes. Add in the three states where his super PAC says it has the signatures, and that's another 36, putting him at 109.\nThe latest YouGov/Economist national polling shows Mr. Biden and Trump tied with 44% and Kennedy at 3%.\nKennedy's support is likely to drop off before November, Tamas predicted.\nBut it's not yet clear whether Mr. Biden or Trump stands to lose more from Kennedy's presidential bid.\n\"Nobody really knows for sure who he's going to take votes from,\" Tamas said.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Allison Novelo,Kathryn Watson","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/20/44b5f063-defb-48ca-b0a2-43d6cedad407/thumbnail/1200x630g2/a95faf51f9e11700782b99d8d1304c1f/gettyimages-2107859071.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@https://twitter.com/AlliNovelo/","_score":5.9464817,"_id":"8ba8be391d1884ce48fdb37193aa9918"},{"title":"US deports about 50 Haitians to nation hit with gang violence, ending monthslong pause in flights","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-19 12:13:12","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/us-deports-about-50-haitians-to-nation-hit-with-gang-violence-ending-monthslong-pause-in-flights-2","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Its first deportation flight in months to the Caribbean nation struggling under surging gang violence.","summary":"The Biden administration sent about 50 Haitians back to their country on Thursday, authorities said, marking the first deportation flight in several months to the Caribbean nation struggling with surging gang violence.\nThe Homeland Security Department said in a statement that it \"will continue to enforce U.S. laws and policy throughout the Florida Straits and and the Caribbean region, as well as at the southwest border. U.S. policy is to return noncitizens who do not establish a legal basis to remain in the United States.\"\nAuthorities didn't offer details of the flight beyond how many deported Haitians were aboard.\nThomas Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data, said a plane left Alexandria, Louisiana, a hub for deportation operations, and arrived in Cap-Haitien, Haiti, after a stop in Miami.\nMarjorie Dorsaninvil, a U.S. citizen, said her Haitian fianc\u00e9, Gerson Joseph, called in tears from the Miami airport Thursday morning to say he was being deported on a flight to Cap-Haitien with other Haitians and some from other countries, including the Bahamas.\nHe promised to call when he arrived but hadn't done so by early evening.\nJoseph lived in the U.S more than 20 years and has a 7-year-old U.S. citizen daughter with another woman. He had a deportation order dating from 2005 after losing an asylum bid that his attorney, Philip Issa, said was a result of poor legal representation at the time. Though Joseph wasn't deported previously, his lawyer was seeking to have that order overturned.\nJoseph was convicted of theft and burglary, and ordered to pay restitution of $270, Issa said. He has been detained since last year.\nDorsaninvil said her fianc\u00e9 has \"nobody\" in Haiti. \"It is devastating for me. We were planning a wedding and now he is gone,\" she said.\nMore than 33,000 people fled Haiti's capital in a span of less than two weeks as gangs pillaged homes and attacked state institutions, according to a report last month from the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration. The majority of those displaced traveled to Haiti's southern region, which is generally peaceful compared with Port-au-Prince, which has an estimated population of 3 million and is largely paralyzed by gang violence.\nHaiti's National Police is understaffed and overwhelmed by gangs with powerful arsenals. Many hospitals ceased operations amid a shortage of medical supplies.\nThe U.S. operated one deportation flight a month to Haiti from December 2022 through last January, according to Witness at the Border. It said deportation flights were frequent after a camp of 16,000 largely Haitian migrants assembled on the riverbanks of Del Rio, Texas, in September 2021 but became rare as fewer Haitians crossed the border illegally from Mexico.\nHaitians were arrested crossing the border from Mexico 286 times during the first three months of the year, less than 0.1% of the more than 400,000 arrests among all nationalities. More than 150,000 have entered the U.S. legally since January 2023 under presidential powers to grant entry for humanitarian reasons, and many others came legally using an online appointment system at land crossings with Mexico called CBP One.\nHomeland Security said Thursday that it was \"monitoring the situation\" in Haiti.\" The U.S. Coast Guard repatriated 65 Haitians who were stopped at sea off the Bahamas coast last month.\nHaitian Bridge Alliance, a migrant advocacy group, urged a halt in deportation flights to Haiti, saying Thursday that the U.S. was \"knowingly condemning the most vulnerable, who came to us in their time of need, to imminent danger.\"\nWith Republicans seizing on the issue in an election year, the Biden administration has emphasized enforcement, most notably through a failed attempt at legislation, after record-high border arrests in December. Arrests for illegal crossings dropped by half in January and have held pretty steady since then after Mexico stepped up enforcement south of the U.S. border. Biden says he is considering executive action to halt asylum at the border during times when illegal crossings reach certain thresholds.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/19/bc8a0c96-9275-463e-a4dd-50a08a156d7d/thumbnail/1200x630/70aa288a468b0e954034763ca2584bc0/homeland-security.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSMiami","_score":5.823552,"_id":"0b2af1401177b30dd4fd2e0757858a4b"},{"title":"Samsung gets $6.4 billion in federal funds to manufacture computer chips in Texas","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-15 15:11:33","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/samsung-semiconductor-chip-factory-austin-taylor-texas","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"The projects are expected to create at least 17,000 construction jobs and 4,500 manufacturing jobs.","summary":"The Biden administration has reached an agreement to provide up to $6.4 billion in direct funding for Samsung Electronics to develop a computer chip manufacturing and research cluster in central Texas.\nSamsung first announced plans to build a plant in Taylor, Texas, in 2021. At the time, the company said it was making a $17 billion investment. The project now also includes an expansion of an existing facility in Austin. The funding announced Monday by the Commerce Department raises the total investment to more than $40 billion.\nThe government support comes from the CHIPS and Science Act, which President Biden signed into law in 2022 with the stated goal of reviving the production of advanced computer chips domestically.\n\"The proposed project will propel Texas into a state-of-the-art semiconductor ecosystem,\" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on a call with reporters. \"It puts us on track to hit our goal of producing 20% of the world's leading-edge chips in the United States by the end of the decade.\"\nRaimondo said she expects the project will create at least 17,000 construction jobs and more than 4,500 manufacturing jobs.\nTexas Sen. John Cornyn (R) authored a related law, the CHIPS for America Act, that created federal programs to encourage semiconductor manufacturing.\n\"By investing in leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing, we are helping secure this vulnerable supply chain, boosting our national security and global competitiveness, and creating new jobs for Texans,\" Cornyn said in a statement released Monday morning.\nSamsung's cluster in Taylor, just northeast of Austin, would include two factories that would make four- and two-nanometer chips. Also, there would be a factory dedicated to research and development, as well as a facility for the packaging that surrounds chip components.\nThe first factory is expected to be operational in 2026, with the second being operational in 2027, according to the government.\nLael Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council, said Samsung will be able to manufacture chips in Austin directly for the Defense Department as a result. Access to advanced technology has become a major national security concern amid competition between the U.S. and China.\nIn addition to the $6.4 billion, Samsung has indicated it also will claim an investment tax credit from the U.S. Treasury Department.\nThe government has previously announced terms to support other chipmakers including Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in projects spread across the country.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/15/843845ff-76c5-40a5-98f7-d3cc31c5b5cc/thumbnail/1200x630/4525e5cb7c7e3f84b735b3d7d2cd45d2/gettyimages-2131328580.jpg?v=c0ff3069549804234360eec4c5e30dea","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSNewsTexas","_score":5.773431,"_id":"a583e502de7e399a522a8fcb5bb48179"},{"title":"U.S. sanctions two entities over fundraising for extremist West Bank settlers who attacked Palestinians","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-19 14:52:11","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-sanctions-fundraisers-for-extremist-west-bank-settlers-attacking-palestinians","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"The Treasury Department announced sanctions on two entities accused of fundraising for extremist West Bank settlers connected to violence against Palestinians.","summary":"The Treasury Department on Friday announced sanctions against two entities that have been accused of fundraising for extremist Israeli-occupied West Bank settlers connected to violence against Palestinians, as well as the founder of a group whose members regularly attack Palestinians.\nDeputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in a statement that Mount Hebron Fund and Shlom Asiraich \"generated tens of thousands of dollars for extremists responsible for destroying property, assaulting civilians, and violence against Palestinians.\"\n\"Such acts by these organizations undermine the peace, security, and stability of the West Bank,\" he added. \"We will continue to use our tools to hold those responsible accountable.\"\nThe Treasury Department said the two entities, Mount Hebron Fund and Shlom Asiraich, have been accused of raising money for settlers Yinon Levi and David Chai Chasdai, who have both already previously been sanctioned.\nLevi is alleged by the U.S. to have led settlers in repeatedly assaulting Palestinian and Bedouin civilians in the West Bank, threatening them if they didn't leave their homes. Levi and the settlers, according to the State Department, \"burned their fields and destroyed their property.\"\nChasdai, according to the U.S., allegedly led a riot, setting cars and buildings on fire in the West Bank. The rampage resulted in the death of a Palestinian civilian.\nThe announcement came as the West Bank has been seeing some of its worst violence perpetrated by extremist settlers against Palestinians since the war in nearby Gaza began.\nThere has been friction between President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose far-right government has responded angrily to previous sanctions imposed against West Bank settlers.\nThe fundraising campaigns established by Mount Hebron Fund for Levi and by Shlom Asiraich for Chasdai generated the equivalent of $140,000 and $31,000, respectively, according to U.S. Treasury.\nThe penalties are intended to block them from using the U.S. financial system and bar American citizens from dealing with them.\nAdditionally, the State Department is designating Ben-Zion Gopstein, the founder and leader of Lehava, an organization whose members have assaulted Palestinian civilians.\nTreasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said the organizations \"undermine the peace, security, and stability of the West Bank.

Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, that aired on April 21, 2024.","summary":"The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, that aired on April 21, 2024.\nThe following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, that aired on April 21, 2024.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Alaska Republican Senator Dan Sullivan who is also here with us. It was a busy weekend here in Washington--\nSENATOR DAN SULLIVAN: Yeah, Margaret, good to be back on the show.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, this Ukraine aid that finally has moved, President Zelenskyy was on another network this morning and he said the U.S. will send a signal with this, that this will not be a second Afghanistan, the U.S. will stay with Ukraine. If Donald Trump wins this next election, can you guarantee the U.S. will stay with Ukraine?\nSEN. SULLIVAN: Well, listen, I can't guarantee anything, but it's actually good that the President- President Zelenskyy mentioned Afghanistan because Margaret, this gets lost too much. I think we gotta look at how we got to the situation of Ukraine. I believe strongly that the weakness coming out of the Biden White House, they cut defense spending, you know, every- every year in terms of the President's budget. Their energy policies exude weakness, and the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan emboldened Putin to undertake the invasion of Ukraine. So we gotta remember, kind of broadly, more strategically, where we are. But as you know, I was a supporter of the defense supplemental. And I think it's not just going to be important for Ukraine, as you and I have talked about before, it's going to be really important for the industrial base of America, which has atrophied dramatically. 60% of this bill goes into building weapons, everything from submarines to--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- In many Republican districts too, which is why it's so surprising it took so long to get through the House.\nSEN. SULLIVAN: All over the place. So I think it's important, but again, you know, a lot of this, in terms of where we are on Ukraine, from my perspective, comes from the weakness of the Biden administration, and, you know, the president's inability to actually make the case on Ukraine. He's given two speeches on Ukraine in the last two years, and all his speeches do is kind of villain- villainize another part of the Congress--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We could--\nSEN. SULLIVAN: --He hasn't tried to bring people together.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We could have a historical argument for the next hour--\nSEN. SULLIVAN: -- Well the history's important--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- going back years about green lights being given to Vladimir Putin around the world by leaders in many countries.So let's talk about--\nSEN. SULLIVAN: -- The history on this is important--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- I'm not saying it's not, but let's talk about the future here, and the signals being sent. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban met in March with Donald Trump at Mar-A-Lago, and then he gave an interview. And in that interview, he said that Trump told him, he will not give a penny to fund Ukraine. And that is why the war will end because Ukraine cannot stand on its own feet. We know he's not a fan of President Zelenskyy. So why do you think he will be persuaded? He might win this election.\nSEN. SULLIVAN: Well, listen, I mean, President Trump put out a statement recently where he thought it was important to support- support Ukraine. He actually also mentioned the Europeans need to do more and he actually mentioned something, as I just said, that it was very unlikely the war would have started, had he still been in the White House. So--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Russia hadn't withdrawn from Ukraine- You know, they'd gone in- in 2014. So this argument over \"Trump would have made a difference,\" it didn't make a difference--\nSEN. SULLIVAN: -- Well look I think--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --for his four years in office.\nSEN. SULLIVAN:\n-- Again, the broader- the broader issue, particularly between Biden and Trump right now, you know, where are we- is the world a safer place for the United States and our allies today as it was four years ago? I think that the answer to that is unequivocally no. But let's get back to your question. I do think that the Republican Party in the House and in the Senate is still very much the peace through strength party. This is the tradition of Republicans, Reagan, the Bush presidencies, Eisenhower, Teddy Roosevelt--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Are you just talking about the Senate or the House? Because there were more Republicans in the House who voted against Ukraine aid than voted for it.\nSEN. SULLIVAN: Well, but actually look at some of the other votes. There was a vote- Republicans in the House two to one rejected an amendment to strip funding for Ukraine, two to one in the house and--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- That was Marjorie Taylor Green's effort.\nSEN. SULLIVAN:-- Correct an- and, you know, we'll see what the Senate does this Tuesday on this bill. One of the things that I think the Speaker did a good job on with regard to this legislation is actually-he actually improved it for a whole host of reasons. But I predict that you'll probably see a majority of Senate Republicans supporting this legislation. And like I said, peace through strength- this is important because Donald Trump was part of that tradition very much, remember President Obama cut defense spending by 25%. His second term, he gutted readiness. This is what Democrats sent-Presidents do, Biden did it-Obama did it.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm-I'm gonna talk about some of these mixed messages in the house with our congressman ahead senator\u2013\nSEN. SULLIVAN:\u2013 Okay, but look I mean \u2013\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 It's not-it's not still clear \u2013\nSEN. SULLIVAN: \u2013 I think our party is still a peace through strength party, one of the dangers of my view\u2013\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013but as just said you can't guarantee a Trump administration\nSEN. SULLIVAN: \u2013well nobody can guarantee anything\u2013\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013but he hasn't even endorsed this bill publicly.\nSEN. SULLIVAN: He came out with a statement last week saying something that you know, Ukraine was important\u2013\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013No he says everyone agrees Ukrainian survival and strength should be much more important to Europe then to us, but it's also important to us, get moving Europe. That was the best that Republicans got out of him. David Cameron from the U.K.,\nSEN. SULLIVAN: \u2013 let me make one other point\u2013\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013the Polish President\u2013\nSEN. SULLIVAN: I think that we're kind of given Joe Biden a bit of a pass on, not just as I mentioned how we got here, but the execution of the Ukraine\u2013\nMARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 Yeah \u2013\nSEN. SULLIVAN: \u2013Effort is you know, literally every major weapon system that the Ukrainians have said they need from HIMARS, Patriots, stingers, tanks, F-16s, now ATACMs, every single weapon system, this administration, delays, delays because they're scared of, you know, making Vladimir Putin mad. The Senate, you saw Mark Warner there a second ago, you interviewed him. In a bipartisan way we come in and we say, Mr. President, you have to give them these weapon systems, they finally relent. Think about where we'd be Margaret, if, you know, a year and a half ago, we would have gotten all these weapons systems in Ukraine.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- Or six months ago, if Republicans in the House actually held a vote to do what they did just yesterday, but I need to move on to the climate because I know you're also passionate about this and what the Biden administration just announced about your state of Alaska. The President wants to conserve 30% of us lands as part of his climate change efforts. And he has limited oil and gas drilling in parts in the national petroleum reserves to protect polar bears and other things. And then he also blocked a role- road, excuse me, crucial to operating a copper and zinc mine. You said this is suicidal and lawless.\nSEN. SULLIVAN: It was.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Those are strong words.\nSEN. SULLIVAN: Well, it's lawless. He doesn't have the authority to do it. And I could go into all the laws that support me on that. It's, as I say, national security suicide. Look, this president won't sanction the Iranian oil and gas regime. You may have seen Senator Blumenthal and I put sent a letter to the President on Friday saying you need to do that. But he has no problem sanctioning Alaska that this administration has issued 63 executive orders and executive actions, singularly focused on Alaska to shut our state down. Now that of course, hurts my constituents. But Margaret, national resources, energy critical minerals, that's an American strength, this should concern all kinds of Americans. I'll mention one final thing that I really wanted to highlight here. You know, I've been in the Senate nine years, I have never seen such a cynical and dishonest display coming out of any presidency. When this President on Friday with Secretary Haaland announced that they did this because the Alaska Native, the indigenous people on the North Slope of Alaska, asked them to, they wanted them to ,these- the leaders of the North Slope of Alaska, were unanimous in opposition to this. They tried to meet with Secretary Haaland, she wouldn't meet with them. This is a rule that focuses on their lands where they've been living for 1000s of years. And then the President says, well, I did it because the indigenous people of Alaska wanted it. That is a lie. And I- it is a lie and go look, go see what the indigenous people of Alaska from that part of my state said, they're very upset and the President was canceling their voices and now stealing their voices. It was really a despicable move.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, we have to leave it there because of the break, but I know you could talk with me on this perhaps again in the future--\nSEN. SULLIVAN:-- Thank you--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: -- more in depth. We'll be right back.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/21/c83da135-91c7-4e9e-9d26-9b86aff30c45/thumbnail/1200x630/04c1009117b9213f55b0f5be91ec4a61/1713717020555.png?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@facethenation","_score":5.7162104,"_id":"1986720ef990db30306f8f2fff01e073"},{"title":"Poland's Duda is latest foreign leader to meet with Trump as U.S. allies hedge their bets on November election","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-18 10:54:05","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-duda-meeting","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Former President Donald Trump met Wednesday in New York with Polish President Andrzej Duda, the latest in a series of meetings with foreign leaders as Europe braces for the possibility of a second\u2026","summary":"New York \u2014 Former President Donald Trump met Wednesday in New York with Polish President Andrzej Duda, the latest in a series of meetings with foreign leaders as Europe braces for the possibility of a second Trump term.\nThe presumptive Republican nominee hosted Duda at Trump Tower, where the two discussed the war in Ukraine and Duda's push to boost NATO members' defense spending, according to a readout from Trump's campaign.\nDuda, who has long expressed admiration for Trump, is also a staunch supporter of Ukraine and has encouraged Washington to provide more aid to Kyiv amid Russian's ongoing invasion. That funding has been held up by Trump allies in Congress.\nAs he arrived, Trump praised the Polish president, saying, \"He's done a fantastic job and he's my friend.\"\nDonald Trump stands with Polish President Andrzej Duda at Trump Tower on April 17, 2024 in New York City.\nMichael M Santiago / Getty Images\n\"We had four great years together,\" Trump added. \"We're behind Poland all the way.\"\nFollowing the almost 2 1/2 hour meeting, Duda said only that it was a \"friendly meeting in very nice atmosphere.\"\nHis aide, Wojciech Kolarski, also in attendance, described it as an \"excellent meeting\" of \"two friends who reminisced on the time when for four years they cooperated while holding presidential offices,\" a time that was \"very fruitful for Polish-U.S. relations.\"\nDuda is the latest foreign leader to meet with Trump in the weeks since he locked up the Republican nomination. U.S. allies across the world were caught off guard by Trump's surprise 2016 win, forcing them to scramble to build relationships with a president who often attacked longstanding treaties and alliances they valued. Setting up meetings with him during the 2024 campaign suggests they don't want to be behind again.\nTrump's allies have been encouraging foreign countries to send diplomats and official emissaries to Mar-a-Lago to reconnect ahead of another potential Trump stint in the White House, sources with direct knowledge of the meetings confirmed to CBS News.\nTrump advisers and allies believe he'll be able to capitalize on the decline in Americans' approval of President Biden's foreign policy decisions. An April CBS News poll found that only 33% of Americans approve of Mr. Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict, down from 44% in October.\nEven as he goes on trial for one of the four criminal indictments against him, Trump and Mr. Biden are locked in a rematch that most observers expect will be exceedingly close in November.\nSuch meetings aren't unprecedented\nWhile some in Poland worried the visit might damage the country's relationship with Biden, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. - a Biden ally and a major voice in his party on foreign affairs - said such meetings make sense.\n\"The polls are close,\" he said. \"If I were a foreign leader - and there's a precedent attached to meeting with candidates who are nominated or on the path to being nominated - I'd probably do it too.\"\nMurphy noted that former President Barack Obama did a lengthy international tour and met with foreign leaders when he first ran for the White House. So did Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, who challenged Obama in 2012 and whose trip included a stop in Poland's capital, Warsaw.\nDuda's visit comes a week after Trump met with British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, another NATO member and key proponent of supporting Ukraine, at the former president's Florida estate.\nIn March, Trump hosted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, an autocrat who has maintained the closest relationship with Russia among European Union countries. Orb\u00e1n shared a montage of footage of the visit on his Instagram feed, which included an image of him and his staff meeting with Trump and the former president's aides in a scene that looked like an official bilateral meeting.\nTrump also met briefly in February with Javier Milei, the fiery, right-wing populist president of Argentina who ran a campaign inspired by Trump, complete with red \"Make Argentina Great Again\" hats. Milei gave Trump an excited hug backstage at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, according to video posted by a Trump campaign aide.\nBiden administration officials have been careful not to weigh in publicly on foreign leaders' meetings with Trump, acknowledging he has a real chance of winning the race.\nWhile some officials have privately expressed frustration with such meetings, they are mindful that any criticism would open the U.S. to charges of hypocrisy because senior American officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, meet frequently with foreign opposition figures at various forums in the United States and abroad.\nSecurity and policy officials monitor the travel plans of foreign officials visiting the U.S., but generally don't have a say in where they go or with whom they meet, according to an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss protocol.\nTrump has been back in his hometown this week for the start of his criminal hush money trial, which has dramatically limited his ability to travel and campaign. While in town, aides have been planning a series of events that began Tuesday evening when Trump, after court adjourned, stopped by a Harlem bodega where a man was killed to rail against crime and blast the district attorney who made him the first former president in U.S. history to stand criminal trial.\nTrump-Duda as \"friends\"\nDuda, a right-wing populist who once proposed naming a military base in his country \"Fort Trump,\" described the dinner earlier Wednesday as a private get-together between friends at Trump's former residence while he is in town for meetings at the United Nations, where Duda is to deliver a speech.\n\"I have been invited by Mr. Donald Trump to his private apartment,\" Duda told reporters, saying it was \"a normal practice when one country has good relations with another country\" to want those relations to be as strong as \"possible with the representatives of various sides of the political stage.\"\n\"We know each other as people. Like two, I can say in some way, friends,\" said Duda, whose term ends in 2025.\nDuda's visit comes as House Republicans wrangle over a $95 billion foreign aid bill that would provide new funding to Ukraine, including money for the U.S. military to replace depleting weapon supplies. Polish leaders have been urging the House to approve the aid bill and ease domestic concerns.\nMany Trump allies in the House are fiercely opposed to aiding Ukraine, even as the country warns that it's struggling amid a fresh Russian offensive. Trump has said he might be open to aid in the form of a loan.\nOne area where Trump and Duda agree when it comes to the conflict is a desire to push NATO members to increase their defense spending. Duda has called on fellow members of the alliance to raise their spending to 3% of gross domestic product as Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine. That would represent a significant increase from the current commitment of 2% by 2024.\nTrump, in a stunning break from U.S. precedent, has long been critical of the Western alliance and has threatened not to defend member nations that do not hit that spending goal. That threat strikes at the heart of the alliance's Article 5, which states that any attack against one NATO member will be considered an attack against all.\nIn February, Trump went even further, recounting that he'd once told leaders that he would \"encourage\" Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to members that are - in his words - \"delinquent.\"\nTrump's campaign said the two discussed the NATO proposal during the meeting. The two also discussed Israel and the Middle East, Trump's 2017 trip to Warsaw \"and many other topics having to do with getting to world peace,\" the campaign said in its readout, which described the men as \"great friends.\"\nThe visit was met with mixed reaction in Poland, where fears of Russia run high and Duda's friendly relationship with Trump has been a source of controversy.\nPoland's centrist Prime Minister Donald Tusk, a political opponent of Duda, was critical of the dinner but expressed hope that Duda would use it as an opportunity \"to raise the issue of clearly siding with the Western world, democracy and Europe in this Ukrainian-Russian conflict.\"","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/18/cf82b33d-ecab-4efc-b2f4-ff182695a986/thumbnail/1200x630/59f9b519dc2ffe8290a752a8173ccc84/gettyimages-2149039936-1.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CBSPolitics","_score":5.6780944,"_id":"ff5fad89397a3a9250c6732df6b22f18"},{"title":"Governors decry United Auto Workers push to unionize car factories in six southern states","author":"Kate Gibson","published_date":"2024-04-16 21:19:42","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uaw-vw-chattanooga-tennessee","clean_url":"cbsnews.com","excerpt":"Republican governors criticized the UAW's efforts as Volkswagen workers in Tennessee are set to start voting on joining the labor union.","summary":"Six Republican governors are condemning efforts by the United Auto Workers to organize car factories in their states, a flash point as the labor group tries to build on its success last year winning concessions from the Big Three automakers by making inroads in the historically union-averse South.\n\"We have a responsibility to our constituents to speak up when we see special interests looking to come into our state and threaten our jobs and the values we live by,\" the governors Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas said Tuesday in a joint statement.\nThe governors spoke out against the UAW a day before 4,300 Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga, Tenn., are set to start voting on whether to join the union. The factory is Volkswagen's North American electric-vehicle assembly hub, where the UAW narrowly lost union votes in 2014 and 2019. Workers at the plant will cast ballots from Wednesday through Friday evening.\nVolkswagen has said it respects the workers' right to vote on whether to join the UAW. But the governors who criticized the union drive said \"we do not need to pay a third party to tell us who can pick up a box or flip a switch,\" while also framing the campaign as a move to support President Joe Biden's reelection campaign.\nThe UAW, which has endorsed President Biden's reelection bid, declined to comment.\nThe UAW in the fall negotiated record contracts for 150,000 workers at General Motors, Ford and Chrysler-parent Stellantis, while some nonunion factories also subsequently announced pay increases for workers. After leading a six-week strike at the companies, UAW President Shawn Fain last fall vowed to organize nonunion companies across the industry, from foreign automakers with U.S. operations to electric vehicle makers like Tesla.\nIn November, VW gave workers an 11% pay raise at the Chattanooga plant, but the UAW said VW's pay still lags behind the Detroit automakers. Top assembly plant workers in Chattanooga make $32.40 per hour, VW said.\nThe UAW pacts with Detroit automakers included 25% pay raises by the time the contracts end in April of 2028. With cost-of-living increases, workers will see about 33% in raises for a top assembly wage of $42 per hour, plus annual profit sharing.\nThe union is also gaining ground in other southern states, with the UAW saying in February that a majority of workers at a Mercedes plant near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, have signed cards in support of joining the labor group.","rights":"cbsnews.com","rank":204,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Alain Sherter,Kate Gibson,Kate Gibson Is A Reporter","media":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/09/06/af0757ec-251d-11e3-9283-005056850598/thumbnail/1200x630/c53fc3916514c87e7fe6b618b92171db/en_0906_Strassmann.jpg?v=55c0f85ebcd2b956528d9c6f5a7e8871","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cbsmoneywatch","_score":5.670356,"_id":"d651a1f0deed5928e6495e5316714e09"}],"user_input":{"q":"Biden","search_in":["title_summary_en"],"lang":["en"],"not_lang":null,"countries":null,"not_countries":null,"from":"2024-04-15 00:00:00","to":null,"ranked_only":"True","from_rank":null,"to_rank":null,"sort_by":"relevancy","page":1,"size":100,"sources":["cbsnews.com"],"not_sources":[],"topic":null,"published_date_precision":null}}
