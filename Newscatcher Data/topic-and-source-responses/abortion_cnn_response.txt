Arizona for Abortion Access, a coalition of abortion rights advocates, has gathered more than 500,000 signatures to put a constitutional amendment on the November ballot that would protect abortion until fetal viability, which doctors believe is around 22 to 24 weeks.\nArizona Republicans have been under intense pressure to address abortion rights following last week's state Supreme Court decision, which revived an 1864 law that bans abortion except to save the life of the pregnant person and threatens doctors with two- to five-year prison sentences.\n'The document presents ideas drafted for internal discussion and consideration within the caucus,' House GOP Speaker Ben Toma said in a statement. 'I've publicly stated that we are looking at options to address this subject, and this is simply part of that.'\nThe memo suggests that one of the 'pros' of the strategy would be to make it 'more likely that the [Arizona for Abortion Access] Initiative will fail' due to the vote being split, Wilson wrote. One downside, she added, would be that the initiatives would 'transfe[r] regulation of abortion from the Legislature to voters.'\nThe ballot initiatives mentioned were part of a multiphase approach designed to either block the passage of the Arizona for Abortion Access initiative or protect lawmakers' ability to regulate abortion access.\nAbortion rights groups have had success with ballot initiatives put to voters since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The memo references several ballot initiatives abortion rights advocates are seeking to pass across the country, including the one in Arizona.\nArizona for Abortion Access blasted the draft strategy memo, calling it a political scheme designed to create chaos.\n'This shows yet again why Arizonans can't leave our most basic and personal rights in the hands of politicians,' the group said in a statement.\nIn the wake of the state Supreme Court decision last week, House Republicans gaveled out early to block Democrats from rolling back the ban. The legislature is scheduled to meet again on Wednesday.\nRepublicans in competitive races in the state, including former President Donald Trump and Senate candidate Kari Lake, have called on the GOP-led legislature to work with Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs on a fix.\nBut the proposal sent by Wilson would take Republicans down a different path. It argues Republicans should pursue a 'Phase One' and consider 'Phase Two' to change the 'narrative' and show the party has a 'plan,' as well as 'potentially pull votes from [Arizona for Abortion Access] Initiative.'\nUnder the proposed Phase 1, lawmakers would first add a measure to the November ballot that would allow lawmakers to regulate certain practices, including requiring parental consent or a court order for minors seeking abortions and only allowing physicians to perform the procedure, which would exist alongside the fetal viability amendment.\nUnder the proposed Phase 2, the legislature would refer the six-week ban and a second measure the memo describes as 'a 14-week law disguised as a 15-week law because it would only allow abortion until the beginning of the 15th week.'\nThe proposal also includes an alternative to Phase 2, under which lawmakers would refer a conditional enactment of the abortion rights ballot initiative, stating it is 'not absolute,' and allow for laws regulating abortion for reasons including the 'mitigation of fetal pain.'\nAny ballot initiative referred by the Republican-led legislature would not need the signature of Hobbs. But it's not clear if Republicans, who hold razor thin majorities in the state House and Senate, will have enough support to enact the plan laid out.\nThe memo, however, ends with a meme featuring talk show host Seth Meyers that says: 'Boom. Easy as that.'\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\nThis story has been updated with additional details.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Arit John,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-ap24102780914169.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":11.306322,"_id":"40cf742a7da099e0101bfbf76e0e8f6a"},{"title":"Reagan-era emergency health care law is the next abortion flashpoint at the Supreme Court","author":"Tierney Sneed","published_date":"2024-04-20 16:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/20/politics/abortion-supreme-court-idaho-emergency-care","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Two years after ending the national right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court will scrutinize one of the marquee efforts by the Biden administration to preserve abortion access\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Two years after ending the national right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court will scrutinize one of the marquee efforts by the Biden administration to preserve abortion access in the post-Roe v. Wade era.\nIn a case being heard by the court Wednesday, the Biden administration is challenging Idaho's enforcement of its abortion ban in medical emergencies, putting a spotlight on what has been one of the most politically explosive flashpoints in the aftermath of Roe's demise.\nThe Justice Department maintains that federal law requires hospitals to offer abortions if necessary to stabilize the health of emergency room patients, even in states like Idaho that ban that procedure. At the time the lawsuit was filed, Attorney General Merrick Garland characterized the case as part of the department's promise to 'work tirelessly to protect and advance reproductive freedom' in the wake of Roe's reversal.\nThe lawsuit has proceeded somewhat under the radar and has been overshadowed by the other blockbuster abortion case at the Supreme Court this year, concerning the federal regulations for abortion pills. Yet, the Idaho case could yield the most significant ruling from the court on abortion since the 2022 Roe reversal and one that could further elevate an issue Democrats want front and center in the 2024 election this November.\nIdaho argues that the Biden administration is trying to retrofit the federal law known as EMTALA \u2013 or the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act \u2013 to 'create a nationwide abortion mandate in hospital emergency rooms.'\nIdaho's abortion law has a narrow exemption for abortions provided to save a pregnant woman's life. However, the Justice Department argues that federal law overrides state abortion bans that prohibit emergency room doctors from offering the procedure to women whose pregnancies are causing medical emergencies that are not yet life-threatening.\n'Many pregnancy complications do not pose a threat to the woman's life when she arrives at the emergency room \u2013 but delaying care until necessary to prevent her death could allow her condition to deteriorate, placing her at risk of acute and long-term complications,' the Justice Department told the high court in a brief.\nAnti-abortion advocates meanwhile hope the Supreme Court will use the case to rebuke what they say is an unlawful Biden administration effort to undermine its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson, the ruling that overturned Roe.\n'This is an opportunity for the Supreme Court to push back against the Biden administration's campaign of massive resistance to the Dobbs decision,' said Roger Severino, a vice president of domestic policy for the conservative Heritage Foundation.\nA bipartisan Congress enacted EMTALA in 1986 to address the issue of 'patient dumping,' the practice by hospitals to refuse emergency room care to patients, often uninsured, in order to save costs.\nThe Justice Department sued Idaho under the law just over a month after the Supreme Court's Dobbs ruling cleared the way for the state to enact a strict abortion ban, and within weeks the administration secured a lower court order blocking Idaho's abortion ban in scenarios of medical emergencies. Until the order was put on pause by higher courts, including the Supreme Court, it was the rare example of a successful action the Biden administration was able to take to try to mitigate the effects of Roe's reversal.\nIt is also a case that highlights what has been a particularly troubling narrative for the anti-abortion movement post-Dobbs: that abortion bans \u2013 even those with ostensible life-of-the-mother exemptions \u2013 are putting the health of pregnant women in jeopardy.\n'Those stories are hugely sympathetic to the public, to voters,' said Gretchen Borchelt, the vice president for reproductive rights and health at the National Women's Law Center, which is supporting the Biden administration in the case. 'I think that crystallizes for people the fallout of the Dobbs decision in a way that nothing else is.'\nAbortion on the ballot in AZ this November\n03:25 - Source: CNN\n03:25 - Source: CNN John Bursch, the vice president of appellate advocacy for the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, which is Idaho's co-counsel in the case, told CNN that it was a 'scare tactic' to claim that Idaho's ban did not adequately protect women facing complications from their pregnancy, as he sought to distance the case from abortion politics.\n'Protecting the mother's life is always possible when that's the only choice that you have,' he said. 'So, this case really isn't about that. And it's really not even about abortion, although the other side is trying to make it about that.'\n(Health care providers in Idaho have said that in the few months that the abortion ban has been in effect, it has prevented them from providing abortions to patients who were suffering pregnancy complications causing them organ failure and other severe conditions \u2013 including conditions that would threaten their future fertility.)\nBursch framed the case around the question of 'whether EMTALA was an intentional attempt by the federal government to take control of the state practice of medicine.'\n'And no one ever thought that before Dobbs,' he said.\nIn the other major abortion case on the docket this term, a challenge brought by anti-abortion doctors to how the federal government has regulated the abortion drug known as mifepristone, the justices in oral arguments indicated they were leaning towards rejecting the case because the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the suit.\n'Even if they kick out the mifepristone case on standing, to decide to make it harder for people get emergency abortion care is going to have huge ramifications for voters,' Borchelt said.\nIn a troubling sign for the administration in this case, the Supreme Court paused lower court rulings that partially blocked Idaho's abortion ban and agreed to take up the case before the lower courts had fully considered it on the merits. There were no public dissents to those moves.\nThe case could turn on how the justices read the term 'unborn child' in EMTALA. The term is referenced multiple times in the law, which includes scenarios in its definition of medical emergencies where the health of an unborn child is in serious jeopardy and transfers of patients in labor that would put the safety of their unborn child at risk are restricted.\nThe references to the 'unborn child' were added by Congress in 1989 to make clear the EMTALA's protections applied to women who showed up to hospitals because they were in labor or facing other pregnancy-related medical emergencies.\nSupreme Court briefs filed by Idaho point to the language to argue that EMTALA's 'text demands equal treatment for \u2018the unborn child.''\n'To say that a statute that requires the protection of the unborn somehow requires doctors to take their lives in emergency rooms, it's just nonsensical,' Bursch told CNN.\nThe Charlotte Lozier Institute, an anti-abortion think tank, said in a friend-of-the-court brief that EMTALA 'expressly protects the lives of unborn children' and that it requires hospitals 'to follow the two-patient paradigm to protect both the mother and her unborn child.'\n'The United States' attempt to diminish the \u2018unborn child's' life as secondary\u2014one that must be protected only if her mother's health is not threatened but loses all value if her mother's health is in jeopardy\u2014is atextual,' the brief said. 'Congress expected hospitals and physicians to preserve both lives wherever possible.'\nIdaho's opponents counter that the provisions in question were meant to ensure that ER patients whose pregnancies were in medical trouble would receive treatment for those complications, even if the women themselves did not face serious risks to their health or possible death.\n'I think it's incredibly dangerous, the implications of what the argument Idaho is trying to push, with respect to the term and the use of the unborn child in the statute,' said Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, the deputy director of the Reproductive Freedom Project of the ACLU, which filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case.\nAbortion rights advocates fear that, beyond just the dispute over Idaho's abortion ban, the conservative majority will issue a ruling that will encourage the anti-abortion movement to take more aggressive steps in their push towards fetal personhood.\n'We have this case for the court where they are going to be talking about what the term \u2018unborn child' means. And so even though it's going to be specific to EMTALA, and its definition there, what we're going to see is anti-abortion folks seize on that, policymakers seize on what the court says,' said Borchelt of the National Women's Law Center.\nBursch said it was 'laughable' to claim the case, depending on the court rules, could lay groundwork for fetal personhood and framed the case as being more about states' authority to regulate medicine within their borders.\n'This case is about whether EMTALA regulates that state's practice of medicine and overrides Idahoans' choice to preserve life,' Bursch said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Tierney Sneed","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-1405450341.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":11.261494,"_id":"5b35401823d797769dac2d604989b30d"},{"title":"Germany should legalize abortion up to 12 weeks, government commission recommends","author":"Ivana Kottasov\u00e1","published_date":"2024-04-15 13:53:47","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/15/europe/germany-abortion-recommendation-intl","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Germany should legalise abortions up to 12 weeks of pregnancy, a panel of experts appointed by the government to draw up recommendations on the issue said on Monday.","summary":"Germany should overturn its 150-year old ban on abortions and make terminations legal within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, a government-appointed panel of experts said on Monday.\nThe Commission on Reproductive Self-Determination and Reproductive Medicine was set up by the German government last year after the coalition government of the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Greens and the Free Democrats pledged to scrap the current abortion law that makes terminations illegal.\nUnder the German criminal code, which dates back to 1871, abortions are technically illegal and punishable with up to three years in prison, although they are rarely prosecuted.\nThe procedure is de-criminalized up to 12 weeks of pregnancy, but anyone seeking a termination must attend a compulsory counselling session followed by a mandatory three-day waiting period.

The measures apply to employers with at least 15 workers unless the accommodations would cause 'undue hardship' for the employer.\nThe law provides pregnant and postpartum workers with a variety of protections, including time off for recovery from childbirth, prenatal or postnatal appointments and postpartum depression and accommodations related to seating, light duty, breaks for food, water and restroom needs, breastfeeding and miscarriage. Employers are not required to offer paid time off.\nThe question of including abortion in the act's definition of 'pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions' sparked a flurry of comments to the commission, with about 54,000 of them urging the commission to exclude abortion and about 40,000 comments asking to include it.\nThe agency noted in the rule that the law cannot be used to require a job-based health plan to pay for any procedure, including an abortion. It specified that the act is a workplace anti-discrimination law.\n'With respect to abortion, the PWFA's requirements are narrow and will likely concern only a request by a qualified employee for leave from work,' the commission said in a statement.\nThe final rule clarifies to employers and workers who is covered, what types of limitations and medical conditions are covered and how workers can ask for reasonable accommodations. It also provides many examples of accommodations and encourages employers and workers to communicate early and frequently about the requests.\nAdvocates have been fighting to improve federal protections for pregnant workers for more than a decade, saying that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act is inadequate and that most pregnancy-related conditions are not considered disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The US Chamber of Commerce was among the supporters of the law.\n'Today with these final rules, we have achieved a huge step forward for women's economic security, maternal health, and the economy as a whole,' Dina Bakst, co-president of A Better Balance, a national legal advocacy organization, said in a statement.

The party that best navigates these cultural battlefields is likely to prevail in November.\nEach party has an advantage, the Democrats on abortion and the Republicans on immigration. Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, energized generations of conservative voters who felt deeply on the issue but were also outraged that courts had taken the question out of the democratic process.\nNow, it's abortion rights voters who are energized, fueled by states like Arizona that are putting in place draconian restrictions on abortion. With the margins small in many swing states, abortion could be the issue that brings out suburban women, who could tilt those states blue in November.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook On the other hand, the Republican Party is now led by former President Donald Trump, who \u2014 on this issue as on many others \u2014 is supremely opportunistic. Trump, of course, proudly supported abortion rights for years until he started flirting with a political career within the Republican Party, at which point he reversed course fully.\nNow that he sees it is politically problematic, he is shifting his stance once again. He has criticized Arizona's abortion ban and has pledged not to sign a national abortion ban if re-elected.\nIt might seem hard for him to backtrack; he has loudly taken credit for the repeal of Roe v. Wade and touted his anti-abortion credentials. But Trump seems able to say anything, and even do anything, without losing the cult-like following he has with Republican voters. He can appeal to the middle ground, certain that his base will stay with him.\nPresident Joe Biden, on the other hand, does not have the fanatical following that Trump does. He has constructed a coalition carefully appealing to different groups with specific policies. If he loses one of those groups, his team fears that the math will not add up come Election Day.\nBut he needs to risk it and get tougher on immigration. It has become a proxy for all kinds of issues where people feel that elites simply don't get the concerns of average people. And the concern is rooted in real facts on the ground.\nThe US has taken in huge numbers of immigrants over the last five decades. In 1970, foreign-born people made up 5.7% of the country. As of 2020, that number was 15.3%. And it's not just America. In Sweden, that number went from 6.6% in 1970 to 19.8% in 2020; in the UK, from 5.3% to 13.8%. As I note in my new book, 'Age of Revolutions,' the Western world has seen a wave of unprecedented migration. Considering the numbers and the cultural diversity of the immigrants, people have been remarkably tolerant.\nIn both the EU and the United States, gangs and cartels have recognized that they can game the asylum system by bringing in migrants who are moving for economic reasons but who apply for asylum, claiming that they are being persecuted at home \u2014 and thus get the right to stay, have legal hearings and eventually work. Last fiscal year, nearly a million people applied for asylum in the US. In the EU last year, that number was more than 1.1 million.\nThe waves of recent migrants have produced problems as anyone on the ground can confirm, from New York City to El Paso to Stockholm. Sweden today is home to one of the highest gun crime death rates in Europe. And it is not a coincidence that its second largest political party is one that traces its roots to World War II-era fascism.\nThe Biden administration has made the case that it has put in place a set of well-crafted policies to limit asylum-seekers, that it needs Congressional action to do more and that Republicans want this problem to fester so that they can reap its electoral benefits. (They even tried to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on utterly bogus charges. The Democratic-majority Senate quickly put a stop to that effort.) All true.\nBut Biden must show he can fight. He should declare a national security emergency, send the National Guard to the border, work with Congress to suspend the asylum process and propose a new one that basically makes it impossible to get asylum if you just show up at the border. Many will scream, and it will all be challenged in court. But it will signal that Biden is taking the problem seriously.\nBill Clinton often says that the American people don't always need you to succeed, but they want to catch you trying. Joe Biden needs to be caught trying to solve the immigration crisis.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Fareed Zakaria","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2147862639-20240419041936989.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":10.481874,"_id":"33be269bd1502c81ff09c7985ae297d6"},{"title":"Fareed's take: Biden must show he's willing to fight on immigration","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-21 15:43:39","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2024/04/21/fareeds-take-gps-2024-election-abortion-immigration-digvid.cnn","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"On GPS with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, he shares his take on how the 2024 election will be defined by abortion and immigration.","summary":"On GPS with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, he shares his take on how the 2024 election will be defined by abortion and immigration.\nOn GPS with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, he shares his take on how the 2024 election will be defined by abortion and immigration.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/240421111033-fareeds-take-4-21-gps.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":10.29314,"_id":"b27abfcacfe325ce4b6a79f1593dd5be"},{"title":"Biden administration issues new rule to protect privacy of those seeking reproductive health care: \u2018No one should have to live in fear'","author":"Jacqueline Howard","published_date":"2024-04-22 17:22:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/22/health/biden-administration-new-rule-reproductive-health-care-privacy","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Patients have a right to privacy when it comes to their medical information, even when they travel to another state for an abortion, IVF, birth control or other types of reproductive health care,\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Patients have a right to privacy when it comes to their medical information, even when they travel to another state for an abortion, IVF, birth control or other types of reproductive health care, federal officials declared in a new rule.\nThe final rule, called HIPAA Privacy Rule to Support Reproductive Health Care Privacy, was announced Monday and prohibits the disclosure of a patient's health information as it relates to reproductive health care, as well as strengthens privacy protections for that patient, their family and their doctors who are providing or facilitating the care.\nThis means that the rule prevents medical records from being used against people for providing or receiving certain types of reproductive health care \u2014 even if a patient traveled to another state for that care, Melanie Fontes Rainer, director of the Office for Civil Rights, said in a news conference Monday.\n'This rule prohibits those regulated by HIPAA \u2014 health care providers, health plans, clearing houses and their business associates \u2014 from using or disclosing a person's protected health information to conduct an investigation into or impose liability on any person for merely seeking, obtaining, providing or facilitating lawful reproductive health care, including abortion,' Rainer said, referring to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.\n'If a person receives reproductive health care, such as a pregnancy test or treatment for an ectopic pregnancy, and that reproductive health care is lawful in the state where the care is received, the information about the care cannot be disclosed or used by the health care provider or health plan for an investigation, or to impose liability by law enforcement on the patient or the provider,' she said. 'And if the reproductive health care like contraception is protected, required or authorized by federal law, including the Constitution, that may also not be used or disclosed based on this rule.'\nOverall, 'no one should have to live in fear that their conversations with their doctor or that their medical claims data might be used to target or track them for seeking lawful reproductive health care,' Rainer said.\nLast year, the Office for Civil Rights published proposed changes to the HIPAA Privacy Rule and received nearly 30,000 comments from the public in response to what the final rule should involve, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services.\nNow, the final rule serves as one part of an ongoing effort by the Biden-Harris administration to protect access to reproductive health care after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n'Each and every American still has a right to their privacy, especially when it comes to their very private, very personal health information,' Becerra said Monday. 'Under federal law, you have rights to your privacy. That's what today is about \u2014 is making sure that Americans who convey very personal, private health information to a provider know that they have rights.'\nThe new rule comes at a time when 14 states have total abortion bans.\nFollowing the Supreme Court's June 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which eliminated a constitutional right to abortion nationwide, nearly two dozen US states have banned or limited access to the procedure. States where abortion is most limited report higher rates of maternal and infant mortality, as well as greater economic insecurity.\nMany patients living in states with abortion restrictions have had to travel to states without restrictions in order to receive care, Rainer said Monday.\nUnder the new rule, 'when a woman travels from one state where the care might be banned to another state to receive lawful reproductive health care, no matter what that healthcare is \u2014 whether it's a pill or it's a procedure or it's just a medical examination \u2014 when that woman goes home, her medical records will be protected,' Rainer said.\n'Herself, her providers, her home providers who literally had nothing to do with the care she received in the first instance, they will be protected, and they'll be able to say \u2018No, you cannot have this information,'' Rainer said. 'The provider in the state where she traveled will also be protected from folks reaching in to go after that type of medical care, which is one of the main goals of this rule \u2014 so that women can seek care, even in the face of the patchwork of laws we have now across the country.'\nThe fight over abortion continues in many state legislatures and courts. Most recently on April 9, Arizona's Supreme Court reinstated a 1864 law, rooted in the Civil War era, barring abortion in nearly all circumstances. The ruling, however, has been stayed for two weeks, and the current 15-week ban remains in place in the meantime.\nAdditionally, the US Supreme Court heard arguments in a case against the abortion pill in March and will hear a challenge to Idaho's near-total ban this week. In Florida, a six-week ban will replace the state's current 15-week ban on May 1.\nWhile the new final rule is one step in an effort to protect women's reproductive rights in the United States, Becerra said that it won't completely undo the effects that the overturning of Roe v. Wade has had on patients across the country.\n'We have no illusion that everything that the President has urged us to do with our authorities is going to undo Dobbs,' Becerra said. 'Dobbs took away rights. Until we have a national law that reinstitutes Roe v. Wade, we're going to have issues.'\nCNN's Annette Choi and Devan Cole contributed to this report.\nCNN's Annette Choi and Devan Cole contributed to this report.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"science","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jacqueline Howard,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1157018519.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":10.12898,"_id":"d99d48f728c57a671dcebca283e2af87"},{"title":"Analysis: Why Biden and Democrats are talking so much about freedom","author":"Ronald Brownstein","published_date":"2024-04-17 04:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/abortion-democrats-freedom-messaging","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration:\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration: 'This fight is about freedom, and the freedom that is fundamental to the promise of America.'\nIn a new abortion-focused ad that the Biden campaign aired in Arizona last week, President Joe Biden somberly asks: 'If Donald Trump gets back in power, what freedom will you lose next?'\nFor Biden, Harris and other Democrats to lean so heavily on the word 'freedom' in this campaign is a historic reversal of roles. At least since the New Deal 90 years ago, Republicans have been the party most likely to frame their agenda as advancing 'freedom' and 'liberty' while Democrats have more often emphasized ideas such as 'equality' and 'justice.'\nRepublicans haven't abandoned their rhetorical efforts to claim the terrain of freedom. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for instance, used the word almost as a mantra the past few years to denounce the restrictions many states imposed to fight the spread of Covid-19 and to attack what he calls the left's effort to impose 'woke ideology.' And Trump disparages Biden's agenda to promote the deployment of electric vehicles as an attempt to deny Americans' freedom to continue purchasing gas-powered cars and trucks.\nBut the GOP push at every level of government to roll back the 'rights revolution' of the past six decades \u2013 symbolized by the proliferation of red-state laws limiting access to abortion and potentially other reproductive health care such as IVF \u2013 has provided Democrats a historic opportunity to reverse the direction of this long-running debate, many analysts agree.\n'Historically, Republicans have rooted their philosophical world view in liberty: for them it's about freedom to own guns, to practice religion as they see fit' or reducing government taxes, spending and regulation, said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute, which studies the intersection of culture and politics. 'What's new is Democrats are using the term in ways to reimagine what freedom really means.'\nTransforming the debate over freedom may be especially crucial for Biden because polls consistently show Trump with a double-digit lead when voters are asked who they trust more to handle the economy. That means that to win the election Biden will need to convince a substantial number of voters who believe Trump is better for their bottom line to vote against him anyway. The interrelated issues revolving around rights, values and democracy likely offer the president his best chance to do so. 'If any issue' is going to flip voters who express more confidence in Trump on the economy, 'it is going to be social issues like abortion,' said Deckman.\nBiden signaled the central role freedom would play in his campaign messaging from the outset, in the video he released last year announcing his plan to seek reelection. As an ominous piano key trills behind images of the January 6, 2021, insurrection, abortion rights protesters and the White House, Biden opens the video with a stark declaration: 'Freedom. Personal freedom is fundamental to who we are as Americans. There's nothing more important. Nothing more sacred.' Later he says: 'The question we're facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer. I know what I want the answer to be, and I think you do too.'\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security.\nRoe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security. Harris, who has been the administration's point person in delivering the freedom message, has likewise cast an expansive net. When Harris delivered a Martin Luther King Day speech to the NAACP this year that summarized the administration's case for another term, she cited all the issues Biden did in the video and others, such as the restrictions several red states have imposed on the teaching of the nation's racial history and the right 'to live free from the horror of gun violence.'\nWay to Win, a liberal group that funds organizations and campaigns focusing on voters of color, has been pushing the party for several years to emphasize the freedom argument. Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, the group's vice president and chief strategy officer, says linking all these other issues to abortion is key to portraying Trump and his allies as a threat to freedom.\n'If [abortion] was the only thing, it would feel different than if you are able to tick off all these other things that they are doing and that they will do,' she said. 'We can even say it with other kinds of repro [rights]: We can say it with IVF, or now they are going to come for your contraception. Abortion is an entry point: because it is so visceral for people, it is a way to connect to a larger story about rights and freedoms.'\nLauren Hitt, a senior spokesperson for the Biden campaign, argued freedom will be a powerful message for the president because it resonates with a broad range of voters. 'It \u2026 speaks to the values of traditional Republican voters, [Nikki] Haley primary voters, and suburban voters \u2013 as well as to our base who believe deeply that the government shouldn't be making personal decisions for people,' she said. 'It's a uniquely powerful idea grounded in traditional democratic values that will be critical in winning the swing voters we need to win in November.'\nThe Trump campaign pushed back on Biden's ad asking which freedom Trump would take away next. 'Under Joe Biden, Americans are less free, less safe, and less prosperous,' Karoline Leavitt, the campaign's national spokesperson, said in a statement.\nDaniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that broad changes in societal attitudes have encouraged both parties to emphasize their commitments to personal freedom. 'Each side recognizes this is something people care about,' Cox said. 'It's effective language at a time when we are increasingly individualistic. We are not as inclined to be communitarian and oriented toward the concerns of others. So I think it's not a surprise that we're seeing both political parties try to employ this language to their advantage.'\nEven with all the increased Democratic emphasis on protecting rights, Cox said, the issue remains 'contested ground' that can favor either party depending on how it is framed. While Republicans have been 'on their heels' defending abortion restrictions such as last week's Arizona ruling, he said, the party has benefited in other races from positioning itself as defending 'parent's rights,' as Republican Glenn Youngkin did while winning the Virginia governorship in 2021. (It's notable that when abortion rights and parental rights collided in the 2023 Virginia state legislative elections, Democrats stressing the former won control of both chambers over Republicans emphasizing the latter.)\nPolling suggests the public remains split over which party it trusts to defend basic rights and freedoms. To begin with, Democrats and Republicans hold very different priorities over which rights are most important to protect, PRRI found in unpublished national polling shared exclusively with CNN. In that survey, conducted late last year, Republicans were most likely to say their freedom to own guns, to practice their religion and to speak their mind was growing more restricted; Democrats were most likely to say that they were losing the freedom to control their own body. 'The parties are talking past each other,' Deckman said. 'Freedom is a word that is quintessentially American, but it depends on what freedoms you are referring to in the first place.'\nThe public returned a similar split verdict last fall in an NBC poll that asked voters which party they trusted more to handle different issues. In the poll, Democrats held a commanding 18 percentage point advantage on dealing with abortion. But when asked which party they trusted more on 'protecting our constitutional rights,' voters preferred Republicans by a margin of 43% to 35%. Even White women, who strongly preferred Democrats on abortion, split evenly over which party they trusted on the broader question of preserving core constitutional rights.\nThat GOP advantage may reflect the traditional political dynamic that conservative voters have been more likely than liberals to believe their rights are under siege and to view government actions as a threat to their liberty. In 2022 polling by Penn State University's McCourtney Institute for Democracy, Republicans were twice as likely as Democrats to say that they had lost rights and freedoms over the past decade. Republicans were also considerably more likely, though not by as lopsided a margin, to predict that they would lose more rights than they gain over the next decade.\nThe real-world consequence of that imbalance was on display in the 2016 presidential campaign, when Democratic-leaning voters largely shrugged about Hillary Clinton's warnings that a Trump victory would allow him to move the Supreme Court to the right in a way that would threaten basic rights, like abortion.\nChris Wilson, a GOP pollster who worked for the super PAC supporting DeSantis in the 2024 campaign, said the Penn State polling suggests that Biden still will face difficulty mobilizing key elements of the Democratic coalition with a message about rights and freedoms. He noted that such groups as Generation Z, Blacks and Latinos were much less likely than college-educated Whites or Republicans to express fears in the poll that they would lose rights in the decade ahead.\n'To whatever extent the Democrats are trying to make a rights argument, it's not as worrying to the youth and to minorities as it is to Whites, people with college degrees, and Boomers,' Wilson said. 'Biden's \u2018rights' argument might be a big hit with his peers, but might be the wrong note to strike if he wants to hold onto the parts of the Democratic coalition that are starting to look shaky.'\nBut the Penn State polling was conducted before the Dobbs decision ended the nationwide right to abortion. And many analysts believe that seismic shift has increased the relevance of questions revolving around rights and freedoms to key groups that Democrats rely on \u2013 with younger women especially focused on these threats. While Republicans traditionally responded more to these arguments, Deckman said, 'These times certainly have made freedom a more accessible, even an existential, issue for people on the left.'\nFernandez Ancona agrees to an extent with both Wilson and Deckman. The 2022 elections, she said, demonstrated how strongly many people react to the risk of losing rights they believed had been settled. 'When these things you take for granted are taken away in this very stark way, it's incredibly motivating,' she said. But she also believes that Democrats need to tie their case about defending personal freedom into a broader message that portrays the 2024 election less as a personal choice between Trump and Biden than as a fundamental crossroads over America's future priorities that will shape not only personal liberties but also economic opportunity.\n'We have to get people to shift their thinking about how this is a choice between two different futures,' she said. 'It can get people out of this one-to-one candidate-to- candidate [comparison] and asking, \u2018what I like, what I don't like' about Trump or Biden.'\nFor libertarians, the escalating struggle between Biden and Republicans over the idea of freedom is a source of both bemusement and frustration. Libertarians take a purist position that advocates for minimal government intervention in both personal behavior and the economy; they usually find Republicans deficient on the first count, and Democrats on the second.\nDavid Boaz, a distinguished senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, sees those flaws in both Biden and Trump. The Biden administration, Boaz said, is 'very big on reproductive freedom, and very big on a lot of aspects of LGBTQ freedom, but beyond those things, where's the freedom in the Biden-Harris plan?' And while Trump talks about promoting economic freedom by cutting taxes and regulation, Boaz continued, Republicans have also undermined such freedom by promoting high tariffs and using government policy to punish companies they disfavor, as DeSantis did with Disney in Florida.\nBut while Boaz believes both Biden and Trump have imperfect records when it comes to promoting freedom, he thinks one issue breaks the tie between them: Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election. \ufeff'I have friends who say Biden is the biggest spender ever and he's regulating and he's woke and how can anyone consider voting for him over Trump?' Boaz said.\n'And I'll say that one reason is that Biden has not tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power. That's a very fundamental issue. You can add up all these [other] issues and weigh them. But the big freedom issue that Biden has over Trump,' Boaaz added, 'is that Trump tried to steal an election.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Ronald Brownstein","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bc56ff7a-5e96-468d-93c1-418068e7e891.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":10.0201645,"_id":"81dbae72a82253d6374c4fc6129317ab"},{"title":"Why Biden and Democrats are talking so much about freedom","author":"Ronald Brownstein","published_date":"2024-04-17 04:00:25","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/abortion-democrats-freedom-messaging/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration:\u2026","summary":"When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration: 'This fight is about freedom, and the freedom that is fundamental to the promise of America.'\nIn a new abortion-focused ad that the Biden campaign aired in Arizona last week, President Joe Biden somberly asks: 'If Donald Trump gets back in power, what freedom will you lose next?'\nFor Biden, Harris and other Democrats to lean so heavily on the word 'freedom' in this campaign is a historic reversal of roles.

Ron DeSantis, for instance, used the word almost as a mantra the past few years to denounce the restrictions many states imposed to fight the spread of Covid-19 and to attack what he calls the left's effort to impose 'woke ideology.' And Trump disparages Biden's agenda to promote the deployment of electric vehicles as an attempt to deny Americans' freedom to continue purchasing gas-powered cars and trucks.\nBut the GOP push at every level of government to roll back the 'rights revolution' of the past six decades \u2013 symbolized by the proliferation of red-state laws limiting access to abortion and potentially other reproductive health care such as IVF \u2013 has provided Democrats a historic opportunity to reverse the direction of this long-running debate, many analysts agree.\n'Historically, Republicans have rooted their philosophical world view in liberty: for them it's about freedom to own guns, to practice religion as they see fit' or reducing government taxes, spending and regulation, said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute, which studies the intersection of culture and politics. 'What's new is Democrats are using the term in ways to reimagine what freedom really means.'\nTransforming the debate over freedom may be especially crucial for Biden because polls consistently show Trump with a double-digit lead when voters are asked who they trust more to handle the economy. That means that to win the election Biden will need to convince a substantial number of voters who believe Trump is better for their bottom line to vote against him anyway. The interrelated issues revolving around rights, values and democracy likely offer the president his best chance to do so. 'If any issue' is going to flip voters who express more confidence in Trump on the economy, 'it is going to be social issues like abortion,' said Deckman.\nBiden signaled the central role freedom would play in his campaign messaging from the outset, in the video he released last year announcing his plan to seek reelection. As an ominous piano key trills behind images of the January 6, 2021, insurrection, abortion rights protesters and the White House, Biden opens the video with a stark declaration: 'Freedom. Personal freedom is fundamental to who we are as Americans. There's nothing more important. Nothing more sacred.' Later he says: 'The question we're facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer. I know what I want the answer to be, and I think you do too.'\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security.\nRoe v.

But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security. Harris, who has been the administration's point person in delivering the freedom message, has likewise cast an expansive net. When Harris delivered a Martin Luther King Day speech to the NAACP this year that summarized the administration's case for another term, she cited all the issues Biden did in the video and others, such as the restrictions several red states have imposed on the teaching of the nation's racial history and the right 'to live free from the horror of gun violence.'\nWay to Win, a liberal group that funds organizations and campaigns focusing on voters of color, has been pushing the party for several years to emphasize the freedom argument. Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, the group's vice president and chief strategy officer, says linking all these other issues to abortion is key to portraying Trump and his allies as a threat to freedom.\n'If [abortion] was the only thing, it would feel different than if you are able to tick off all these other things that they are doing and that they will do,' she said. 'We can even say it with other kinds of repro [rights]: We can say it with IVF, or now they are going to come for your contraception. Abortion is an entry point: because it is so visceral for people, it is a way to connect to a larger story about rights and freedoms.'\nLauren Hitt, a senior spokesperson for the Biden campaign, argued freedom will be a powerful message for the president because it resonates with a broad range of voters. 'It \u2026 speaks to the values of traditional Republican voters, [Nikki] Haley primary voters, and suburban voters \u2013 as well as to our base who believe deeply that the government shouldn't be making personal decisions for people,' she said. 'It's a uniquely powerful idea grounded in traditional democratic values that will be critical in winning the swing voters we need to win in November.'\nThe Trump campaign pushed back on Biden's ad asking which freedom Trump would take away next. 'Under Joe Biden, Americans are less free, less safe, and less prosperous,' Karoline Leavitt, the campaign's national spokesperson, said in a statement.\nDaniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that broad changes in societal attitudes have encouraged both parties to emphasize their commitments to personal freedom. 'Each side recognizes this is something people care about,' Cox said. 'It's effective language at a time when we are increasingly individualistic. We are not as inclined to be communitarian and oriented toward the concerns of others. So I think it's not a surprise that we're seeing both political parties try to employ this language to their advantage.'\nEven with all the increased Democratic emphasis on protecting rights, Cox said, the issue remains 'contested ground' that can favor either party depending on how it is framed. While Republicans have been 'on their heels' defending abortion restrictions such as last week's Arizona ruling, he said, the party has benefited in other races from positioning itself as defending 'parent's rights,' as Republican Glenn Youngkin did while winning the Virginia governorship in 2021. (It's notable that when abortion rights and parental rights collided in the 2023 Virginia state legislative elections, Democrats stressing the former won control of both chambers over Republicans emphasizing the latter.)\nPolling suggests the public remains split over which party it trusts to defend basic rights and freedoms. To begin with, Democrats and Republicans hold very different priorities over which rights are most important to protect, PRRI found in unpublished national polling shared exclusively with CNN. In that survey, conducted late last year, Republicans were most likely to say their freedom to own guns, to practice their religion and to speak their mind was growing more restricted; Democrats were most likely to say that they were losing the freedom to control their own body. 'The parties are talking past each other,' Deckman said. 'Freedom is a word that is quintessentially American, but it depends on what freedoms you are referring to in the first place.'\nThe public returned a similar split verdict last fall in an NBC poll that asked voters which party they trusted more to handle different issues. In the poll, Democrats held a commanding 18 percentage point advantage on dealing with abortion. But when asked which party they trusted more on 'protecting our constitutional rights,' voters preferred Republicans by a margin of 43% to 35%. Even White women, who strongly preferred Democrats on abortion, split evenly over which party they trusted on the broader question of preserving core constitutional rights.\nThat GOP advantage may reflect the traditional political dynamic that conservative voters have been more likely than liberals to believe their rights are under siege and to view government actions as a threat to their liberty. In 2022 polling by Penn State University's McCourtney Institute for Democracy, Republicans were twice as likely as Democrats to say that they had lost rights and freedoms over the past decade. Republicans were also considerably more likely, though not by as lopsided a margin, to predict that they would lose more rights than they gain over the next decade.\nThe real-world consequence of that imbalance was on display in the 2016 presidential campaign, when Democratic-leaning voters largely shrugged about Hillary Clinton's warnings that a Trump victory would allow him to move the Supreme Court to the right in a way that would threaten basic rights, like abortion.\nChris Wilson, a GOP pollster who worked for the super PAC supporting DeSantis in the 2024 campaign, said the Penn State polling suggests that Biden still will face difficulty mobilizing key elements of the Democratic coalition with a message about rights and freedoms. He noted that such groups as Generation Z, Blacks and Latinos were much less likely than college-educated Whites or Republicans to express fears in the poll that they would lose rights in the decade ahead.\n'To whatever extent the Democrats are trying to make a rights argument, it's not as worrying to the youth and to minorities as it is to Whites, people with college degrees, and Boomers,' Wilson said. 'Biden's \u2018rights' argument might be a big hit with his peers, but might be the wrong note to strike if he wants to hold onto the parts of the Democratic coalition that are starting to look shaky.'\nBut the Penn State polling was conducted before the Dobbs decision ended the nationwide right to abortion. And many analysts believe that seismic shift has increased the relevance of questions revolving around rights and freedoms to key groups that Democrats rely on \u2013 with younger women especially focused on these threats. While Republicans traditionally responded more to these arguments, Deckman said, 'These times certainly have made freedom a more accessible, even an existential, issue for people on the left.'\nFernandez Ancona agrees to an extent with both Wilson and Deckman. The 2022 elections, she said, demonstrated how strongly many people react to the risk of losing rights they believed had been settled. 'When these things you take for granted are taken away in this very stark way, it's incredibly motivating,' she said. But she also believes that Democrats need to tie their case about defending personal freedom into a broader message that portrays the 2024 election less as a personal choice between Trump and Biden than as a fundamental crossroads over America's future priorities that will shape not only personal liberties but also economic opportunity.\n'We have to get people to shift their thinking about how this is a choice between two different futures,' she said. 'It can get people out of this one-to-one candidate-to- candidate [comparison] and asking, \u2018what I like, what I don't like' about Trump or Biden.'\nFor libertarians, the escalating struggle between Biden and Republicans over the idea of freedom is a source of both bemusement and frustration. Libertarians take a purist position that advocates for minimal government intervention in both personal behavior and the economy; they usually find Republicans deficient on the first count, and Democrats on the second.\nDavid Boaz, a distinguished senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, sees those flaws in both Biden and Trump. The Biden administration, Boaz said, is 'very big on reproductive freedom, and very big on a lot of aspects of LGBTQ freedom, but beyond those things, where's the freedom in the Biden-Harris plan?' And while Trump talks about promoting economic freedom by cutting taxes and regulation, Boaz continued, Republicans have also undermined such freedom by promoting high tariffs and using government policy to punish companies they disfavor, as DeSantis did with Disney in Florida.\nBut while Boaz believes both Biden and Trump have imperfect records when it comes to promoting freedom, he thinks one issue breaks the tie between them: Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election. \ufeff'I have friends who say Biden is the biggest spender ever and he's regulating and he's woke and how can anyone consider voting for him over Trump?' Boaz said.\n'And I'll say that one reason is that Biden has not tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power. That's a very fundamental issue. You can add up all these [other] issues and weigh them. But the big freedom issue that Biden has over Trump,' Boaaz added, 'is that Trump tried to steal an election.'","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Ronald Brownstein,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/bc56ff7a-5e96-468d-93c1-418068e7e891.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":10.011537,"_id":"29d5ef176fd69a8b984c85be46f5d200"},{"title":"Former Marine sentenced to 9 years in prison for firebombing of California Planned Parenthood clinic","author":"Taylor Romine","published_date":"2024-04-16 01:17:58","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/15/politics/planned-parenthood-attack-former-marine-sentenced","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"A former marine who used a Molotov cocktail to firebomb a Planned Parenthood clinic in Costa Mesa, California, was sentenced to nine years in prison Monday, according to the Justice Department.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 A former marine who used a Molotov cocktail to firebomb a Planned Parenthood clinic in Costa Mesa, California, was sentenced to nine years in prison Monday, according to the Justice Department.\nChance Brannon \u2014 along with his co-defendant Tibet Ergul \u2014 attacked the Planned Parenthood clinic and conspired to plot attacks with Ergul and co-defendant Xavier Batten, including a potential attack on a power grid, in 'furtherance of a race war,' the Justice Department said in a news release.

New York CNN \u2014\nNew York CNN \u2014 Eight years ago, when North Carolina tried regulate how transgender people use public bathrooms, Corporate America revolted.\nPayPal scrapped a planned expansion of one of its operations in the state. Musicians canceled performances. And the NCAA said it wouldn't let North Carolina host championships while the law was on the books. All in, the boycott cost the state's economy around $4 billion, according to an analysis by the Associated Press, which noted its tally was likely an underestimation.\nLately, though, Corporate America doesn't have the same stomach for a culture war.\nLast year, at least 510 anti-LGBTQ bills were introduced in US state legislatures \u2014 a new record, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, and nearly three times the number of such bills introduced in 2022. Nearly two dozen states have either banned or severely curtailed abortion rights since Roe v. Wade was overturned two years ago.\nWhile corporate giants from a range of industries pledged to provide support and financial assistance for employees seeking abortion care, few are wading into that political conversation with the kind of fervor we've seen on other issues in the recent past.\nThere doesn't appear to be a single, unified theory for why that's the case. Perhaps businesses were willing to take more risks in a zero-interest-rate environment, when their stocks were riding high and customers were unfazed by inflation. Perhaps the payoff of past progressive campaigns proved too costly in a deeply polarized country \u2014 no brand wants to be the next Bud Light.\nAnother possibility: Customers and businesses simply have outrage fatigue, says Cait Lamberton, professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.\n'People can only stay enraged for so long,' Lamberton told me. 'We are actually very good at adapting to psychological discomfort. Very quickly, our rationalization mechanisms kick in, and we are able to find a way to reframe the actions of a brand, or our own actions, in ways that don't create massive internal conflict.'\nI spoke to Lamberton about the changing winds of corporate activism and the dilemma leaders find themselves in.\nThe following interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nThe following interview has been edited for length and clarity.

And that idea is that every brand needs to have a social and ideological purpose. For at least six years, we saw pretty strong numbers related to people's interest in brand activism.\nConsumers wanted not only to have their own personal needs met, but for brands to more generally provide value to society as a whole. But in the last few years, we've seen that position softening.\nSince 2016, we've had anger about politics. We've had anger about Ukraine, about abortion rights, the list goes on. And it's not a place where most people can stay for extended periods of time.\nNightcap: It felt like we'd come full circle a year ago, when Bud Light angered some folks by partnering with a trans social media influencer.

When people get into a room, it's very easy to start thinking that they represent the rest of the world. 'Brand purpose' often takes an internal turn, so it comes to be defined by what the employees and the leadership believe in. But if you lose sight of your customer, you can make huge mistakes.\nSo, I think there was a disconnect there, which isn't to say that all Bud Light drinkers were anti-trans. But there may have been a vocal segment that was going to respond negatively.\nThe other thing that they did that caused some problems is that they backed off from it. Bud Light took a position that had a cost, and then they immediately ran away when they realized the cost, and that added insult to injury.\nThere certainly were ways that aligning with a historically excluded population could benefit the brand. But you can't do it without anticipating the potential effects.\nNightcap: So are we just reverting back to the old model of shareholder capitalism, everything focused on the bottom line and steering clear of politics?\nNightcap: So are we just reverting back to the old model of shareholder capitalism, everything focused on the bottom line and steering clear of politics?

On one hand, they can choose to be an activist about something that won't harm them, and shareholders should like that.\nThe problem is that when there's no cost, it's not seen as credible. So on the other hand, you can take an activist stance that has a cost, and then some stakeholders are going to be mad at you for doing so.\nBrands' hesitation may be quite rational in that they're caught between these two poles \u2014 do we do something costless, that will not make any difference? Or do we do something costly and risk creating real damage, not only to our bottom line, but also potentially alienating some of our consumers?\nIt's not an easy decision to make.\nNightcap: When Georgia had restrictive voting bills on the ballot in 2021, a bunch of companies, including Coca Cola and Delta, spoke out about it.

Corporations directly affect the environment with the products they make. They directly affect pay equity. They can directly affect gun-related issues. But they don't have a direct connection to abortion. The only way that they can do anything is by guaranteeing reproductive rights for their employees. Probably the best thing that corporations could do is give people voting day off.\nNightcap: Have we seen this play before?

But she made sure everyone heard the line she's come up with: 'Trump abortion bans.'\nAnd not one pro-Palestinian protester interrupted her that day, or, for that matter, over her four-day campaign swing West.\nThe vice president is clearly feeling energized these days. She is more engaged. She is looser. Aides say she was the one who pushed to explicitly call out former President Donald Trump as responsible for every rollback in abortion rights, and she is clearly feeding on the old prosecutorial rush of tearing apart the opposition's argument.\nIn a conference room in the back of a campaign office in a Las Vegas strip mall, Harris said she is finding the last few months, on the attack and able to zero in on the contrast with Trump, 'very liberating.'\n'You can't forget that for the first probably year and a half, we were landlocked. It was basically me and Joe and a Zoom screen,' she told CNN, in an exclusive interview at the end of the multiday campaign swing, built in part around getting her to battlegrounds Arizona and Nevada, and around what staff has found to be helpful downtime back home in Los Angeles cooking Sunday dinner. 'Being out and being able to just have real conversations and not soundbites in an interview \u2014 it is liberating.'\nNo one in the vice president's orbit, including Harris herself, needs to be reminded how the disappointment and disenchantment from her first years on the job still hang over her, or how odd it is that some voters say in interviews with CNN and outside focus groups they are inclined toward Biden but are turned off by Harris.\nCNN's conversations with two dozen aides to the vice president, the reelection campaign and other top Democrats also show the paradox that even the most Biden-centric aides have been forced to grudgingly admit: There is another swath of voters turned off by the president \u2014 and their internal data shows Harris will be critical to getting them if Biden wants to win a second term.\nAfter years of being shunted to politically toxic and fruitless parts of the administration portfolio, such as overseeing migration negotiations with Central American leaders, or clearly junior varsity ones like chairing the National Space Council, these days are so full of plum assignments for Harris that her trip to Arizona was originally supposed to be to promote the latest round of student loan debt cancellation \u2014 only to get quickly changed when the state Supreme Court ruled that Arizona must adhere to its 1864 abortion ban.\n'She has been front and center on so many of the most politically potent issues right now,' said Julie Chavez Rodriguez, who was a top aide to Harris for years before becoming the Biden reelection campaign manager, calling these 'new opportunities to speak to the coalitions we know she already has a deep affinity to, but on issues that are top of mind for those voters.'\n'As a former prosecutor, she can prosecute the case on so much,' Rodriguez said.\nIt means getting to talk about gun control and reaching out to younger voters like the gym full of high schoolers in Vegas who cheered even more loudly for her than they did when Marvel actress Xochitl Gomez took the stage first. ('She's killing it!' an excited 15-year-old in a Barbie-pink denim jacket exclaimed after pushing up to take a photo with Harris as Aretha Franklin's 'Respect' played on the speakers.)\nWhile Biden talks about threats to democracy, Harris talks about 'freedom' under assault \u2014 a way of thinking that she said feels rooted in her life and in the lives of the voters she is after. It's the stories she used to tell about being taken to civil rights protests when she was in her stroller. It's showing up at the Cow Palace in San Francisco when she was district attorney to join the chants to close the 'gun show loophole' \u2014 as Biden did earlier this month in a new action to crack down on buyers at gun shows avoiding background checks.\n'I grew up the child of parents who fought for civil rights and freedoms,' she said, 'so this really does cut at the core for me around what's important about our country and what's at stake in the country.'\nMore often these days, she's invoking the 'prosecutor for president' framing that defined her own presidential campaign more than four years ago. She likes facts, she says. She likes using them to show she is right and has been right all along about what she says Trump is after.\n'The prosecutor approach is really about just deconstructing an issue,' she said. 'It's presenting and reminding folks about the empirical evidence that shows us exactly how we arrived at this point. \u2026 He can't hide from this stuff.'\nJust before coming on stage in Arizona, Harris and a few aides scrambled to add in a line to go right at what Trump had said minutes before \u2014 that the US Supreme Court's Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade is 'working the way it is supposed to.'\nDobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade is 'working the way it is supposed to.' 'Here's what a second Trump term looks like: More bans, more suffering and less freedom,' she told those gathered in Tucson, warning a national abortion ban and restrictions on abortion medications loom.\n'Shame! Shame! Shame!' the crowd started chanting.\nBy that evening, at a $1.5 million fundraiser in 'Family Guy' creator Seth MacFarlane's tree-filled living room in a Beverly Hills house with a 360-degree view of Los Angeles, and then in front of a luncheon for Black women in power the next day, she had started building that into a pursed lip, lowered voice Trump impression of her own, mocking the former president as saying, 'Well, you know, the states will do what they want to do.'\nDuring her own run for president, Harris was often derided as having no core and just chasing situational politics. By the end of the swing through Nevada, she was the one coming at Trump for being a weathervane on even the most fundamental issues of belief and politics.\n'It's not as though he has any real explanation. There's a lot of what he's doing that is just to suggest that he took a different tact,' she said of Trump's shifting arguments about whether and when to have abortion bans. 'There's a lot of benefit to being unburdened by ideology.'\nHarris' small staff has struggled since her inauguration to keep up with a scrutiny no previous vice president has faced, so even with the significantly stepped-up travel schedule these days, they have been grateful for help from new campaign hires in fielding press requests or just handling event logistics.\nFor the candidate herself, the shift has been more existential.\nBiden's personality fit the unstructured ambiguity of the modern vice presidency. He could be the presidential adviser, or the chummy cheerleader schmoozing hours after the conversations were scheduled to end.\nNot Harris. She likes a plan. She thrives with a goal. Left to her own, people who know her and were sometimes involved say she often let a small circle of friends and advisers into her head, getting into agonizing spirals of what else she should be doing, but also why she wasn't doing more, but also what would happen if she did try to do more.\nThree years of telling Harris she was supposed to establish herself led to more stress over what that could mean more than any actual progress.\n'It took me way longer than two years how to figure out how to be a good United States senator, and her job is a lot harder than mine,' said Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a longtime leader on the gun safety movement who has often talked about how engaged he has found Harris to be. 'There's no doubt she's better at the job today than she was in Year 1.'\nRunning for vice president has the definition that being vice president lacks. It's tactics, strategy, a target, a goal. Given a mission, aides have found Harris to be an extremely effective performance player, whether pressuring interest group leaders dragging their feet to support Biden or helping deliver the battlegrounds where she is shining more.\n'What business do we need to accomplish?' is a line Harris tends to use and that staff have learned to use themselves to prod her.\nWith Harris hyperaware of the filters she believes go over her every word and move, aides know better than to use the phrase 'attack dog' in a planning meeting with her. She won't risk being seen as an angry Black woman. She won't be the traditional running mate all-purpose battering ram.\nAt her first event in Las Vegas last week, Harris asked students to raise their hands if they were ever in an active shooter drill; dozens of hands went up. She told them about the blood stains on the floor and abandoned valentines still strewn around the preserved Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School she toured in Parkland, Florida, last month, and about a student from another school who confided that she didn't like going to fifth period because there was no closet in that room to hide in.\nHarris has a way of telling stories like these that spark audible reactions of shock and outrage from the crowd. She did it there, and again an hour later while talking about abortion, decrying how having no exception for rape is 'immoral,' resulting in a survivor of 'violence to their body \u2014 that they don't have the right to determine what happens to their body next.'\n'There's a certain level of authority that comes with having a uterus and being a woman,' said New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, praising how Harris has been leading the charge for the administration on reproductive rights.\n'They have the potential to tell a really interesting story and vision that connects with younger people, but there's a long way to go from here to there,' said John Della Volpe, a pollster who specializes in younger voters and is not affiliated with the reelection campaign. 'She can translate that in a more emotional and evocative way that resonates with young people.'\nFor Harris, it's at least the feeling, for the first time in a long time, of standing up and standing out on her own. These days, Trump campaign aides don't talk much about her, despite past Republicans' attempts to make her a liability for Biden. But she's eager to take on whoever Trump picks as his own running mate.\n'I am ready,' she threw down, 'for whoever has the, fill in the blank, to do it.'\nFor all the efforts, the campaign and Harris' own staff still aren't quite sure what people make of her. In the last few months, they invested in asking voters about her, including having the Democratic National Committee pay for focus groups in Milwaukee run by an operative who has long worked for her.\nThe bad news: Several people said Harris rubs them the wrong way, in all the ways that are familiar from criticism of her. A few specifically cited her laugh \u2014 a frequent target of Republican operatives who flood clips of it on social media, which defenders say plays into sexism.\nThe good news, as described to CNN by several people familiar with the findings: People said they would much rather hear from Harris than Biden on abortion, guns, student loans and Gaza.\nMultiple people asked said they didn't think Harris had been treated well. They questioned whether Biden actually likes her.\nHarris has internalized skepticism about campaign data \u2014 'I give polls only so much credit,' she said in the interview \u2014 but around her, the responses were validation of years of grumbling that Biden should have been better setting up his heir apparent, and that perhaps they are now both in danger of paying the price.\nYet the rivalry still bubbles up. Some Biden aides greeted the findings with frustration, annoyed by the suggestion that the president will need to lean on her more. Questions about where Harris is more resonant immediately lead Biden aides to stress that they are complementary components of the campaign, and that the president, not her, is the one who can do things like go to Pittsburgh to propose new tariffs on Chinese steel.\nHarris has integrated so much into the work of the administration that Air Force Two sat on the tarmac for an hour recently, delaying a campaign-geared trip to North Carolina as she listened in on Biden's call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which she has done without public announcement throughout the Israel-Hamas war.\nBut in a March speech in Alabama, Harris called for 'an immediate ceasefire,' waited for applause, and only then added, 'for at least the next six weeks' to get the Israeli hostages out of Gaza. West Wing aides fumed both at the noticeable pause \u2014 even though the position was the same as Biden's \u2014 and at hearing that Harris' aides had alerted reporters ahead of time that they should watch the speech.\nLikewise, when CNN reported in February that Harris had been holding private meetings with top Democratic officials to discuss campaign strategy, top Biden aides spread word to several who attended that they had not realized these were happening.\n'There's so many ways in which they are able to complement one another and speak to our core audiences from different perspectives that reinforce who we are as a campaign and as an administration at this unique moment in time,' said Rodriguez, the Biden campaign manager.\nThe solution for Harris, aides believe, is exposure. Though many leading Democrats think she'd have a hard path to a future presidential nomination, aides believe they can at least boost her numbers by getting her out more.\nBut the day job still gets in the way. A long-anticipated appearance on Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show was postponed last week, according to people familiar, rather than risking a setback to being taken seriously by laughing it up on a comedy show in the midst of a crisis.\nWith under 200 days until the election, they are not sure when she will get back.\nShe's already scripted some bits, though.\nWhen MacFarlane asked her at the fundraiser who her favorite Trump is, she knew the question was coming. No purposeful pause this time.\n'Alec Baldwin,' she shot back.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,Edward-Isaac Dovere","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2147839782.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":8.424096,"_id":"b5307d80194ea2d7c06c3c8dd6dfd957"},{"title":"Promises Joe Biden has made so far in his campaign for a second term","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-20 13:13:05","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/04/politics/biden-campaign-promises-dg","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"The president has made a number of promises on the campaign trail. Here are some of the policies Biden says he would enact if elected for a second term.","summary":"President Joe Biden's main pitch to voters ahead of November is simple: They should vote for him because he is not Donald Trump. In speeches and political events since his reelection campaign began in earnest earlier this year, Biden had said that his second term would essentially be a continuation of his first: 'Let's finish this job,' Biden said in a video announcing his reelection campaign last year. In making his case to voters, Biden has contrasted his own ideas of governance with Trump's stated plans to drastically alter how the federal government works, how executive power would be used and how America's role on the world stage will change if the former president wins a second term. Biden, meanwhile, has promised to protect American democracy, pass a federal law to codify the right to an abortion into law, preserve the country's international alliances and agreements and deliver on climate benchmarks. His ability to deliver on these promises even if he wins a second term, though, is not a certainty. Many of his more lofty ambitions would require congressional approval and action. In some of his most significant and enduring acts as president, Trump appointed three conservative nominees to the Supreme Court. The ensuing right-wing supermajority paved the way for the court's 2022 decision that overturned Roe. V Wade, which had enshrined the right to an abortion in federal law for nearly half a century. Biden has made the court's decision, and Trump's repeated promises to go further in restricting abortion access if he were to win in November, a centerpiece of his reelection campaign. 'Like most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right,' Biden said during his State of the Union address on March 7. '\u2026 But my predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. He's the reason it was overturned \u2014 in fact, he brags about it.' 'Look at the chaos that has resulted,' Biden added. During the speech, Biden promised to codify the abortion-related protections enshrined in Roe v. Wade into federal law if he wins a second term, but he acknowledged that would require the cooperation of a Democratic-controlled Congress. 'If Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again,' Biden said. Biden called for codifying Roe into law when he was running for president in 2020. While seeking office in 2020, Biden made ambitious climate-related promises, warning that climate change presents an existential threat to humanity. Some of those promises panned out: Biden's landmark legislative achievements, the bipartisan infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act, include hundreds of billions of dollars to encourage clean energy production and the manufacturing of electric vehicles. Pollution-falling emissions fell by 2% in the United States last year. Activists on Biden's left flank still think the president has not done enough \u2014 they want Biden to declare a climate emergency that would free up federal resources to confront climate change. Biden will need more time to fulfill some of his other pledges, including cutting emissions in half by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, and having a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. Biden said the 2020 race was a 'battle for the soul of the nation.' Now, he has made preserving democracy the focal point of his 2024 campaign \u2014 saying the value Americans place on a free and democratic society is the most important question of our country's time. He lays out the stakes in stark terms: If Trump wins a second term, the United States will face a crisis that could lead to the erosion of democratic norms. 'Not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault here at home as they are today,' Biden said during his State of the Union address last month. Today, he warned, there are 'forces taking us back in time.' Biden urged Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. The acts, which would have made Election Day a federal holiday, bolstered voting-related security measures, allowed all voters to request mail-in ballots and updated parts of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, were blocked by Senate Republicans in 2021. 'Pass and send me the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act,' Biden told Congress during his address, 'and stop denying another core value of America \u2014 our diversity across American life.' Biden has criticized Republican-led drives to ban certain books from public schools. 'Banning books \u2013 it's wrong,' he said in his State of the Union address. The United States, he said, shouldn't be erasing history. In the same speech, Biden also called for expanded pre-kindergarten for 3- and 4-year-olds, along with raises for teachers in public schools. He said he wants to continue making college more affordable by expanding access to Pell grants for working-class families, renewing a 2020 promise he made to double the grants' value. 'To remain the strongest economy in the world,' Biden said, 'we need the best education system in the world.' In some of his first actions as president, Biden worked to return the United States to the presence it held on the world stage before Trump became president. As president, Trump denigrated alliances like NATO and withdrew the United States from crucial international agreements, including the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accords. While running in 2020, Biden promised to undo damage wreaked by Trump on America's international partnerships. Biden has said he will continue to repair relationships that have faltered under Trump's control \u2014 and uphold American commitments to NATO and Ukraine. Trump, meanwhile, has said he would encourage Russia to do 'whatever the hell they want' to NATO-member countries who don't fulfill certain funding obligations. Biden frequently refers to those comments while speaking with supporters. 'The rest of the world is wondering what in the hell is happening to us,' Biden said at a campaign event in New York last month. 'And they're relieved, not because I'm so special but that I'm not Trump.' In an earlier Dallas fundraiser, Biden said the United States' international reputation was 'crushed when (Trump) was president.' 'Imagine what will happen if he's reelected,' Biden said. In 2022, Biden signed the most comprehensive gun-reform legislation in nearly 30 years. The law, passed shortly after a White supremacist massacred 10 people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket, allocated more than $750 million to help states implement crisis-intervention programs, closed certain loopholes in existing gun-control legislation and required more thorough reviews for people aged 18 to 21 who wanted to buy firearms. Biden has said he wants to go further. 'I'm demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,' Biden said at his State of the Union address. 'Pass universal background checks. None of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners.' He made a similar promise while running in 2020 but has not been able to get Congress' support. Biden has homed in on Trump's statements suggesting he would be open to cutting programs like Social Security and Medicare. In an interview with CNBC last month, Trump said: 'There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements,' Trump said on CNBC. Biden responded on X: 'Not on my watch.' He reiterated his vow to protect Social Security during his State of the Union address. 'Many of my Republican friends want to put Social Security on the chopping block,' Biden said 'If anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age I will stop them.' 'I will protect and strengthen Social Security and make the wealthy pay their fair share,' he added. ``\nPresident Joe Biden's main pitch to voters ahead of November is simple: They should vote for him because he is not Donald Trump.\nIn speeches and political events since his reelection campaign began in earnest earlier this year, Biden had said that his second term would essentially be a continuation of his first: 'Let's finish this job,' Biden said in a video announcing his reelection campaign last year.\nIn making his case to voters, Biden has contrasted his own ideas of governance with Trump's stated plans to drastically alter how the federal government works, how executive power would be used and how America's role on the world stage will change if the former president wins a second term.\nBiden, meanwhile, has promised to protect American democracy, pass a federal law to codify the right to an abortion into law, preserve the country's international alliances and agreements and deliver on climate benchmarks.\nHis ability to deliver on these promises even if he wins a second term, though, is not a certainty.

House Republicans released the text of three bills Wednesday that would provide aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, with the latter intended to protect US allies in the region from Chinese aggression. Despite opposition from hardline conservatives, House Speaker Mike Johnson advanced the foreign aid plan that, taken together, adds up to about $95 billion in aid. The House is expected to vote on the bills Saturday.

The president and his allies nearly tripled his rival's network in ad spending over\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Joe Biden holds a big edge on the airwaves over Donald Trump in the opening weeks of their general election matchup. The president and his allies nearly tripled his rival's network in ad spending over the past month and a half while Trump has had to devote millions of campaign funds to legal expenses.\nFrom March 6 \u2013 the day after Super Tuesday when Trump effectively secured the 2024 GOP presidential nomination \u2013 through Sunday, Biden's campaign and other Democratic advertisers spent $27.2 million on advertising for the presidential race, while the Trump campaign and GOP advertisers spent about $9.3 million, according to AdImpact data.\nThe Biden campaign's ad spending has included millions in key battleground states such as Michigan ($4.1 million), Pennsylvania ($3.9 million), Arizona ($2.5 million), Wisconsin ($2.2 million) and Georgia ($2.2 million). The Biden network has used its plentiful airtime to promote the administration's first-term record and to slam Trump, focusing on key issues such as the cost of living and abortion rights.\nFor example, Biden's campaign has spent over half a million dollars in just the past 10 days airing a new ad in Arizona, seizing on the high-profile fight over abortion rights there. 'Because of Donald Trump, millions of women lost the fundamental freedom to control their own bodies. And now women's lives are in danger because of that. The question is, if Donald Trump gets back in power, what freedom will you lose next?,' the ad says.\nMeanwhile, a pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., recently ramped up its advertising, booking over $1 million worth of airtime in Pennsylvania to coincide with Biden's recent campaign swing through the state last week.\n'Biden's open border puts us all at risk by releasing criminal illegals into our communities,' the MAGA Inc. spot says. Immigration and crime have been a key point of emphasis in Trump campaign messaging throughout his 2024 bid.\nTrump has also benefited since Super Tuesday from a nearly $3 million anti-Biden campaign from outside groups aligned with the oil and gas industries, which have been running ads in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, criticizing California fuel standards defended by the Biden administration.\nBut despite these signs of activity, Trump's network has been significantly outspent on the airwaves by Biden since becoming the presumptive nominee.\nTrump has also been forced off the campaign trail with the beginning of his criminal hush money trial in New York.\nBiden spent three days in Pennsylvania last week, meeting union voters, rallying with the Kennedys and slamming his predecessor's economic policies. At the same time, Trump was in court in New York, and the lone campaign event he had set for last week, a Saturday rally in North Carolina, was postponed due to bad weather.\nThe latest round of Federal Election Commission filings further show how Biden's fundraising edge is enabling his advertising advantage.\nEntering April, Biden's campaign reported $85.5 million in cash on hand, nearly doubling Trump's war chest of $45.1 million. A similar disparity exists between the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee, both poised to play key supporting roles in the election \u2013 the DNC reported $45.2 million on hand at March 31, while the RNC reported about $21.6 million.\nTrump's mounting legal expenses are exacerbating the gap. The former president's constellation of political committees has had to direct millions of dollars toward legal costs as several cases against the former president proceed; in March alone, a leadership PAC fronting most of Trump's legal fees spent about $3.7 million on legal-related expenses \u2013 nearly $3 out of every $4 it collected.\nThat leadership PAC, Save America, has spent more than $70 million on legal expenses since the start of 2021, FEC records show, a massive drain on funds that could otherwise be spent on efforts such as large ad campaigns.\nStill, polls continue to show a margin-of-error race between Biden and Trump. CNN's latest Poll of Polls average finds no clear leader, with each taking an average of 47% support among the potential electorate. That finding is effectively unchanged from averages from earlier this year.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"David Wright,CNN","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2147885702-20240422195521771.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":7.3108225,"_id":"53064ceb5071503154d63a183e5a336b"},{"title":"Opinion: This Supreme Court move is bad news for all activists \u2013 no matter their cause","author":"Jill Filipovic","published_date":"2024-04-17 16:44:43","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/17/opinions/mckesson-supreme-court-counterman-filipovic/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"If you organize a protest and someone shows up and commits an act of violence, can you be legally liable?

Follow her on Twitter . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion on CNN. This article has been updated to reflect the latest news. If you organize a protest and a participant, counter-protester or random yahoo shows up and commits an act of violence, can you be legally on the hook? In Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi the answer right now is yes \u2013 and the US Supreme Court just let that terrible ruling stand.\nOn Monday, the court declined to hear Mckesson v. Doe, a case in which Black Lives Matter organizer DeRay Mckesson was sued after someone at a protest he organized in Baton Rouge, Louisiana \u2013 importantly, not Mckesson himself \u2013 threw a rock at a police officer, seriously injuring the officer in the face.\nThat assault was horrible, tragic and criminal. But it's not the actual perpetrator \u2014 who remains unidentified \u2014 who was held accountable. It was Mckesson. That's who the anonymous Officer Doe sued under the theory that Mckesson knew or should have known that violence at the protests would occur, and should therefore be held liable for his negligence.\nThe Fifth Circuit, in part, agreed: Mckesson or any other protest organizer, they ruled, could be held liable under a negligence theory for the actions of third parties at their protests, even if those third parties did not act at their direction and even if they had no intention of fomenting violence. Mckesson, the Fifth Circuit ruled, can be held liable even though he did not intend for violence to occur, did not instigate or promote violence and by no account behaved violently himself.\nThe Fifth Circuit's ruling has tremendous First Amendment implications. After all, Americans have a constitutionally protected right to protest. But that right becomes pretty meaningless if anyone who organizes a protest can be sued into financial ruin for the bad behavior of anyone else who might show up. As Ian Milhiser pointed out in Vox, 'under the Fifth Circuit's rule, a Ku Klux Klansman could sabotage the Black Lives Matter movement simply by showing up at its protests and throwing stones.'\nCommenting on the court's refusal to hear the case, Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted that the court had already weighed in on the first Amendment question in a recent decision, Counterman v. Colorado, which was issued less than two weeks after the Fifth Circuit decided Mckesson. Sotomayor wrote: 'In Counterman, the Court made clear that the First Amendment bars the use of \u2018an objective standard' like negligence for punishing speech.' She included a quote from Counterman, brackets hers: 'the First Amendment precludes punishment [for incitement], whether civil or criminal, unless the speaker's words were \u2018intended' (not just likely) to produce imminent disorder.' Using a negligence standard for liability, she wrote, 'would violate the First Amendment.'\nThe Fifth Circuit used a negligence standard to allow Mckesson to be held liable for the actions of another protester. Sotomayor seems to be clearly saying this was incorrect. 'Because this Court may deny certiorari for many reasons, including that the law is not in need of further clarification, its denial today expresses no view about the merits of Mckesson's claim,' her opinion states. The Fifth Circuit didn't have the Counterman decision to rely on when it issued its ruling in Mckesson; now that Counterman is out in the world, Sotomayor wrote, she expects lower courts 'to give full and fair consideration to arguments regarding Counterman's impact in any future proceedings in this case.'\nIn other words, the Fifth Circuit's Mckesson decision is wrong. A lower court hearing the Mckesson case could and should choose to appropriately apply the law. The Fifth Circuit could eventually get on board. But the Supreme Court declined to actually overturn the Fifth Circuit's decision \u2014 which means that people in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi are, for now, still bound by it.\nThat is very bad news for any activist, or frankly anyone who wants their voices heard in a public forum. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has long been hostile to the Black Lives Matter movement, and Mckesson specifically. Some conservatives may be cheering at this moment of perceived comeuppance. But those same people should ask if they want their movement leaders held responsible if, say, violence breaks out at an anti-abortion march or a pro-Trump 'stop the steal' rally. After all, both of these movements have been rife with violence for years. Does that make anyone who organizes a protest in their name potentially negligent for any harm any attendee causes?\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook Freedom of speech, expression and assembly is a foundational value in the United States, a protection so crucial it is enshrined in the first of the constitutional amendments. Those of us who want those rights protected must stand by them, regardless of content \u2013 that is, whether or not we support the Black Lives Matter movement (for the record, I do) or the MAGA or anti-abortion movements (for the record, I do not). Allowing leaders to be sued if a single bad actor acts badly at a protest imposes far too high a potential cost on organizers; it functionally shuts down speech and, as the Supreme Court has held, is constitutionally impermissible.\nBut it's also currently the law of the land in three American states. And every American, regardless of ideology, should be up in arms and demand that change: People in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi have as much a right to protest as all the rest of us.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Jill Filipovic,Opinion Jill Filipovic","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap22084684207675.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@CNNOpinions","_score":6.9395027,"_id":"26a72aaa8341fd2092b48051ed2a550c"},{"title":"Catch up on the day's news: Trump trial testimony, campus protests, Earth Day","author":"Daniel Wine","published_date":"2024-04-22 21:01:43","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/22/us/5-things-pm-april-22-trnd","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"CNN's 5 Things PM brings you the news you need to know.","summary":"\ud83d\udc4b Welcome to 5 Things PM, and Happy Earth Day!

The plane was inspected and then departed safely, the airline said.\n'We are aware of the incident and are working with the FAA to fully understand the circumstances,' Southwest Airlines told CNN.\nCNN has reached out to the National Transportation Safety Board to see if it plans to investigate the incident.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"news","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Gregory Wallace,CNN,Pete Muntean","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1634545557.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@CNN","_score":6.5720544,"_id":"44177650d21aa03e05b89b98ca39eaa4"},{"title":"Democrats build financial edge in battle for the House","author":"David Wright","published_date":"2024-04-19 16:30:29","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/19/politics/democrats-fundraising-edge","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Democrats are building a significant financial edge in the battle for the House of Representatives, outraising their GOP counterparts and placing big fall ad reservations as Republicans grapple with\u2026","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Democrats are building a significant financial edge in the battle for the US House of Representatives, outraising their GOP counterparts and placing big fall ad reservations as Republicans grapple with the fallout of ongoing leadership battles.\nHouse Democrats' official campaign committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, announced this week that it hauled in a record-breaking $45.4 million during the first quarter of the year, outraising its Republican counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee, which brought in $33.4 million over the same period.\nThe DCCC also touted a war chest of $71.1 million, while the NRCC said it had about $55.9 million in cash on hand, funds each committee will use to support candidates in key battleground states with control of the House up for grabs.\nMeanwhile, a pair of super PACs aligned with the House leadership of both parties also announced their most recent quarterly fundraising totals this week, showing Democrats with another advantage.\nHouse Majority PAC, the Democratic super PAC, said that, along with its affiliated organization, House Majority Forward, it had raised $37 million in the quarter for Democrats' House effort. Their GOP counterparts, the Congressional Leadership Fund, along with its affiliate, American Action Network, announced a combined fundraising haul of $30 million in the first quarter. The groups are set to play pivotal roles in the upcoming House contests, devoting tens of millions of dollars to independent expenditures.\nDemocrats also have a fundraising edge when it comes to the candidates themselves. First-quarter FEC filings showed that in 20 of 22 races rated as 'toss-ups' by the Cook Political Report \u2013 its most competitive category \u2013 the lead Democratic candidate outraised the lead Republican candidate. Many of the Democratic candidates, hauling in millions, hailed from highly competitive seats in California and New York, critical sections of the House map.\nAdding to the pressure, House Republicans are still dealing with the fallout from leadership fights as they seek to defend their razor-thin majority. During his first full quarter as speaker, Mike Johnson struggled to keep pace with the fundraising of his predecessor, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who was ousted last year. Johnson hauled in $20 million for House Republicans in the first quarter, while McCarthy raised at least $30 million for the party in the first quarter of the previous two years.\nAnd the leadership drama appears poised to drag on. With less funds to distribute to the party than his predecessor \u2013 a key lever of influence \u2013 Johnson faces threats to his job as he has sought to advance legislation on Capitol Hill.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has led an effort to potentially oust the speaker amid disputes over foreign aid and the renewal of a foreign surveillance law. Johnson has said he will not resign, and on Thursday, he took the extraordinary step of relying on Democratic votes to move advance a package providing foreign aid for Ukraine and Israel. Greene left the US Capitol on Friday following the vote without moving to oust Johnson.\nMeanwhile, a conservative dark money group, American Prosperity Alliance, launched new ads this week targeting three House Republicans who had voted to oust McCarthy, slamming their voting records. It is spending about $700,000 on the ad campaign, which is set to run through the rest of the month, another example of costly intraparty divisions.\nDemocrats, for their part, are prepping massive fall advertising reservations. House Majority PAC, the lead Democratic super PAC, announced earlier this month plans to spend $186 million on advertising campaigns targeting a series of key battleground races.\nThe group, whose 2024 investment surpasses the $102 million initially reserved in ads in the 2022 cycle and the $41 million in the 2020 cycle, said it was making its largest investment ever to flood key districts with an aggressive ad campaign, including attacks against Republicans on abortion and the collapse of a bipartisan border security deal.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"CNN,David Wright","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2115165051.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":5.9247856,"_id":"f526121bb9bed9cbbf6cfaadcd4855a1"},{"title":"Gov.\u00a0Ron DeSantis signs education bill limiting book challenges","author":"Carlos Suarez","published_date":"2024-04-16 22:41:23","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://us.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/desantis-education-book-challenges-reaj","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill Tuesday that limits the number of books and classroom materials that can be challenged in school districts.","summary":"CNN \u2014\nCNN \u2014 Less than a year after signing a law that led to the removal of hundreds of books from public school shelves, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill Tuesday that amends the state's law to limit the number of books and classroom materials that can be challenged in school districts.\nThe bill, which goes into effect on July 1, states that Florida residents without children in a school district 'may not object to more than one material per month' and instructs the state's Board of Education to adopt changes to implement the decision.\nThe provision does not limit the number of challenges a parent with a child enrolled in a Florida school district can file or include a penalty if the law is violated.\nDeSantis on Tuesday acknowledged that some school districts in the state may have gone too far in removing titles from classrooms.\n'You have some people who are taking the curriculum transparency, and they are trying to weaponize that for political purposes,' he said at an event in Jacksonville, Florida. 'That involves objecting to normal books, like some of the books that I saw in the teacher's lounge, these classic books.'\nIn the first half of the 2023-2024 school year, Florida had the highest number of bans compared to other states, a report released Tuesday by the literary and free expression advocacy group PEN America found.\nThere were 4,349 instances of book bans in 23 states and 53 public schools from July to December 2023, but PEN America says 3,135 of those bans impacted 11 school districts in the Sunshine State.\nMore than 1,600 cases were from a single school district, Escambia County Public Schools, which is facing a lawsuit in connection to the book removals, CNN previously reported.\nIn February, during a news conference near Orlando, the governor called on Florida's Department of Education to 'take appropriate action to prohibit bad actors in school leadership positions from intentionally depriving students of an education by politicizing the book review process.'\nHe called the idea that Florida bans books a 'false narrative.'\nBut across the state, school board meetings have become a battleground between parents who want certain books removed and those who wish to have them remain available to students. Meanwhile, Florida teachers and educators have struggled to navigate a slate of laws signed by the governor that expand so-called 'parental rights' in schools.\nIn 2023, DeSantis signed HB 1069, which restricts sexual education and classroom 'instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in Pre-K through 8th grade.'\nThe legislation also allows parents and citizens to petition for classroom books and instructional materials that include 'pornography' or describe sexual conduct to be removed. Individual school districts are responsible for creating processes 'to handle all objections' and provide resolutions, the law states.\nSince the law went into effect last year, residents have swiftly objected to a number of books, and individual school districts were left to develop a process to determine whether the challenged material would be restricted to a certain age group or removed from schools altogether.\nDespite the removal of hundreds of books from school shelves in the last school year, DeSantis maintains Florida does not ban books in schools, but he has acknowledged that 'some people have abused this process.'\n'If you're somebody who doesn't have a kid in school and you're gonna object to 100 books, no, I don't think that's appropriate,' DeSantis said at a news conference in February.\nSabrina Ba\u00eata, manager of PEN America's Freedom to Read program and a lead author of Tuesday's report, said the findings should be a red alert for those who care about American values and free expression.\n'Book bans are targeting narratives about race and sexual identities and sexual content writ large, and they show no sign of stopping. The bans we're seeing are broad, harsh, and pernicious \u2013 and they're undermining the education of millions of students across the country,' Ba\u00eata said in a statement.\nWhen it comes to how many books are banned at public schools, Florida takes the lead, followed by Wisconsin, which had 481 bans in three school districts; Iowa with 142 bans in three districts and Texas with 141 bans in four districts. Kentucky and Virginia reported at least 100 bans, according to the PEN America report.\nAfter analyzing the book ban instances, PEN America found several trends regarding the content of the books and the people involved or impacted by the bans.\nBooks that discuss sex, abortion or rape are among the most censored after claims that their content considered sexually explicit or 'obscene' \u2013 a category of speech that is not protected under the First Amendment, according to the report. PEN America said there is no consistent legal definition of what is considered sexually explicit from state to state, 'leading to confusion about what is and is not allowed.'\nOther books that continue being targeted are those discussing race, racism and LGBTQ+ themes, especially transgender identities and experiences, PEN America said.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Carlos Suarez,Nicole Chavez,Denise Royal","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-ap24107753748573-20240416214639141.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":5.480832,"_id":"65f5cda8ac1111a6e5fffbdc093006fa"},{"title":"Catch up on the day's news: Mayorkas impeachment fails, dementia risks, NBA player banned","author":"Daniel Wine","published_date":"2024-04-17 21:24:04","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/17/us/5-things-pm-april-17-trnd/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"CNN's 5 Things PM brings you the news you need to know.","summary":"\ud83d\udc4b Welcome to 5 Things PM!

That's going to be a continuation of the contrast the American people have been able to see since this campaign began,' said Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler.\nBiden's Pennsylvania push comes as he's also seeking to move the needle with voters who continue to hold sour views about the president's handling of the economy. Recent polling has also shown a close contest between Biden and Trump fewer than seven months from Election Day.\nBiden's speech on Tuesday is expected to be heavy on economic populism as he seeks to portray Trump as out of touch with Americans' concerns. He will zero-in on the two candidates' differing plans on tax policy as the president outlines 'how Trump's tax plan is a handout to the rich and leaves the middle class holding the bag,' Tyler said.\nThe president is expected to take aim at Trump's pledge to extend the sweeping tax cuts that congressional Republicans approved in 2017 \u2013 a measure that reduced taxes for most Americans, but from which the rich benefited far more than others. Meanwhile, Biden is campaigning on raising taxes on the wealthy to fund his social and other priorities while protecting those who earn less than $400,000 a year from tax hikes.\nIn 2020, Biden used his hometown to frame the election as a 'Scranton vs. Park Avenue' choice for voters.

It would hit those with a net worth of more than $100 million.\nBiden also proposes taxing capital gains at the same rate as wage income for those earning more than $1 million and increasing the net investment income tax rate on earned and unearned income above $400,000 to 5%, up from 3.8%.\nThe president wants to increase the corporate tax rate to 28%, up from the 21% rate set by the GOP tax cut package in 2017, and raise the corporate minimum tax rate on billion-dollar corporations to 21%, from 15%. Also, he would reduce incentives for multinational businesses to book profits in low-tax jurisdictions and raise the tax rate on their foreign earnings to 21% from 10.5%.

The law reduced individual and corporate income tax rates, changed international tax rules, repealed personal exemptions, increased the standard deduction and child tax credit, limited or restricted certain itemized deductions and doubled the estate tax exemption, among other provisions.\nMost Americans benefited from the tax law, but the wealthy benefited the most.\nNearly all the individual income and estate tax provisions expire at the end of 2025, while most of the corporate measures are permanent.

Trump declined to voluntarily release his tax returns as president.\n'President Biden believes that all occupants of the Oval Office should be open and honest with the American people,' the White House said in a statement on Monday, 'and that the longstanding tradition of annually releasing presidential tax returns should continue unbroken.'\nThe president's events this week come as his campaign continues to build out its infrastructure Pennsylvania, where recent polling has shown no clear leader in a two-way race between Biden and Trump.\nBiden campaign battleground states director Dan Kanninen told reporters on a call Monday that the Biden campaign is investing heavily in the commonwealth with a particular focus on driving turnout in Philadelphia. The Biden campaign has opened 14 new offices in Pennsylvania in March as they work to train volunteers and hire campaign staff.\n'We're obviously looking at Pennsylvania right now where the president is spending the week campaigning, and it's a textbook example of how we're going to run those votes,' said Kanninen.\nCampaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez also released a campaign strategy memo ahead of the visit, pointing to the coordinated campaign's early investments in Allegheny County, home to Pittsburgh, as well as in the central part of the state in York and Lancaster counties \u2013 two counties Trump won in 2020 where the team sees 'opportunities for Democratic growth as shown by gains made at the local level.'\nChavez Rodriguez argued Biden's support for unions, abortion rights, and protecting democracy will play with Pennsylvania voters in November.\n'With all of these issues remaining salient for voters and Trump and MAGA Republicans only becoming more extreme, they continue to alienate the voters that decide elections in Pennsylvania \u2013 and show no signs of being able to win them back,' she wrote.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Sam Fossum,Arlette Saenz,Tami Luhby","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap24103786777136.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":4.520334,"_id":"7977385238fc8c08973843d16ebf4e42"},{"title":"Biden pushes his economic populism in battleground Pennsylvania as Trump is stuck in a New York courtroom","author":"Arlette Saenz","published_date":"2024-04-16 13:23:51","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/politics/joe-biden-scranton-pennsylvania-donald-trump/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"President Joe Biden is seeking to draw a sharp economic contrast with former President Donald Trump during a three-day swing through Pennsylvania with campaign officials framing the election as a\u2026","summary":"President Joe Biden is seeking to make a sharp economic argument against former President Donald Trump during a three-day swing through Pennsylvania with campaign officials framing the election as a debate between his 'kitchen table' Scranton outlook and Trump's 'Mar-a-Lago vision.'\nThe trip, which kicks off Tuesday in Biden's hometown of Scranton, also will set up a stark split screen as the president is on the campaign trail while Trump spends most of the week in a New York City courtroom for his criminal trial.\n'No matter where Donald Trump is, whether it's in Mar-a-Lago, a courtroom or anywhere else, he'll be focused on himself, his toxic agenda, his campaign of revenge and retribution.

Trump declined to voluntarily release his tax returns as president.\n'President Biden believes that all occupants of the Oval Office should be open and honest with the American people,' the White House said in a statement on Monday, 'and that the longstanding tradition of annually releasing presidential tax returns should continue unbroken.'\nThe president's events this week come as his campaign continues to build out its infrastructure Pennsylvania, where recent polling has shown no clear leader in a two-way race between Biden and Trump.\nBiden campaign battleground states director Dan Kanninen told reporters on a call Monday that the Biden campaign is investing heavily in the commonwealth with a particular focus on driving turnout in Philadelphia. The Biden campaign has opened 14 new offices in Pennsylvania in March as they work to train volunteers and hire campaign staff.\n'We're obviously looking at Pennsylvania right now where the president is spending the week campaigning, and it's a textbook example of how we're going to run those votes,' said Kanninen.\nCampaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez also released a campaign strategy memo ahead of the visit, pointing to the coordinated campaign's early investments in Allegheny County, home to Pittsburgh, as well as in the central part of the state in York and Lancaster counties \u2013 two counties Trump won in 2020 where the team sees 'opportunities for Democratic growth as shown by gains made at the local level.'\nChavez Rodriguez argued Biden's support for unions, abortion rights, and protecting democracy will play with Pennsylvania voters in November.\n'With all of these issues remaining salient for voters and Trump and MAGA Republicans only becoming more extreme, they continue to alienate the voters that decide elections in Pennsylvania \u2013 and show no signs of being able to win them back,' she wrote.","rights":"cnn.com","rank":61,"topic":"politics","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Tami Luhby,Arlette Saenz,Sam Fossum","media":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap24103786777136.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@cnnpolitics","_score":4.497749,"_id":"82b244df87503cf2b1501bd118cb664d"},{"title":"Rick Santorum Fast Facts","author":"Editorial Research","published_date":"2024-04-19 18:03:19","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.cnn.com/2013/05/13/us/rick-santorum-fast-facts/index.html","clean_url":"cnn.com","excerpt":"Read Rick Santorum Fast Facts on CNN.com and learn more about the former Pennsylvania congressman and former presidential candidate.","summary":"Here's a look at the life of Rick Santorum, former Pennsylvania congressman.\nBirth date: May 10, 1958\nBirth date: May 10, 1958 Birth place: Winchester, Virginia\nBirth place: Winchester, Virginia Birth name: Richard John Santorum\nBirth name: Richard John Santorum Father: Aldo Santorum, a psychologist\nFather: Aldo Santorum, a psychologist Mother: Catherine (Dughi) Santorum, a nurse\nMother: Catherine (Dughi) Santorum, a nurse Marriage: Karen (Garver) Santorum (1990-present)\nMarriage: Karen (Garver) Santorum (1990-present) Children: Isabella, 2008; Patrick, 2001; Peter, 1999; Sarah, 1998; Gabriel, born and died in 1996; Daniel, 1995; Richard Jr., 1993; Elizabeth, 1991\nChildren: Isabella, 2008; Patrick, 2001; Peter, 1999; Sarah, 1998; Gabriel, born and died in 1996; Daniel, 1995; Richard Jr., 1993; Elizabeth, 1991 Education: Pennsylvania State University, B.A., Political Science, 1980; University of Pittsburgh, M.B.A., 1981; Dickinson School of Law, J.D., 1986\nEducation: Pennsylvania State University, B.A., Political Science, 1980; University of Pittsburgh, M.B.A., 1981; Dickinson School of Law, J.D., 1986 Religion: Roman Catholic\nReligion: Roman Catholic Member of the 'Gang of Seven,' a group that exposed and condemned scandals in Congress, when in the House of Representatives.\nFounded the Congressional Working Group on Religious Freedom.\nKnown for spearheading and helping to pass the welfare reform bill and a ban on partial-birth abortion.\n1981-1986 - Administrative assistant to Pennsylvania state Senator J.

Sixty-five of 100 samples of the most contaminated produce were imported, with 52 of those samples originating from Mexico.\nThe majority of the highly contaminated imports were strawberries, typically the frozen variety, the report said. Because they grow low to the ground and are therefore more accessible to bugs, strawberries often top lists of foods contaminated with insecticides.\nImported and domestic green beans also tested high for pesticides, even samples that were labeled organic, 'the only organic food we found with significant levels of pesticides,' said James Rogers, director of food safety research and testing at Consumer Reports.\nNearly all the tested green beans were contaminated with acephate, an organophosphate insecticide that is considered a 'possible human carcinogen.' The US Environmental Protection Agency prohibited the chemical for use on green beans in 2011.\nThe Food Industry Association, which supports all facets of the industry, told CNN that ' all pesticides go through an extensive review process by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to ensure they are safe for human consumption and to establish tolerances, the maximum residue limit permitted on or in a food.'\n'all pesticides go through an extensive review process by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to ensure they are safe for human consumption and to establish tolerances, the maximum residue limit permitted on or in a food.'

Carbamates were developed to replace older, problematic chemicals such as organophosphates, which date back to the 1850s.\nOne of the most frequently used compounds in the world, organophosphates are the main components of nerve gas, herbicides, pesticides and insecticides and are also used to create plastics and solvents. Studies have linked organophosphates to low sperm count, childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and 'neurodevelopmental deficits in childhood, including reduced IQ, perceptual reasoning, and memory,' according to the EPA.\nThe EPA considers both organophosphates and carbamates a high or first priority for review under the Food Quality Protection Act.\nAs a group, pesticides have also been linked in studies to preterm births, congenital malformations such as neural tube defects, spontaneous abortions and an increase in genetic damage in humans. Exposure to pesticides has also been associated with heart disease, cancer and other disorders.\nCritics point to the EPA's lack of action as a key reason concerning pesticides are frequently found despite a growing amount of scientific evidence that even low levels could be harmful.\n'The EPA could certainly be doing a better job of setting more accurate safe limits based on the latest science,' said Alexis Temkin, EWG's senior toxicologist.

'That's why we provide a chart that lists how much of each vegetable or fruit that it is safe to eat each day.'\nThe chart lists produce by pesticide concern, with the lowest levels listed as 'Okay to eat more than 10 servings a day.'
