            "summary": "The US economy's standout performance will be a major driver of global growth this year but could make America's inflation problem harder to solve, according to the International Monetary Fund.\nThe IMF upgraded Tuesday its forecast for US economic growth to 2.7% this year — 0.6 percentage points higher than it predicted as recently as January.\nThe move highlights how the United States is outpacing other advanced economies, notably the European economy, which has struggled to regain momentum after the pandemic, with high interest rates and the lingering effects of earlier rises in energy costs weighing on activity.\nThe Washington-based IMF expects the 20 countries that use the euro to grow just 0.8% this year, a downgrade of 0.1 percentage points from its January forecast.\nThe global economy, meanwhile, is seen expanding by 3.2% , 0.1 percentage points more than predicted in January. China's economy, the second-largest in the world, is forecast to grow 4.6%, while India is expected to notch growth of 6.8%.\n, 0.1 percentage points more than predicted in January. China's economy, the second-largest in the world, is forecast to grow 4.6%, while India is expected to notch growth of 6.8%. 'The strong recent performance of the United States reflects robust productivity and employment growth, but also strong demand in an economy that remains overheated,' IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in a blog post accompanying the agency's World Economic Outlook. 'This calls for a cautious and gradual approach to (monetary) easing by the Federal Reserve.'\n'Astonishingly, the US economy has already surged past its pre-pandemic (growth) trend,' Gourinchas added in the foreword to the report.\nAn economy can overheat when rapid economic growth — often triggered by a sudden increase in household and government spending, as has happened in the United States — causes inflation to rise.\nAnnual US inflation has ticked up in recent months after falling considerably from a peak of 9.1% hit in June 2022. Consumer prices rose by a stronger-than-expected 3.5% in March, prompting traders to postpone expectations of the first interest rate cut by the Fed by several months.\nWhat's more — although it's not their central forecast — strategists at UBS now see 'real risk' that the Fed won't cut borrowing costs and rather will resume raising rates by early next year, according to a recent note. Some Fed officials have recently argued in favor of keeping rates on hold for the remainder of this year.\nAlso posing upside risks to inflation are high government spending and debt levels in the United States. 'The fiscal stance… is of particular concern,' Gourinchas wrote, noting that it raises short-term risks to the process of slowing inflation, as well as longer-term financial stability risks for the global economy.\nIn contrast to the United States, 'there is little evidence of overheating' in the euro area, according to Gourinchas.\nThe European Central Bank will need to 'carefully calibrate the pivot toward monetary easing' to avoid inflation — currently at 2.4% — falling below its 2% target, he added.\nThe IMF expects inflation to average 5.9% around the world this year, down from an average of 6.8% in 2023 but 0.1 percentage points above its January forecast.\nthis year, down from an average of 6.8% in 2023 but 0.1 percentage points above its January forecast. 'Worryingly, progress toward inflation targets has somewhat stalled since the beginning of the year,' Gourinchas wrote.\nInflation has been dampened by lower energy costs and slower rises in goods prices as supply chain frictions have eased and Chinese export prices have fallen. But 'stubbornly high' inflation in the cost of services and a recent increase in oil prices, in part due to escalating tensions in the Middle East, could push overall prices higher again, Gourinchas said.\n'Further trade restrictions on Chinese exports could also push up goods inflation,' he added.\nOfficials in Europe and the United States have voiced concerns about potential 'dumping' by China — that is, the export of goods at artificially low prices. That raises the prospect of tariffs on certain Chinese products, which could lift broader inflation.\nChina, the world's biggest manufacturer, could also become the source of a different risk to global inflation, via stronger-than-expected economic growth. China's economy expanded 5.3% in the first quarter, according to official figures published Tuesday, beating estimates of economists polled by Reuters.\nIn a sign of the threat to inflation, the data, which reflected a jump in high-tech manufacturing, gave some support to oil prices Tuesday.",

'It's a stark contrast from my opponent. He looks at the economy from Mar-a-Lago where he and his rich friends embrace the failed trickle-down policies that have failed working families for more than forty years.' The trip, which kicks off a three-day swing through Pennsylvania, presented a stark split screen as the president is on the campaign trail while Trump spends most of the week in a New York City courtroom for his criminal trial.\n'Scranton values or Mar-a-Lago values. These are the competing visions for our economy and they raise questions of fundamental fairness at the heart of this campaign,' Biden argued.\nBiden's Pennsylvania push comes as he's also seeking to move the needle with voters who continue to hold sour views about the president's handling of the economy.\nRecent polling has also shown a close contest between Biden and Trump fewer than seven months from Election Day.",

            "summary": "New York CNN —\nNew York CNN — Federal Reserve officials have been saying for months they need to see more convincing data demonstrating that inflation is on a sustainable path to 2% before they can feel comfortable cutting rates. Last month's unexpectedly hot Consumer Price Index report is the exact opposite of that. That's why Fed Chair Powell conveyed on Tuesday the central bank won't be cutting interest rates any time soon.\n'The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it's likely to take longer than expected to achieve [2% inflation],' Powell said Tuesday in a panel discussion with Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem. US stocks initially dropped after his signal that rates would stay higher for longer, and Treasury yields rose to new highs for the year before paring back.\nMarkets, businesses and the White House have been laser-focused on the timing and number of rate cuts this year, yet the prospect seems to be slipping away. How would the US economy handle more months of painstakingly high interest rates? Not as well as it has thus far, experts say.\nWhen Fed officials initially penciled in three rate cuts at the end of last year, markets hit new highs. The expectation at the time was the first of those cuts would come as early as March. Investors tend to prefer lower rates because that reduces the cost of borrowing which, in turn, can help boost profits. It also means investors have more money to pour into the market.\nThen, when progress on inflation started to stall leading into last month's policy meeting, investors pushed back their timeline to June for the start of cuts. But investors were overjoyed when officials maintained their median forecast for three rate cuts this year at last month's meeting, leading to multiple fresh records for major US indexes.\nHowever, that momentum is wearing off. After last week's hotter-than-expected inflation data, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have each shed around 2% of their value.\nEven with the recent selloff, stock market prices still reflect the expectation the Fed will cut later this year, said Itay Goldstein, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. 'There is a risk there that if the Fed doesn't decrease rates, market prices will decline.'\nThat will have a spillover effect on the overarching economy, he told CNN. That's because stock market declines could cause firms to delay investments or cut back on costs. For instance, Tesla announced it was slashing 10% of its workforce as shares of the electric vehicle maker have been plummeting this year.\nMarket declines can also make households 'feel that they're not as rich,' he added, which can also cause them to cut corners.\nSince the Fed held interest rates steady last year after 11 hikes that brought rates to the highest level in over two decades, higher for longer has been the central bank's mantra.\nBut the longer the Fed leaves interest rates higher means more pain could be inflicted on households and businesses, said Goldstein.\nAlthough it hasn't quite been the case so far — especially considering the latest retail sales report, which showed consumers continue to spend despite inflation and the highest interest rates in two decades — elevated interest rates tend to cause people to save more money rather than invest or spend it, which slows the economy. That risk will be elevated if the Fed doesn't cut rates this year, he said.\nAlready, the expectation that the Fed will keep rates higher has pushed up US Treasury yields significantly. For instance, the 2-year Treasury yield briefly hit 5% after Powell's Tuesday remarks. That's fueling higher mortgage rates.\nUltimately, higher-for-even-longer rates 'will increase borrowing costs across the economy, which is likely to have a negative impact on consumer spending, business investment, and the housing market,' said Brian Rose, senior US economist at UBS Global Wealth Management.\nBut not everyone thinks cracks in the economy will widen if the Fed doesn't cut rates this year. 'We think the economy is strong enough that it doesn't need cuts to avoid recession,' David Mericle, chief US economist at Goldman Sachs, said.",

Call it an April slump.\nFaltering tech stocks, fears that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates higher for longer and geopolitical conflict have led to a sharp drop in US markets this month. CNN's Fear & Greed Index, which measures seven barometers of market sentiment, is displaying a solid 'fear' reading, down from 'greed' just a month ago.\nBut Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak, Boston Consulting Group's global chief economist, thinks there's too much doomsaying on Wall Street. The economy has been extraordinarily resilient for the past few years — consistently proving the naysayers wrong, he says. For all of the market gloom last week, stocks are still near all-time highs, and this earnings season has been strong.\nCarlsson-Szlezak, who co-authored a book on pervasive economic doomsaying, told Before the Bell that the Federal Reserve's wait-and-see approach to inflation and interest rate cuts should be a vote of confidence for this economy and that recession fears are far off from reality.\nBefore the Bell that the Federal Reserve's wait-and-see approach to inflation and interest rate cuts should be a vote of confidence for this economy and that recession fears are far off from reality.

Are their fears overblown? Philipp Carlsson-Szlezak: We're seeing expectations reset — the forecast for six rate cuts this year has vanished, now it's less than two. The fact that markets are off about 4% relative to that news is not out of the ordinary.\nPhilipp Carlsson-Szlezak: We're seeing expectations reset — the forecast for six rate cuts this year has vanished, now it's less than two. The fact that markets are off about 4% relative to that news is not out of the ordinary. These inflation prints are actually an extreme expression of underlying strength. The vanishing rate cut expectations, well, they're also an expression of strength. If we had to rush to cut rates to prop up the economy, that would be bad. We can wait because this economy is booming and running ahead.\nThe market volatility, in my view, is a confirmation that those rate cuts aren't coming as fast as was hoped and dreamed about.\nBut valuations are very high, and the markets are still near record highs. I speak with many institutional investors, and I don't see them folding in fear. I think the market would look different if that were the case.\nWhat about geopolitical worries?\nWhat about geopolitical worries? It's so easy to focus on predictions of a dire meltdown. We have a war in Europe, that is an enormous shift in the geopolitical landscape, an enormous humanitarian shock and an enormous disruption to the European business order. And there is no recession. Isn't that telling us something about how high the bar can be for geopolitics to flow directly through to the macroeconomy?\nA similar point can be made about rising tensions in the Middle East. So far, they have not pushed down a major Western economy. They have the potential to do so, and this is the difficulty with geopolitical risk. If that feeds into an oil price rally and a sharp movement in the oil market, we're talking about something different. But recall that at the start of the Ukraine war, oil also went up a lot. And did we get a recession in the US from that? Did it pull down the growth numbers in the US? It did not.\nI'm not saying there isn't a risk. And I'm not saying we should look away and shrug off these many geopolitical crises. They all have the potential to magnify and amplify and grow.\nBut it's not really possible to say that the real economy has taken a hit from either war in either Ukraine or the Middle East.\nAre investors paying too much attention to swings in monthly economic data?\nAre investors paying too much attention to swings in monthly economic data? Some of the short-term predictability and forecast ability for the economy is very poor. Economics isn't really constructed like a natural science in that way.\nBut I quibble with the notion that markets can't look through this. As I've said, we're still near record numbers in the equity market. If you believed all the doomsaying about impending stumbles and the economy falling off a cliff edge, then we wouldn't have these valuations and these prices in various financial markets.\nMarkets have to react to something. Somebody prices everything at the margin. Of course there's a reaction to data flow. But I don't think, for example, that the three consecutive months of inflation surprises to the upside have pushed the equity market into a reset or a correction.\nSo what comes next? We can't stave off a cyclical recession forever.\nSo what comes next? We can't stave off a cyclical recession forever. When will the next recession be? You and I both know, that's so hard to pinpoint, but I don't think it will be in 2024.

What are some economic themes you're watching in the back half of 2024?\nWhat are some economic themes you're watching in the back half of 2024? I think we're still likely to get a rate cut or two. The labor market has cooled. It hasn't cooled as much as it was expected to, but job openings are down. I also think consumers will continue to be in a position to spend.\nThe US consumption economy is diversified between goods and services and that diversification has provided a steady floor for us. When services were weak, goods were exceptionally strong. Now that goods are off their overshoots, services are back to trend and carrying the day. So I see little reason to think there is a pocket of weakness that will tear down the whole consumption story.\nThere are gyrations under the hood, but when you look at the aggregates, it adds up to great numbers.\nA potential US ban against TikTok took a major step toward becoming reality on Saturday as House lawmakers approved a hot-button bill targeting the app as part of a wide-ranging aid package for Israel and Ukraine, reports my colleague Brian Fung.\nThe bipartisan vote of 360-58 marks the latest defeat for TikTok in Washington, as the embattled social media company with 170 million US users fights for survival under its current ownership by ByteDance, its Chinese parent company.\nThe bill passed by the House this weekend closely resembles an earlier version approved in March that would ban TikTok from US app stores unless it finds a new owner, and quickly.\nPolicy analysts expect the Senate to take up the aid package quickly, giving it high odds of passage. And President Joe Biden has previously said he would sign the TikTok legislation if it reaches his desk.\nTesla has been ordered to recall nearly 4,000 of its Cybertrucks due to an accelerator pedal that can stick in place when pressed down, report my colleagues Chris Isidore and Peter Valdes-Dapena.\nThe cause, according to the regulator: soap.\n'An unapproved change introduced lubricant (soap) to aid in the component assembly of the pad onto the accelerator pedal. Residual lubricant reduced the retention of the pad to the pedal,' the NHTSA wrote in the recall document.\nTesla has yet to detail how many of the futuristic looking Cybertrucks it has produced. But it has said that it would be slow ramping up production of the vehicle , which had its first deliveries in late November.\n, which had its first deliveries in late November. The NHTSA said the recall affects 'all Model Year (‘MY') 2024 Cybertruck vehicles manufactured from November 13, 2023, to April 4, 2024.'\nThat means the 3,878 trucks being recalled are likely many, if not all, of the trucks now on US roads.\nUnlike many Tesla recalls, this one cannot be fixed with a simple over-the-air software update. Tesla will have to have owners respond to letters and bring the Cybertrucks into its service centers for a repair at no charge.",

The US economy's remarkable strength is a big reason behind the dollar's rally over the past week. The latest data on retail spending released Tuesday showed that Americans continue to open up their wallets, and other figures released earlier this month show the US job market remains solid and the country's manufacturing sector is expanding.\nFederal Reserve officials have said that the economy's resilience means they can hold rates steady at a 23-year high as they wait for more evidence that inflation is headed toward their 2% target. The central bank cuts rates if it's clear that the economy is contracting, since it's also responsible for maximizing employment in addition to stabilizing prices.\nBut there are signs that inflation's cooling has stalled. March was the third straight month of hotter-than-expected inflation readings. Inflation overall has recently been pushed up by climbing gas prices and stubbornly elevated housing costs.\nFed Governor Michelle Bowman suggested in a speech Wednesday that the central bank may need to hike rates again or push the first rate cut further out since there 'is a lot of financial market activity and a lot of continued growth that we wouldn't have expected if policy was sufficiently tight.'\nBut the robustness of America's economy isn't the only thing lifting the US dollar.\nBefore the Bell spoke with Claudio Irigoyen, head of global economics at Bank of America, about the dollar's rally and what it means for Americans and the world.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nWhat's powering the dollar's rally in addition to the US economy's resilience?\nWhat's powering the dollar's rally in addition to the US economy's resilience? Claudio Irigoyen: The dollar is strengthening for a combination of reasons. It's not only the Fed saying that it is not going to cut rates soon, which has caused markets to reprice. It's also that the US economy is doing better than the rest of the main regional blocs, including the euro zone. Most of the surprises in growth keep coming from the US.\nClaudio Irigoyen: The dollar is strengthening for a combination of reasons.

It's also that the US economy is doing better than the rest of the main regional blocs, including the euro zone. Most of the surprises in growth keep coming from the US. It is also because every time you have a shock on the geopolitical side, there is this flight to quality components, which helps the dollar. And if you keep having incidents in the Middle East, those shocks will cause a spike in energy prices and those shocks have a proportionally bigger effect on Europe and Japan, but not as much on the US, which is more energy independent.\nWhat does a strong US dollar mean for Americans?\nWhat does a strong US dollar mean for Americans? For Americans, the purchasing power of the dollar is higher and consumption will remain strong. People will travel abroad more, probably. Imports are cheaper, so they will import more. But obviously if that happens, then the rest of the world is happily financing the country's current account deficit. (A 'current account' is a record of a country's transactions with the rest of the world, including imports, exports, payments and other transfers. And a deficit occurs when spending exceeds production, resulting in net imports.)\n(A 'current account' is a record of a country's transactions with the rest of the world, including imports, exports, payments and other transfers.

It's not necessarily bad for other economies because if you have a weaker currency, that should help your exports, and that's the way the global economy re-balances. However, the strong dollar is not an exogenous shock, it is an endogenous reaction of the market to the fact that the US is doing better than the rest.\nI don't think you're going to have a weakening of the dollar until you have more convergence in growth or in monetary policy. There's a very narrow path where the dollar can weaken, and that happens usually when China, relative to trend, is doing better than the US. Despite the better-than-expected numbers in the first quarter in China, we are still not seeing that. And again, geopolitical risks need to disappear from the map, but everything indicates that between now and the US elections, geopolitical risks will remain.\nhave a weakening of the dollar until you have more convergence in growth or in monetary policy.

Last year, Netflix made a particularly risky bet by pushing users who share passwords to create their own accounts — but it's paid off, reports my colleague Samantha Delouya.\nNetflix, the dominant player in streaming, added more than 9 million subscribers in the first three months of the year, hitting a record high of 269.6 million subscribers.\n'It added more subscribers than many analysts, myself included, expected,' said eMarketer senior analyst Ross Benes. 'This signals that password sharing was even more common than previously thought as Netflix keeps converting freeloader viewers into paid users.'\nWhile the subscriber additions topped Wall Street's estimates, the company still reported a drop in growth from its blowout fourth-quarter report, when Netflix added 13 million subscribers. Netflix announced Thursday that it plans to stop sharing its quarterly subscriber numbers in 2025.\nThe company also reported $9.37 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $5.28 for the first quarter, beating Wall Street's estimates, according to FactSet.\nHowever, the stock, which has been a darling of Wall Street this year, fell after the news.\nRead more here.\nMonday: Earnings from Verizon, Truist and Albertsons.

            "summary": "London CNN —\nLondon CNN — The high and rising level of US government debt risks driving up borrowing costs around the world and undermining global financial stability, the International Monetary Fund has warned.\nThe IMF said Wednesday that increased government spending, growing public debt and elevated interest rates in the United States had contributed to high and volatile yields — or interest rates — on Treasuries, raising the risk of higher rates elsewhere.\nIts analysis found that a spike in yields on long-term US government bonds is associated with similar surges in government bond yields in other advanced and developing economies, with the latter suffering exchange rate turbulence as well.\n'Loose fiscal policy in the United States exerts upward pressure on global interest rates and the dollar,' Vitor Gaspar, director of the IMF's fiscal affairs department, told reporters. 'It pushes up funding costs in the rest of the world, thereby exacerbating existing fragilities and risks.'\nIt's the second time this week the IMF has fired a shot across the bows of the US government. On Tuesday, it said public spending and borrowing was contributing to an overheating of the US economy, making it harder for the Federal Reserve to defeat inflation.\nHigher interest rates make it more costly for households and businesses to service their loans, which can lead to defaults that cause losses at banks and other lenders, increasing financial instability.\nfinancial instability.

On Tuesday, Treasury yields touched fresh highs for the year after Fed chair Jerome Powell signaled that official interest rates could stay high for a while yet because of persistent inflation in the United States.\nUS consumer prices have been propped up by debt-fueled government spending — including pandemic stimulus — which has boosted households' spending power and turbocharged economic growth.\nLoose US fiscal policy, in addition to increasing the country's already hefty debt burden, could make 'the last mile' of getting inflation back down to the Fed's target harder to achieve, the IMF said.\nthe IMF said. The Washington-based agency is also worried that, if US inflation stays high, it could dash investors' hopes for interest rate cuts, leading to a selloff of financial assets, including stocks and government bonds around the world. A resulting fall in the price of bonds would raise their yields.\nworried that, if US inflation stays high, it could dash investors' hopes for interest rate cuts, leading to a selloff of financial assets, including stocks and government bonds around the world. A resulting fall in the price of bonds would raise their yields. 'Under this scenario, financial conditions would broadly tighten,' Tobias Adrian, director of the IMF's monetary and capital markets department, wrote Tuesday in a blog accompanying the agency's Global Financial Stability Report. 'Globally, borrowers would find it harder to service debt, given higher bond yields,' he added.\nAccording to Gaspar, the problem could be especially acute in low-income countries, where constraints on public finances are 'particularly severe.' 'High and volatile interest rates make the situation worse,' he said.\nThere are risks for the United States too. According to the IMF, investors are demanding higher returns to hold US Treasuries, reflecting their concerns over sustained inflation, the uncertain future path of monetary policy and additional debt issuance in the world's biggest economy.\n'The risk premium on (US) government debt has increased in recent times and may remain high in a context in which debt levels are elevated,' the agency's chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters Tuesday.\nThat means that even if the Fed cuts interest rates later this year — the IMF's central scenario — US government funding costs may not fall by the same margin, he added.\nThat would place further pressure on the government's finances, leaving less money for public services or for absorbing future adverse shocks to the economy, such as financial meltdowns, pandemics or wars.\nThe US government's interest costs on a common measure soared to $659 billion in fiscal year 2023, which ended on September 30, according to the Treasury Department. That's nearly double what it was in fiscal year 2020.\nAnd according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-profit, in fiscal year 2023, the government spent more to service its debt than it did on each of housing, transport and higher education.\nin fiscal year 2023, the government spent more to service its debt than it did on each of housing, transport and higher education. The IMF expects US public debt to continue rising, helping drive government debt worldwide to close to 100% of global gross domestic product by 2029, from 93% last year.\nThe agency called on governments everywhere to exercise 'fiscal restraint' in the world's 'biggest-ever election year.'\n'History shows governments tend to spend more and tax less during election years,' it said.",

Start in the south in Bangalore, India's Silicon Valley, in the fall of 2022. Fly very, very slowly northwards until you reach the Himalayas just before the national elections that started this week.\nYou would witness a country in constant convulsion.\nSoon after take off, you'd see the swish houses and gleaming towers of Bangalore's new tech and corporate elite submerged amid September 2022's monsoon rains. Just a little further north and a few months on in March 2023, record breaking fires tear through Karnataka state's forests, the smoke obscuring vision for days.\nThen, on to the heaving, humid metropolis of Mumbai at summer's onset in April 2023 to find over a dozen people dead, mostly women, due to heat exposure at a large public gathering. Next, entire stretches of Delhi under water from flooding in July.\nThat same summer, hospitals in the sunburnt state of Uttar Pradesh, home to over 240 million people, fill with listless, heat-stroked workers. Finally, the anticipated visual reprieve of the Himalayan snow caps that never comes — instead replaced by an almost snowless winter that continues into 2024.\nThe impacts of India's extreme weather are not neatly contained within the country's borders. This is a global worry. When India introduces wheat export bans due to a heat wave or slows its vaunted IT exports because Bangalore is underwater, the lives of seemingly unconnected millions across the world are affected.\nIndia is the world's third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the US. It is also the world's fastest-growing major economy.\nHow India handles climate change, then, is everyone's concern. But while climate is mentioned in the election manifestos of the two main parties — the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress — it will, perhaps surprisingly, not feature as a major issue in India's six-week-long national election that started this week. That's unlike in Australia, the UK and US, among others, where elections can be significantly influenced by climate policy positions.\nThis is because climate politics looks different in the developing world; it will shape Indian elections in definitive but under-the-radar ways. Climate impacts do shape voter demands — though this tends to filter through as anxieties about livelihood and continued welfare support, rather than in a neatly defined area of politics labeled 'climate.'\nYou can see it in farmers asking for loan waivers and irrigation facilities after years of drought, in urban families demanding reduced electricity prices to offset cooling bills and in calls for more penetrating social welfare.\nHere in the world's most-populous country, the average Indian does not emit very much at present. India's relatively low per-capita carbon emissions of 1.9 tons per person are less than half of the global average of 4.7 tons per person — and several times lower than developed economies.\nThis duality — low per-capita emissions and a rapidly growing economy — also shapes India's climate policy. The incumbent government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has both pushed the rapid deployment of renewables and domestic green manufacturing to create jobs, while continuing to rely on fossil fuels to power the economy. That's fairly similar to previous governments.\nLeaf through the BJP and Congress' election manifestos and you will find several dozen pledges across sectors that could be filed under climate policy, with a roughly even split between the two parties (though their emphases predictably differ).\nStump speeches throughout this campaign season have not featured climate change as a central issue.\nAditya Valiathan Pillai\nBut these are listed across several chapters and rarely mention the word 'climate' (though each has a separate chapter on sustainable development). Similarly, stump speeches throughout this campaign season have not featured climate change as a central issue.\nParties do however focus on climate-adjacent developmental issues — including expanding entitlements for the poorest (which could also help with weather shocks), creating jobs through green manufacturing and reconfiguring Indian agriculture.\nBut politics here seems to reflect the relative insignificance of climate change as a conceptual category in the Indian voter's mind. When tens of thousands of farmers marched through Maharashtra in 2018 after several years of drought across parts of the state, they protested against rising agricultural debt, declining productivity, pests and inadequate irrigation. This was a climate protest in all but slogan.\nTake for example a Muslim woman I spoke with a few years ago from the poorer reaches of North Bengal. Her small house in an informal settlement in Delhi was engulfed in a summer fire, and then a few years later her family home in Bengal was damaged in a monsoon flood.\nShe supports a large family of children and grandchildren as a house cleaner in Delhi's rich neighbourhoods. Despite the fingerprint of climate impacts on her past, her main demands in previous elections were for regular water (which she gets once in two weeks from a water truck), cheaper electricity (she told me she pays around three times the price her rich employers pay because of an illegal connection), and cheaper health care.\nElections turn, then, on meeting developmental exigency. The headwinds of climate change are absorbed by the electoral machine and emerge as end-of-tailpipe policies rather than grand climate strategy.\nThis pattern of climate politics is reinforced by seemingly low recognition in India of climate change as a problem. In a 2022 survey of over 4,500 individuals across the country, over 50% of respondents said they knew little or nothing about climate change. Interestingly, recognition of climate change increased to over 80% in that survey when respondents were supplied with a short description of the phenomenon.\nThe hotch-potch of ad hoc policy fixes that emerges around climate issues will only get the country so far. It fails when put to the long-term test. Mobilizing large amounts of public finance to redesign cities to trap less heat and flood less, for example, requires a genuine public debate about a climate-ravaged future. Immediate investments are necessary to dull the blow tomorrow.\nad hoc policy fixes that emerges around climate issues will only get the country so far. It fails when put to the long-term test.

Despite the fingerprint of climate impacts on her past, her main demands in previous elections were for regular water (which she gets once in two weeks from a water truck), cheaper electricity (she told me she pays around three times the price her rich employers pay because of an illegal connection), and cheaper health care.\nElections turn, then, on meeting developmental exigency. The headwinds of climate change are absorbed by the electoral machine and emerge as end-of-tailpipe policies rather than grand climate strategy.\nThis pattern of climate politics is reinforced by seemingly low recognition in India of climate change as a problem. In a 2022 survey of over 4,500 individuals across the country, over 50% of respondents said they knew little or nothing about climate change. Interestingly, recognition of climate change increased to over 80% in that survey when respondents were supplied with a short description of the phenomenon.\nThe hotch-potch of ad hoc policy fixes that emerges around climate issues will only get the country so far. It fails when put to the long-term test. Mobilizing large amounts of public finance to redesign cities to trap less heat and flood less, for example, requires a genuine public debate about a climate-ravaged future. Immediate investments are necessary to dull the blow tomorrow.\nad hoc policy fixes that emerges around climate issues will only get the country so far. It fails when put to the long-term test.

            "summary": "Washington CNN —\nWashington CNN — Spending at US retailers rose in March for the second consecutive month, underscoring the strength of the US consumer fueled by a robust job market.\nRetail sales rose 0.7% in March from the prior month, a slower pace than February's upwardly revised 0.9% gain, the Commerce Department reported Monday. That beat the 0.4% increase that economists projected, according to a FactSet poll. The figures are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation.\nRetail spending has increased in seven of the past 10 months through March.\nSales were up across several categories in March, including at gas stations, which increased a strong 2.1% from February. Gas prices have steadily risen in the past several weeks. Still, excluding sales at gas stations, retail sales were up 0.6% in March.\nOnline sales jumped 2.7% in March, while specialty stores saw sales increase a solid 2.1%. Spending at restaurants and bars rose 0.4% last month. Meanwhile, sales of electronics, clothes, and sporting goods fell 1.2%, 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively.\n'Today's retail sales figures show strong consumer spending wrapping up the first quarter of 2024,' said Claire Tassin, retail and e-commerce analyst at Morning Consult, in a note Monday. 'In March, promotional activity from e-commerce brands like Amazon helped to drive up online sales.'\nMonday's report adds to evidence that the US economy remains solid, keeping the Federal Reserve in wait-and-see mode. A strong economy means the Fed won't be in a rush to cut rates, especially considering that there are some signs that inflation's progress has stalled in recent months. Fed officials have said they are not yet convinced that inflation is truly headed toward their 2% goal.\n'With inflation running above target, economic growth continuing to show momentum, and elevated prices across a range of asset markets, the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate,' Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid said Friday at a conference in Overland Park, Kansas. He does not vote on interest rate decisions this year.\n'Therefore, rather than preemptively adjust the policy rate, I would prefer to be patient and wait for clear and convincing evidence that inflation is on track to hit our 2% target before adjusting the stance of policy,' he said.\nFor now, interest rates are at a 23-year high after the Fed raised rates aggressively starting two years ago. Analysts at major Wall Street banks have recently pushed back their estimates on the timing of the first rate cut. Goldman Sachs is forecasting the first cut to be in July instead of June, while Bank of America now sees the first cut in December instead of June.\nAmericans have been on a spending spree these past few years and economists argue that will likely continue this year.\nThe US economy grew at a brisk pace last year, thanks to strong consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic growth. Spending has remained solid, even in the face of still-high inflation and elevated interest rates.\n'Households are just not changing their spending patterns, but they've been changing everything else,' Shannon Seery Grein, an economist at Wells Fargo, told CNN previously. 'There has been this change in psyche in which they change everything to fit their spending patterns. They're saving less on a monthly basis, they're pulling out money from other assets such as retirement accounts, we've seen a pickup in Buy Now Pay Later, we've continued to see a pickup in credit card usage and so on.'\n'I think you're going to keep seeing households spend at the rates that they have,' she added.\nThe Commerce Department releases broader figures on consumer spending for March later this month. In February, spending on goods and services advanced 0.8%, the strongest monthly gain in more than a year. Consumer spending hasn't contracted since March 2023.\nAnd as long as the job market remains healthy, so will spending. Employers added a shocking 303,000 jobs in March as the unemployment rate fell to a low 3.8% that month. Annual wage growth, measured as average hourly earnings, slowed last month, but it continued to beat inflation.\nThe US job market is currently one of the strongest in history: Job growth has expanded for 39 straight months, the fifth-longest streak on record, and the unemployment rate has been below 4% for more than a year.",

            "summary": "Washington CNN —\nWashington CNN — Taylor Swift and Beyoncé raked in some serious concert money in 2023. This year, Swift is continuing her legacy tour and other pop stars such as Olivia Rodrigo and Bad Bunny are taking the stage as Americans are expected to continue spending on live music — though at a slower pace than they did last year.\nAmericans splurged on concerts in 2023, selling out major stadiums and driving up hotel revenues. It was remarkable, given that inflation was elevated and interest rates were at their highest in two decades.\nDespite evidence of a slight slowdown this year, (ticket sales for the annual Coachella Valley Music and Arts festival were slower, joining other festivals seeing a similar slowdown in sales, according to Billboard,) there likely won't be a sharp pullback anytime soon.\nThe broader US economy is estimated to remain solid throughout 2024, with Federal Reserve officials expecting it to continue expanding and for unemployment to remain low (but edge higher), according to their latest economic projections.\nThat means fans will have the disposable income needed to snag concert tickets as employers keep pumping out jobs and workers continue to command decent wage growth, according to economists.\nThere has also been a long-term trend of people focusing their spending more on experiences, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic kept fans stuck at home for more than a year. Demand for concerts remains robust and experts say that musicians are capitalizing on that.\n'With the job market and economy holding strong, consumers could continue spending on these tours – and there's certainly still demand,' Liz Anderson, a content strategist at jobs site Appcast, said in a statement to CNN. 'And today's biggest artists are successful businesspeople backed by huge teams of advisors. They aren't stupid – they're looking at the numbers and know when to capitalize on high demand.'\nTickets to see Taylor Swift and Beyoncé last year weren't cheap. That means many fans likely broke the bank in 2023 to see either (or both) of those two artists — in addition to other touring acts last year such as Bruce Springsteen and Coldplay.\nIt stands to reason that those folks probably need to sit on the sidelines and save up some money or pay off their cards first before attending another pricey concert. Not to mention that inflation has continued to take a bite out of people's budget these past few years.\nRelated article US retail sales rose in March for the second-straight month\nRelated article US retail sales rose in March for the second-straight month Beyoncé released 'Cowboy Carter' on March 29, her eighth studio album featuring 27 tracks rooted in country music. Unsurprisingly, the album's songs have already seen massive success, breaking streaming records and ranking highly on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\nThe pop icon hasn't announced a tour to promote the album, but some fans have already begun to speculate on X, joking that she really ought to wait until next year. According to a Fed survey, consumers have indeed become more price sensitive in recent months.\nSwift released her eleventh studio album, 'The Tortured Poets Department,' Friday, and it soared past Beyoncé's streaming record in just a few hours, becoming Spotify's most streamed album in a single day of 2024. Swift's latest set of music was released a 'double album,' consisting of 15 extra tracks.\nBut the economy is still humming along and those fans who might not have had enough dough last year to attend one of Beyoncé's Renaissance tour show, might be able to afford tickets to see their favorite superstar live now.\nConsumer spending is powered by the job market, and US consumers won't stop spending on concerts, unless they absolutely have to because they got laid off or employers are slamming the brakes on hiring, economists say. Neither has happened yet and there is no recession in sight.\nThe United States is one the wealthiest countries in the world, as measured by gross domestic product per capita, according to the latest projections from the International Monetary Fund. It's a trend that's been decades in the making, improving the country's standards of living, which is a key reason for why Americans have enough income to spend on experiences in the first place.\n'If you look at the last 60 years, that growth in wealth is really what has contributed to the middle class getting to a point where there's a lot more disposable income used for experiences,' said Pawan Joshi, senior vice president of products and strategy at business software company E2open.\n'We're going to be growing at a more modest rate, but I would say the resiliency and desire to continue to do what we do is going to always push us to attend these events and create more ways to entertain ourselves,' he added.\nShutdowns during the pandemic and Americans who might have given up on saving for a costly down payment to buy a home, amid a persistently unaffordable housing market, could also be contributing to experiential consumer spending gaining steam.\n'The pandemic did result in a permanent shift in preferences, particularly for younger generations. People used to create a bucket list of what they'd want to handle during retirement, but now they're saying ‘why wait until retirement?'' Jeanelle Johnson, partner and co-leader of the travel, transportation and hospitality sector at PricewaterhouseCoopers, previously told CNN.",

The trip comes after Biden publicly came out last month against a controversial $14 billion deal for Japan's Nippon Steel to purchase US Steel. US Steel shareholders approved the deal last week, but it still needs approval from the Justice Department and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.\nIn March, Biden said it is 'vital' for US Steel 'to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated,' and a senior administration official told reporters that he will reiterate those sentiments in Pittsburgh, saying Biden 'will make that clear again.'\nOfficials downplayed concerns that the potential tariffs could lead to additional inflation.\n'If taken, these actions will not increase inflation, but they will protect American jobs and (the) steel industry,' a senior official said, suggesting there will be 'no impact on inflation at all.'\nResidual inflation 'is not coming from goods,' the official added, and 'these actions will not change that.'\n'Our trade actions are actually strategic and balanced. President Biden will not impose ineffective, across-the-board tariffs that would increase costs and harm hundreds of thousands of jobs,' the official said. 'In fact, the imports of steel from China accounted for about 0.6% of total US steel demand, so it's quite small, and we see no inflationary pass through. But it is important for us to get ahead of China's new export surge and their continued pressure on prices that makes it hard for American steel companies to compete.'\nStill, US consumers will ultimately pay any tariffs on imports, not the exporting country – which can lead to increased prices.\nThe United Steelworkers, a key union representing workers in the steel industry, endorsed Biden's reelection campaign last month.\nBiden's Pennsylvania push comes as he's also seeking to move the needle with voters who continue to hold sour views about the president's handling of the economy. Recent polling has also shown a close contest between Biden and Trump fewer than seven months from Election Day.\nTrump made tariffs against China a central feature of his global economic strategy, and Biden has largely maintained them, despite external criticism. By calling for a tariff hike he says would protect American workers, Biden also appears to be attempting to insulate himself from Trump's criticism that he's weak on China.\nA new tariff hike could threaten Biden's attempts at repairing what has been a tense relationship between the world's two largest economies. China has denied accusations of overcapacity and claims the US is seeking to stifle competition through protectionist trade policies. Biden has sought in recent months to stabilize a fraught relationship with China, including in direct conversations with President Xi Jinping. The efforts appeared to bear fruit this week when Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his counterpart for the first time in a year.\nCNN's Chris Isidore, Arlette Saenz and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.\nCNN's Chris Isidore, Arlette Saenz and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",

            "summary": "Washington CNN —\nWashington\nCNN\n—\nTaylor Swift and Beyoncé raked in some serious concert money in 2023. This year, Swift is continuing her legacy tour and other pop stars such as Olivia Rodrigo and Bad Bunny are taking the stage as Americans are expected to continue spending on live music — though at a slower pace than they did last year.\nAmericans splurged on concerts in 2023, selling out major stadiums and driving up hotel revenues. It was remarkable, given that inflation was elevated and interest rates were at their highest in two decades.\nDespite evidence of a slight slowdown this year, (ticket sales for the annual Coachella Valley Music and Arts festival were slower, joining other festivals seeing a similar slowdown in sales, according to Billboard,) there likely won't be a sharp pullback anytime soon.\nThe broader US economy is estimated to remain solid throughout 2024, with Federal Reserve officials expecting it to continue expanding and for unemployment to remain low (but edge higher), according to their latest economic projections.\nThat means fans will have the disposable income needed to snag concert tickets as employers keep pumping out jobs and workers continue to command decent wage growth, according to economists.\nThere has also been a long-term trend of people focusing their spending more on experiences, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic kept fans stuck at home for more than a year. Demand for concerts remains robust and experts say that musicians are capitalizing on that.\n'With the job market and economy holding strong, consumers could continue spending on these tours – and there's certainly still demand,' Liz Anderson, a content strategist at jobs site Appcast, said in a statement to CNN. 'And today's biggest artists are successful businesspeople backed by huge teams of advisors. They aren't stupid – they're looking at the numbers and know when to capitalize on high demand.'\nDon't fans need to recover financially first?\nTickets to see Taylor Swift and Beyoncé last year weren't cheap. That means many fans likely broke the bank in 2023 to see either (or both) of those two artists — in addition to other touring acts last year such as Bruce Springsteen and Coldplay.\nIt stands to reason that those folks probably need to sit on the sidelines and save up some money or pay off their cards first before attending another pricey concert. Not to mention that inflation has continued to take a bite out of people's budget these past few years.\nBeyoncé released 'Cowboy Carter' on March 29, her eighth studio album featuring 27 tracks rooted in country music. Unsurprisingly, the album's songs have already seen massive success, breaking streaming records and ranking highly on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\nThe pop icon hasn't announced a tour to promote the album, but some fans have already begun to speculate on X, joking that she really ought to wait until next year. According to a Fed survey, consumers have indeed become more price sensitive in recent months.\nSwift released her eleventh studio album, 'The Tortured Poets Department,' Friday, and it soared past Beyoncé's streaming record in just a few hours, becoming Spotify's most streamed album in a single day of 2024. Swift's latest set of music was released a 'double album,' consisting of 15 extra tracks.\nBut the economy is still humming along and those fans who might not have had enough dough last year to attend one of Beyoncé's Renaissance tour show, might be able to afford tickets to see their favorite superstar live now.\nConsumer spending is powered by the job market, and US consumers won't stop spending on concerts, unless they absolutely have to because they got laid off or employers are slamming the brakes on hiring, economists say. Neither has happened yet and there is no recession in sight.\nExperiential consumer spending\nThe United States is one the wealthiest countries in the world, as measured by gross domestic product per capita, according to the latest projections from the International Monetary Fund. It's a trend that's been decades in the making, improving the country's standards of living, which is a key reason for why Americans have enough income to spend on experiences in the first place.\n'If you look at the last 60 years, that growth in wealth is really what has contributed to the middle class getting to a point where there's a lot more disposable income used for experiences,' said Pawan Joshi, senior vice president of products and strategy at business software company E2open.\n'We're going to be growing at a more modest rate, but I would say the resiliency and desire to continue to do what we do is going to always push us to attend these events and create more ways to entertain ourselves,' he added.\nShutdowns during the pandemic and Americans who might have given up on saving for a costly down payment to buy a home, amid a persistently unaffordable housing market, could also be contributing to experiential consumer spending gaining steam.\n'The pandemic did result in a permanent shift in preferences, particularly for younger generations. People used to create a bucket list of what they'd want to handle during retirement, but now they're saying ‘why wait until retirement?'' Jeanelle Johnson, partner and co-leader of the travel, transportation and hospitality sector at PricewaterhouseCoopers, previously told CNN.",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — Not even a beer at the movies is spared from shrinkflation, alleges a lawsuit against Cinemark. And one man is spearheading the fight against what he considers false advertising on his beer pour.\nThe proposed class-action suit, filed this week in a Texas federal court, claims that the theater chain's 24-ounce drink cups can only hold a maximum of 22 ounces, purposely misleading customers.\nAccording to the lawsuit, the lead plaintiff, Shane Waldrop, ordered a 24-ounce beer from a Texas Cinemark theater on Valentine's Day this year and observed that the 24-ounce container did not seem large enough to hold 24 ounces of liquid. Waldrop then took the container home and measured it for himself, finding it only held 22 ounces, according to the lawsuit.\n'This lawsuit is another example of consumers unwittingly overpaying for a supposed benefit they are not receiving,' Jarrett Ellzey, one of Waldrop's attorneys said in a statement to CNN. 'While two ounces may seem inconsequential to the seller, the bottom line is the buyer is not getting what he's promised by the seller.'\nThe lawsuit claims Cinemark's false advertising violates both state and federal laws.\nCNN did not independently verify the size of Cinemark's 24-ounce cups, and Cinemark did not respond to CNN's request for comment.\nConcessions are a major part of a movie theater's business. For Cinemark's most recent reported quarter, concession revenue climbed to $243 million, while admissions revenue was $322.2 million.\nRising prices seem to have boosted that revenue: Cinemark reported concession revenue for 2023 exceeded revenue in 2019 by 3%, even though movie attendance was 25% lower.\nWaldrop's lawsuit claims some of that revenue came through shortchanging customers. A 20-ounce drink at the Plano, Texas, Cinemark theater Waldrop visited costs $7.80 pre-tax, while a 24-ounce drink costs just $1 more, at $8.80.\n'The 24 oz drink should provide a deal for consumers over the 20 oz drink's price: $0.37 per ounce vs. $0.39 per ounce,' the lawsuit said. 'But due to the actual volume of 22 oz available in the '24 oz' drink, the price is $0.40 per ounce making the larger drink more expensive per ounce, which is not a deal at all.'\nDuring times of high inflation, some companies reduce the size of their products to cut costs rather than hiking prices. The practice, known as 'shrinkflation,' has been in the spotlight recently as some packaged food brands faced accusations of quietly engaging in the practice.\nRelated article Even Cookie Monster is complaining about the US economy now\nRelated article Even Cookie Monster is complaining about the US economy now OREO Double Stuf Chocolate Sandwich Cookies saw a 6% decrease in size by weight from January 2019 to October 2023, according to a report from Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in December, using Labor Department data.\n'Consumers are tired of not getting value for their hard-earned money while corporations get a windfall for providing an underperforming product or, as in this case, an incomplete product,' Ellzey said. 'Though often misunderstood, class actions function as a device for changing business bad practices like this.'\n- CNN's Bryan Mena contributed to reporting.\n- CNN's Bryan Mena contributed to reporting.",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — President Joe Biden called on his administration to ratchet up pressure on the Chinese steel industry as he brings his economic competition pitch to Pittsburgh, the heart of the American steel industry, on Wednesday, part of a three-day campaign trail swing through battleground Pennsylvania.\n'The bottom line is I want fair competition with China, not conflict,' Biden said in Pittsburgh on Wednesday. 'And we're in a stronger position to win the economic competition in the 21st century against China, or anywhere else, because we're investing in America and American workers again.'\nThe domestic steel industry remains critical to building everything from cars to appliances, to roads and bridges, and Biden has made investment in American manufacturing a key plank of his economic policy – even as voters continue to give him low marks on his handling of the economy.\nThe president made an economic pitch around tax policy and visited with union workers in his hometown of Scranton on Tuesday, and he will travel to Philadelphia for campaign events on Thursday, seeking to set up a stark split screen as former President Donald Trump spends much of his week in a New York City courtroom for a criminal trial.\nSpeaking from the United Steelworkers headquarters, Biden called on United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai to 'consider tripling' the existing 7.5% tariff rate on Chinese steel and aluminum through a review of the Section 301 tariff rate, pending the conclusion of a four-year review.\nOfficials expect the ongoing review to be completed 'soon,' and Tai could take action to '(enhance) the effectiveness' of the tariffs based on its findings, a senior official said.\nChina's Commerce Ministry responded on Wednesday saying it 'firmly opposes' the continuing review. America's shipbuilding industry lost its competitive advantage many years ago due to over-protection, it claimed, citing multiple US research reports.\nThe US effort is 'full of false accusations, misinterpreting normal trade and investment activities as harming US national security and corporate interests, and blaming China for its own industrial problems. This lacks factual basis and goes against economic common sense,' it said in a statement.\nNational Economic Council director Lael Brainard described Biden's call as 'strategic, balanced, and targeted,' saying it would safeguard the US from China's efforts to undercut domestic steel manufacturing.\n'The president understands we must invest in American manufacturing, but we also have to protect those investments and those workers from unfair exports associated with China's industrial overcapacity,' which, she said, 'poses a serious risk to the future of the American steel and aluminum industry.'\nBrainard said the approach was developed 'in close partnership with industry stakeholders and unions.'\nBiden also highlighted the Department of Commerce's efforts to crack down on China's attempts to 'flood the market with cheap products' through anti-dumping and countervailing duties, among other actions.\n'They're not competing – they're cheating,' Biden said of China. 'They're cheating, and we're seeing the damage here in America.\nThe trip comes after Biden last month publicly opposed a controversial $14 billion deal for Japan's Nippon Steel to purchase US Steel. US Steel shareholders approved the deal last week, but it still needs approval from the Justice Department and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.\nIn March, Biden said it is 'vital' for US Steel 'to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.' He reiterated those sentiments on Wednesday, telling the crowd to cheers that it 'should remain a totally American company.'\n﻿'American-owned, American-operated by American union steelworkers, the best in the world. And that's going to happen, I promise you,' he said.\nOfficials downplayed concerns that the potential tariffs could lead to additional inflation.\n'If taken, these actions will not increase inflation, but they will protect American jobs and (the) steel industry,' a senior official said, suggesting there will be 'no impact on inflation at all.'\nResidual inflation 'is not coming from goods,' the official added, and 'these actions will not change that.'\n'Our trade actions are actually strategic and balanced. President Biden will not impose ineffective, across-the-board tariffs that would increase costs and harm hundreds of thousands of jobs,' the official said. 'In fact, the imports of steel from China accounted for about 0.6% of total US steel demand, so it's quite small, and we see no inflationary pass through. But it is important for us to get ahead of China's new export surge and their continued pressure on prices that makes it hard for American steel companies to compete.'\nStill, US consumers will ultimately pay any tariffs on imports, not the exporting country – which can lead to increased prices.\nThe United Steelworkers, a key union representing workers in the steel industry, endorsed Biden's reelection campaign last month.\nBiden's Pennsylvania push comes as he's also seeking to move the needle with voters who continue to hold sour views about the president's handling of the economy. Recent polling has also shown a close contest between Biden and Trump fewer than seven months from Election Day.\nTrump made tariffs against China a central feature of his global economic strategy, and Biden has largely maintained them, despite external criticism. By calling for a tariff hike he says would protect American workers, Biden also appears to be attempting to insulate himself from Trump's criticism that he's weak on China.\nA new tariff hike could threaten Biden's attempts at repairing what has been a tense relationship between the world's two largest economies. China has denied accusations of overcapacity and claims the US is seeking to stifle competition through protectionist trade policies. Biden has sought in recent months to stabilize a fraught relationship with China, including in direct conversations with President Xi Jinping. The efforts appeared to bear fruit this week when Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his counterpart for the first time in a year.\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the location of where Biden will deliver his remarks on Wednesday.\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the location of where Biden will deliver his remarks on Wednesday.

Opening arguments get underway next week.\nWe can't say exactly who will testify because the prosecution won't tell Trump's team which witnesses they will call first. They anticipate Trump will violate a gag order and trash talk whoever takes the stand.\nWhat we do know is that Trump has already tried to seed a conspiracy theory that the jury is somehow biased against him.

Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images President Joe Biden is preparing a campaign swing through battleground Pennsylvania this week, zeroing in on his plans to raise taxes for the wealthiest Americans and corporations as he looks to present an economic contrast to former President Donald Trump.\nThe push will kick off Tuesday with a major address in Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, campaign officials told CNN, a site he's often turned to as the backdrop for making his economic populist pitch to voters.\n'The address will drive home a simple question: Do you think the tax code should work for rich people or for the middle class?' a campaign official told CNN. 'The president has made it clear what he thinks the answer is, and so has Donald Trump.' Biden then will travel to the Pittsburgh area on Wednesday and speak at a campaign event in Philadelphia on Thursday, officials said. The campaign also plans to hold events in other battleground states next week to push the economic case against Trump, who is required to be in a New York City courtroom for jury selection at his hush money trial.\nBiden's campaign swing, the first since his March barnstorm of battleground states that will effectively serve as counterprogramming to Trump's trial, comes as both men are trying to win over working-class voters. By focusing on taxes, the president also is attempting to break through on economic issues at a time when voters have maintained pessimistic views of their personal financial state and his handling of the economy, which has proven to be a vexing political issue in his reelection bid.",

The only thing that must always be clear is that competition must be fair,' Scholz told students at Tongji University in Shanghai.\n'In other words, that there is no dumping, that there is no overproduction, that copyrights are not infringed,' Scholz said, adding it was important to allow companies to set up production facilities locally without bureaucratic hurdles.\n'And that's why whenever I'm in China and I say level playing field, of course we want our companies to have no restrictions,' he said.\nScholz also said small countries should not have to live in fear of big countries and that borders should not be changed by force, but did not mention China by name.\nScholz is due to meet President Xi Jinping on Tuesday and question him about China's support for Russia's wartime economy, two years after Moscow unleashed its invasion of Ukraine.\nThe German government and German businesses are also wary of any potential future conflict over Taiwan.\n'One of these principles is that we should not be afraid of our neighbors,' he told students, comparing global values and relations between countries to neighborly relations.\n'We want that in our own lives. If our neighbor is a big, strong, muscular person, then we always want to say hello and be sure that he will never hurt us.'",

And the company has created more than 200,000 jobs in Vietnam, it added.\nAccording to the statement, Cook said Apple 'stands ready … to enhance cooperation and investment activities' in the Southeast Asian country.\nRelated article How booming Vietnam offers the US an alternative to China\nRelated article How booming Vietnam offers the US an alternative to China His visit highlights Vietnam's growing importance to global companies looking for alternatives to China as trade tensions between Beijing and the West have escalated in recent years.\nVietnam has been a 'major beneficiary' of moves by multinational companies to diversify their manufacturing hubs — a strategy known as 'China plus one' — says Thuy Anh Nguyen, a strategist at Dragon Capital, a local fund management firm that invests solely in Vietnamese companies.\nNguyen, whose firm manages $6 billion in assets, told CNN that labor costs in Vietnam's manufacturing sector are about half those in neighboring China.\nThat has helped Vietnam go from producing mostly 'low-value products' like textiles to more tech products like iPhones and iPads, she said. 'Those are higher-value items. That's how we move up the value chain.'\nVietnam pulled in more than $4.29 billion in foreign direct investment during the first two months of the year, up almost 39% from the same period in 2023, according to the country's Ministry of Planning and Investment. Most of the new investment went into the processing and manufacturing sector.\nIn recent years, fast-growing Asian economies like Vietnam and India have emerged as alternative locations for manufacturers as ties between Beijing and the West have frayed.\nVietnam is 'the perfect landing spot for tech companies to diversify outside China,' according to Dan Ives, a senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, who pointed to the high number of trained engineers in the country as one factor .\n. 'We're not just talking about (manufacturing of) low-cost electronics,' he told CNN. 'We're talking higher up the value chain… That was not even on the radar (of foreign companies) two years ago.'\nOnce enemies in war, the United States and Vietnam have grown increasingly close — the value of US imports of Vietnamese goods s﻿oared more than 360% in the decade to end-2023 to top $144 billion, according to US government data.\nIn September, the two countries formally upgraded their diplomatic ties to a 'comprehensive strategic partnership,' a symbolic yet highly important move that positions Vietnam as a destination for more US investment, including for critical technologies like semiconductor chips.\nIntel (INTC) has also taken note of Vietnam's rise. In 2021, the company committed $1.5 billion to a sprawling campus just outside Ho Chi Minh City, which it says will be its largest single assembly and test facility in the world.\nAt the same time, relations between the United States and China have deteriorated. A trade war between the two countries, which began in 2018 when Washington slapped tariffs on many Chinese imports, ratcheted up last year as both sides introduced tit-for-tat chipmaking export controls.\nexport controls. During the pandemic, meanwhile, China's strict zero-Covid policy scrambled global supply chains, demonstrating the risks of concentrating production in a single location.\nNotably, the world's biggest iPhone factory, located in central China and owned by Taiwanese manufacturing firm Foxconn, was forced to temporarily shut down in 2022 after workers revolted over fears of the spread of coronavirus.\nVietnam has another advantage, says Nguyen: A booming, educated, and youthful population. That's a big draw for foreign tech companies looking to hire workers for their factories, and find consumers for their products.\n'Vietnam has a population of 100 million people. If it was in Europe, it would be the biggest country,' she said, also noting that smartphone adoption in Vietnam was rapidly increasing.\nThe International Monetary Fund expects Vietnam's economy to growth 5.8% this year, much faster than the predicted global average of 3.2%. For 2025, the fund forecasts growth of 6.5% in Vietnam. That's not far off India's pace of expansion.\nof 6.5% in Vietnam. That's not far off India's pace of expansion. Still, Vietnam represents a far smaller market than India, which has also been wooing large foreign companies, including Tesla (TSLA), to set up factories in the country.\nFor now, Vietnam's attractiveness to foreign firms is 'more around supply than demand,' says Ives at Wedbush Securities, while, for India, it encompasses both.\nJuliana Liu contributed reporting.\nJuliana Liu contributed reporting.",

Hong Kong CNN —\nHong Kong CNN — In a slick video marking the National Security Education Day, China's top spy agency has a stern message for Chinese people: foreign spies are everywhere.\nAs ominous music plays, a broad-faced, beady-eyed man disguises himself as a street fashion photographer, a lab technician, a businessman and a food delivery driver – he even sets up an online honey trap – to glean sensitive state secrets in various places and industries.\n'In the sea of people, you may have never noticed him. His identity is changeable and his whereabouts are hard to find,' a narrator says. 'They are everywhere, cunning… and sneaky, and they may be right here in our lives.'\nEventually, Chinese police catch the spy in a dramatic ambush after state security authorities receive multiple tip-offs from the public.\n'They can disguise as anyone. But among the crowds you and I together are protecting national security,' the narrator concludes. 'We 1.4 billion people are 1.4 billion lines of defense.'\nThe three-minute video is the latest propaganda push by China's powerful civilian spy agency, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), to mentally arm the Chinese public against what it sees as the growing threat of foreign espionage.\nUnder Xi Jinping, China's most authoritarian leader in decades, the country's notoriously secretive spy agency has drastically raised its public profile and broadened its remit.\nFrom a shadowy organization without any discernable public face, the MSS has been transformed into a highly visible presence in public life.\nIn Chinese cities, posters and slogans promoting national security are now a common sight on sidewalks, subway trains, campuses and billboards. On social media, the ministry commands a massive following with near-daily commentaries, short videos or even comic strips sounding the alarm about supposedly ubiquitous threats to the country.\nAccording to the MSS, foreign spies are omnipresent and infiltrating everything – from mapping apps to weather stations. The ministry has also posted details of what it claims are espionage activities carried out by American and British spy agencies, and detailed how Chinese nationals studying or working abroad have allegedly been recruited by the CIA.\nLast week, as part of a documentary to mark National Security Education Day, the MSS revealed that a Chinese scientist convicted of selling state secrets to a foreign intelligence agency was executed in 2016. The documentary did not explicitly mention which country, but its images show an American flag and the US Capitol building.\nThe MSS' transformation is part of Xi's sweeping pivot to ramp up national security in the face of heightened geopolitical tensions and mounting domestic challenges.\nAs US-China relations fray, the MSS has undertaken significant efforts to provide guidance to other government agencies and broader society, said Xuezhi Guo, a professor of political science at Guilford College in the US.\n'These endeavors aim to foster anti-espionage awareness and enhance security measures in light of the evolving landscape of espionage threats,' he said. 'The goal is to empower Chinese citizens and entities with the knowledge and skills required to bolster their vigilance and preempt espionage activities effectively.'\nThe emphasis on external threats also helps Beijing deflect criticism at home over its own policies by shifting blame onto 'foreign forces' – a playbook the Chinese government has repeatedly applied during periods of public discontent, most recently over protests in late 2022 against Xi's hardline measures to prevent Covid.\nAnd the spy agency's extending reach is a sign of the increasing securitization of Chinese life and society under Xi, where 'an incredibly wide array of issues can be viewed as threats to national security,' said Sheena Chestnut Greitens, director of the Asia Policy Program at the University of Texas at Austin.\nThe MSS was born out of a reassessment of China's national security needs in the early 1980s, as the country emerged from decades of political upheaval and self-imposed isolation under Chairman Mao Zedong to embrace market reforms and open up to the world.\nIt was founded in 1983 by merging an intelligence department of the ruling Chinese Communist Party and a counterespionage unit in the police force. It oversees intelligence and counterintelligence both within China and overseas, with provincial and municipal branches extending throughout the country.\nIt is often likened to a combined CIA and FBI, though the MSS long operated under a heavier veil of secrecy, without an official website or any publicly listed contacts or spokesperson.\nBut China's spy agency has gradually stepped out of the shadows as Xi makes national security a key priority.\nIn 2015, the MSS established its first public point of contact by setting up a hotline and a website to encourage people to report any suspected threats to state security. In the same year, China designated April 15 as National Security Education Day.\nAnd in 2020, the ministry started to churn out promotional materials – from posters to animations – under a dedicated office named the National Security Propaganda Studio.\nThe following year, the MSS gave an unprecedented written Q&A to state media, introducing its role and recruitment channels to the public for the first time. Later in the year, an official in charge of the spy agency's educational and propaganda work showed up on the prime-time news program of state broadcaster CCTV – a rare appearance that was noted by state media.\nThe most drastic move came last August when the agency made its social media debut: it launched an official account on WeChat, China's most popular social app, with a rallying call for 'all members of society' to join its fight against foreign infiltration. Its posts regularly rack up hundreds of thousands of views and are widely shared by state media outlets.\nAnd this year, the ministry dialed up its multimedia activity. In January, it launched a comic strip series called 'Shenyin Special Investigation Squad,' featuring a team of five secret police officers hunting down foreign spies – plots it said were inspired by real-life counterespionage operations.\nIn one installment, a group of foreign-looking characters are tracked by the secret police as they try to extract strategic rare earth metals under the guise of survey work for real estate development; in another, an undercover MSS agent gets a job at a consulting firm to investigate its suspicious deeds, including its connections with experts in key sensitive fields.\n'MSS' decision to establish a social media presence is an anomaly given its traditionally low profile,' said Greitens at the University of Texas, who has studied China's security apparatus.\nOne reason for the change may be the minister of state security, Chen Yixin, who was appointed in late 2022, according to Greitens.\nChen is widely seen as a trusted aide of Xi, having served under him for years when Xi was a provincial official in Zhejiang province. And he has a track record of using social media to drive home the official message.\n'Chen has been saying for years that new media are important to guide public opinion on the party's political-legal and national security work. So, part of this appears to be him putting his personal stamp on the Ministry's work,' Greitens said.\nIn addition, China's National Security Commission – a powerful body headed by Xi – approved a document on enhancing public education around national security work last May, which 'seems to provide high-level cover for MSS' course of action here,' she added.\nThe MSS's warnings appear aimed at a wide variety of targets.\nIn one post from last year, the agency said it had discovered hundreds of 'illegal' weather stations that were spying for foreign countries, including around sensitive sites such as military bases, defense companies' property and major grain-producing regions.\nIn another, the agency warned against commentaries that seek to 'denigrate' the Chinese economy through 'false narratives' that promote China's decline – calling such criticism an attempt to attack its socialist system and 'strategically contain and suppress China.'\n'Things that might have previously been considered purely scientific or purely in the realm of business and economics now have this securitized layer to them,' Greitens said. 'Whether it's the collection of data, or market research by a foreign consulting firm.'\nLast May, CCTV reported state security authorities had raided several offices of Capvision, an international consultancy firm with headquarters in Shanghai and New York. It came after authorities raided the Beijing office of US firm Mintz Group, which specializes in corporate due diligence, while detaining five of its local staff, and questioned employees at the Shanghai branch of American consultancy firm Bain.\nThe broad scope of threats on the MSS' radar is closely linked to Xi's 'comprehensive national security concept,' an overarching framework that includes more than 20 components to state security. It covers everything from politics, economy, defense, culture and ecology to cyberspace, big data and artificial intelligence, and extends from the deep sea and the polar regions to space.\nChina has also broadened its already sweeping counterespionage law, casting a wider net over what the state deems as potential acts of spying.\nIt now encompasses 'a much broader range of activities, including what some in the foreign business community perceive as ordinary, everyday business behaviors,' said Guo at Guilford College. 'This expansion also extends to the state's authority to investigate and seize electronic devices, computers, and digital assets, raising heightened concerns about cybersecurity.'\nChina's heightened focus on national security stems not only from what it sees as a deteriorating international environment – especially its great-power rivalry with the US, but also concerns about the slowing Chinese economy. The property crisis and unpaid salaries have already sparked sporadic protests, and a worsening economic downturn could risk triggering further domestic unrest.\nThrough the emphasis on national security, Guo said, Xi strategically redirects part of the criticism and blame for his policy failures onto external forces.\nThe MSS' propaganda and education campaigns – as well as its generous cash rewards for national security tip-offs – have spurred enthusiasm online for catching foreign spies.\nOn Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, influencers have rushed to produce short videos teaching their followers how to identify spies. In the comment sections, users shared their own experiences of reporting or encountering a suspected spy.\nOn Xiaohongshu, China's Instagram-like platform, a young woman caused a stir last year after she called the MSS' hotline to report her boyfriend as a suspected spy. The blogger had been encouraged to do so by commentators after she said in an earlier post that her boyfriend could not remember the exact lyrics and tunes of China's national anthem. 'Ladies, is it normal if your boyfriend can't sing the national anthem?' she asked in the post.\nGreitens noted that past examples from other countries have shown over-encouraging or incentivizing citizens to report on potential security threats can backfire.\n'The tendency is to over-report,' Greitens said. 'What happens then is you can actually get lots of false positives in a system that can end up having a really corrosive long-term effect … the potential effects for Chinese citizens and foreign businesses could really start to accumulate quickly.'\nThe relentless warnings from the MSS and its expanding powers have already raised alarms in the international business community, at a time when the Chinese government is trying to woo foreign investment to help revitalize a slowing economy.\nLast month, a day after Xi hosted a group of American executives in Beijing and less than a week after the annual China Development Forum attended by about 100 global CEOs, the MSS released a dramatic video warning the public to stay vigilant against foreign consultancy firms working as a cover for foreign intelligence services.\nThe six-minute 'micro movie,' which the agency says is based on real events, shows a consultancy working on behalf of an unidentified foreign spy agency to steal commercial secrets from a Chinese company seeking to go public abroad – and gleaning sensitive information about government industrial subsidies and the Chinese air force.\nExperts say such videos risk undermining Beijing's central message that China is trying to lower barriers for foreign business and investment.\n'This is indicative of the conflicting messages coming from the top, as well as an unreasonable overemphasis on national security issues that is driving foreign investors away,' said James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based partner at American law firm Perkins Coie LLP.\n'The ambiguity of the laws and lack of judicial oversight to prevent the security agencies from overreaching, creates much uncertainty for foreign companies.'\nFollowing China's crackdown on the consulting industry, most foreign consultancies have adjusted to the new environment, with some moving potentially controversial due-diligence or fact-finding work outside of mainland China, Zimmerman said.\n'Some that remain in China are getting called in for ‘tea,'' he added, referring to a euphemism for police questioning. 'Not because they are under investigation, but to have a chilling effect and as a reminder that they, too are being watched by the security agencies.'\nSince starting his unprecedented third term in power in late 2022, Xi has repeatedly urged officials to balance development and security, calling security 'the foundation of development.' But the highly visible warnings and raids by the MSS have fueled concerns among foreign businesses that, should the two appear to conflict, security will take precedence.\nThe MSS is 'driven more by politics than reality or good common sense,' Zimmerman said. 'But this is China with Xi Jinping characteristics.'",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — Most employers must offer 'reasonable accommodations' to workers related to pregnancy or childbirth, including providing time off for an abortion, according to a final rule issued Monday by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\nThe rule clarifies the provisions of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which became law last June after Congress passed it as part of a federal government spending package in late 2022. The measures apply to employers with at least 15 workers unless the accommodations would cause 'undue hardship' for the employer.\nThe law provides pregnant and postpartum workers with a variety of protections, including time off for recovery from childbirth, prenatal or postnatal appointments and postpartum depression and accommodations related to seating, light duty, breaks for food, water and restroom needs, breastfeeding and miscarriage. Employers are not required to offer paid time off.\nThe question of including abortion in the act's definition of 'pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions' sparked a flurry of comments to the commission, with about 54,000 of them urging the commission to exclude abortion and about 40,000 comments asking to include it.\nThe agency noted in the rule that the law cannot be used to require a job-based health plan to pay for any procedure, including an abortion. It specified that the act is a workplace anti-discrimination law.\n'With respect to abortion, the PWFA's requirements are narrow and will likely concern only a request by a qualified employee for leave from work,' the commission said in a statement.\nThe final rule clarifies to employers and workers who is covered, what types of limitations and medical conditions are covered and how workers can ask for reasonable accommodations. It also provides many examples of accommodations and encourages employers and workers to communicate early and frequently about the requests.\nAdvocates have been fighting to improve federal protections for pregnant workers for more than a decade, saying that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act is inadequate and that most pregnancy-related conditions are not considered disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The US Chamber of Commerce was among the supporters of the law.\n'Today with these final rules, we have achieved a huge step forward for women's economic security, maternal health, and the economy as a whole,' Dina Bakst, co-president of A Better Balance, a national legal advocacy organization, said in a statement. 'The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a life-changing protection for pregnant and postpartum workers nationwide, ensuring they aren't forced off the job or denied the accommodations they need for their health.'",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — Globe-trotters are on the move again in a big way, boosting the rankings of a handful of international aviation hubs on the list of the world's busiest airports.\nThere's no change at the top of the list. The No. 1 airport for passenger volume in 2023, Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International, has held that position every year — except pandemic-walloped 2020 — for more than two decades.\nBut for the first time, Dubai takes the No. 2 ranking, according to Airports Council International's preliminary rankings for 2023, released on Monday.\n'Dubai served around 87 million passengers in 2023. That is a year-to-year increase of 31%, and that is 1% higher than 2019. And they connected 262 destinations around 104 countries to 102 international carriers,' said Luis Felipe de Oliveira, ACI World's director general.\nThe airport's jump up from No. 5 in 2022 is representative of a big growth area in aviation, with industry expansion in emerging and developing economies in the Middle East and Asia Pacific expected at more than twice the rate of advanced economies in the decades to come, de Oliveira said.\nBut Atlanta doesn't have too much to worry about for now. With 104.7 million passengers in 2023, Dubai's not nipping at its heels just yet.\nThat figure is still about 5% below ATL's pre-pandemic 2019 passenger total, but de Oliveira said ACI expects Atlanta to serve about 110 million passengers in 2024 – bringing the airport back to 2019 passenger levels.\nGlobally, passenger traffic in 2023 grew by 27% from 2022 to reach nearly 94% of 2019 results, with domestic travel rebounding more quickly from the pandemic — growing by 20% from 2022 to reach almost 97% of 2019 levels.\nThe world's largest domestic market, the United States, had four more airports – all with significant domestic passenger shares – in the top 10 in 2023: Dallas/Fort Worth (No. 3), Denver (No. 6), Los Angeles (No. 8) and Chicago O'Hare (No. 9).\nBut in 2023, it was the international market that drove recovery, growing about 37% to reach about 90% of 2019 figures. And while Dubai is the No. 2 airport for overall traffic, it's No. 1 in the world for international passengers. Plus, it has evolved into a destination in its own right.\nLondon Heathrow, another strong international player, jumped up from No. 8 in 2022 to No. 4 last year. But it was Tokyo Haneda in Japan that made the biggest leap – from No. 16 to No. 5, thanks largely to Japan's reopening. It's a welcome indicator that Asia's passenger numbers are getting back on track, de Oliveira said.\nIstanbul's airport held steady at No. 7, and Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi dropped one spot from No. 9 in 2022 to No. 10 last year. India, with an enormous population and an increasingly connected aviation network, is an example of growth in the industry's 'capillarity' in different parts of the world.\n'In the US, you have a very good capillarity in the system – the small, medium and big airports connecting with each other. We don't have that in many parts of the world,' de Oliveira said.\nBut it's growing rapidly in India, he said, with Air India and IndiGo buying hundreds of aircraft and the government investing in the country's more than 140 airports.\nThe 2023 global total passengers figure is close to 8.5 billion, according to ACI's preliminary figures.\nThe global outlook is 'very positive' for continued growth. 'In 2020, we lost like 20 years of development of the aviation sector in one year, so we are recovering very fast considering that,' de Oliveira said.\nIn 2023, the system was able to cope better with surging demand than it did earlier in the pandemic rebound, he said, although there are still some pressure points, including a shortage of US air traffic controllers.\nThere's also very high demand for new, more efficient aircraft to reduce fuel costs and increase sustainability.\nIn addition to the most recent production slowdowns precipitated by issues with Boeing aircraft, supply chain slowdowns have contributed to a backlog of orders. The supply chain issues have improved, but the backlog is still significant, de Oliveira said.\nAircraft delivery delays could affect growth if airlines aren't able to cope with demand, but he added that airlines are consequently likely to delay retiring less efficient planes to continue to meet strong demand.\nEverything that happened as a result of the pandemic has underlined the importance of being ready for future issues, de Oliveira said, and ACI is working with member airports to become more resilient.\n'That is always with the focus on the passenger … We have this ecosystem, if the ecosystem doesn't work well, the passenger suffers.'\n1.

            "summary": "President Joe Biden's main pitch to voters ahead of November is simple: They should vote for him because he is not Donald Trump. In speeches and political events since his reelection campaign began in earnest earlier this year, Biden had said that his second term would essentially be a continuation of his first: 'Let's finish this job,' Biden said in a video announcing his reelection campaign last year. In making his case to voters, Biden has contrasted his own ideas of governance with Trump's stated plans to drastically alter how the federal government works, how executive power would be used and how America's role on the world stage will change if the former president wins a second term. Biden, meanwhile, has promised to protect American democracy, pass a federal law to codify the right to an abortion into law, preserve the country's international alliances and agreements and deliver on climate benchmarks. His ability to deliver on these promises even if he wins a second term, though, is not a certainty. Many of his more lofty ambitions would require congressional approval and action. In some of his most significant and enduring acts as president, Trump appointed three conservative nominees to the Supreme Court. The ensuing right-wing supermajority paved the way for the court's 2022 decision that overturned Roe. V Wade, which had enshrined the right to an abortion in federal law for nearly half a century. Biden has made the court's decision, and Trump's repeated promises to go further in restricting abortion access if he were to win in November, a centerpiece of his reelection campaign. 'Like most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right,' Biden said during his State of the Union address on March 7. '… But my predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. He's the reason it was overturned — in fact, he brags about it.' 'Look at the chaos that has resulted,' Biden added. During the speech, Biden promised to codify the abortion-related protections enshrined in Roe v. Wade into federal law if he wins a second term, but he acknowledged that would require the cooperation of a Democratic-controlled Congress. 'If Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again,' Biden said. Biden called for codifying Roe into law when he was running for president in 2020. While seeking office in 2020, Biden made ambitious climate-related promises, warning that climate change presents an existential threat to humanity. Some of those promises panned out: Biden's landmark legislative achievements, the bipartisan infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act, include hundreds of billions of dollars to encourage clean energy production and the manufacturing of electric vehicles. Pollution-falling emissions fell by 2% in the United States last year. Activists on Biden's left flank still think the president has not done enough — they want Biden to declare a climate emergency that would free up federal resources to confront climate change. Biden will need more time to fulfill some of his other pledges, including cutting emissions in half by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, and having a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. Biden said the 2020 race was a 'battle for the soul of the nation.' Now, he has made preserving democracy the focal point of his 2024 campaign — saying the value Americans place on a free and democratic society is the most important question of our country's time. He lays out the stakes in stark terms: If Trump wins a second term, the United States will face a crisis that could lead to the erosion of democratic norms. 'Not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault here at home as they are today,' Biden said during his State of the Union address last month. Today, he warned, there are 'forces taking us back in time.' Biden urged Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. The acts, which would have made Election Day a federal holiday, bolstered voting-related security measures, allowed all voters to request mail-in ballots and updated parts of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, were blocked by Senate Republicans in 2021. 'Pass and send me the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act,' Biden told Congress during his address, 'and stop denying another core value of America — our diversity across American life.' Biden has criticized Republican-led drives to ban certain books from public schools. 'Banning books – it's wrong,' he said in his State of the Union address. The United States, he said, shouldn't be erasing history. In the same speech, Biden also called for expanded pre-kindergarten for 3- and 4-year-olds, along with raises for teachers in public schools. He said he wants to continue making college more affordable by expanding access to Pell grants for working-class families, renewing a 2020 promise he made to double the grants' value. 'To remain the strongest economy in the world,' Biden said, 'we need the best education system in the world.' In some of his first actions as president, Biden worked to return the United States to the presence it held on the world stage before Trump became president. As president, Trump denigrated alliances like NATO and withdrew the United States from crucial international agreements, including the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accords. While running in 2020, Biden promised to undo damage wreaked by Trump on America's international partnerships. Biden has said he will continue to repair relationships that have faltered under Trump's control — and uphold American commitments to NATO and Ukraine. Trump, meanwhile, has said he would encourage Russia to do 'whatever the hell they want' to NATO-member countries who don't fulfill certain funding obligations. Biden frequently refers to those comments while speaking with supporters. 'The rest of the world is wondering what in the hell is happening to us,' Biden said at a campaign event in New York last month. 'And they're relieved, not because I'm so special but that I'm not Trump.' In an earlier Dallas fundraiser, Biden said the United States' international reputation was 'crushed when (Trump) was president.' 'Imagine what will happen if he's reelected,' Biden said. In 2022, Biden signed the most comprehensive gun-reform legislation in nearly 30 years. The law, passed shortly after a White supremacist massacred 10 people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket, allocated more than $750 million to help states implement crisis-intervention programs, closed certain loopholes in existing gun-control legislation and required more thorough reviews for people aged 18 to 21 who wanted to buy firearms. Biden has said he wants to go further. 'I'm demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,' Biden said at his State of the Union address. 'Pass universal background checks. None of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners.' He made a similar promise while running in 2020 but has not been able to get Congress' support. Biden has homed in on Trump's statements suggesting he would be open to cutting programs like Social Security and Medicare. In an interview with CNBC last month, Trump said: 'There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements,' Trump said on CNBC. Biden responded on X: 'Not on my watch.' He reiterated his vow to protect Social Security during his State of the Union address. 'Many of my Republican friends want to put Social Security on the chopping block,' Biden said 'If anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age I will stop them.' 'I will protect and strengthen Social Security and make the wealthy pay their fair share,' he added. ``\nPresident Joe Biden's main pitch to voters ahead of November is simple: They should vote for him because he is not Donald Trump.\nIn speeches and political events since his reelection campaign began in earnest earlier this year, Biden had said that his second term would essentially be a continuation of his first: 'Let's finish this job,' Biden said in a video announcing his reelection campaign last year.\nIn making his case to voters, Biden has contrasted his own ideas of governance with Trump's stated plans to drastically alter how the federal government works, how executive power would be used and how America's role on the world stage will change if the former president wins a second term.\nBiden, meanwhile, has promised to protect American democracy, pass a federal law to codify the right to an abortion into law, preserve the country's international alliances and agreements and deliver on climate benchmarks.\nHis ability to deliver on these promises even if he wins a second term, though, is not a certainty.

Wade got it right,' Biden said during his State of the Union address on March 7. '… But my predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. He's the reason it was overturned — in fact, he brags about it.'\n'Look at the chaos that has resulted,' Biden added.\nDuring the speech, Biden promised to codify the abortion-related protections enshrined in Roe v. Wade into federal law if he wins a second term, but he acknowledged that would require the cooperation of a Democratic-controlled Congress.\n'If Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again,' Biden said.\nBiden called for codifying Roe into law when he was running for president in 2020.\nWhile seeking office in 2020, Biden made ambitious climate-related promises, warning that climate change presents an existential threat to humanity.\nSome of those promises panned out: Biden's landmark legislative achievements, the bipartisan infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act, include hundreds of billions of dollars to encourage clean energy production and the manufacturing of electric vehicles. Pollution-falling emissions fell by 2% in the United States last year.\nActivists on Biden's left flank still think the president has not done enough — they want Biden to declare a climate emergency that would free up federal resources to confront climate change.\nBiden will need more time to fulfill some of his other pledges, including cutting emissions in half by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, and having a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.\nBiden said the 2020 race was a 'battle for the soul of the nation.' Now, he has made preserving democracy the focal point of his 2024 campaign — saying the value Americans place on a free and democratic society is the most important question of our country's time.\nHe lays out the stakes in stark terms: If Trump wins a second term, the United States will face a crisis that could lead to the erosion of democratic norms.\n'Not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault here at home as they are today,' Biden said during his State of the Union address last month. Today, he warned, there are 'forces taking us back in time.'\nBiden urged Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. The acts, which would have made Election Day a federal holiday, bolstered voting-related security measures, allowed all voters to request mail-in ballots and updated parts of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, were blocked by Senate Republicans in 2021.\n'Pass and send me the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act,' Biden told Congress during his address, 'and stop denying another core value of America — our diversity across American life.'\nBiden has criticized Republican-led drives to ban certain books from public schools.\n'Banning books – it's wrong,' he said in his State of the Union address. The United States, he said, shouldn't be erasing history.\nIn the same speech, Biden also called for expanded pre-kindergarten for 3- and 4-year-olds, along with raises for teachers in public schools.\nHe said he wants to continue making college more affordable by expanding access to Pell grants for working-class families, renewing a 2020 promise he made to double the grants' value.\n'To remain the strongest economy in the world,' Biden said, 'we need the best education system in the world.'\nIn some of his first actions as president, Biden worked to return the United States to the presence it held on the world stage before Trump became president. As president, Trump denigrated alliances like NATO and withdrew the United States from crucial international agreements, including the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accords.\nWhile running in 2020, Biden promised to undo damage wreaked by Trump on America's international partnerships. Biden has said he will continue to repair relationships that have faltered under Trump's control — and uphold American commitments to NATO and Ukraine.\nTrump, meanwhile, has said he would encourage Russia to do 'whatever the hell they want' to NATO-member countries who don't fulfill certain funding obligations. Biden frequently refers to those comments while speaking with supporters.\n'The rest of the world is wondering what in the hell is happening to us,' Biden said at a campaign event in New York last month. 'And they're relieved, not because I'm so special but that I'm not Trump.'\nIn an earlier Dallas fundraiser, Biden said the United States' international reputation was 'crushed when (Trump) was president.'\n'Imagine what will happen if he's reelected,' Biden said.\nIn 2022, Biden signed the most comprehensive gun-reform legislation in nearly 30 years.\nThe law, passed shortly after a White supremacist massacred 10 people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket, allocated more than $750 million to help states implement crisis-intervention programs, closed certain loopholes in existing gun-control legislation and required more thorough reviews for people aged 18 to 21 who wanted to buy firearms.\nBiden has said he wants to go further.\n'I'm demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,' Biden said at his State of the Union address. 'Pass universal background checks. None of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners.'\nHe made a similar promise while running in 2020 but has not been able to get Congress' support.\nBiden has homed in on Trump's statements suggesting he would be open to cutting programs like Social Security and Medicare.\nIn an interview with CNBC last month, Trump said: 'There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements,' Trump said on CNBC. Biden responded on X: 'Not on my watch.'\nHe reiterated his vow to protect Social Security during his State of the Union address.\n'Many of my Republican friends want to put Social Security on the chopping block,' Biden said 'If anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age I will stop them.'\n'I will protect and strengthen Social Security and make the wealthy pay their fair share,' he added.\n``",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — Everyone knows the familiar shapes that make up New York's skyline. There's the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building.\nAnd now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week.\nStretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin.\nWhite columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show.\nAbove, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities.\nAdams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help 'supercharge our economy and expand New York City's iconic skyline,' building on 'continued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world's most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.'\nArchitects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick's Cathedral and Grand Central Station.\nAs New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city's recovery.\n'This investment opens a new chapter for Midtown — and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,' said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi.\n'Midtown's revitalization is being led by its public realm — including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,' Joshi added.\nJoshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home.\nThis has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers — who often take out huge loans to finance projects — to make good on their repayments.\nThe project will begin the city's public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.\nand the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.",

Boeing, which has seen its once pristine reputation for safety and engineering quality badly diminished recently, held the briefing Monday to try to pre-emptively answer Salehpour, although the executives said they wouldn't comment directly on his allegations.\nBoeing has faced more than five years of questions about the safety and quality of its commercial jets following two fatal crashes of a different model, the 737 Max, in 2018 and 2019. Those crashes killed 346 people and led to a 20-month grounding of that jet.\nIt came under renewed scrutiny earlier this year after a door plug blew out on an 737 Max flight by Alaska Airlines on January 5, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet.

            "summary": "Washington CNN —\nWashington CNN — A potential US ban against TikTok took a major step toward becoming reality on Saturday as House lawmakers approved a hot-button bill targeting the app as part of a wide-ranging aid package for Israel and Ukraine.\nThe bipartisan vote of 360-58 marks the latest defeat for TikTok in Washington, as the embattled social media company with 170 million US users fights for survival under its current ownership by ByteDance, its Chinese parent company.\nThe bill passed by the House this weekend closely resembles an earlier version approved in March that would ban TikTok from US app stores unless it finds a new owner, and quickly.\nBy attaching the TikTok bill to funding for Ukrainian military equipment and Israeli missile defense, House Republicans put the pressure on Senate lawmakers to consider the whole package in a single up-or-down vote.\nPolicy analysts expect the Senate to take up the aid package quickly, giving it high odds of passage. And President Joe Biden has previously said he would sign the TikTok legislation if it reaches his desk.\nThe fast-tracking of the TikTok bill shows how policy priorities outside the company's control have merged to create a potent and potentially devastating outcome for an app that's beloved by many young Americans but that US officials say is a national security risk.\nThe version of the bill approved Saturday would, if signed, give TikTok 270 days to find a new owner, up from the roughly six months contemplated under prior versions of the legislation. And the bill also gives the White House an option to extend that deadline another 90 days if the president determines there's progress toward a sale.\nTikTok has vocally opposed the bill. For weeks, TikTok has waged an intense lobbying campaign in a bid to defeat the legislation, arguing it violates its users' First Amendment rights and threatens small businesses.\n'It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,' TikTok said in a post on X on Wednesday.\nTikTok has hinted it could sue to block the House's divestiture legislation, telling users in March that it plans to continue fighting, 'including (by) exercising our legal rights.' A court challenge over the law would set the stage for a high-stakes battle over Americans' right to access digital information.\nUntil this week, Senate lawmakers have been divided over the House's proposal for a forced sale of TikTok. That shifted somewhat once the House unveiled its latest draft featuring a longer deadline. And in the days leading up to the House vote on Saturday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer emphasized the urgency of approving the foreign aid. On Saturday, Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor that there is a tentative agreement for the chamber to take up the foreign aid package on Tuesday.\nAll of that suggests a reasonably high likelihood the TikTok bill will pass, said Paul Gallant, a policy analyst at the market research firm Cowen Inc. Gallant estimates the odds of Senate passage at 80%.\n'We believe TikTok is unlikely to get stripped from the larger package,' Gallant wrote in a research note Friday, adding that the Senate is likely to take up the legislation within one to two weeks, though Senate leaders have indicated it could be passed even sooner.",

            "summary": "When Vice President Kamala Harris rushed to Arizona late last week after the state Supreme Court upheld an 1864 law banning abortion in almost all cases, she began her speech with a stark declaration: 'This fight is about freedom, and the freedom that is fundamental to the promise of America.'\nIn a new abortion-focused ad that the Biden campaign aired in Arizona last week, President Joe Biden somberly asks: 'If Donald Trump gets back in power, what freedom will you lose next?'\nFor Biden, Harris and other Democrats to lean so heavily on the word 'freedom' in this campaign is a historic reversal of roles. At least since the New Deal 90 years ago, Republicans have been the party most likely to frame their agenda as advancing 'freedom' and 'liberty' while Democrats have more often emphasized ideas such as 'equality' and 'justice.'\nRepublicans haven't abandoned their rhetorical efforts to claim the terrain of freedom. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for instance, used the word almost as a mantra the past few years to denounce the restrictions many states imposed to fight the spread of Covid-19 and to attack what he calls the left's effort to impose 'woke ideology.' And Trump disparages Biden's agenda to promote the deployment of electric vehicles as an attempt to deny Americans' freedom to continue purchasing gas-powered cars and trucks.\nBut the GOP push at every level of government to roll back the 'rights revolution' of the past six decades – symbolized by the proliferation of red-state laws limiting access to abortion and potentially other reproductive health care such as IVF – has provided Democrats a historic opportunity to reverse the direction of this long-running debate, many analysts agree.\n'Historically, Republicans have rooted their philosophical world view in liberty: for them it's about freedom to own guns, to practice religion as they see fit' or reducing government taxes, spending and regulation, said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute, which studies the intersection of culture and politics. 'What's new is Democrats are using the term in ways to reimagine what freedom really means.'\nTransforming the debate over freedom may be especially crucial for Biden because polls consistently show Trump with a double-digit lead when voters are asked who they trust more to handle the economy. That means that to win the election Biden will need to convince a substantial number of voters who believe Trump is better for their bottom line to vote against him anyway. The interrelated issues revolving around rights, values and democracy likely offer the president his best chance to do so. 'If any issue' is going to flip voters who express more confidence in Trump on the economy, 'it is going to be social issues like abortion,' said Deckman.\nBiden signaled the central role freedom would play in his campaign messaging from the outset, in the video he released last year announcing his plan to seek reelection. As an ominous piano key trills behind images of the January 6, 2021, insurrection, abortion rights protesters and the White House, Biden opens the video with a stark declaration: 'Freedom. Personal freedom is fundamental to who we are as Americans. There's nothing more important. Nothing more sacred.' Later he says: 'The question we're facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer. I know what I want the answer to be, and I think you do too.'\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security.\nRoe v. Wade and subsequent wave of red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, not surprisingly, featured prominently in Biden's announcement video. But he also raised multiple other issues to accuse 'MAGA extremists' of threatening 'bedrock freedoms,' including book bans, restrictions on voting, 'telling people who they can love' (a reference to state laws rolling back LGBTQ rights) and calling for cuts in Social Security. Harris, who has been the administration's point person in delivering the freedom message, has likewise cast an expansive net. When Harris delivered a Martin Luther King Day speech to the NAACP this year that summarized the administration's case for another term, she cited all the issues Biden did in the video and others, such as the restrictions several red states have imposed on the teaching of the nation's racial history and the right 'to live free from the horror of gun violence.'\nWay to Win, a liberal group that funds organizations and campaigns focusing on voters of color, has been pushing the party for several years to emphasize the freedom argument. Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, the group's vice president and chief strategy officer, says linking all these other issues to abortion is key to portraying Trump and his allies as a threat to freedom.\n'If [abortion] was the only thing, it would feel different than if you are able to tick off all these other things that they are doing and that they will do,' she said. 'We can even say it with other kinds of repro [rights]: We can say it with IVF, or now they are going to come for your contraception. Abortion is an entry point: because it is so visceral for people, it is a way to connect to a larger story about rights and freedoms.'\nLauren Hitt, a senior spokesperson for the Biden campaign, argued freedom will be a powerful message for the president because it resonates with a broad range of voters. 'It … speaks to the values of traditional Republican voters, [Nikki] Haley primary voters, and suburban voters – as well as to our base who believe deeply that the government shouldn't be making personal decisions for people,' she said. 'It's a uniquely powerful idea grounded in traditional democratic values that will be critical in winning the swing voters we need to win in November.'\nThe Trump campaign pushed back on Biden's ad asking which freedom Trump would take away next. 'Under Joe Biden, Americans are less free, less safe, and less prosperous,' Karoline Leavitt, the campaign's national spokesperson, said in a statement.\nDaniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said that broad changes in societal attitudes have encouraged both parties to emphasize their commitments to personal freedom. 'Each side recognizes this is something people care about,' Cox said. 'It's effective language at a time when we are increasingly individualistic. We are not as inclined to be communitarian and oriented toward the concerns of others. So I think it's not a surprise that we're seeing both political parties try to employ this language to their advantage.'\nEven with all the increased Democratic emphasis on protecting rights, Cox said, the issue remains 'contested ground' that can favor either party depending on how it is framed. While Republicans have been 'on their heels' defending abortion restrictions such as last week's Arizona ruling, he said, the party has benefited in other races from positioning itself as defending 'parent's rights,' as Republican Glenn Youngkin did while winning the Virginia governorship in 2021. (It's notable that when abortion rights and parental rights collided in the 2023 Virginia state legislative elections, Democrats stressing the former won control of both chambers over Republicans emphasizing the latter.)\nPolling suggests the public remains split over which party it trusts to defend basic rights and freedoms. To begin with, Democrats and Republicans hold very different priorities over which rights are most important to protect, PRRI found in unpublished national polling shared exclusively with CNN. In that survey, conducted late last year, Republicans were most likely to say their freedom to own guns, to practice their religion and to speak their mind was growing more restricted; Democrats were most likely to say that they were losing the freedom to control their own body. 'The parties are talking past each other,' Deckman said. 'Freedom is a word that is quintessentially American, but it depends on what freedoms you are referring to in the first place.'\nThe public returned a similar split verdict last fall in an NBC poll that asked voters which party they trusted more to handle different issues. In the poll, Democrats held a commanding 18 percentage point advantage on dealing with abortion. But when asked which party they trusted more on 'protecting our constitutional rights,' voters preferred Republicans by a margin of 43% to 35%. Even White women, who strongly preferred Democrats on abortion, split evenly over which party they trusted on the broader question of preserving core constitutional rights.\nThat GOP advantage may reflect the traditional political dynamic that conservative voters have been more likely than liberals to believe their rights are under siege and to view government actions as a threat to their liberty. In 2022 polling by Penn State University's McCourtney Institute for Democracy, Republicans were twice as likely as Democrats to say that they had lost rights and freedoms over the past decade. Republicans were also considerably more likely, though not by as lopsided a margin, to predict that they would lose more rights than they gain over the next decade.\nThe real-world consequence of that imbalance was on display in the 2016 presidential campaign, when Democratic-leaning voters largely shrugged about Hillary Clinton's warnings that a Trump victory would allow him to move the Supreme Court to the right in a way that would threaten basic rights, like abortion.\nChris Wilson, a GOP pollster who worked for the super PAC supporting DeSantis in the 2024 campaign, said the Penn State polling suggests that Biden still will face difficulty mobilizing key elements of the Democratic coalition with a message about rights and freedoms. He noted that such groups as Generation Z, Blacks and Latinos were much less likely than college-educated Whites or Republicans to express fears in the poll that they would lose rights in the decade ahead.\n'To whatever extent the Democrats are trying to make a rights argument, it's not as worrying to the youth and to minorities as it is to Whites, people with college degrees, and Boomers,' Wilson said. 'Biden's ‘rights' argument might be a big hit with his peers, but might be the wrong note to strike if he wants to hold onto the parts of the Democratic coalition that are starting to look shaky.'\nBut the Penn State polling was conducted before the Dobbs decision ended the nationwide right to abortion. And many analysts believe that seismic shift has increased the relevance of questions revolving around rights and freedoms to key groups that Democrats rely on – with younger women especially focused on these threats. While Republicans traditionally responded more to these arguments, Deckman said, 'These times certainly have made freedom a more accessible, even an existential, issue for people on the left.'\nFernandez Ancona agrees to an extent with both Wilson and Deckman. The 2022 elections, she said, demonstrated how strongly many people react to the risk of losing rights they believed had been settled. 'When these things you take for granted are taken away in this very stark way, it's incredibly motivating,' she said. But she also believes that Democrats need to tie their case about defending personal freedom into a broader message that portrays the 2024 election less as a personal choice between Trump and Biden than as a fundamental crossroads over America's future priorities that will shape not only personal liberties but also economic opportunity.\n'We have to get people to shift their thinking about how this is a choice between two different futures,' she said. 'It can get people out of this one-to-one candidate-to- candidate [comparison] and asking, ‘what I like, what I don't like' about Trump or Biden.'\nFor libertarians, the escalating struggle between Biden and Republicans over the idea of freedom is a source of both bemusement and frustration. Libertarians take a purist position that advocates for minimal government intervention in both personal behavior and the economy; they usually find Republicans deficient on the first count, and Democrats on the second.\nDavid Boaz, a distinguished senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, sees those flaws in both Biden and Trump. The Biden administration, Boaz said, is 'very big on reproductive freedom, and very big on a lot of aspects of LGBTQ freedom, but beyond those things, where's the freedom in the Biden-Harris plan?' And while Trump talks about promoting economic freedom by cutting taxes and regulation, Boaz continued, Republicans have also undermined such freedom by promoting high tariffs and using government policy to punish companies they disfavor, as DeSantis did with Disney in Florida.\nBut while Boaz believes both Biden and Trump have imperfect records when it comes to promoting freedom, he thinks one issue breaks the tie between them: Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election. ﻿'I have friends who say Biden is the biggest spender ever and he's regulating and he's woke and how can anyone consider voting for him over Trump?' Boaz said.\n'And I'll say that one reason is that Biden has not tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power. That's a very fundamental issue. You can add up all these [other] issues and weigh them. But the big freedom issue that Biden has over Trump,' Boaaz added, 'is that Trump tried to steal an election.'",

            "summary": "Sales of previously owned homes in the United States fell in March as home prices climbed and mortgage rates held steady that month, reflecting the persistent pain of America's affordability woes and undermining the crucial spring homebuying season.\nExisting home sales, which make up the majority of the housing market, fell 4.3% in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.19 million, the sharpest drop in more than a year, the National Association of Realtors reported Thursday. Sales fell across the country except in the Northeast region, which saw an increase for the first time since November 2023.\nMeanwhile, the median price of an existing home was $393,500 last month, an increase of 4.8% from a year earlier. That was the highest March price on record. Rising home prices coupled with mortgage rates stuck at elevated levels means Americans are still dealing with a tough housing market.\nHome sales are up from the decades-lows seen last fall , and were off to a robust start this year, but now that momentum seems to have come undone. Sales might not rise meaningfully higher as the Federal Reserve signals that it won't cut interest rates anytime soon.\n, and were off to a robust start this year, but now that momentum seems to have come undone. Sales might not rise meaningfully higher as the Federal Reserve signals that it won't cut interest rates anytime soon. 'Though rebounding from cyclical lows, home sales are stuck because interest rates have not made any major moves,' NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a release. 'There are nearly six million more jobs now compared to pre-Covid highs, which suggests more aspiring homebuyers exist in the market.'\nMortgage rates play a key role in determining housing affordability. That could be a frustrating sticking point.\nLast year, home sales were in the doldrums at their lowest level in nearly three decades as mortgage rates shot up, reaching a two-decade high of 7.79% in October.\nThen mortgage rates began to decline on hopes that the Fed would cut interest rates aggressively in 2024, but those expectations have been thrown out the window. Disappointing inflation reports and signs that the economy remains strong are keeping the Fed in wait-and-see mode, pushing back the timing of the first rate cut. Mortgage rates have held steady in recent weeks but are poised to rise because they track bond yields, which are climbing on persistently high inflation readings.\nkeeping the Fed in wait-and-see mode, pushing back the timing of the first rate cut. Mortgage rates have held steady in recent weeks but are poised to rise because they track bond yields, which are climbing on persistently high inflation readings. Home prices nationwide, which also play a role in affordability, haven't retreated in any meaningful way.\nOne bright spot in NAR's latest report on existing home sales: There was an increase in first-time homebuyers trickling into the market. They represented 32% of all transactions in March, up from 26% in February and 28% higher than a year ago, while the share of buyers who were investors declined in March.\n'Good to see that number go up above 30%' Yun said. That may be 'because people heard about the lawsuit settlement where the buyers possibly need to come up with extra funds to pay up some professional representation, but they want to do it before the new rules takes place sometime in July,' Yun added.\nA historic NAR settlement, which was announced in March and is expected to change how homebuyers and sellers pay their real estate agents, hasn't been approved by the courts yet. But it is already sending shockwaves through the real estate industry, with some buyers saying they plan to begin searching for a home before the new rules take effect.",

Apple took the crown last year – but only for one quarter, as Samsung took the spot back.\n'It's also very significant that Samsung is back at the top,' Popal said. 'This year, we are expecting Android to grow at twice the pace of iOS.' (Android is the operating system used by Samsung systems, while iPhones use iOS.)\nThat's because Android had a strong decline over the past few years, so it has more room to grow now. Both Apple and Samsung did not respond to a request for comment.\nBoth Apple and Samsung did not respond to a request for comment. Overall, IDC said global smartphone shipments increased 7.8% year over year to about 289 million devices in the first quarter of 2024, indicating the smartphone market is reemerging after two years of macroeconomic challenge.\nSamsung occupied about 20.8% of market share (or 60.1 million shipments) during the quarter, followed by Apple with 17.3% (50.1 million shipments). Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi made up 14.1% (40.8 million shipments).\nIn December, Apple overtook Samsung as the highest performer in the smartphone category, ending Samsung's 12-year run at the top, with 20% market share (compared to Samsung's 19.4% market share).\nAlthough IDC said in its latest report that it expects Apple and Samsung to maintain their hold on the market, the resurgence of Huawei and other companies in China, including Xiaomi and OPPO/OnePlus, will likely continue.

China remains an important market for Apple as it is the largest market behind the US. The company continues to offer discounts in China to help boost sales.\nLast year, Huawei's popular Mate 60 smartphone made headlines when the US government sought more information about the Pro model, which included a sophisticated processor. Its debut shocked industry experts who questioned how the company could make such a chip following sweeping efforts by the United States to restrict China's access to foreign chip technology because of perceived national security concerns.\nPopal also noted Apple has not articulated a strong message about artificial intelligence, at a time when many tech companies are doubling down on related strategies and features.\n' We're hoping to hear some messaging around this at its June developer conference,' she said.

            "summary": "Washington CNN —\nWashington CNN — Sales of previously owned homes in the United States fell in March as home prices climbed and mortgage rates held steady that month, reflecting the persistent pain of America's affordability woes and undermining the crucial spring homebuying season.\nExisting home sales, which make up the majority of the housing market, fell 4.3% in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.19 million, the sharpest drop in more than a year, the National Association of Realtors reported Thursday. Sales fell across the country except in the Northeast region, which saw an increase for the first time since November 2023.\nMeanwhile, the median price of an existing home was $393,500 last month, an increase of 4.8% from a year earlier. That was the highest March price on record. Rising home prices coupled with mortgage rates stuck at elevated levels means Americans are still dealing with a tough housing market.\nHome sales are up from the decades-lows seen last fall , and were off to a robust start this year, but now that momentum seems to have come undone. Sales might not rise meaningfully higher as the Federal Reserve signals that it won't cut interest rates anytime soon.\n, and were off to a robust start this year, but now that momentum seems to have come undone. Sales might not rise meaningfully higher as the Federal Reserve signals that it won't cut interest rates anytime soon. 'Though rebounding from cyclical lows, home sales are stuck because interest rates have not made any major moves,' NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a release. 'There are nearly six million more jobs now compared to pre-Covid highs, which suggests more aspiring homebuyers exist in the market.'\nMortgage rates play a key role in determining housing affordability. That could be a frustrating sticking point.\nLast year, home sales were in the doldrums at their lowest level in nearly three decades as mortgage rates shot up, reaching a two-decade high of 7.79% in October.\nThen mortgage rates began to decline on hopes that the Fed would cut interest rates aggressively in 2024, but those expectations have been thrown out the window. Disappointing inflation reports and signs that the economy remains strong are keeping the Fed in wait-and-see mode, pushing back the timing of the first rate cut. Mortgage rates have held steady in recent weeks but are poised to rise because they track bond yields, which are climbing on persistently high inflation readings.\nkeeping the Fed in wait-and-see mode, pushing back the timing of the first rate cut. Mortgage rates have held steady in recent weeks but are poised to rise because they track bond yields, which are climbing on persistently high inflation readings. Home prices nationwide, which also play a role in affordability, haven't retreated in any meaningful way.\nOne bright spot in NAR's latest report on existing home sales: There was an increase in first-time homebuyers trickling into the market. They represented 32% of all transactions in March, up from 26% in February and 28% higher than a year ago, while the share of buyers who were investors declined in March.\n'Good to see that number go up above 30%' Yun said. That may be 'because people heard about the lawsuit settlement where the buyers possibly need to come up with extra funds to pay up some professional representation, but they want to do it before the new rules takes place sometime in July,' Yun added.\nA historic NAR settlement, which was announced in March and is expected to change how homebuyers and sellers pay their real estate agents, hasn't been approved by the courts yet. But it is already sending shockwaves through the real estate industry, with some buyers saying they plan to begin searching for a home before the new rules take effect.",

Instead, he said, there are indications 'that it is likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence.'\n'Right now, given the strength of the labor market and progress on inflation so far, it's appropriate to allow restrictive policy further time to work and let the data and the evolving outlook guide us,' the Fed chief said.\nInterest rates are currently nestled at a 23-year high after the Fed launched an aggressive rate-hiking campaign two years ago, reports my colleague Bryan Mena.\nInflation is down considerably from a four-decade peak reached in the summer of 2022, but recent inflation reports have shown persistent price pressures in services and housing.\nHigher borrowing costs, coupled with elevated prices for essentials, have forced many Americans to cut back.

But it did say that it would have been profitable without the cost of the grounding.\nThe blowout of a door plug on an Alaska Airlines flight caused a three-week grounding by the Federal Aviation Administration of the 737 Max 9 model of jets, and brought fresh questions about the safety and quality of Boeing planes. United, which depends on Boeing planes for about 80% of its mainline fleet, had 86 of the Max 9 jets, more than any other airline in the world, and it was hit particularly hard by Boeing's problems.",

The researchers in Wednesday's study, published in Nature, said financial pain in the short-term is inevitable, even if governments ramp up their efforts to tackle the crisis now.\n'These impacts are unavoidable in the sense that they are indistinguishable across different future emission scenarios until 2049,' two of the study's researchers from the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research, Maximilian Kotz and Leonie Wenz, told CNN via email.\nHowever, they say immediate actions to reduce climate change could stem some losses in the longer term.\nNoah Diffenbaugh, a professor and environmental researcher at Stanford University, said the economic damage from climate change will take different shapes. Not only can extreme weather events result in costly repairs to damaged property, but elevated temperatures can also impact agriculture, labor productivity, and even cognitive ability in some cases.\nWhile discourse about the cost of climate change often refers to potentially expensive mitigation efforts like curbing oil and gas use or technology to pull carbon pollution out of the air, investing in greener technology, the study argued that short-term financial damage wrought by climate change already outweighs the cost of trying to solve the crisis.\nor technology to pull carbon pollution out of the air, investing in greener technology, the study argued that short-term financial damage wrought by climate change already outweighs the cost of trying to solve the crisis. Researchers estimated it would cost the global economy $6 trillion by 2050 to comply with the Paris Climate Agreement—the international agreement among nearly 200 nations to tackle climate change—compared to the study's estimated $38 trillion economic damage due to climate change.\n'Adaptation could offer ways to reduce these damages,' the researchers Kotz and Wenz said.\nBernardo Bastien, a researcher at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego, said that adaptation strategies, which are approaches designed not to reduce climate change, but to respond by limiting its negative effects, could help save money on a longer time horizon.\nBastien gave an example: utility companies in the state of California that have shut down the electrical grid to prevent wildfires.\n'When you turn off electrical grids, you're turning off industry and you're turning off a lot of households that use electricity for their well-being,' Bastien said. 'It's very costly but very necessary.'\nAnd while the study concludes some economic damage is guaranteed before 2049, its authors argue that benefits from curbing climate change could emerge a few decades down the line.\n'Damage estimates diverge strongly across emission scenarios after 2049, conveying the clear benefits from mitigation from a purely economic point of view,' the study said.\nHowever, the expected financial hit won't be distributed evenly.\nDiffenbaugh, who was not associated with the study, said that while research showing the aggregate impact of climate change is important, 'embedded in those aggregate impacts are very stark disparities in who is most impacted by climate change.'\n'We have clear evidence that overall, the poor are harmed more,' he said. 'That's what's likely to happen from the global warming that's already occurred and what's likely to happen even for small increments of global warming.'\nThe Nature study estimated the economic damage of different regions. North America and Europe are expected to see a lower income reduction in the next 26 years at 11%, compared to South Asia and Africa at 22%.\nThe United States, a historically large polluter, will take a smaller economic hit than some neighboring countries, according to the study. However, it won't be spared from disruptions caused by a warming planet — especially younger generations of Americans.\n— especially younger generations of Americans. A different paper, published Tuesday in Consumer Reports from global consulting firm ICF, estimates that the lifetime personal cost of climate change for a baby born in the US in 2024 could be as high as $500,000.\nThe ICF paper said price hikes on essential elements of the cost of living in the US will add up due to climate change. Housing costs are projected to increase by $125,000 over the lifetime of a person born in 2024, owing to elevated maintenance and insurance costs due to the risks of flooding and other weather-related damage, the paper said. Food prices are also seen rising by an estimated $33,000 over the lifetime of a 2024 baby, due to disruptions to agriculture and supply chains, the paper said. Other expenses, like energy, transportation and health care, are expected to balloon in the next few decades, as well.\n'For many Americans, this financial loss will require difficult decisions about how to pay for food, housing, and other daily expenses, which climate change will increase by approximately 9 percent over their lifetime,' the paper said.",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — More than 13 million Ecuadorians are expected to head to the polls Sunday for a referendum dominated by security issues, in a vote that could shape the political future of President Daniel Noboa and his tough-on-crime agenda.\nNoboa, the son of a banana tycoon, swept into office last November as the youngest president in Ecuador's history on the back of a promise to rein in the rampant crime that has transformed the once tranquil country into one plagued by violence and turf wars between drug cartels.\nSince then he has embarked on an uncompromising agenda in which he has declared 'war' on more than 20 criminal gangs he has labeled as 'terrorists,' declared a 90-day state of emergency, and authorized a highly controversial raid on the Mexican embassy in Quito to capture a fugitive Ecuadorian former vice president accused of corruption.\nExperts say Sunday's vote will reveal a lot about how much public backing there is for Noboa and the decisions he's made in the past six months and could well be a deciding factor in whether he seeks another term when his current one ends in May 2025.\nThe referendum will ask 11 questions, five that will modify the Constitution if approved and six that are advisory. More than 13 million of Ecuador's population of nearly 18 million are eligible to vote – and in Ecuador, voting is obligatory.\nAmong the biggest proposals are measures to allow the military to patrol with police to combat organized crime (something that can currently only happen under a state of emergency, which has a 90 day limit); to allow the extradition of Ecuadorians (currently prohibited by the Constitution); and to raise the penalties for those found guilty of violent crimes.\n'We require urgent reforms that allow us to protect our security,' Noboa told a military event in March. 'This process can only continue, it can only be sustained, if we give the National Police and the Armed Forces the clear and firm support that we are proposing in the referendum.'\nEcuador, home to the Galapagos islands and a tourist-friendly dollar economy, was once known as an 'island of peace,' nestled between the world's two largest cocaine producers, Peru and Colombia.\nBut the country's deep ports have made it a key transit point for cocaine making its way to consumers in the United States and Europe. Rival criminal organizations are locked in a battle to control these trafficking routes.\nThis violence is increasingly spilling over into the public sphere in brutal fashion. According to figures by the Ecuadorian National Police, the murder rate in 2016 was 5.8 homicides per 100,000 people. By 2022, it had spiked to 25.6, a similar level to that of Colombia and Mexico, countries with a long history of drug cartel violence.\nIt was Ecuadorians' growing discontent with the deteriorating security conditions that led Noboa's predecessor Guillermo Lasso to call a snap election last year.\nNoboa, a relative political novice at the time, won that election in a run-off vote with a tough-on-crime message that gained further resonance when anti-corruption candidate Fernando Villavicencio was assassinated at a campaign event.\nJust a few weeks into Noboa's term, he declared a nationwide state of emergency after the security situation deteriorated in spectacular fashion following the escape of the notorious gang leader Adolfo Macias, also known as Fito, from a prison in Guayaquil, the country's biggest and arguably most dangerous city.\nIn response to the escape, the government deployed more than 3,000 police officers and members of the armed forces to find Fito. It was unsuccessful.\nCriminal groups then responded by embarking on a wave of violent attacks – including taking over a TV station that was broadcasting live on air – in a show of strength meant to discourage the crackdown.\nHours later, Noboa took the unprecedented step of declaring an 'internal armed conflict' and ordered Ecuador's armed forces to 'neutralize' the members of more than 20 gangs, which he labeled as terror groups.\n'I declared war on terrorists. These are not conventional gangs. They are terrorist groups. They are highly organized, structured, armed forces that terrorize complete regions and have had control in the past few years of our nation's prisons,' Noboa told CNN's Christiana Amanpour in January.\nNoboa burnished his credentials as an uncompromising enforcer this month when he ordered police to raid the Mexican Embassy in Quito to arrest former Ecuadorian Vice President Jorge Glas, who was facing embezzlement charges and had been seeking asylum there. Glas has denied the charges, which he claims are politically motivated.\nThe raid made waves internationally as, under diplomatic norms, embassies are generally considered protected spaces.\nMexico decried the raid as 'an outrage against international law,' and has since severed diplomatic ties. Various other Latin American countries have rallied around Mexico while the United Nations has also voiced concern.\nNoboa, on the other hand, claims to have no regrets, saying the security crisis in Ecuador called for 'exceptional decisions,' and that he could not allow a convicted criminal to escape justice.\nIn an open letter published recently, Noboa tied the embassy raid to the upcoming referendum, claiming 'a vast majority of Ecuadoreans' would defend his decision with their vote.\nSome experts have told CNN they believe the raid will grant Noboa a 'spike of popularity.'\nIt's unclear though if support for Noboa will be blunted by an energy shortage that has led him to order 8-hour nationwide power cuts and a complete shutdown of the private and public sector for a two-day period.\nThe crisis has been sparked by low reservoirs levels, as Ecuador relies largely on hydropower. However, without showing evidence, Noboa has blamed 'saboteurs' and says he has ordered an investigation.\nBeyond security, other proposals in the referendum include measures that would enable companies to hire workers on hourly wages and the recognition of international arbitrage to resolve investment disputes.\nto hire workers on hourly wages and the recognition of international arbitrage to resolve investment disputes. The referendum has met opposition among some groups who claim the matters can be dealt with in the National Assembly.\nAll proposals can be approved or rejected individually.",

'I particularly call upon the young and first time voters to vote in large numbers. After all, every vote counts and every voice matters!'\nThe BJP's campaign manifesto centers on job creation, anti-poverty programs such as expanding food handouts and housing schemes, and national development with particular focus on women, the poor, farmers and young people.\nModi wants to turn the country into a global manufacturing hub, continue its massive infrastructure transformation, and achieve energy independence by 2047.\nOn the world stage, Modi wants India to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, will push to bid for the 2036 Summer Olympics and aims to land an astronaut on the moon.\nRelated article A visual guide to voting in the world's largest democracy\nRelated article A visual guide to voting in the world's largest democracy The BJP has also pledged to implement a uniform civil code, which would replace a sprawl of religious and customary laws with a standard rule that everyone, regardless of faith, would be required to follow. The BJP says it will protect the rights of women, though some communities say it will interfere with their freedom of religion and customs.\nChallenging the BJP is India's main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, and its newly formed INDIA alliance of parties.\nBut the once-formidable force in Indian politics has been languishing since Modi rose to power a decade ago. And the INDIA alliance is already starting to show cracks, with defections and infighting.\nThe opposition bloc is banking on a unified approach to counter the BJP's dominance over the past decade.\nThe Congress party's campaign is promising 'freedom from fear' and vowing to protect democratic values such as freedom of speech, expression and religious belief espoused in the constitution.\nIts manifesto also emphasizes justice, equity and welfare, promising recognition of civil unions between LGBTQ+ couples, protection of religious minorities, and safety and empowerment of women, among other pledges such as apprenticeship for young graduates.\nIt speaks directly to critiques from rights groups that the BJP is eroding democratic values, by promising to restore freedom of the media, to strengthen the autonomy of the Election Commission and other state agencies, and review laws passed by the BJP 'without proper parliamentary scrutiny and debate.'\nIndia's Election Commission has imposed restrictions on media, including CNN, that limits the publication of reporting and analysis in the run-up to and during polling days.\nVoters are casting their ballots for 543 seats in the lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha, with a further two seats nominated by the country's president.\nThe party with the majority will form a government and appoint one of its winning candidates as prime minister.\nOn Friday, voters from constituencies in 21 states and union territories across India will cast their ballots electronically. Some states are so big that voting is spread out over the seven phases, while others vote on one day.\nAmong the most politically important states is Uttar Pradesh, home to 240 million people who vote in all seven phases. India's largest state is a crucial battleground with 80 seats in the Lok Sabha up for grabs.\nAlso voting Friday is the southern state of Tamil Nadu and its capital Chennai, where the regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party and INDIA alliance will be vying to prevent the BJP from making inroads into a corner of India it has historically struggled to penetrate.\nWest Bengal, a state of 102 million people and 42 Lok Sabha seats, will also vote in all seven phases, starting Friday. The BJP has struggled to crack the state, which has been long ruled by the All India Trinamool Congress and headed by political heavyweight Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.\nVoters in the northeast state of Arunachal Pradesh, nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, are also heading to the polls Friday. Video shared by the Election Commission shows workers trekking through forests, carrying election equipment on horses to reach a remote polling station.\nIn the state of Meghalaya, also in the northeast, election workers carrying large boxes were filmed walking through lakes to reach polling booths.\nThe remote Indian Ocean archipelago of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, home to indigenous tribes from among the world's most isolated communities, will also vote Friday.\nSo too will the northeast states, including Mizoram, Nagaland on the border with Myanmar, as well as parts of Manipur, which has been gripped by ethnic violence over the past year, and the western state of Rajasthan.\nIndia's Meteorological Department has predicted heat wave conditions in some of the places voting Friday, including parts of West Bengal and Puducherry.

The association says burden shouldn't be entirely on parents, app stores or young people — it has to be on the platform developers.\nBut parents probably can't count on developers, which leads to Haidt's jarring conclusion: We're at a tipping point as a society, and if grown-ups don't take action, they could risk the mental health of all young people indefinitely.\nHaidt, the Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical Leadership at New York University's Leonard N.

Because most of us were techno-optimists, we didn't really raise alarms when our kids started spending four, five, six and now seven to nine hours a day on their phones and other screens. The basic argument of the book is that we've overprotected our children in the real world and we've under-protected them online. And for both halves of that, you can see how we did that thinking that it was going to be OK. We were wrong on both points.\nCNN: What is some of the most startling data you found?\nCNN: What is some of the most startling data you found? Haidt: The one that comes immediately to mind was the discovery that teenage boys used to have by far the highest rates of broken bones before the great rewiring of childhood. Before 2010, teenage boys were much more likely than any other group to go to a hospital because they broke a bone. Once we get to the early 2010s, their rates of hospitalization plunge, so that now teenage boys are slightly less likely to break a bone than are their fathers or grandfathers. They're spending most of their time on their computers and their video games, and so they're physically safe. But I would argue that this comes at the cost of healthy boyhood development.\nHaidt: The one that comes immediately to mind was the discovery that teenage boys used to have by far the highest rates of broken bones before the great rewiring of childhood.

CNN: Does this mental health crisis affect boys and girls differently?\nCNN: Does this mental health crisis affect boys and girls differently? Haidt:﻿ The basic facts about gender differences are that when everyone got a smartphone in the early 2010s, boys went for video games and YouTube and Reddit, while girls went more for the visual social media platforms, especially Instagram, Pinterest and Tumblr.\nHaidt:﻿ The basic facts about gender differences are that when everyone got a smartphone in the early 2010s, boys went for video games and YouTube and Reddit, while girls went more for the visual social media platforms, especially Instagram, Pinterest and Tumblr. A second difference is that girls share emotions more than boys do. They talk about their feelings more, and they're more open to each other. Girls' levels of anxiety go up a lot in this period (the tween and teen years), as soon as they get hyper-connected to each other via social media.\nSelf-harm is a way that some girls have historically coped with anxiety, and those rates also went way up in the early 2010s. It used to be that (self-harm) was not a thing that 12- and 13-year-olds were doing, it was more older girls. In the 2010s, hospital emergency room visits (for self-harm) for 10 to 14-year-old girls nearly tripled. That's one of the biggest increases in markers of mental illness that we see in all the data that I've reviewed.\nCNN: You've said we're at a tipping point in this crisis? Why?\nCNN: You've said we're at a tipping point in this crisis? Why? Haidt: I think that this year is the tipping point for several reasons. In 2019, the debate was really getting started. Then Covid-19 happened, and that obscured previous trends. Now we're a few years past Covid-19, past the school closures, past the masks, and what has become clear to everyone is that kids are not all right. And the data on rates of mental illness shows us that most of the increase was in place long before Covid-19 arrived.\nHaidt: I think that this year is the tipping point for several reasons.

And the data on rates of mental illness shows us that most of the increase was in place long before Covid-19 arrived. Nowadays, in families across America, one of the biggest and most prevalent dynamics is fighting over technology. What I found since the book came out is that almost everybody sees the problem. Parents are in a state of despair. They feel like the genie is out of the bottle. They say, 'You can't put toothpaste back in a tube, can you?' To that, I say, 'If you really have to do it, you'll do it.'\nWhen you look at the wreckage of adolescent mental health and you look at the increases in self-harm and suicide, you look at the declining test scores since 2012 in the United States and all around the world, I think we have to do something. My book provides clear analysis of the multiple collective action problems and of the four simple norms that will solve them.\nCNN: What are the norms that will solve this crisis?\nCNN: What are the norms that will solve this crisis? Haidt: No. 1: No smartphones before high school. We must clear them out of middle school and elementary school. Just let kids have a flip phone or phone watch when they become independent.\nHaidt: No. 1: No smartphones before high school. We must clear them out of middle school and elementary school. Just let kids have a flip phone or phone watch when they become independent. No. 2: No social media until 16. These platforms were not made for children. They appear to be especially harmful for children. We must especially protect early puberty since that is when the greatest damage is done.\nNo. 3: Phone-free schools. There's really no argument for letting kids have the greatest distraction device ever invented in their pockets during school hours. If they have the phones, they will be texting during class, and they will be focused on their phones. If they don't have phones, they will listen to their teachers and spend time with other kids.\nNo. 4: More independence, free play and responsibility in the real world. We need to roll back the phone-based childhood and restore the play-based childhood.\nCNN: Rethinking smartphone privileges is a huge departure for many families. How do you convince parents to buy in?\nCNN: Rethinking smartphone privileges is a huge departure for many families. How do you convince parents to buy in? Haidt: Elementary school is easy. If you've already given your kid a phone or their own iPad, you can take it away. Just be sure to coordinate with the parents of your kid's friends so that your kid feels they're not the only one. They can still have access to a computer; they can still text their friends on a computer. But if your kids are in elementary school, just commit to not giving them these things until high school.\nHaidt: Elementary school is easy.

They can still have access to a computer; they can still text their friends on a computer. But if your kids are in elementary school, just commit to not giving them these things until high school. Middle school is harder. Most middle school kids are entirely enmeshed in smartphones and social media. The key in middle school is to have some very severe time restrictions. The problem is the move from a couple hours of access a day to potentially having access all day long. That's what does a lot of the kids in. Half of all American teens say they're online almost constantly. If your kids already have these devices, I think you want to make some strict rules about when they have access to them.\nCNN: What do you think will happen if we don't change soon?\nCNN: What do you think will happen if we don't change soon? Haidt: Given that the rates of mental illness and self-harm and suicide are still going up, we don't know where the limit is. We don't know whether it's possible to have 100% of our kids be depressed and anxious. We're already getting close to half for the girls; we're already in the ballpark of 30% to 40% having depression or anxiety, and about 30% currently say they've thought about suicide this year. Things are already really bad, and the levels could just continue to rise to the point where the majority of kids are depressed, anxious and suicidal.\nHaidt: Given that the rates of mental illness and self-harm and suicide are still going up, we don't know where the limit is.

Things are already really bad, and the levels could just continue to rise to the point where the majority of kids are depressed, anxious and suicidal. This has enormous social implications, too. Because kids are somewhat sex-segregated online (they interact less with kids of the opposite sex), the situation is unconducive to heterosexual dating and marriage. I think the separation between boys and girls and their rising rates of anxiety are going to drive rates of marriage and heterosexual childbearing down much faster than they've been going — and they've been dropping for decades.\nLastly, I think there could be huge economic implications. Already, you have dozens of state attorneys general suing Meta and Snapchat because of the sheer amount of money that the states spend on psychiatric emergency services for adolescents. Another economic implication is that if we have one or two or three anxious generations where young people are afraid to take risks, our free market economy, our entrepreneurial culture, all the things that make the American economy so vibrant and dynamic will suffer. That's why I think we have no choice. We (must) put a stop to this now.\nMatt Villano is a writer and editor based in Northern California. Learn more about him at whalehead.com.",

New York CNN —\nNew York CNN — The 2024 gangbusters rally in stocks has skidded to a screeching halt.\nThe S&P 500 index has fallen 4.6% so far in April, and all three major US indexes are on track for their first negative month since last October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on the brink of wiping out its gains since the start of 2024 — it's up just 0.2% — while the S&P 500 is up 5.1% and the Nasdaq Composite has added 3.9%.\n— it's up just 0.2% — while the S&P 500 is up 5.1% and the Nasdaq Composite has added 3.9%. CNN's Fear & Greed Index, which measures seven barometers of market sentiment, closed Thursday at a 'fear' reading, down from 'greed' a month ago.\nBehind the turmoil? Strong economic data and sticky inflation have led Wall Street to push back its expectations for when the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates. A boost to oil prices from rising tension in the Middle East hasn't helped.\nData released this month showed that inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target.

            "summary": "China has accused the United States of 'stoking military confrontation' with the recent deployment of a powerful missile launcher capable of firing weapons with a range of up to 1,600 kilometers to exercises in the Philippines.\nThe presence of the US Army's Mid-Range Capability (MRC) ground-based missile system increases the risks of 'misjudgment and miscalculation' in a region already on edge over Chinese-Philippine face-offs in the South China Sea, Beijing says.\nIt's the first-ever deployment of the MRC missile system, also known as the Typhon system, to the Indo-Pacific theater, and it comes amid a series of US-Philippine military exercises, including the largest-ever edition of the bilateral Balikatan exercises beginning Monday.\nThe US Army has not said how long the Typhon system will remain in the Philippines, but its involvement in the series of joint exercises between the two treaty allies, the first of which began on April 8, sends a signal the US can put offensive weaponry well within striking distance of Chinese installations in the South China Sea, the southern Chinese mainland and along the Taiwan Strait, analysts say.\nThe Typhon system is capable of firing the Standard Missile 6 (SM-6), a ballistic missile defense munition that can also target ships at sea at a range of 370 kilometers (230 miles), according to the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\nIt also can fire the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile, a maneuverable cruise missile with a range of 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles), according to the CSIS.\nDuring a regular news briefing last week, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian accused the US of seeking a 'unilateral military advantage,' and underscored Beijing's strong opposition to the deployment.\n'We urge the US to earnestly respect other countries' security concerns, stop stoking military confrontation, stop undermining peace and stability in the region, and take concrete actions to reduce strategic risks,' Lin said.\nThe US Army is calling the deployment, which began April 11 for the Salaknib exercise, a 'landmark' in its regional capability.\nThe apparent diplomatic fallout comes as attendees from 29 countries, including the commander of the US Pacific Fleet, attend a four-day Western Pacific Naval Symposium, which began in the eastern Chinese port city of Qingdao on Sunday.\nThe attendees will discuss 'maritime peace, maritime order based on maritime security cooperation and international laws, and global maritime governance,' according to Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency.\nThose are the same rules Washington and Manila accuse Beijing of ignoring with aggressive Chinese actions that have injured Filipino sailors and damaged vessels around disputed features in the South China Sea.\nThe 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines – the oldest such US pact in Asia-Pacific – stipulates both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party.\nIn brief comments to CNN on the sidelines of the gathering, US Adm. Stephen Koehler said: 'I think it's a great opportunity for all navies to get together and discuss all the issues.'\nAnalysts say the deployment of the Typhon missile battery is the first signal of US plans to address what has long been an advantage for Beijing in the region.\n'This in some way ‘equalizes' the prior situation where (Chinese) missiles have threatened US forces along the First Island Chain (which includes the northern Philippines, Japan and Taiwan), and even further eastward along the Second Island Chain centering on Guam,' said Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.\nA 2021 report for the US Army's professional journal Military Review puts the current missile advantage of the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) in stark terms.\n'The conventional arm of the PLARF is the largest ground-based missile force in the world, with over 2,200 conventionally armed ballistic and cruise missiles and with enough antiship missiles to attack every US surface combatant vessel in the South China Sea with enough firepower to overcome each ship's missile defense,' Army Maj. Christopher Milhal wrote.\nWhile the Typhon can't bring those kinds of numbers into play for US forces, its mobility represents a problem for Chinese mission planners — giving it important deterrent value, analysts say.\nIn announcing the Typhon deployment, the US military noted how the system was delivered to the Philippines via an 8,000-mile, 15-hour flight from Washington state by a US Air Force C-17 cargo jet.\nAnalysts don't expect the Typhon system to be permanently based in the Philippines, but Koh said the ability to move the batteries to a range of 'pre-surveyed launch sites' around the region on short notice increases their survivability and challenges relatively new and untested Chinese intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) and targeting capabilities.\nWhether the Typhon's likely temporary status mitigates the fallout remains unknown. but China has previously reacted furiously to missile deployments in what it sees as its backyard.\nWriting in the International Institute for Strategic Studies' Military Balance Blog, analyst Rupert Schulenberg noted that in 2016, when South Korea agreed to the deployment of a THAAD defensive missile system on the Korean Peninsula, 'Beijing responded with an unofficial economic boycott that cost South Korea's economy $7.5 billion in 2017 alone.'\nThe current deployment of the Typhon was something that would not have even been an option for the US military until 2019. Development of ground-launched missile systems of the type were banned under the 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty between the US and the Soviet Union.\nBut the US formally withdrew from the treaty in 2019, with then-President Donald Trump 'citing Russian noncompliance and concerns about China's intermediate-range missile arsenal.'\nMeanwhile, the US and the Philippines kicked-off the largest of their series of joint exercises Monday, with the three-week Balikatan drills — Tagalog for shoulder-to-shoulder — involving thousands of military personnel.\nA report from the official Philippine News Agency said Manila would use the exercises to showcase its military's most advanced systems, including a missile frigate, light fighter jets, close-combat support aircraft and Black Hawk helicopters.\nPhilippine officials previously indicated the naval portion of the exercise would for the first time extend beyond the 12-nautical-mile limit of Philippine waters — and into the country's exclusive economic zone, some 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers) from Philippine shores, though no exact route has been provided.\nIt will also include French naval participation in a group sail from Palawan Island, according to Philippine officials.\nPalawan, which sits between the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is about 200 kilometers from Second Thomas Shoal, a contested feature in the Spratly Islands that has been the site of a number of dangerous face-offs between Philippine and Chinese coast guard vessels, during which Philippine ships have been targeted with water cannons, injuring several Filipino sailors.\nCNN's Steven Jiang in Qingdao contributed to this report.\nCNN's Steven Jiang in Qingdao contributed to this report.",

            "summary": "Varanasi and New Delhi CNN —\nVaranasi and New Delhi CNN — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi once famously made a simple election promise: 'good days are coming'.\nTo his adoring supporters, it's a vision of a future now finally within reach should Modi and his right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secure an emphatic and rare third consecutive term at this month's nationwide election.\nAt his rallies, tens of thousands gather in near frenzied religious devotion in support of a man whose policies they say have transformed the lives of ordinary Indians – and helped enshrine the nascent promise of social mobility in a country still riven by caste divisions.\nModi projects himself as an outsider from humble origins. Born as the son of a tea seller in a small town in Gujarat, he does not fit neatly within the often privately educated, resolutely metropolitan, English-speaking template set by many previous Indian leaders.\nThe 74-year-old is unmarried, has no children, and seemingly shuns expensive material possessions in favor of a simple, ascetic lifestyle.\nAnd though little is shared about Modi the man – his private life is assiduously guarded by a formidable public relations team – his persona resonates with many.\nHis political rise in some ways mirrors India's own path from a newly independent nation freed from the shackles of colonialism to a confident, secure country inching ever closer to superpower status – albeit one wracked by deep and abiding fault lines.\nModi, his opponents argue, has done little to soothe those divisions.\nReligious persecution and Islamophobia have increased sharply on his watch, with many accusing the prime minister of tacitly endorsing sectarianism as a means of further bolstering his Hindu-nationalist credentials, while diverting from policy failures – such as youth unemployment, which now stands at close to 50% among 20- to 24-year-olds.\nAmong India's minorities, particularly the country's 230 million Muslims, the prospect of another five-years for a prime minister who calls himself the 'chowkidar' – or watchman – remains deeply concerning.\nMany don't believe Modi is watching out for them – instead, they say they are marginalized as he fulfills his party's dream of transforming secular, pluralistic India into a majoritarian Hindu state.\n'As he goes toward seeking a third term, Prime Minister Modi has positioned himself as a head priest alongside the head of the political system … the protector of the nation (and), as the creator of a Hindu-first nation,' said Saba Naqvi, author of 'The Saffron Storm: From Vajpayee to Modi.'\nThis seemingly potent, populist mix of economic empowerment and Hindu nationalism has proved to be a successful electoral formula for Modi, confounding longstanding social and regional voting lines.\nAccording to 2023 Pew research, about eight-in-ten Indian adults have a favorable view of Modi, including 55% who have a very favorable view. Such levels of popularity for a two-term incumbent prime minister defy all modern conventions, both in India and throughout much of the democratic world.\nvery favorable view. Such levels of popularity for a two-term incumbent prime minister defy all modern conventions, both in India and throughout much of the democratic world. 'He's done something which has not happened before in Indian politics among all our prime ministers,' said Naqvi. 'He has willfully created a cult of his own personality.'\nAs the sun sets across the Ganges, Hindu devotees bathe in the holy river's waters and priests offer daily prayer by its banks. It's here, in the city of Varanasi – Modi's own constituency – that this so-called cult of personality is on full display.\nBillboards with the prime minister's face appear on the corners of roads, and saffron flags with his party's lotus symbol are hoisted on buildings across the dusty, meandering gulleys of the ancient city.\nOn the streets, his party's volunteers go door-to-door advocating for the leader.\nWhen Modi first ran for prime minister a decade ago, he did so on a promise of infrastructure, development and anti-corruption, choosing the city of gods as his constituency – its religious symbolism the perfect backdrop for his BJP's Hindu nationalist ambitions.\nIn one of Varanasi's oldest spice markets, shopkeepers say their lives have been transformed since.\n'Many people think he is God,' said father of two, Akash Jaiswal, pointing to Modi's welfare schemes and business incentives. 'We've never had a prime minister like Modi ever. He's done a great sacrifice for India, for us … We want him to be prime minister forever.'\nJaiswal even praised some of Modi's most controversial leadership moments. 'India had the least casualties during Covid,' he said, when in fact the country had the third highest number of pandemic-related deaths, after the United States and Brazil, according to the World Health Organization. Modi was highly criticized for his handling of the pandemic and accused of being underprepared, as hospitals reached their limit and morgues overflowed with bodies.\nThe city's BJP President, Dileep Patel, who has helped Modi with all three of his election campaigns, however, isn't surprised by his enduring levels of popularity. To him, Modi represents India's future.\n'Today India is strong, capable, and self-reliant under the prime minister's leadership,' he said.\nModi's official party biography tells the story of a poor boy, the third of six children, whose father was a 'chaiwallah' or tea seller, who'd serve customers at the local train station to support his young family\nPromoted by the BJP, analysts say this tale of humble beginnings makes him relatable to hundreds of millions across the country. And it stands in stark contrast to the generations of India's elite, urbane politicians that have historically risen to the top job.\n'He comes from a poor background and that helps him understands the people of India,' said Varanasi BJP president Patel.\nIndia's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was a member of the Indian National Congress, a political party that was pivotal in ending nearly 200 years of British colonial rule. His daughter, Indira Gandhi, also became prime minister, as did her son, Rajiv. All three studied overseas at Cambridge or Oxford.\nThe face of today's Congress Party, and Modi's primary opponent, is Rahul Gandhi, son of Rajiv, and an alumni of both Cambridge and Harvard.\nModi, by contrast, had a modest upbringing in the small town of Vadnagar, far from the political cut and thrust of the capital New Delhi, according to Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, author of 'Narendra Modi: The Man, The Times.'\nMukhopadhyay notes Modi was an average student at school and his marriage was arranged to a woman at 17.\nThough Mukhopadhyay claims the tale of Modi's poverty is 'grossly exaggerated,' his charisma – and confidence – was evident from an early age.\n'He liked acting in school plays,' said Mukhopadhyay. 'He always wanted to have the lead role. If the lead role was not given to him, he would not act in the play at all.'\nModi was still a child when he was exposed to the idea of Hindu nationalism through classes at the local branch of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing paramilitary organization that advocates for the establishment of Hindu hegemony within India.\nFounded in 1925 by Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, a campaigner who had split from Nehru's Congress party over what he believed to be 'undue pampering of the Muslims,' its central mission is to 'nourish the Hindu culture,' according to the group's website.\nAt 17, Modi abandoned his family and his wife, left his village and traversed India with the group in search of a spiritual awakening, according to his biography. He devoted himself to the RSS, never remarried and learned to 'leave all the pleasures in life,' according to an interview he gave in 2019.\nBy 1972, he had become a 'pracharak' for the RSS, according to his biography, someone appointed to spread their cause through meetings and public lectures.\nThe turning point for the young activist came in 1975, when then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi invoked what she called necessary 'shock treatment' to stamp out internal unrest. She imposed a state of emergency, tightening government control, rounding up critics, censoring her opposition and silencing the press.\nDetached from the demands of marriage, Modi then 25, saw an opportunity, according to his biography. He joined a movement to restore democracy to India, his profile states, marking the start of his journey to political high office.\nAnd in the absence of a family life, many of his supporters have claimed him as part of their own, adding to his everyman appeal. 'Modi is our family,' said the shopkeeper Jaiswal in Varanasi. 'We are all his family.'\nModi joined the BJP in 1987, when the fringe political party started gaining traction fueled by the rise of Hindu nationalism in India.\nConsidered to be the political arm of the RSS, the BJP gained prominence that decade when it advocated for the destruction of the Babri Masjid, a 16th-century mosque believed by Hindus to have been built on the site of the birthplace of the religion's revered Lord Ram.\nAnd it was thrust into the mainstream in 1992, when – spurred on by members of the BJP – Hindu hardliners attacked the mosque, ripping it apart with their hands, and setting off a wave of sectarian violence that reverberated through the nation.\nOne of the BJP's founders Lal Krishna Advani – widely believed to be the brains behind the mosque's destruction – saw a leader in Modi, giving him immense responsibilities within the party.\nNo politician 'brings the experience that Modi does,' Naqvi, the author, said last month from her home in New Delhi, referring to his various political roles.\nModi thrived under Advani's guidance, working his way through the ranks of the BJP. In 2001, he was appointed chief minister of the wealthy state of Gujarat.\nUnder Modi's governance, the state introduced a wave of infrastructure, industry, and innovation to its arid landscape – making the 'Gujarat model' synonymous with development and government efficiency.\nHis tenure was not without controversy.\nViolence erupted in Gujarat in 2002 when Hindus blamed Muslims for setting fire to a train in an incident that killed dozens of Hindu pilgrims and sought revenge by attacking Muslim-owned homes and stores.\nMore than 1,000 people – mostly Muslims – were killed, according to government figures. Critics accused Modi of being complicit in the violence, alleging that his administration failed to prevent or adequately respond to the unrest.\nModi faced international repercussions in its aftermath, with the United States banning him from entering the country for many years over concerns about human rights violations.\nHe vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and the Supreme Court cleared him of complicity. Months after the violence, he was re-elected with a roaring majority – the 'first evidence' of his cult following, said Naqvi, the author.\nBut the polarization of communities deeply divided the nation, leaving scars that persist to this day.\nPolitical scientist Christophe Jaffrelot suggested events in Gujarat made Hindu nationalists more confident. 'But Modi himself is so insecure, he cannot face any questions,' he said.\nModi infamously walked out of an interview in 2007, when journalist Karan Thapar pressed him on his role in the Gujarat riots. He rarely gives interviews, and has not held a solo press conference since becoming Prime Minister.\n'He cannot face debate,' Jaffrelot said.\nModi's 'Gujarat model' had become a blueprint for India and in 2014, the BJP won by a landslide, crushing the Congress – the party's worst defeat in more than 100 years of its existence.\nSince entering into office, Modi's administration has upgraded the country's aging transport network, building highways connecting small villages with major cities. His administration has built new power plants and maritime projects, and, according to recent remarks from Modi himself, subsidized the construction of some 40 million concrete homes for improvised families.\nThe administration also bolstered the country's military capabilities. And it's invested money in sports, science and high-end technology – letting India thrive on the world stage.\nBut for some observers, a troubling pattern has also emerged.\n'He was able to popularize Hindu nationalistic politics and their ideology,' said Mukhopadhyay, the writer and unofficial Modi biographer.\nModi appointed Hindu nationalists to top positions in government, giving them the power to make sweeping changes to legislation, instilling a sense of fear among the 230 million Muslims living in the country.\nIn 2019, he roared through polls yet again – this time on a more clearly defined ticket of Hindu supremacy.\nHe abrogated the special autonomy of Kashmir – India's only Muslim-majority state – bringing it under the direct control of New Delhi. His government implemented a controversial citizenship law considered by many to be discriminatory against Muslims.\nHe built the Ram Temple in Ayodhya on the site of the destroyed mosque, reviving painful memories of 1992's bloodshed for many Muslims, but brought a sense of pride for millions of Hindu devotees.\nAnd to his more vocal critics, Modi's economic policies are also open to question. Despite India now boasting an economy that is projected to grow 7.3% this fiscal year – the highest rate among major global economies – accusations persist that Modi has failed to create enough jobs, or adequately bridge the gap between the country's billionaire class and its most improvised.\n'He has made the poor, poorer. He has increased inequalities,' said Jaffrelot, in reference to the country's wealth gap, which according to a recent study is more unequal than it was during British rule.\nOn the diplomatic front, he's grown closer to the US, been wooed by Australia and courted by the United Kingdom.\nAt the same time, Modi has kept India's historically close relationship with Russia — snapping up huge amounts of Moscow's oil despite the Ukraine invasion — and he maintains relations with both Israel and other Middle Eastern countries at a time of increased polarization.\nAnd an overwhelming majority of Indians appear to put their weight behind his leadership. A recent Morning Context poll ranked Modi as the world's most popular global leader, with an approval rating of 76% at home.\n'He's the number one figure right now. He's the only candidate for prime minister,' Naqvi said.\nAt a Modi rally in the northern city of Ghaziabad earlier this month, thousands of supporters thronged the large grounds as he walked on stage. Some dressed as the Indian god Ram, others head to toe in saffron, the official color of his BJP, their triumphant cries reverberating through the air.\nIn the city of Meerut in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, a Modi supporter says she is voting for him because he is 'unlike any other politician in the world.'\n'I have put Modi's poster in my son's room,' Raniva, who is 36 and goes by one name, said. 'The way (he) is doing so much for the country, I hope my son also does good work for the country.'\nOn the streets of the capital New Delhi, opinion is more divided. 'Nowadays there is so much fighting between Hindus and Muslims. We all know why,' said one rickshaw driver sitting outside the city's famed Jama Mosque.\nWith Modi widely expected to comfortably win the upcoming election, some analysts say they have genuine fears about the future of the country's democracy.\n'I definitely see a decline in the quality of democracy in the country,' said Mukhopadhyay. 'I see greater insecurity and marginalization of Muslims in India. That's not a very rosy picture. But it's the likely path India is going to take.'",

            "summary": "Scranton, Pennsylvania CNN —\nScranton, Pennsylvania CNN — President Joe Biden is seeking to make a sharp economic argument against former President Donald Trump during a three-day swing through Pennsylvania with campaign officials framing the election as a debate between his 'kitchen table' Scranton outlook and Trump's 'Mar-a-Lago vision.'\nThe trip, which kicks off Tuesday in Biden's hometown of Scranton, also will set up a stark split screen as the president is on the campaign trail while Trump spends most of the week in a New York City courtroom for his criminal trial.\n'No matter where Donald Trump is, whether it's in Mar-a-Lago, a courtroom or anywhere else, he'll be focused on himself, his toxic agenda, his campaign of revenge and retribution. That's going to be a continuation of the contrast the American people have been able to see since this campaign began,' said Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler.\nBiden's Pennsylvania push comes as he's also seeking to move the needle with voters who continue to hold sour views about the president's handling of the economy. Recent polling has also shown a close contest between Biden and Trump fewer than seven months from Election Day.\nBiden's speech on Tuesday is expected to be heavy on economic populism as he seeks to portray Trump as out of touch with Americans' concerns. He will zero-in on the two candidates' differing plans on tax policy as the president outlines 'how Trump's tax plan is a handout to the rich and leaves the middle class holding the bag,' Tyler said.\nThe president is expected to take aim at Trump's pledge to extend the sweeping tax cuts that congressional Republicans approved in 2017 – a measure that reduced taxes for most Americans, but from which the rich benefited far more than others. Meanwhile, Biden is campaigning on raising taxes on the wealthy to fund his social and other priorities while protecting those who earn less than $400,000 a year from tax hikes.\nIn 2020, Biden used his hometown to frame the election as a 'Scranton vs. Park Avenue' choice for voters. Ahead of the president's trip this week, campaign officials sought to cast the election as a debate between Scranton and Trump's Mar-a-Lago country club.\n'You got Joe Biden, a candidate who sees the world from the kitchen table where he grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Donald Trump, who sees the world from his country club down at Mar-a-Lago. Nowhere is that contrast of world views on display more clearly, than when it comes to who each candidate believes should be paying more in taxes and who they believe should be paying less,' said Tyler.\nThe president will also travel to Pittsburgh on Wednesday, where he will speak at the United Steelworkers Headquarters, and Philadelphia for a campaign event on Thursday where he will continue to push his economic message.\nBiden's tax plans contain a variety of tax increases on the wealthy and big corporations, which he wants to use to shore up Medicare's finances, create two new tax breaks for buying homes, temporarily extend the enhanced child tax credit, reduce child care costs and permanently extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, among other initiatives.\nHis most recent budget proposal, which outlines the policies that he will also campaign on, calls for a 25% minimum tax on all the income of the wealthiest .01% of Americans, including their appreciated assets, which are not currently taxed. It would hit those with a net worth of more than $100 million.\nBiden also proposes taxing capital gains at the same rate as wage income for those earning more than $1 million and increasing the net investment income tax rate on earned and unearned income above $400,000 to 5%, up from 3.8%.\nThe president wants to increase the corporate tax rate to 28%, up from the 21% rate set by the GOP tax cut package in 2017, and raise the corporate minimum tax rate on billion-dollar corporations to 21%, from 15%. Also, he would reduce incentives for multinational businesses to book profits in low-tax jurisdictions and raise the tax rate on their foreign earnings to 21% from 10.5%. Plus, he would quadruple the tax on companies that buy back their own stock instead of investing in workers or lowering prices.\nTrump sought to preempt Biden's speech with a social media post Monday touting the 2017 tax cuts and criticizing Biden's plans to raise taxes for the wealthy and corporations.\n'If Joe Biden gets his way you will soon be facing colossal tax hikes, the likes of which no one has ever seen before,' Trump said in a video on Truth Social.\nThe former president has told supporters – including wealthy donors – that extending the 2017 tax cuts will be one of his main goals for a second term. The law reduced individual and corporate income tax rates, changed international tax rules, repealed personal exemptions, increased the standard deduction and child tax credit, limited or restricted certain itemized deductions and doubled the estate tax exemption, among other provisions.\nMost Americans benefited from the tax law, but the wealthy benefited the most.\nNearly all the individual income and estate tax provisions expire at the end of 2025, while most of the corporate measures are permanent. The next president and Congress will have to deal with the expiring provisions next year.\nAhead of the trip, Biden used Tax Day to tee up another contrast with his predecessor by releasing his tax 2023 return. Trump declined to voluntarily release his tax returns as president.\n'President Biden believes that all occupants of the Oval Office should be open and honest with the American people,' the White House said in a statement on Monday, 'and that the longstanding tradition of annually releasing presidential tax returns should continue unbroken.'\nThe president's events this week come as his campaign continues to build out its infrastructure Pennsylvania, where recent polling has shown no clear leader in a two-way race between Biden and Trump.\nBiden campaign battleground states director Dan Kanninen told reporters on a call Monday that the Biden campaign is investing heavily in the commonwealth with a particular focus on driving turnout in Philadelphia. The Biden campaign has opened 14 new offices in Pennsylvania in March as they work to train volunteers and hire campaign staff.\n'We're obviously looking at Pennsylvania right now where the president is spending the week campaigning, and it's a textbook example of how we're going to run those votes,' said Kanninen.\nCampaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez also released a campaign strategy memo ahead of the visit, pointing to the coordinated campaign's early investments in Allegheny County, home to Pittsburgh, as well as in the central part of the state in York and Lancaster counties – two counties Trump won in 2020 where the team sees 'opportunities for Democratic growth as shown by gains made at the local level.'\nChavez Rodriguez argued Biden's support for unions, abortion rights, and protecting democracy will play with Pennsylvania voters in November.\n'With all of these issues remaining salient for voters and Trump and MAGA Republicans only becoming more extreme, they continue to alienate the voters that decide elections in Pennsylvania – and show no signs of being able to win them back,' she wrote.",

            "summary": "President Joe Biden is seeking to make a sharp economic argument against former President Donald Trump during a three-day swing through Pennsylvania with campaign officials framing the election as a debate between his 'kitchen table' Scranton outlook and Trump's 'Mar-a-Lago vision.'\nThe trip, which kicks off Tuesday in Biden's hometown of Scranton, also will set up a stark split screen as the president is on the campaign trail while Trump spends most of the week in a New York City courtroom for his criminal trial.\n'No matter where Donald Trump is, whether it's in Mar-a-Lago, a courtroom or anywhere else, he'll be focused on himself, his toxic agenda, his campaign of revenge and retribution. That's going to be a continuation of the contrast the American people have been able to see since this campaign began,' said Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler.\nBiden's Pennsylvania push comes as he's also seeking to move the needle with voters who continue to hold sour views about the president's handling of the economy. Recent polling has also shown a close contest between Biden and Trump fewer than seven months from Election Day.\nBiden's speech on Tuesday is expected to be heavy on economic populism as he seeks to portray Trump as out of touch with Americans' concerns. He will zero-in on the two candidates' differing plans on tax policy as the president outlines 'how Trump's tax plan is a handout to the rich and leaves the middle class holding the bag,' Tyler said.\nThe president is expected to take aim at Trump's pledge to extend the sweeping tax cuts that congressional Republicans approved in 2017 – a measure that reduced taxes for most Americans, but from which the rich benefited far more than others. Meanwhile, Biden is campaigning on raising taxes on the wealthy to fund his social and other priorities while protecting those who earn less than $400,000 a year from tax hikes.\nIn 2020, Biden used his hometown to frame the election as a 'Scranton vs. Park Avenue' choice for voters. Ahead of the president's trip this week, campaign officials sought to cast the election as a debate between Scranton and Trump's Mar-a-Lago country club.\n'You got Joe Biden, a candidate who sees the world from the kitchen table where he grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Donald Trump, who sees the world from his country club down at Mar-a-Lago. Nowhere is that contrast of world views on display more clearly, than when it comes to who each candidate believes should be paying more in taxes and who they believe should be paying less,' said Tyler.\nThe president will also travel to Pittsburgh on Wednesday, where he will speak at the United Steelworkers Headquarters, and Philadelphia for a campaign event on Thursday where he will continue to push his economic message.\nBiden's tax plans contain a variety of tax increases on the wealthy and big corporations, which he wants to use to shore up Medicare's finances, create two new tax breaks for buying homes, temporarily extend the enhanced child tax credit, reduce child care costs and permanently extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, among other initiatives.\nHis most recent budget proposal, which outlines the policies that he will also campaign on, calls for a 25% minimum tax on all the income of the wealthiest .01% of Americans, including their appreciated assets, which are not currently taxed. It would hit those with a net worth of more than $100 million.\nBiden also proposes taxing capital gains at the same rate as wage income for those earning more than $1 million and increasing the net investment income tax rate on earned and unearned income above $400,000 to 5%, up from 3.8%.\nThe president wants to increase the corporate tax rate to 28%, up from the 21% rate set by the GOP tax cut package in 2017, and raise the corporate minimum tax rate on billion-dollar corporations to 21%, from 15%. Also, he would reduce incentives for multinational businesses to book profits in low-tax jurisdictions and raise the tax rate on their foreign earnings to 21% from 10.5%. Plus, he would quadruple the tax on companies that buy back their own stock instead of investing in workers or lowering prices.\nTrump sought to preempt Biden's speech with a social media post Monday touting the 2017 tax cuts and criticizing Biden's plans to raise taxes for the wealthy and corporations.\n'If Joe Biden gets his way you will soon be facing colossal tax hikes, the likes of which no one has ever seen before,' Trump said in a video on Truth Social.\nThe former president has told supporters – including wealthy donors – that extending the 2017 tax cuts will be one of his main goals for a second term. The law reduced individual and corporate income tax rates, changed international tax rules, repealed personal exemptions, increased the standard deduction and child tax credit, limited or restricted certain itemized deductions and doubled the estate tax exemption, among other provisions.\nMost Americans benefited from the tax law, but the wealthy benefited the most.\nNearly all the individual income and estate tax provisions expire at the end of 2025, while most of the corporate measures are permanent. The next president and Congress will have to deal with the expiring provisions next year.\nAhead of the trip, Biden used Tax Day to tee up another contrast with his predecessor by releasing his tax 2023 return. Trump declined to voluntarily release his tax returns as president.\n'President Biden believes that all occupants of the Oval Office should be open and honest with the American people,' the White House said in a statement on Monday, 'and that the longstanding tradition of annually releasing presidential tax returns should continue unbroken.'\nThe president's events this week come as his campaign continues to build out its infrastructure Pennsylvania, where recent polling has shown no clear leader in a two-way race between Biden and Trump.\nBiden campaign battleground states director Dan Kanninen told reporters on a call Monday that the Biden campaign is investing heavily in the commonwealth with a particular focus on driving turnout in Philadelphia. The Biden campaign has opened 14 new offices in Pennsylvania in March as they work to train volunteers and hire campaign staff.\n'We're obviously looking at Pennsylvania right now where the president is spending the week campaigning, and it's a textbook example of how we're going to run those votes,' said Kanninen.\nCampaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez also released a campaign strategy memo ahead of the visit, pointing to the coordinated campaign's early investments in Allegheny County, home to Pittsburgh, as well as in the central part of the state in York and Lancaster counties – two counties Trump won in 2020 where the team sees 'opportunities for Democratic growth as shown by gains made at the local level.'\nChavez Rodriguez argued Biden's support for unions, abortion rights, and protecting democracy will play with Pennsylvania voters in November.\n'With all of these issues remaining salient for voters and Trump and MAGA Republicans only becoming more extreme, they continue to alienate the voters that decide elections in Pennsylvania – and show no signs of being able to win them back,' she wrote.",

            "excerpt": "They opened the box on a Sunday in late March, getting their first look at Asfan Mohammed since he departed India for Russia four months earlier.",
            "summary": "They opened the box on a Sunday in late March, getting their first look at Asfan Mohammed since he departed India for Russia four months earlier.\nHe was better dressed than when he'd left – a black suit, white shirt, tie and shoes replacing the casual attire he'd worn when family and friends saw him off.\nBut he had to be buried in line with his Muslim beliefs, so his body would need to be prepared; the neat clothes removed.\nIt was then Imran Mohammad, 41, saw the extent of what had happened to his 31-year-old brother while fighting for the Russian armed forces in Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.\n'I saw holes on the back of his shoulder, his ribs right down till his lower back,' Imran told CNN.\n'There were six to seven holes caused by a drone attack. It ripped through his body. There was internal damage. Two teeth were broken.'\nAnd now this tight-knit family in Hyderabad, southern India was broken too. A husband, father and provider gone.\nImran's business was also in ruins, rotted by neglect as he'd focused all his energies on finding out what happened to his brother on the battlefield of Europe's bloodiest conflict since the Second World War.\nImran noted the time.\n'I opened the box at 11 a.m. Sunday. When I saw his body for the first time, it hit me that he's no more,' he said.\n'My efforts to look for my brother, my two-month fight for my brother, came to a painful end. I wanted to react looking at his corpse, but I just couldn't. I went totally numb.'\nAsfan met an unlikely fate – one his family could never have imagined when Putin ordered Russian troops into Ukraine in February 2022.\nAt the time, the father of two managed a clothing store, one of almost 300 across India in the homegrown Allen Solly chain, selling kids' clothes, wedding tuxedos and just about everything in between.\nHe'd been there eight years, his brother said.\nIt wasn't the worst job, but Asfan wanted more for his wife and two children, ages 2 and 8 months. And he dreamed of taking them out of Hyderabad.\n'He wanted to work in Australia,' where his sister-in-law and her family lived, Imran said. 'They were calling him and his family there.'\nBut that meant Asfan would need a high score on the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), which gauges proficiency of non-native speakers.\n'He wrote his IELTS. He didn't do well,' Imran said. 'He felt demotivated. He tried again.'\nIt didn't work, Imran said.\nBut videos on YouTube about job opportunities in Russia gave Asfan new hope, and he contacted an employment agency, his brother said.\n'He was going to work as a taxi driver or delivery boy in Russia – that process was on,' Imran said.\n'Then a couple of days later the agents said there are vacancies for helper and security jobs in the Russian army. The agents assured him that this was the best job. They said he could get a Russian passport and national card within a year through which you could move around neighboring countries.'\nAsfan thought that could be a stepping stone to his family's dream life in Australia, his brother said.\nInstead, his choice took him to the frigid, battle-scarred landscape of Ukraine.\nAsfan kept his plans secret from family and friends until it was too late to turn back, according to Imran, who said he only learned his brother was leaving three days before he set off for Russia on November 9 last year.\nBy that time, Asfan had paid more than $1,800 to the recruiters, who asked him not to speak to anyone, even his family, about his intention to travel.\n'They had brainwashed him so much … They warned him he could be deported from Russia, from the airport,' Imran said. 'I tried my level best to stop him.'\nAfter a multi-stop route that took him through other Indian cities and the United Arab Emirates, Asfan arrived in Moscow on November 12.\nA day later, he signed papers – in Russian, which he couldn't read – committing him to the work, his brother said.\n'He trusted the agents a bit too much,' Imran said.\nBy some estimates, Russia has been sending thousands of foreign men to fight in Ukraine since Putin ordered the invasion.\nMany of them are young men from South Asia, enticed by the prospect of steady employment and higher salaries in Russia. In Nepal, prominent opposition lawmaker and former foreign minister Bimala Rai Paudyal told parliament earlier this year that between 14,000 and 15,000 Nepalis were fighting on the front lines, citing testimony from men returning from Ukraine.\nThe Russian government last year announced a lucrative package for foreign fighters to join the country's military, including a monthly salary of at least $2,000 and a fast track to Russian citizenship – but the Kremlin has not said how many foreigners it has recruited under the plan.\nNew Delhi has strong ties with Moscow dating back to the Cold War and has largely steered clear of condemning outright the invasion by Russia, which remains India's biggest arms supplier.\nIndia has also become a major purchaser of Russian energy, bolstering Moscow's coffers by a record $37 billion of crude oil purchases last year alone and providing Russia's sanctions hit economy with vital revenue.\nMeanwhile, India, which has no law preventing its citizens from serving in a foreign state's military, has acknowledged that a number of its nationals have been fighting for Russia in Ukraine.\nIn a statement in February, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said getting those Indians an early discharge from the Russian military was a 'top priority.' The ministry told CNN last month it has been in continuous contact with Russian authorities to make that happen.\nBut for some, those efforts would come too late. A ministry spokesperson told CNN at least two Indians have died in the conflict.\nIn early March, India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said it had busted major human trafficking networks that were duping men into Russian military jobs, with 35 such cases identified.\n'The trafficked Indian Nationals were trained in combat roles and deployed at front bases in Russia-Ukraine War Zone against their wishes,' the CBI statement said.\nAsfan didn't tell his brother when he was going to be sent to Ukraine, Imran said, but he did get in contact on December 1, just as he was heading to the battlefield.\nAsfan was seeking a way out, Imran said.\n'He asked me to speak to the agents,' Imran said. 'I did promise him that I'd try my best.'\nIt was the last time they spoke to each other.\n'The military personnel were not in touch with these agents,' Imran said.\n'These brokers duped the boys and put their lives in danger,' he said, referring to Asfan and other Indians sent to war.\nOn January 23, Imran received a voice message from one of those Indian men deployed alongside Asfan.\nThe man, who said he had been injured in combat, told Imran he had found Asfan, who'd also been injured, inside a house in Ukraine a day earlier.\nImran said the man told him he couldn't pick his brother up 'because of the drones around them,' but had passed word of Asfan's condition to a Russian medical team.\nUkrainian forces have used converted commercial drones against their Russian opponents with devastating effect on the frontlines, either by dropping grenades from above or by using them as remote controlled bombs.\nTwo days later, Imran said he visited his member of parliament to try to get Indian officials to help his injured brother. But pleas to the government went unanswered, he said.\nThe Indian Embassy in Moscow eventually replied that it was looking into the case.\nOn a March 6 visit to his MP's office, Imran got the news he had dreaded.\n'We called the emergency number at the Indian Embassy (in Moscow). As soon as I mentioned Asfan's name on the phone, they told me he's dead. I didn't have the strength to talk to them,' he said.\n'I didn't want to believe what they were saying.'\nHe still had no visual proof of Asfan's death, but he had to pass on what he'd learned to the rest of the family.\nAsfan's wife 'was unconscious for three hours,' Imran said. 'She cried through the night.'\nAsfan's family has buried his body, but they are scarred by a war far away.\nImran says it pains him to look at his brother's young children, who will never know their dad. And he says his own future feels uncertain.\n'This has been on for four months, for 24 hours a day,' he said. 'This has been the worst phase I've ever been through. There's no personal life anymore. No friendship left. I've only been taking care of my family.'\nAnd one of them, his brother, is forever gone.",

            "summary": "It's Tax Day in the United States.\nSome Americans are scrambling to get their documents in on time, while others are figuring out how to pay what they owe or enjoying a return of cash from the IRS. Either way, it's fair to say that filing taxes is stressful business.\nThis year, it's estimated that taxpayers will spend $104 billion on out-of-pocket expenses associated with preparing and submitting tax forms, according to a recent report by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. They'll also spend an estimated 6.55 billion collective hours preparing their documents to comply with tax laws.\n'We have built ourselves a house of cards that is unlike anything else in the developed world,' said Bill Harris, the former CEO of Turbotax and founding CEO of Paypal. 'The tax code is so complex that it takes a tremendous amount of time and money for many people to file,' he told CNN.\nIt's particularly difficult for investors, he said, who have to report their earnings and losses from the market to the IRS.\n'If I had a magic wand I would create a dramatic and massive reform of the tax code and make it hugely simpler,' he said.\nBut he doesn't.\nAs an alternative, Harris, who currently heads financial services firm Evergreen Money and recently authored a book about reducing tax burdens, shared his three biggest tax tips for investors with Before the Bell.\nIt's not all about the 401(k): 'You should absolutely max out your 401(k) to the point of your employer match,' said Harris. 'It's free money.'\nIt's not all about the 401(k): 'You should absolutely max out your 401(k) to the point of your employer match,' said Harris. 'It's free money.' Beyond that match, he said, there are other vehicles you can hold your retirement money in.\nIf you think of stocks as a long-term investment, it's logical to want to hold them in your retirement account. But that's a mistake, he said.\n'What you want to do is you want to put your income generating assets in your tax-advantaged accounts [like 401(ks) and Roth IRAs], because those are the ones who are really getting taxed high,' he said. 'Then you put your capital gain assets in your taxable accounts.'\nIf you hold stocks for more than 12 months, the top federal tax rate for capital gains is 20%, not 37% like income tax, so 'you're already ahead,' he said.\nFrom there, just defer selling for as long as you can, he said. 'You can defer as long as you want and pay no tax,' he said.\nIf you have to sell, harvest your losses: Every now and then, you should review your stock portfolio to understand its tax implications, said Harris.\nIf you have to sell, harvest your losses: Every now and then, you should review your stock portfolio to understand its tax implications, said Harris. An increase over your purchase price results in an unrealized capital gain (a profit that exists on paper but hasn't been cashed in yet), while a decrease indicates an unrealized loss. These gains or losses only become 'realized' and taxable when you sell, he explained.\nSo for tax purposes, selling securities that have lost value can offset the taxes due on gains from successful investments. If your losses exceed your gains, you can carry the net loss (total losses minus total gains) into the next tax year, potentially reducing future tax burdens.\nBut, he warned, be cautious of the 'wash sale' rule. You can't recognize a tax loss if you repurchase the same security within 30 days of selling it. Frequent trading, leading to short-term gains (profits from assets held for a short period, typically less than a year), is taxed at higher ordinary income rates and may result in underperformance compared to the market.\nGive back: Investments rise over time. And even if you defer and offset their sales, 'you're eventually going to have some stocks with a high percentage of appreciation,' said Harris. 'You can ultimately just sell and pay the tax, but you can also actually eliminate even that part in a number of ways.'\nGive back: Investments rise over time. And even if you defer and offset their sales, 'you're eventually going to have some stocks with a high percentage of appreciation,' said Harris. 'You can ultimately just sell and pay the tax, but you can also actually eliminate even that part in a number of ways.' The first is through charitable giving. 'What you do is always only give those highly appreciated securities,' he said . 'With a relatively small amount of charitable giving, you can eliminate a lot of tax.'\n. 'With a relatively small amount of charitable giving, you can eliminate a lot of tax.' If you have children, each parent can give each of their children $17,000 a year tax free, he said. If you have three children and two parents, that's $108,000 in tax free money a year, Harris said.\nYou don't have to be ultra-wealthy to start a tax-free trust fund for your kids, either. Parents can open custodial accounts for their young children, he said, and start accumulating those cash gifts right away.\nOil prices eased Monday but gold rose and global stocks were mixed as rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East spurred demand for safe haven investments after Iran launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, report my colleagues Laura He and Anna Cooban.\nThe price of Brent crude dipped below $90 a barrel, while US WTI crude dropped by 1% to $84.50 by 4.46 a.m. ET.

New York CNN —\nNew York CNN — Eight years ago, when North Carolina tried regulate how transgender people use public bathrooms, Corporate America revolted.\nPayPal scrapped a planned expansion of one of its operations in the state. Musicians canceled performances. And the NCAA said it wouldn't let North Carolina host championships while the law was on the books. All in, the boycott cost the state's economy around $4 billion, according to an analysis by the Associated Press, which noted its tally was likely an underestimation.\nLately, though, Corporate America doesn't have the same stomach for a culture war.\nLast year, at least 510 anti-LGBTQ bills were introduced in US state legislatures — a new record, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, and nearly three times the number of such bills introduced in 2022. Nearly two dozen states have either banned or severely curtailed abortion rights since Roe v. Wade was overturned two years ago.\nWhile corporate giants from a range of industries pledged to provide support and financial assistance for employees seeking abortion care, few are wading into that political conversation with the kind of fervor we've seen on other issues in the recent past.\nThere doesn't appear to be a single, unified theory for why that's the case. Perhaps businesses were willing to take more risks in a zero-interest-rate environment, when their stocks were riding high and customers were unfazed by inflation. Perhaps the payoff of past progressive campaigns proved too costly in a deeply polarized country — no brand wants to be the next Bud Light.\nAnother possibility: Customers and businesses simply have outrage fatigue, says Cait Lamberton, professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.\n'People can only stay enraged for so long,' Lamberton told me. 'We are actually very good at adapting to psychological discomfort. Very quickly, our rationalization mechanisms kick in, and we are able to find a way to reframe the actions of a brand, or our own actions, in ways that don't create massive internal conflict.'\nI spoke to Lamberton about the changing winds of corporate activism and the dilemma leaders find themselves in.\nThe following interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nThe following interview has been edited for length and clarity. Nightcap: There was a real trend, starting around 2016, of companies taking a political or moral stand on cultural fights. But in the past year or so, that seems to have gone out of vogue. What's happening?\nNightcap: There was a real trend, starting around 2016, of companies taking a political or moral stand on cultural fights. But in the past year or so, that seems to have gone out of vogue. What's happening? Lamberton: What we've seen is the natural life cycle of an idea. And that idea is that every brand needs to have a social and ideological purpose.\nLamberton: What we've seen is the natural life cycle of an idea. And that idea is that every brand needs to have a social and ideological purpose. For at least six years, we saw pretty strong numbers related to people's interest in brand activism.\nConsumers wanted not only to have their own personal needs met, but for brands to more generally provide value to society as a whole. But in the last few years, we've seen that position softening.\nSince 2016, we've had anger about politics. We've had anger about Ukraine, about abortion rights, the list goes on. And it's not a place where most people can stay for extended periods of time.\nNightcap: It felt like we'd come full circle a year ago, when Bud Light angered some folks by partnering with a trans social media influencer. It was such a small, seemingly innocuous ad, but the reaction was enormous. ﻿(The brand's parent company Anheuser-Busch said it lost about $1 billion in sales as a result of the backlash.)\nNightcap: It felt like we'd come full circle a year ago, when Bud Light angered some folks by partnering with a trans social media influencer.

Lamberton: I think a few things happened there.\nLamberton: I think a few things happened there. When people get into a room, it's very easy to start thinking that they represent the rest of the world. 'Brand purpose' often takes an internal turn, so it comes to be defined by what the employees and the leadership believe in. But if you lose sight of your customer, you can make huge mistakes.\nSo, I think there was a disconnect there, which isn't to say that all Bud Light drinkers were anti-trans. But there may have been a vocal segment that was going to respond negatively.\nThe other thing that they did that caused some problems is that they backed off from it. Bud Light took a position that had a cost, and then they immediately ran away when they realized the cost, and that added insult to injury.\nThere certainly were ways that aligning with a historically excluded population could benefit the brand. But you can't do it without anticipating the potential effects.\nNightcap: So are we just reverting back to the old model of shareholder capitalism, everything focused on the bottom line and steering clear of politics?\nNightcap: So are we just reverting back to the old model of shareholder capitalism, everything focused on the bottom line and steering clear of politics? Lamberton: It depends very much on the kind of brand we're talking about.\nLamberton: It depends very much on the kind of brand we're talking about. Brands are in a difficult position, in some ways. On one hand, they can choose to be an activist about something that won't harm them, and shareholders should like that.\nThe problem is that when there's no cost, it's not seen as credible. So on the other hand, you can take an activist stance that has a cost, and then some stakeholders are going to be mad at you for doing so.\nBrands' hesitation may be quite rational in that they're caught between these two poles — do we do something costless, that will not make any difference? Or do we do something costly and risk creating real damage, not only to our bottom line, but also potentially alienating some of our consumers?\nIt's not an easy decision to make.\nNightcap: When Georgia had restrictive voting bills on the ballot in 2021, a bunch of companies, including Coca Cola and Delta, spoke out about it. We haven't seen quite the same pushback in the wake of Roe being overturned last year and all the subsequent abortion bans that have been put in place since.\nNightcap: When Georgia had restrictive voting bills on the ballot in 2021, a bunch of companies, including Coca Cola and Delta, spoke out about it.

There is, I believe, a sense that there isn't a huge payoff to be had from courting public opinion. At the end of the day, the courts are going to make these calls.\nCompanies may recognize that they don't have as much power as they might in other areas. Corporations directly affect the environment with the products they make. They directly affect pay equity. They can directly affect gun-related issues. But they don't have a direct connection to abortion. The only way that they can do anything is by guaranteeing reproductive rights for their employees. Probably the best thing that corporations could do is give people voting day off.\nNightcap: Have we seen this play before? Like, what historical precedents do companies have to draw on when it comes to brand activism?\nNightcap: Have we seen this play before?

Here in Philadelphia, the most vivid example is Wanamaker's department store (established in 1861). John Wanamaker was an evangelical Christian who felt that a business' job in the world was to morally uplift people.\nThe general idea was that this company should be part of the set of forces that shape society. So we have had companies taking ideological positions for a long time. But I do think we're in a slightly different environment now.\nTechnology has created a high level of transparency about what companies do. People have new ways of connecting and sharing information that didn't previously exist. Politically, we've certainly become more polarized. Economically, we've seen a great deal of volatility just in the last half decade. So it would be very hard to say there's a historical analog that maps onto this context.\nNightcap: Right. The Wanamakers didn't need to hire a social media manager.\nNightcap: Right. The Wanamakers didn't need to hire a social media manager.

Marjorie Taylor Greene said she won't yet move forward with a motion to vacate. 1 min ago From CNN's Lauren Fox and Alison Main A number of lawmakers who backed the aid packages today said their views on House Speaker Mike Johnson as a leader changed after the speaker put bills on the floor despite a threat against his job. House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, said he thinks it was a transformative moment for Johnson as a leader, adding that the speaker's stock in the conference has gone up even as he faces the threat of an ouster from a minority of members. 'I have tremendous respect. ... He had a learning curve, but at the end of the day, he knew what the right thing to do was,' McCaul said. Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois was blunt when asked whether he had a new respect and view of the speaker than he did two weeks ago. 'I guess I do. The old adage is it's never too late to do the right thing. We tested that,' Quigley said. 'I think we build on this. ... We have a lot of challenges. It's good news that today at a critical time, we did act cohesively as a legislature.' GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said he always thought Johnson would get there but a turning point came when the speaker was briefed that passing Ukraine aid by April was essential. 'He's always said he was for Ukraine, and I've always believed him,' Bacon said. 'I think he just came to the conclusion we couldn't wait any longer.

Drew Angerer/AFP/Getty Images Moments after the House passed four foreign aid bills totaling $95 billion, Speaker Mike Johnson said he had not spoken to Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries about potentially saving his job if his hardline colleagues move to oust him. ��I don't walk around this building being worried about a motion to vacate,' Johnson said, referring to a procedural tool to remove the House speaker. 'I have to do my job. ... I've done here what I believe to be the right thing to allow the House to work its will. And as I've said, you do the right thing, and you let the chips fall where they may.' Walking toward his office, Johnson told reporters that he believes he will still be speaker in November and that he hasn't spoken to any of his detractors Saturday. Johnson said the 'world is destabilized' and 'a tinderbox,' stressing the importance of the bills' passage in a 'dangerous time.' 'Three of our primary adversaries, Russia, and Iran, and China, are working together and they're being aggressors around the globe,' Johnson said. 'They're a global threat to our prosperity and our security. Their advance threatens the free world, and it demands American leadership. We turn our backs right now, the consequences could be devastating.' 21 min ago From CNN's Priscilla Alvarez The White House on Saturday clinched urgent foreign aid after a monthslong saga that involved starts and stops in Congress and was momentarily upended by one of the most politically vulnerable issues for President Joe Biden: border security. The ask for additional aid to Ukraine, among other priorities, dates to October, when the White House put forward its national security supplemental funding request. Over the last several months, Biden has framed the need to provide additional funds to the war-torn country as a national security priority, warning that no ground should be ceded to Russia. More recently, US officials attributed losses on the battlefield in Ukraine to the lack of additional assistance from the United States. In February, for example, the White House laid the blame for Ukraine's withdrawal from the key town of Avdiivka squarely at the feet of Republicans in Congress. Funding for Ukraine was also a recurring topic of discussion between Biden and global leaders as the US sought to reaffirm its leadership on the world stage — a theme echoed in the president's statement Saturday. 'Today, members of both parties in the House voted to advance our national security interests and send a clear message about the power of American leadership on the world stage. At this critical inflection point, they came together to answer history's call, passing urgently-needed national security legislation that I have fought for months to secure,' Biden said. 32 min ago TikTok criticized the House's passage of a bill that could ban the app in the US. \"It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement Saturday. 41 min ago From CNN's Samantha Waldenberg President Joe Biden speaks at a campaign event in Philadelphia on Thursday. Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters/File President Joe Biden said in a statement Saturday that the House passage of foreign aid bills sends a 'clear message' about America's leadership to the globe.

At this critical inflection point, they came together to answer history's call, passing urgently-needed national security legislation that I have fought for months to secure,' Biden said. 'I urge the Senate to quickly send this package to my desk so that I can sign it into law and we can quickly send weapons and equipment to Ukraine to meet their urgent battlefield needs,' he added. 17 min ago From CNN's Tamar Michaelis in Jerusalem Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked the US House for passing the Israel aid bill. 'The US Congress just overwhelmingly passed a much appreciated aid bill that demonstrates strong bipartisan support for Israel and defends Western civilization. Thank you friends, thank you America!' Netanyahu said on social media. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz also thanked the House, saying he hopes the measure will pass in the US Senate soon 'with strong bipartisan support.' Posting on X, Katz said, 'Thank you @SpeakerJohnson for your leadership which led the efforts to pass the Israel aid package in the House of Representatives today. And thank you Minority Leader @RepJeffries for supporting it.The vote on the Israel aid package with an overwhelming bipartisan support proves the strong ties and strategic partnership between Israel and the U.S. and sends a strong message to our enemies. I hope it passes the Senate soon with strong bipartisan support.' 57 min ago From CNN's Haley Talbot The House has adjourned after passing a foreign aid package that now heads to the Senate. House Speaker Mike Johnson's job is safe, for now, after Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said she won't move forward with her motion to vacate — a rarely used procedural tool to remove the House speaker — on Saturday. She said she wants her GOP colleagues to 'go home and hear from their constituents.' The House is not expected back until April 29 after a one-week recess. 47 min ago From CNN's Haley Talbot Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks at a press conference in Berlin on February 16./File Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on X that he is \"grateful\" for House lawmakers for passing the measure that provides aid to Ukraine, personally thanking Speaker Mike Johnson \"for the decision that keeps history on the right track.\" \"Democracy and freedom will always have global significance and will never fail as long as America helps to protect it,\" Zelensky said in the post. \"The vital U.S. aid bill passed today by the House will keep the war from expanding, save thousands and thousands of lives, and help both of our nations to become stronger.\" \"Just peace and security can only be attained through strength,\" he added. 1 hr 5 min ago From CNN's Morgan Rimmer and Manu Raju Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly argued that House Democrats should not save Speaker Mike Johnson's job, telling CNN that the only speaker he wants is Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. 'Democrats need to decide who they want to be speaker, and I want Hakeem Jeffries, he said.

            "excerpt": "Here is a fact check of seven of Biden's Pennsylvania remarks.",
            "summary": "Washington CNN —\nWashington CNN — President Joe Biden spent three days this week campaigning in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania. He littered his remarks with false and misleading claims on subjects ranging from his annual earnings to his cap on seniors' prescription drug spending to the demographics of China to the frequency of his past travel to Iraq and Afghanistan.\nAnd in Biden's most eyebrow-raising remarks of the campaign swing, he told and then retold a story in which he strongly suggested his late uncle, Ambrose Finnegan, was eaten by cannibals after his plane was shot down while he fought in World War II. Biden's dramatic details don't match the Defense Department's official account of the plane crash.\nHere is a fact check of eight of Biden's Pennsylvania remarks.\nIn the same Tuesday speech in Scranton, Biden repeated his regular promise that nobody making less than $400,000 per year will pay even a cent more in taxes under his proposals. He then added, 'I hope you're all able to make $400,000. I never did.'\nFacts First : Biden's 'I never did' claim is false. In fact, his presidential salary is $400,000 per year ; the joint tax filings of President Biden and first lady Jill Biden showed $619,976 in income last year , $579,514 in 2022 and $610,702 in 2021. In addition, Biden earned millions in 2017 and 2018, when, during his time as a private citizen following his vice presidency, he and Jill Biden signed a lucrative book deal and he delivered paid speeches . The Bidens' joint tax filings showed a total of about $11 million in 2017 income and about $4.6 million in 2018 income.\nFacts First: Biden's 'I never did' claim is false. In fact, his presidential salary is $400,000 per year ; the joint tax filings of President Biden and first lady Jill Biden showed $619,976 in income last year , $579,514 in 2022 and $610,702 in 2021. In addition, Biden earned millions in 2017 and 2018, when, during his time as a private citizen following his vice presidency, he and Jill Biden signed a lucrative book deal and he delivered paid speeches . The Bidens' joint tax filings showed a total of about $11 million in 2017 income and about $4.6 million in 2018 income. Biden, who was a US senator for 36 years prior to his vice presidency, did regularly earn less than $400,000 per year before 2017. As PolitiFact has previously noted, the Bidens' joint filings reported less than $400,000 in income in each year from 1998 through 2016 except for 2013, when they were just over $407,000.\nIn the same speech in Scranton, Biden touted provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act he signed in 2022. He said: 'For example, seniors, beginning in 2024, no matter how much their prescription drug costs are, they'll never have to pay more than $2,000 a year, no matter what.'\nFacts First : Biden's claim is false in two ways. First, the $2,000 cap on Medicare Part D enrollees' out-of-pocket prescription drug spending takes effect in 2025 , not 2024; there is a higher cap, more than $3,000, in place this year . (The White House corrected the official transcript of Biden's speech to make clear Biden should have said 2025 instead of 2024.) Second, it's not true that seniors will 'never' have to spend more than $2,000 per year on prescription drugs 'no matter what.' The cap is indexed to annual inflation in Part D costs , so it is highly likely to be set higher than $2,000 in future years. Also, the cap doesn't apply to out-of-pocket spending on Medicare Part B drugs like those administered at doctors' offices.\nFacts First: Biden's claim is false in two ways. First, the $2,000 cap on Medicare Part D enrollees' out-of-pocket prescription drug spending takes effect in 2025 , not 2024; there is a higher cap, more than $3,000, in place this year . (The White House corrected the official transcript of Biden's speech to make clear Biden should have said 2025 instead of 2024.) Second, it's not true that seniors will 'never' have to spend more than $2,000 per year on prescription drugs 'no matter what.' The cap is indexed to annual inflation in Part D costs , so it is highly likely to be set higher than $2,000 in future years. Also, the cap doesn't apply to out-of-pocket spending on Medicare Part B drugs like those administered at doctors' offices. Biden has correctly said on various previous occasions that the $2,000 cap takes effect in 2025, but he has also previously incorrectly said that the cap took effect in 2023 or 2024.\n- CNN's Tami Luhby contributed to this item.\n- CNN's Tami Luhby contributed to this item. In a Wednesday speech in Pittsburgh that was focused on US steel competition with China, Biden said, 'I always say to my colleagues — when I meet other world leaders, I say, ‘Would you trade places with China? Would you trade places with their problems?' They've got a population that is more people in retirement than working.'\nFacts First : The claim that China has more retired people than working people is false.

Fuxian Yi, a University of Wisconsin-Madison senior scientist who is an expert on Chinese demographics , called Biden's claim 'overstated and premature.' China reported having more than 740 million employed people at the end of 2023, while it also reported having just shy of 297 million people age 60 or above that year.

Yi noted that China's ratio of working people to seniors is shrinking as the country's population ages. But Biden's claim that the number of retirees already exceeds the number of people working is clearly not correct, even if you apply the usual dose of skepticism to official Chinese data.\nratio of working people to seniors is shrinking as the country's population ages. But Biden's claim that the number of retirees already exceeds the number of people working is clearly not correct, even if you apply the usual dose of skepticism to official Chinese data. 'It's certainly the direction they're heading, but still an exaggeration,' Derek Scissors, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank who is an expert on the Chinese economy, said of Biden's claim.\nBiden made a similar claim in 2021, which CNN fact-checked as false at the time.\nAs he has on numerous previous occasions, Biden cited a 2021 report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy think tank that found that 55 of the country's largest corporations had made more than $40 billion in total profit in their previous fiscal year but not paid any federal corporate income taxes.\nBiden said in the same Tuesday speech in Scranton: 'When Trump was president in 2020, 55 of the largest corporations in America of the Fortune 500 made $40 billion in profit and paid zero — zero — in federal income taxes.' After someone in the audience called that 'sinful,' Biden continued, 'Well, guess what? I came along and took care of the sin. Not anymore. Thanks to the law that I wrote and signed, big corporations now have to pay a minimum — they should be paying more — a minimum of 15% tax.'\nFacts First : Biden's 'not anymore' claim is false — the same exaggeration he delivered in his State of the Union address in March . While the 15% corporate minimum tax he signed into law in the Inflation Reduction Act will reduce the number of big corporations that don't pay any federal taxes, it's not true that 'not anymore' will any big corporation — such as the ones on the list of 55 companies Biden mentioned — ever do so. That's because the minimum tax, on the 'book income' companies report to investors, only applies to companies with at least $1 billion in average annual income. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, only 14 of the companies on that 2021 list of 55 non-payers reported having US pre-tax income of at least $1 billion.\nFacts First: Biden's 'not anymore' claim is false — the same exaggeration he delivered in his State of the Union address in March .

According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, only 14 of the companies on that 2021 list of 55 non-payers reported having US pre-tax income of at least $1 billion. In other words, there will clearly still be some big and profitable corporations paying no federal income tax despite the existence of the new Biden tax. The exact number is not known.\nMatthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told CNN in 2022 that the new tax is 'an important step forward from the status quo' and that it would raise substantial revenue, but he also said: 'I wouldn't want to assert that the minimum tax will end the phenomenon of zero-tax profitable corporations. A more accurate phrasing would be to say that the minimum tax will *help* ensure that *the most profitable* corporations pay at least some federal income tax.'\nThere are lots of nuances to the tax; you can read more specifics here. Asked for comment in early 2023, when Biden made a similar claim, a White House official told CNN: 'The Inflation Reduction Act ensures the wealthiest corporations pay a 15% minimum tax, precisely the corporations the President focused on during the campaign and in office.'\nBiden delivered another version of a claim he has regularly made about billionaires' tax rates. He said in the same Tuesday speech in Scranton: 'Do you know what the average federal tax rate for a billionaire is today in America? For real: 8.3%.' After some people in the audience laughed, Biden continued, 'That's how much federal ta- — no, I'm serious. Not a joke. Far less than the vast majority of Americans pay in federal taxes. No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a nurse, a sanitation worker.'\nFacts First : Biden's '8.3%' claim is misleading in the absence of any explanation of what this figure is. As in previous speeches , including the State of the Union address in March , Biden didn't explain that the figure is the product of an alternative calculation, from economists in his own administration, that factors in unrealized capital gains that are not treated as taxable income under federal law. In other words, while Biden made it sound like he was talking about a federal tax rate, he was actually citing a figure that is not based on the way the US tax system actually works at present.\nFacts First: Biden's '8.3%' claim is misleading in the absence of any explanation of what this figure is.

In other words, while Biden made it sound like he was talking about a federal tax rate, he was actually citing a figure that is not based on the way the US tax system actually works at present. There's nothing inherently wrong with the alternative calculation itself; the administration economists who came up with it explained it in detail on the White House website in 2021. (They said the figure was 8.2%.) Biden, however, has tended to cite the figure without any context about what it is and isn't, leaving open the impression that he was talking about what these billionaire families pay under current law.\nSo what do billionaires actually pay under current law? The answer is not publicly known, but experts say it's clearly more than 8%.\n'Biden's numbers are way too low,' Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute think tank, told CNN in 2023. Gleckman said that in 2019, University of California, Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman 'estimated the top 400 households paid an average effective tax rate of about 23 percent in 2018. They got a lot of attention at the time because that rate was lower than the average rate of 24 percent for the bottom half of the income distribution. But it still was way more than 2 or 3,' numbers Biden has used in some previous speeches, 'or even 8 percent.'\nIn February 2024, Gleckman provided additional calculations from the Tax Policy Center. The center found that the top 0.1% of households paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 30.3% in 2020, including an average income tax rate of 24.3%.\nDuring the same Tuesday speech in Scranton, Biden repeated a familiar boast about his supposed impact on the federal budget deficit. He said, 'A lot more to do, but guess what? During the whole time, I've been able to cut the federal deficit at the same exact time by over $1 trillion — $1 trillion.'\nFacts First : Biden's claim leaves out such critical context that it is misleading. While the annual federal budget deficit was more than $1 trillion lower in the 2023 fiscal year than it was in both the 2020 fiscal year (under President Donald Trump) and the 2021 fiscal year (partially under Trump and partially under Biden), analysts have repeatedly noted that Biden's own actions, including laws he has signed and executive orders he has issued, have had the overall effect of worsening annual deficits, not reducing them. As in past remarks , Biden didn't explain that the primary reason the deficit fell by a record amount during his tenure was that it had skyrocketed to a record high at the end of Trump's term because of bipartisan emergency pandemic relief spending, then fell as expected when that spending expired as planned.\nFacts First: Biden's claim leaves out such critical context that it is misleading.

'The deficit is a trillion dollars lower, roughly, than when President Biden took office. That's true. But that's driven not because he ‘reduced' the deficit by a trillion dollars, but because when he took office it was the middle of Covid and we had been temporarily injecting huge sums of money into the economy,' Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group that promotes deficit reduction and tracks the issue, said in a February interview.\nBiden can fairly say that his policies have contributed to a strong economic recovery that has boosted tax revenues and thus eaten into deficits. On the whole, though, Goldwein said deficits under Biden have been 'higher than they otherwise would have been because of legislation President Biden has signed into law and executive actions he's taken.'\nBiden made the same claim during his State of the Union address in March. You can read a more detailed fact check here.\nBiden claimed in another Tuesday speech in Scranton: 'I was in, I think, 36, 38 times in Iraq and Afghanistan as a senator and as a vice president.'\nFacts First : These figures are false, according to statistics previously released by Biden's own 2020 presidential campaign. The campaign said in 2019 that Biden had visited Iraq and Afghanistan on a total of 21 occasions, the Washington Post reported at the time .\nFacts First: These figures are false, according to statistics previously released by Biden's own 2020 presidential campaign. The campaign said in 2019 that Biden had visited Iraq and Afghanistan on a total of 21 occasions, the Washington Post reported at the time . Biden has delivered similar falsehoods about his travel to Iraq and Afghanistan on various previous occasions — including in the 2019 remarks that prompted his campaign to correct the record — and they have been previously fact-checked by media outlets including CNN.\nIn Scranton, where Biden was born, he visited a memorial that honors local residents who died in World War II, including his late uncle Ambrose Finnegan. Before Biden left the city on Wednesday, he told a dramatic story about Finnegan: 'He got shot down in an area where there were a lot of cannibals in New Guinea at the time. They never recovered his body.' He blamed cannibalism even more directly in his Pittsburgh speech later in the day, claiming Finnegan 'got shot down in New Guinea, and they never found the body because there used to be — there were a lot of cannibals, for real, in that part of New Guinea.'\nFacts First : Biden's claim differs from the account provided by the Defense Department, as CNN's Donald Judd reported Wednesday. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency's page on Finnegan says this about the 1944 incident: 'For unknown reasons, this plane was forced to ditch in the ocean off the north coast of New Guinea. Both engines failed at low altitude, and the aircraft's nose hit the water hard. Three men failed to emerge from the sinking wreck and were lost in the crash.' This official account, which notes that an additional crew member survived the crash, makes no mention of the plane being shot down or of possible cannibalism; while Biden said the crash happened 'in' New Guinea, where there was indeed some cannibalism at the time, the official account notes the men went down in the nearby ocean.\nFacts First : Biden's claim differs from the account provided by the Defense Department, as CNN's Donald Judd reported Wednesday.

'President Biden is proud of his uncle's service in uniform, who lost his life when the military aircraft he was on crashed in the Pacific after taking off near New Guinea,' deputy press secretary Andrew Bates told CNN on Wednesday.\n- CNN's Donald Judd contributed to this item.\n- CNN's Donald Judd contributed to this item.",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — North Korean illustrators and graphic designers appear to have helped produce work for US animation studios unbeknownst to those companies, suggesting that unreleased episodes of a few popular American cartoons could include work from one of the most closed-off economies in the world.\nThe revelation comes from a trove of documents recently discovered by US researchers inside a computer server housed in North Korea. It's unclear how the files ended up in this tightly controlled portion of the internet, but the researchers who analyzed them told CNN they appear to be the result of work that was unknowingly outsourced to North Korean workers.\nThe US has imposed strict sanctions prohibiting American companies from doing business with the nuclear-armed regime.\nIn addition to drawings for an upcoming season of the Amazon Prime Video show 'Invincible,' the files also contain sketches and videos that resemble work for 'Iyanu: Child of Wonder,' a superhero series slated to air on Max, the streaming service that, along with CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.\nshow 'Invincible,' the files also contain sketches and videos that resemble work for 'Iyanu: Child of Wonder,' a superhero series slated to air on Max, the streaming service that, along with CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery. There is no evidence that the studios had any knowledge their proprietary work was on a North Korean server.\nThe files were discovered in December by Nick Roy, a Boston-based cyber-sleuth who regularly scans the North Korean internet as a hobby. Roy found a new North Korean website that outside visitors didn't need a password to access, unlocking a trove of animation sketches, and shared them with the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank.\nThe documents include a series of Chinese instructions that have been translated into Korean. They call for making adjustments to the size and style of the animation. Among the documents, there is also an editing sheet written in English with specifications for animation work with 'Invincible' printed atop.\nThe discovery raises questions about the ability of US tech and creative arts companies to control their supply chains and avoid work that could inadvertently violate sanctions banning countries from doing business with North Korea.\nThey also offer a rare window into how graphic designers operate in one of the world's most closed countries. A 2022 public advisory warning from the FBI and departments of State and Treasury mentions animation as one of many sectors where North Korean IT workers ply their trade. US officials are particularly concerned that North Korean workers are posing as other nationalities to get hired at US companies.\nLogs from the North Korean computer server showed multiple visits from internet connections in northeast China, the US cybersecurity firm Mandiant told CNN. Both Roy and Michael Barnhart, a North Korea specialist at Mandiant, told CNN that those log files suggest workers in China may have been passing along instructions to their North Korean counterparts on the animation projects.\nOther computers from within North Korea also appear to have been connecting to the computer server, Roy said, suggesting there were people accessing the animation files not only in China but also in North Korea.\nIn a statement to CNN, California-based Skybound Entertainment, which produces 'Invincible' for Amazon, said it does not contract with Chinese or North Korean companies and has no knowledge of such companies working on 'Invincible.' Skybound Entertainment said it would investigate the research that CNN presented.\n'Our contracts specifically prohibit outsourcing to any third-party without our express prior written consent, and no such consent has been sought nor granted,' Skybound Entertainment spokesperson Hannah Cosgrove said. Skybound Entertainment is 'taking this matter very seriously' and has 'started an investigation to get to the bottom of this with third party counsel,' Cosgrove added.\nMax declined to comment. Maryland-based YouNeek Studios, which co-created the 'Iyanu' graphic novel series that the animated show is based on, did not respond to requests for comment. US-based Lion Forge Entertainment, which is producing the 'Iyanu' animated show, declined to comment.\nA source familiar with the matter told CNN that Lion Forge Entertainment contracted with a South Korea-based animation studio for the work. But late last year, the source said, Lion Forge discovered that the South Korean studio had further outsourced animation work for Iyanu to other South Korean companies without authorization. Lion Forge severed ties with the South Korean animation studio in January, the source said.\nThe South Korean studio told Lion Forge that it had outsourced the work only to South Korean companies, not any entity in North Korea, the source added.\nAfter discovering the files, Roy shared them with his friend Martyn Williams, a North Korea expert and senior fellow at the Stimson Center, which analyzed the files. Williams and his colleagues concluded that they looked like part of a work order.\n'It looks very much like this is all working-level editing files for these animations,' Williams said.\n'The North Koreans have a lot of software companies set up in China that act as kind of fronts and will send information, send work back to Pyongyang, where the work is done,' Williams told CNN.\nThe think tank found no evidence to suggest the American companies were aware of the activity, he added. Because the editing comments on the files were written in Chinese, 'it is likely that the contracting arrangement was several steps downstream from the major producers,' the Stimson Center says in a report to be published Monday.\nThe North Korean regime has long been enamored with movie studios and animation as a vehicle for propaganda and a source of revenue, according to experts. North Korea was more advanced in animation than South Korea for several years after the Korean Peninsula was split following World War II.\nNorth Korea's main animation studio is Pyongyang-based SEK Studio, which was founded in the 1950s and has contracted with a range of foreign companies over the years. The US Treasury Department sanctioned SEK Studio in 2021 for being connected to the North Korean regime.\n'Seemingly fueled by the desire for unreasonably low-cost labor, foreign media companies continue to subcontract animation work to SEK Studio,' the Treasury Department said in a statement announcing the sanctions. The studio uses 'animation workers' in North Korea and China, the department said.\nWilliams suspects SEK Studio may be involved in the animation work discovered on the computer server because SEK is the only entity in North Korea capable of handling this kind of volume.\nBattered by sanctions and strapped for cash, the North Korean regime has turned to thousands of IT workers living abroad to bring in hard currency, according to US officials and private experts.\nSince the 2022 advisory, FBI agents and State and Treasury officials have been quietly trying to raise awareness of the North Korean insider threat by conducting briefings for business executives and chasing down leads about potential North Korean IT workers at US companies.\nBarnhart, the Mandiant researcher, said any company that hires a North Korean IT worker runs the risk of being targeted by North Korean hackers because of the close relationship between the two.\n'There are a lot more overlaps that we're beginning to see with these IT workers and [North Korean hackers],' Barnhart told CNN.\nA previous CNN investigation found that the founder of a California-based cryptocurrency startup had unwittingly paid tens of thousands of dollars to a North Korean engineer. The entrepreneur was unaware of the situation until the FBI notified him, he said.\nAs for the recently discovered North Korean server, Mandiant made a report of its findings — that the server appeared to be hosting content from US animation studios — available to government agencies, including the FBI, Barnhart said.\nThe FBI declined to comment.\nCNN has requested comment from North Korea's observer mission to the United Nations in New York and the North Korean Embassy in London.\nA Treasury Department spokesperson told CNN the department does not comment on potential or hypothetical sanctions violations.\n'Treasury remains concerned about North Korean efforts to generate revenue for their weapons programs, including through cybercrime and the abuse of contractors, and urges industry to be vigilant against any attempts to evade sanctions,' the spokesperson said in a statement.\nRoy, the independent researcher, has been scanning North Korean internet infrastructure for nearly a decade from his studio in Boston and elsewhere. He does it, he says, to help close the 'gap in information' that outsiders have about the East Asian country.\nThe North Korean internet has just over 1,000 IP addresses, the unique identifiers that allow a computer to connect to the public internet, according to Roy. The US has over 1.5 billion IP addresses.\nThe sketches reviewed by CNN wouldn't look out of place at a big animation studio anywhere in the world. There are superheroes with sharp jaw lines and muscular features, and cape-wearing anime-style figures with tousled hair and darting eyes.\nHeinz Insu Fenkl, an expert in North Korean comics, said that animation and comics have been prominent in North Korean society since the country's founding in 1948.\nToday, North Korean comics are sold in street markets in northeast China and bring in precious revenue for the regime, he added.\n'Because North Korea does so much of the groundwork of animation, they have the technology,' Fenkl said. 'They spend a lot of energy and money keeping their technology updated in those areas.'\nBut recent advancements in animation in North Korea have also come in part by simply ripping off Western production companies, according to Fenkl.\n'That's why you can probably see things like production sketches while an animation project is going on because there may well be [someone] who is not known to be a North Korean working at that studio,' he told CNN.\nCNN's Alex Marquardt and Mike Conte contributed to this report.",

Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie railed on House Speaker Mike Johnson and his handling of the foreign aid bills, despite deciding not to move to oust the speaker Saturday. Greene argued that more House Republicans will support their effort after going home over recess and speaking with their constituents. 'I'm actually gonna let my colleagues go home and hear from their constituents, because I think people have been too obsessed with voting for foreign wars and the murder industry here in America to actually understand how angry Americans are,' the Georgia Republican told CNN. Massie, a Kentucky Republican, added that they are giving Johnson the chance to resign, although the speaker has insisted he won't. Massie added he believes a motion to vacate — a rarely used procedural tool to remove the House speaker — will happen eventually. 'I'm pretty sure one will come to the floor, if he doesn't resign at some point, but we're trying to avoid that,' he said. Greene insisted their effort to oust Johnson is gaining momentum, adding that the speaker is \"a lame duck.\" Rep. Paul Gosar Friday signed on to the effort Friday, becoming the third member to do so. 'If we had the vote today in our conference, he would not be speaker today. He's already a lame duck, he can't raise money, everyone knows it,' Greene claimed. 3 hr 22 min ago From CNN's Morgan Rimmer House Speaker Mike Johnson talks to the press after the House passed four foreign aid bills at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on Saturday. Drew Angerer/AFP/Getty Images Several swing-district House Republicans praised Speaker Mike Johnson for pushing forward with the foreign aid bills and attacked his detractors. Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro, a vulnerable New York freshman lawmaker, told CNN's Manu Raju that after speaking with his constituents, 'It is clear to me that there are moments in time where we must do the right thing, and today we did that.' He defended Johnson for waiting for months to hold votes on aid for critical allies Israel and Ukraine, saying the speaker had to build bipartisan consensus in \"a very complicated Congress.\" Molinaro said he hoped Johnson's detractors do not attempt to oust him, warning them that Congress is not 'only supposed to do what they want.' Rep. Jen Kiggans, a vulnerable Republican from Virginia, also praised the speaker. 'I'm very proud of Mike Johnson. I know what he did today was difficult, but there was a lot of us standing by him, and you saw great bipartisan effort today. And that's what Americans want to see,' she said.

Michelle Shen/CNN As members of Congress streamed out of the Capitol after passing an aid bill to Israel, a crowd of protesters with loudspeakers shouted, \"Congress, Congress you can't hide, we charge you with genocide!\" The bill also includes aid to Gaza, but the protesters represent the divisive nature of providing support to Israel amid the humanitarian disaster in Gaza. Marione Ingram protests outside the Capitol. Michelle Shen/CNN Marione Ingram, 88, and her husband, Daniel Ingram, 93, were among the protesters. Marione is a survivor of the Holocaust and large-scale bombing operations in Germany during World War II. \"I am now reliving my childhood every time I see anything that's happening in Gaza. And for the last over six months, my husband and I and a few others have been at the White House every single day in the afternoon trying to get our government to stop fighting,\" she said. Pro-Palestinian protesters have been resorting to ever-louder tactics – such as shutting down the Golden Gate Bridge during Monday's morning commute – as they try to shake US support for Israel and draw attention to the crisis in Gaza, where more than 34,000 people have died since the war began, according to the Ministry of Health there. 4 hr ago From CNN's Lauren Fox and Alison Main A number of lawmakers who backed the aid packages today said their views on House Speaker Mike Johnson as a leader changed after the speaker put bills on the floor despite a threat against his job. House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, said he thinks it was a transformative moment for Johnson as a leader, adding that the speaker's stock in the conference has gone up even as he faces the threat of an ouster from a minority of members. 'I have tremendous respect. ... He had a learning curve, but at the end of the day, he knew what the right thing to do was,' McCaul said. Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois was blunt when asked whether he had a new respect and view of the speaker than he did two weeks ago. 'I guess I do. The old adage is it's never too late to do the right thing. We tested that,' Quigley said. 'I think we build on this. ... We have a lot of challenges. It's good news that today at a critical time, we did act cohesively as a legislature.' GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said he always thought Johnson would get there but a turning point came when the speaker was briefed that passing Ukraine aid by April was essential. 'He's always said he was for Ukraine, and I've always believed him,' Bacon said. 'I think he just came to the conclusion we couldn't wait any longer. He was briefed that we had to get this done in April or bad things were going to happen to Ukraine.\" 3 hr 31 min ago From CNN's Kit Maher House Speaker Mike Johnson talks to the press after the House passed four foreign aid bills at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on Saturday. Drew Angerer/AFP/Getty Images Moments after the House passed four foreign aid bills totaling $95 billion, Speaker Mike Johnson said he had not spoken to Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries about potentially saving his job if his hardline colleagues move to oust him. 'I don't walk around this building being worried about a motion to vacate,' Johnson said, referring to a procedural tool to remove the House speaker. 'I have to do my job. ... I've done here what I believe to be the right thing to allow the House to work its will. And as I've said, you do the right thing, and you let the chips fall where they may.' Walking toward his office, Johnson told reporters that he believes he will still be speaker in November and that he hasn't spoken to any of his detractors Saturday. Johnson said the 'world is destabilized' and 'a tinderbox,' stressing the importance of the bills' passage in a 'dangerous time.' 'Three of our primary adversaries, Russia, and Iran, and China, are working together and they're being aggressors around the globe,' Johnson said. 'They're a global threat to our prosperity and our security. Their advance threatens the free world, and it demands American leadership. We turn our backs right now, the consequences could be devastating.' 4 hr 20 min ago From CNN's Priscilla Alvarez The White House on Saturday clinched urgent foreign aid after a monthslong saga that involved starts and stops in Congress and was momentarily upended by one of the most politically vulnerable issues for President Joe Biden: border security. The ask for additional aid to Ukraine, among other priorities, dates to October, when the White House put forward its national security supplemental funding request. Over the last several months, Biden has framed the need to provide additional funds to the war-torn country as a national security priority, warning that no ground should be ceded to Russia. More recently, US officials attributed losses on the battlefield in Ukraine to the lack of additional assistance from the United States. In February, for example, the White House laid the blame for Ukraine's withdrawal from the key town of Avdiivka squarely at the feet of Republicans in Congress. Funding for Ukraine was also a recurring topic of discussion between Biden and global leaders as the US sought to reaffirm its leadership on the world stage — a theme echoed in the president's statement Saturday. 'Today, members of both parties in the House voted to advance our national security interests and send a clear message about the power of American leadership on the world stage. At this critical inflection point, they came together to answer history's call, passing urgently-needed national security legislation that I have fought for months to secure,' Biden said. 4 hr 31 min ago TikTok criticized the House's passage of a bill that could ban the app in the US. \"It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement Saturday. 4 hr 39 min ago From CNN's Samantha Waldenberg President Joe Biden speaks at a campaign event in Philadelphia on Thursday.

'I urge the Senate to quickly send this package to my desk so that I can sign it into law and we can quickly send weapons and equipment to Ukraine to meet their urgent battlefield needs,' he added.\nThe House has passed a $95 billion package providing foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific region.\nA fourth bill in the package addressed other House GOP priorities, including sanctions on Iran and a measure that could lead to a TikTok ban.

Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie railed on House Speaker Mike Johnson and his handling of the foreign aid bills, despite deciding not to move to oust the speaker Saturday.\nGreene argued that more House Republicans will support their effort after going home over recess and speaking with their constituents.\n'I'm actually gonna let my colleagues go home and hear from their constituents, because I think people have been too obsessed with voting for foreign wars and the murder industry here in America to actually understand how angry Americans are,' the Georgia Republican told CNN. Massie, a Kentucky Republican, added that they are giving Johnson the chance to resign, although the speaker has insisted he won't. Massie added he believes a motion to vacate — a rarely used procedural tool to remove the House speaker — will happen eventually.\n'I'm pretty sure one will come to the floor, if he doesn't resign at some point, but we're trying to avoid that,' he said.\nGreene insisted their effort to oust Johnson is gaining momentum, adding that the speaker is \"a lame duck.\" Rep. Paul Gosar Friday signed on to the effort Friday, becoming the third member to do so.\n'If we had the vote today in our conference, he would not be speaker today.

Marc Molinaro, a vulnerable New York freshman lawmaker, told CNN's Manu Raju that after speaking with his constituents, 'It is clear to me that there are moments in time where we must do the right thing, and today we did that.'\nHe defended Johnson for waiting for months to hold votes on aid for critical allies Israel and Ukraine, saying the speaker had to build bipartisan consensus in \"a very complicated Congress.\" Molinaro said he hoped Johnson's detractors do not attempt to oust him, warning them that Congress is not 'only supposed to do what they want.'\nRep. Jen Kiggans, a vulnerable Republican from Virginia, also praised the speaker.\n'I'm very proud of Mike Johnson.

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — Under the searing New Delhi sun, more than a dozen of India's top opposition leaders joined hands in a rare show of unity imploring voters to 'save democracy.'\nStanding before thousands of supporters at the city's historic and politically important Ramlila Maidan, the March 31 rally marked the opposition's strongest attempt yet to sway voters against electing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third straight term.\nThe consequence of continued Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rule, they say, would be the erosion of the very foundation upon which modern India was built: democracy.\n'This election is for saving democracy and we must fight united,' main opposition party Indian National Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge told the crowds, who were waving the party flag of orange, white and green. 'There is no level playing field in this election.'\nRelated article What to know about the world's biggest election\nRelated article What to know about the world's biggest election It echoed a similar rally more than 40 years earlier on the same spot, when opposition leaders fired up huge crowds to help change the course of the 1977 election – ending the 10-year rule of India's powerful third prime minister and political scion Indira Gandhi.\nGandhi had imposed a state of emergency, jailed key opposition leaders and curtailed civil freedoms. To some, India's future was perched on a needle point between autocracy and democracy. She lost the election and, in the eyes of many, India's democracy was saved.\nTo many supporters in the crowd three weeks ago, India is now at a similar crossroads with this high-stakes election deciding which path the country follows.\n'Our democracy is being murdered, India is becoming a dictatorship,' Hazari Lal Rajput, a resident from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, told CNN at the Ramlila Maidan.\nUnless there is a major upset, Modi's BJP is set to win its third straight five-year term thanks to his potent, populist mix of economic empowerment and Hindu nationalism.\nAccording to 2023 Pew research, about eight in 10 Indian adults have a favorable view of Modi, including 55% who have a very favorable view. Such levels of popularity for a two-term incumbent prime minister defy all modern conventions, both in India and throughout much of the democratic world.\nBut India's opposition leaders accuse Modi's right-wing government of becoming an electoral autocracy by attempting to rig the vote, weaponizing state agencies to stifle, attack and arrest opposition politicians, and undermining democratic principles ahead of elections, which began on April 19 and run until June 1, with results counted on June 4.\nThey also warn Modi's brand of Hindu nationalism is uncorking dangerous religious divides in a country with a long and tragic history of sectarian bloodletting.\nModi and the BJP have denied political interference, with one senior party leader saying it was a 'process of law' to take 'appropriate action against corruption.'\nTo counter the BJP, the opposition has formed a 27-member bloc — the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, or INDIA.\nBut so far that alliance has proved lackluster, observers say. It has been beset by ideological differences, has seen a host of defections to the BJP and, even with the election in full swing, has yet to even name a prime ministerial candidate.\n'What kind of a democracy can you have if you don't have a vibrant opposition, a robust opposition that can question the government?' asks Arati Jerath, an independent political commentator and journalist.\n'That's why it's not really a question of whether Modi wins or not, it's a question of keeping the opposition alive to fight another day so that democracy in India survives.'\nAmong those leading the charge for the opposition alliance is Rahul Gandhi, longtime face of the Congress and the latest member of his family to bid for power.\nHe is the son of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. His grandmother Indira was India's first female leader, and his great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the country's founding prime minister.\n'If the BJP wins these fixed elections and changes the constitution, the country will be on fire. Remember this,' Rahul Gandhi told the crowd in Delhi last month.\nThe BJP and its allies are gunning for a supermajority of more than two-thirds of the seats in India's parliament, the Lok Sabha. A rising fear among critics is that this would give the BJP the power to change India's constitution, which is rooted in the democratic principles of justice, liberty, equality and – crucially – secularism.\nThe BJP has repeatedly denied it has plans to change the constitution.\n'When I say that I have big plans, no one should be scared. I don't take decisions to scare or run over anyone, I take decisions for the wholesome development of the nation,' Modi said in an interview with Indian news agency ANI earlier this week.\nBut the party has already begun publicly pulling India's government away from its secular foundation and leading BJP figures have openly advocated for the country to be declared a Hindu nation.\n'There shouldn't be politics on the basis of religion in any country, they should talk about real issues. Until people's financial situation improves, there won't be any social reform,' said voter Mohammad Irfan at the opposition rally in Delhi.\nOpposition parties have found themselves facing a slew of legal and financial challenges in the run-up to this year's election.\nGandhi's Congress – the largest party in the INDIA alliance — has accused the BJP of 'tax terrorism' and crippling its ability to campaign after its accounts were frozen by the tax department, leaving it unable to use some $20 million in funds. It has also been landed with a $218 million tax bill.\nThen came the arrest of Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi chief minister and head of the popular Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).\nKejriwal's detention on graft allegations came after the announcement of the general election last month, sparking protests in the capital. Analysts say it's the first time in post-independence history that an Indian chief minister has governed from behind bars.\nKejriwal has denied the allegations, claiming they are politically motivated. He is just one of several prominent members of the opposition, including three other senior AAP leaders, that have also been arrested or investigated by state agencies in moves decried as political by their parties.\n'I think there are very serious concerns about how free and fair the elections are going to be in India this time around,' said Atishi, Delhi minister of education for the AAP, who goes by one name.\nReports have emerged of opposition party members being coerced into joining the BJP with the threat of arrest, while they were under investigation by state agencies. Other reports suggest politicians have had their probes dropped after switching sides.\nAtishi said she was also approached to switch to the BJP. 'Either you join the ruling party, and then the cases are closed or put into cold storage or if you don't, like the Aam Aadmi Party leaders, then the cases go ahead and you're arrested and put into jail,' she said, without specifically naming who approached her.\nCNN cannot independently confirm the incidents and has reached out to the BJP for comment.\nIn his interview with ANI, Modi denied any sliding of democracy under his rule and emphasized the independence of the Election Commission and state agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate, saying political leaders make up just 3% of cases.\n'Shouldn't we let the ED work independently when it is supposed to do so?' he said. 'I am convinced that corruption has destroyed the country. We should fight against corruption with our full strength.'\nAnalyst Jerath said a BJP-led campaign to weaken the opposition was part of Modi's 'scorched earth policy.'\n'Just wipe out whatever comes in your way so that this juggernaut can move on without any kind of challenge, without any obstruction,' she said.\nModi is enduringly popular, analysts say, appealing to both the poor and the affluent, especially among much of the roughly 80% of India's population who are Hindu.\nDuring his 10 years in power, he has launched a raft of welfare policies including free food handouts, housing, cheap gas cylinders for women and infrastructure projects.\nIndia is also the world's fastest-growing major economy and Modi's presence on the world stage — including hosting the G20 — has cemented the country as a modern global power, along with a history-making moon landing.\nAuthor Christophe Jaffrelot told CNN Modi makes people feel 'proud again of being Indian.'\n'There is a sense in India, a constant sense, of vulnerability, a lack of self-esteem. So to be recognized as a great power in spite of everything, (that) is attributed to him,' he said.\nThat does not mean there aren't key issues the opposition could rally around, analysts say, including the BJP's failure to increase education opportunities or improve health infrastructure – especially following the coronavirus pandemic, which hit India especially hard.\nYouth unemployment also remains a huge problem, close to 50% among 20-to-24-year-olds.\nBut the INDIA alliance has failed to capitalize on these weak spots, Jerath said.\n'They haven't been able to weave together a cohesive kind of campaign, come up with a catchy slogan that will fire the imagination of the voting public,' she said.\nCongress leader Gandhi is one of the few opposition figures considered to have the kind of star power and name recognition to stand against Modi.\nBut though he may have the name, Gandhi lacks leadership skills, some analysts say.\nRasheed Kidwai, journalist and author of '24 Akbar Road,' a history of the Congress party, said it's a winner-takes-all election and there is 'no silver medal in politics.'\n'The problem with INDIA alliance is there is nobody who has that kind of hunger, who has that kind of personal(ity), who has that kind of inner sense of belonging or ownership to go in this election. Rahul is doing it but is not a contender,' he said.\nGandhi recently completed a 6,713-kilometer (4,200-mile) walk across the country, starting in the violence-hit northeastern state of Manipur, to raise issues of poverty, unemployment, diversity and democracy with voters.\nDespite these efforts, the BJP has dominated the campaign narrative.\nA key gauge of opposition strength will be in those parts of India where the BJP has historically failed to make inroads.\nRegional opposition heavyweights, such as the West Bengal chief minister and All India Trinamool Congress head Mamata Banerjee and the south's Tamil Nadu chief minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin, will be vying to block a BJP takeover in their respective states.\nBut the only other major national party is the Congress, which has been the main opposition since 2014.\nCongress governed the country for much of the 77 years since independence, and while it was once a powerful political force with its legacy rooted in the formation of modern India, it now finds itself in the doldrums, dogged by infighting and accusations of corruption within the party.\n'In the Congress, the best and brightest are not fighting the election,' Kidwai said.\nAnalysts say that during a decade in opposition, Congress has failed to rebuild its organization and political machinery to effectively take on the BJP.\nThe Congress organization has 'decayed and almost died over the years, particularly in north India, and particularly in Uttar Pradesh, which is the largest, most populous state,' Jerath said.\n'There was a time after independence, and for many years after independence, that they used to say that you would find a Congress flag in every single village in India,' she said. 'That's no longer true.'\nStill, there is optimism from some.\nThe AAP's Atishi said that despite repeated attacks against her party, it has been able to defeat the BJP in Delhi again and again.\n'Democracy becoming an autocracy … That is what we are fighting against,' she said. 'I think that the people of India have always voted very sensibly, and we hope that they do so this time.'",

You know, it's not lost upon me that as we've spent an entire season talking about weight, that can bring up some pretty complicated feelings about food overall. Not just what we eat, but how we eat and how much we enjoy it. For our guest today, a lot of those sorts of feelings started pretty early in life. I had this babysitter who was a chronic dieter, and at that time I had no idea what a diet was. I had no idea why somebody would want a diet. She would eat this colorless, aromaless food. And she was sad all the time. That's Dr. Linda Shiue. She's an internal medicine physician who's done a lot of thinking about food. And in addition to being a big foodie, she's also a chef. She went to cooking school. She worked at a Michelin star restaurant. She even wrote a cookbook called Spicebox Kitchen. Now, part of the reason I wanted to talk to her is back in 2016, she became the very first director of culinary medicine at Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco. She runs a teaching kitchen there. So this is a doctor who is teaching her patients how to cook. Part of the reason she does this is because it's easy to sing the praises of healthy food. But Doctor Shiue has found that people often feel like they have to give up a lot if they start eating healthy. They think it's deprivation and, you know, loss of joy and kind of penance even. It's colorless, it's bland, it has no texture. It has no flavor, and we're not supposed to enjoy it. And look, I get that. I can relate to that. Sometimes eating healthy, frankly, means eating boring. And for most people, if something tastes healthy, they don't usually expect it to also taste good. And the opposite is true. People associate unhealthy foods with being the most tasty. So yes, our relationship with food can be tricky. It's why people talk about cheat days, why they talk about restricting foods they love, or being bad when they let themselves have a cookie. But here's what we're going to talk about today. Food is so much more than just fuel. People really need to think about that. It can be a connection to culture and expression of care. It can be a way to celebrate with others. And food can also be a source of joy. So today we're going to dive headfirst into food. How to eat better, yes, but also how to eat more joyfully while overcoming a lot of our hang ups around it. What is that balance between eating for pleasure and eating for energy? I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, and this is Chasing Life. One of the reasons I really wanted to talk to you was because you were the first director of culinary medicine at Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco. You're a chef. Obviously you're a doctor. I just find that to be a really interesting confluence. How did that all sort of come about for you? I just love eating. I mean, I like to say I was born with a tasting spoon in my mouth. You know, I, I always loved food. I took my first cooking class when I was seven, and I've always been really interested in other people's food. But what really happened was, after my first decade of practicing as a primary care doctor, I, like many other primary care doctors, was kind of burning out, and I kind of felt like I was just writing prescriptions that wasn't enough for me and for my patients. I felt like I wasn't doing enough for them. They may or may not have been feeling better, but their numbers look better, right? Their blood pressure look better. But maybe they didn't feel better. And so I kind of felt like, what am I doing? And can I do this for the rest of my life? I think there's, what I think is a misperception a lot of times that very tasty foods are going to be, by definition, not healthy, right? Oh well, that looks fantastic. But I don't think that my waistline can tolerate it or whatever is not good for my health. What do you say about that? I think there's room for any food that you like, pretty much. Right. It's like depending on the quantity, the frequency. I don't think we should demonize any food except for, you know, ultra processed foods. I may say, let's really try to avoid those as much as possible, but I still wouldn't say that you can never have them. I cannot tell you with any honesty that my kids do not like, you know, Cheetos. Flaming Hot Cheetos. I don't buy them. However, you know, we're human, right? So we all have things that we like. So it's about, you know, the frequency, quantity, etc. but food has to be a flavor first. None of us will eat food that is good for us from a health sense. If we don't want it like it has to taste good to us, to the person eating it. And I think there's great skill in making food that is, you know, nutritionally better for us, tastes fantastic so that you're not even thinking about it as being health food. And that's one of the reasons why Doctor Shiue went to cooking school. I wanted to learn a couple of things. One is all the techniques, right? If I was going to teach people professionally, I want to make sure I was teaching them the right way. And two, I wanted to learn how to flavor. So how do we seasoned food? Seasoned not just meaning how much salt we add, but how do I use spices and herbs in the right way? What cooking techniques bring out the best flavor in things that are better for us, namely vegetables? Because I truly think that people who don't enjoy vegetables just don't know how to prepare them properly. I would not cut the idea short that healthy diet, I think, is actually the most important thing. I think it actually supersedes physical activity. When I've traveled around the world and seen some of the healthiest societies around the world, they are active, but they're often not intensely active. But what is the most different, I think, is their is their diet as a general rule. People have said to me that the vast majority of our chronic disease in the United States revolves around diet and one shape or another, the food that we eat, the quantity that we eat, whatever it may be. And if you if you think about it, we're a $4 trillion spending health economy in this country. And let's say even half of it is due to diet. I mean, it's it's remarkable. The fact that we need to eat better as a country and that it can be still tasty and something that people enjoy, I think is a reality. What do you think is the perception of a healthy diet? They think it's deprivation and, you know, loss of joy and kind of penance even. And so I think that remains a perception for a lot of people. That that is what health food is. It's colorless, it's bland, it has no texture. It has no flavor. And we're not supposed to enjoy it. That actually, you know, this outdated perception that if you are overweight, that it's because you have overindulged. And I really like to counter that with food is meant to be enjoyed nutrition and sustenance. That's only one small part of food. Food is for me, is mainly pleasure. It's a connection to myself, to my loved ones, to my culture. A lot of people were taught that, you know, quote unquote, cultural food, whatever that means. We all have a culture is not healthy. People are told, oh, no, no, the food that you eat, that's why you have diabetes. You have to eat this kind of standard healthy American diet. And then, you know, people being polite may not say, I'm not going to do that. That doesn't resonate with me. Or like, I don't know what that is. They'll say, okay, I'll try that. And then, you know, three months later they come back. No change. Oh, that didn't work for you. And the fact is, they never ate it because they didn't understand what it was or didn't want to eat it. Every culture has a healthy diet. We do know from studies that in general, healthy diets are going to involve fewer processed foods and more whole foods. That makes sense. Actually, the way that our food supply has become, is kind of devoid of nutrition, may have a lot of additives. We use a lot of convenience foods that are ultra processed. That is actually really the main problem. So if we go back to, you know, minimally processed foods from any culture and focus on lots of, you know, whole grains, legumes, vegetables, we can all actually eat joyfully and healthfully. You know, I never really thought of, the idea that people immediately when they think of healthy food. I got the idea that they they realize they need to eat less. But the idea that you also needed to eat more bland, that's a really interesting thing. So it became fewer calories of a very, very plain food that that's what you're saying. That's what your patients sort of came to you with. And on the other hand, humans, you know, we crave sweet, we crave salt, we want those tastes. And I think that's part of what leads us to overeat is that if you're in a society or an environment where you have plenty of options for food, you tend to seek out those foods. How do you how do you tackle this problem? I really try not to demonize anything. So personally, I have a sweet tooth. Naturally. That's that's my, you know, my weakness. If anything. 'Yeah. It's hard. So I like to ask myself, is it worth it? Like, do I want to have a bigger portion of a so-called healthier dessert? Or do I want a little bit of the real thing? I actually want a little bit of the real thing. Maybe less frequently. Right. So I want my amazing dessert. If I happen to be traveling in a place that has, like a really well-known bakery, I'm going to have that. But I'm going to eat it mindfully. So I think this is a really important tip for everybody. What that means - it doesn't have to be meaning that you have to meditate over your food. It means when you're eating your food, just focus on the pleasure of that. Eat slowly, chew your food. My dad actually has a saying chew your food 100 times. No one does that, but chew your food more than the half chew that most of us do before we swallow our food. You'll taste it better, right? Chew it. And then also pay attention to when you've had enough. Some people say that it's the first three bites where you really taste it, and after that you're just eating it. So, you know, if that means that you've had enough, then then you've had enough then. And an easy way to do that is to split your dessert. That's typically what I do. Another issue the day to day snacking. Doctor Shiue has some thoughts on that as well. People snack a lot and I think snackers are divided into salty or sweet snackers and the salty snackers typically like chips. You know, this is what people eat when they're watching TV at night, and the sweet snackers often like ice cream. So the first two recipes, which are very simple that I put in to my electronic medical record, were for the sweet snackers, banana nice cream. Have you had that before? I've not had it, but I read about it because of you. So I saw they take the frozen bananas and put them in the blender. And it's that easy and it's surprisingly good. It tastes like soft serve. You can put in spices, you can add on toppings. You know, let's say I make a healthier sundae with it with dark chocolate, put on fruit, nuts, etc.. And I always say, you know, I have to be real. It's not ice cream, it's not gonna be the same. But if you want to have this every night and then have your real ice cream once a week, this might make it better for you, right? So let's do this a little bit better for the chip eater, the salty snacker I couldn't a recipe for kale chips. And, I remember like, the skepticism of some of these early people. You know, I remember this guy. He's like, come on, I don't eat kale. Why would I do this? And I don't I don't really cook. I'm like, this is so easy and I'll tell you how to make it right now. Have you ever made kale chips yourself, Sanjay? I'm.... I'm with your other friend here probably in terms of my skepticism. Right. So again, not the same, but pretty good and really easy. So, you know, get your organic kale and I say organic for kale in particular because it keeps a lot of pesticide residue. Wash it well. Spin it dry and dry it off completely. And that tear or cut it into bite sized pieces. Toss it with a lot of olive oil, salt, pepper. And then you bake it in a slow oven like around 300 degrees for about 10 to 20 minutes. And you get these nice crispy, crunchy, salty snacks that actually are a value add. Right. So the idea with my stuff is that it has to taste good, but it should also add nutrition, right? No matter what. If you're going to be eating something, why not have it do something that's good for you? So kale, you've got all that fiber. You have calcium, magnesium, iron, vitamin K, potassium, all the things that we may not actually get enough of. It's very heart healthy. It's very diabetes friendly. Okay. I just want to say here that if you're still skeptical about whether kale chips are going to satisfy your cravings, I do hear you on this one. But Doctor Shiue says stick with it. You might be surprised. It's worth it in a long run, you know? But as adults, too, we can all change our palates. Our taste buds constantly regenerate. And so give yourself a month if you're cutting back on sugar or if you're cutting back on salt, cutting back on fat. If you're new to vegetables, just keep trying. Be patient. In a month you'll be like, oh, that thing is now too sweet for me that I used to love. Coming up after the break, why the words we use around food do matter, and also a step by step guide to reframing your approach to eating. We'll be right back. You know, being a writer like you are and someone who communicates this as well as a physician chef. I imagine that the word choices are really important to you. You made a conscious decision not to to lean into calorie counts. For example, the word diet. The word junk food, the word cheat day, things like that.... Are these. Is this language you use? Words are so important, right? You know that words are so important and that people will remember your words if you make an unfortunate word choice forever. I can't say that I have made lots of mistakes around word choices. But I try my best. And so for cheat day, I have fun when I can come up with a better term for something. I call them treat day. So I tell people, do not, you know, let's let's be positive. Let's have a positive approach to all of this. You're not going to eat perfectly. None of us eat perfectly. I don't eat perfectly. You're going to eat better. Don't have a cheat day. Have a cheat day. I think it actually really is important to have a treat day. It's like our lives are hard. We deserve to treat ourselves in whatever way that is, including in how we eat, i that is what people are into. Like, for me, I like to have my treats, but I don't have them all the time and. There is no one healthy diet that is one size fits all. What works for me may not work for you and that is really important to recognize. As a general rule though, whether it's a particular cultural diet or, you know, something that comes from your own heritage. Focusing on plants... That seems to be a pretty universal truth, as I've talked to lots of people about this, but I am curious, are there some top line things that people should think about if they're listening to this podcast and say, okay, I want to enjoy my food. I don't want to punish myself. I don't want to deprive myself. I'm not into that bland diet that that Dr. Shiue's babysitter ate when she was in kindergarten. Where do you begin? Eat home cooked food more often. Right. Because again, you know exactly what's going to it. You have control over it, and you can make it taste the way that you want to taste. So that is going to be number one, something that resonates with you and is better for you. Focus on again the plant based food, so specifically wholegrains leafy greens and legumes, beans and legumes. Focus on those things. No matter how you're eating, then quantity is important and proportions of these items are important. So make vegetables half of your plate. Whole grains and proteins ideally a leaner protein including plant based proteins one quarter each of your plate. And then getting to that plate. This goes back to my Michelin starred experience... Plate your food. Make it look good. We eat with our eyes first. You know, we talk about satiety often and like, do we feel full satiety actually is contributed to by what is our pleasure of that eating experience? If the food looks beautiful, you're going to take your time to eat it. You're going to have that joy of like eating a beautiful plate of food, even if it's leftovers. And, focus on exploring spices. You know, my cookbook Spicebox Kitchen focuses on that because one, I love spices, but they're also... they have health benefits. They're are first medicines they bring us and connect us to different cultures around the world, and they're kind of fun to play around with. You can't go wrong, and I think that's a good way for people to diversify their diets, even if they only know how to cook two things. Let's say they only know how to roast a vegetable and grill some protein. If you play around with 20 different spices, you have 20 different meals there. I think that getting back to the mindful eating part of it, really, let's try to shift from our kind of dominant culture of being productive all the time, even that that's the culture that we all live in. Focus solely on your food. Enjoy that food. Take your time and chewing it so you can savor the flavor, absorb those nutrients better, and just give that as a gift to yourself. I think those sorts of things any of us can do, and it will improve most people's eating experience and nutrition if they do that. Yeah, I think the idea of the mindless eating is, is that I'm, I'm a victim of that, or I'm somebody who falls prey to that. I guess, you know, the idea of being mindful when you eat, not being on your phone, not trying to multitask whenever I've done that. And it's funny, I will just be candid. It happens rarely for me because I feel like I'm always on the run, but when I do it, it's kind of magical, right? I really do enjoy each bite. Doctor Shiue says tuning into your body's needs can really help drive better choices, but you got to be intentional about this. She recommends following the principles of what's called intuitive eating, listening to your body's signals about whether or not you're actually hungry, or whether there might be something else you need at that moment. Are they thirsty? Are they tired? Are they upset? Is that really what they're seeking when they think they're looking for food? So one, listening and trying to just take a moment to really establish what it is that they need at that time. And then when they're making the food choice, thinking about, is this going to make me feel good right in the moment or also later? And then seeing what happens when you eat whatever you're eating, notice that, like, do I feel better now or is this dragging me down? Did I feel better for a few minutes? And now I wish I hadn't eaten that? And when it comes to noticing your feelings around food and around eating, Doctor Shiue says, try and let go of the guilt or shame. It really doesn't serve much of a purpose. Many of us have experienced shame or guilt around food, and that a lot of that is a product of our culture. And you know what the food industry has taught us, and what the fashion and whole dieting industries have created where there is an idealized image. And even though we as an individual may not even think that we care that much about that message, it's reached all of us in all of our subconscious. And so I think that most people at some point feel like, oh, I shouldn't eat that. That's bad for me. It might affect my weight. Let's get away from the weight as the reason why we maybe want you to make a different food choice. Let's focus on your health, which is not always accurately reflected by your weight, whether it's your weight gain or your inability to lose weight. But how.. what you eat, how it makes you feel, and what it does in terms of promoting the health of your body overall. I think for so many people it feels like I'm just trying to get my calories in. I know I need to eat, probably not gonna eat that healthy. I'm eating bland, whatever it might be, depriving myself. You have flipped the script on that. Enjoy your food. I mean, I think that's probably the biggest point of this podcast, is that you can enjoy your food and eat healthy at the same time. Don't demonize certain foods for being bad. And there's still room for indulgence. I really want to always acknowledge that that we should eat for pleasure, even if that means eating something which we may not categorize as being great for our health. And so I think that people have to put it all in the context. It's not what you do every second, it's the overall pattern of how you're eating. And I think if people really lean into that and pay attention to their body signals of how their body is processing certain foods and how that makes them feel, you know, right after eating and from day to day that that will help guide people, you know, kind of listen to your body. I think that will never steer you wrong. 'You know, in a world where talking about food often revolves around weight, calories, nutrition, it is refreshing to hear Doctor Shiue's perspective on all of this, that we should also focus on satisfaction and well-being, and try and let go of guilt and strict rules or labels. There's also a lot of room for the foods we love because it's not about being perfect. Instead, it's about listening to your body signals about what you need not only what's good for you, but what also makes you feel good. Because let's be honest here, food is one of life's greatest joys. I heard from a lot of you about that. My comfort food is pizza. My goodness, it just hits all the things and I don't even need toppings. Grilled cheese sandwiches with tomato soup just reminds me of childhood. Butter beans. No one ever thinks about them. Hot tea. And if something Really wretched has happened.... Then it's hot tea with sugar and lemon,. Greek avgolemono soup which has chicken broth, eggs and lemon juice. My mom passed away when I was about 20, and I realized that some of those processed foods from my childhood remind me of being with my mom. So I would say Oreos are my biggest comfort food. You know, I'm really grateful for all the conversations we've had on this season of Chasing Life. Doing this podcast is such a privilege because I always learn so much. I set out on this journey to find out what weight means for our health. What is the connection really between those two things? Whether it is possible to feel good and be healthy without agonizing over the numbers on the scale, and also why it can feel so hard to lose weight. Again, I learned a lot, not only about the latest weight loss drugs and why obesity is considered a disease, but also how to simply think about weight in a different way. To get some perspective on ourselves and others. Our society is evolving quickly and right now it has a lot of catching up to do. There is still so much to learn about weight and health, but I'm glad we get to do this together. I'm glad so many of you show so much interest in this topic, which I know can feel personal and complicated. In celebration of all this, we're going to be diving into one of the biggest mysteries of life. Something I'm really excited about happiness, the science behind it, what it really means, and how you can be happier. Chasing life is a production of CNN audio.

But how do you strike a balance between eating for pleasure and eating for fuel? How can we reframe our relationship with food – so it doesn't revolve around what's 'bad' or 'good?'

So if we go back to, you know, minimally processed foods from any culture and focus on lots of, you know, whole grains, legumes, vegetables, we can all actually eat joyfully and healthfully. You know, I never really thought of, the idea that people immediately when they think of healthy food. I got the idea that they they realize they need to eat less. But the idea that you also needed to eat more bland, that's a really interesting thing. So it became fewer calories of a very, very plain food that that's what you're saying. That's what your patients sort of came to you with. And on the other hand, humans, you know, we crave sweet, we crave salt, we want those tastes. And I think that's part of what leads us to overeat is that if you're in a society or an environment where you have plenty of options for food, you tend to seek out those foods. How do you how do you tackle this problem? I really try not to demonize anything. So personally, I have a sweet tooth. Naturally. That's that's my, you know, my weakness. If anything. 'Yeah. It's hard. So I like to ask myself, is it worth it? Like, do I want to have a bigger portion of a so-called healthier dessert? Or do I want a little bit of the real thing? I actually want a little bit of the real thing. Maybe less frequently. Right. So I want my amazing dessert. If I happen to be traveling in a place that has, like a really well-known bakery, I'm going to have that. But I'm going to eat it mindfully. So I think this is a really important tip for everybody. What that means - it doesn't have to be meaning that you have to meditate over your food. It means when you're eating your food, just focus on the pleasure of that. Eat slowly, chew your food. My dad actually has a saying chew your food 100 times. No one does that, but chew your food more than the half chew that most of us do before we swallow our food. You'll taste it better, right? Chew it. And then also pay attention to when you've had enough. Some people say that it's the first three bites where you really taste it, and after that you're just eating it. So, you know, if that means that you've had enough, then then you've had enough then. And an easy way to do that is to split your dessert. That's typically what I do. Another issue the day to day snacking. Doctor Shiue has some thoughts on that as well. People snack a lot and I think snackers are divided into salty or sweet snackers and the salty snackers typically like chips. You know, this is what people eat when they're watching TV at night, and the sweet snackers often like ice cream. So the first two recipes, which are very simple that I put in to my electronic medical record, were for the sweet snackers, banana nice cream. Have you had that before? I've not had it, but I read about it because of you. So I saw they take the frozen bananas and put them in the blender. And it's that easy and it's surprisingly good. It tastes like soft serve. You can put in spices, you can add on toppings. You know, let's say I make a healthier sundae with it with dark chocolate, put on fruit, nuts, etc.. And I always say, you know, I have to be real. It's not ice cream, it's not gonna be the same. But if you want to have this every night and then have your real ice cream once a week, this might make it better for you, right? So let's do this a little bit better for the chip eater, the salty snacker I couldn't a recipe for kale chips. And, I remember like, the skepticism of some of these early people. You know, I remember this guy. He's like, come on, I don't eat kale. Why would I do this? And I don't I don't really cook. I'm like, this is so easy and I'll tell you how to make it right now. Have you ever made kale chips yourself, Sanjay? I'm.... I'm with your other friend here probably in terms of my skepticism. Right. So again, not the same, but pretty good and really easy. So, you know, get your organic kale and I say organic for kale in particular because it keeps a lot of pesticide residue. Wash it well. Spin it dry and dry it off completely. And that tear or cut it into bite sized pieces. Toss it with a lot of olive oil, salt, pepper. And then you bake it in a slow oven like around 300 degrees for about 10 to 20 minutes. And you get these nice crispy, crunchy, salty snacks that actually are a value add. Right. So the idea with my stuff is that it has to taste good, but it should also add nutrition, right? No matter what. If you're going to be eating something, why not have it do something that's good for you? So kale, you've got all that fiber. You have calcium, magnesium, iron, vitamin K, potassium, all the things that we may not actually get enough of. It's very heart healthy. It's very diabetes friendly. Okay. I just want to say here that if you're still skeptical about whether kale chips are going to satisfy your cravings, I do hear you on this one. But Doctor Shiue says stick with it. You might be surprised. It's worth it in a long run, you know? But as adults, too, we can all change our palates. Our taste buds constantly regenerate. And so give yourself a month if you're cutting back on sugar or if you're cutting back on salt, cutting back on fat. If you're new to vegetables, just keep trying. Be patient. In a month you'll be like, oh, that thing is now too sweet for me that I used to love. Coming up after the break, why the words we use around food do matter, and also a step by step guide to reframing your approach to eating. We'll be right back. You know, being a writer like you are and someone who communicates this as well as a physician chef. I imagine that the word choices are really important to you. You made a conscious decision not to to lean into calorie counts. For example, the word diet. The word junk food, the word cheat day, things like that.... Are these. Is this language you use? Words are so important, right? You know that words are so important and that people will remember your words if you make an unfortunate word choice forever. I can't say that I have made lots of mistakes around word choices. But I try my best. And so for cheat day, I have fun when I can come up with a better term for something. I call them treat day. So I tell people, do not, you know, let's let's be positive. Let's have a positive approach to all of this. You're not going to eat perfectly. None of us eat perfectly. I don't eat perfectly. You're going to eat better. Don't have a cheat day. Have a cheat day. I think it actually really is important to have a treat day. It's like our lives are hard. We deserve to treat ourselves in whatever way that is, including in how we eat, i that is what people are into. Like, for me, I like to have my treats, but I don't have them all the time and. There is no one healthy diet that is one size fits all. What works for me may not work for you and that is really important to recognize. As a general rule though, whether it's a particular cultural diet or, you know, something that comes from your own heritage. Focusing on plants... That seems to be a pretty universal truth, as I've talked to lots of people about this, but I am curious, are there some top line things that people should think about if they're listening to this podcast and say, okay, I want to enjoy my food. I don't want to punish myself. I don't want to deprive myself. I'm not into that bland diet that that Dr. Shiue's babysitter ate when she was in kindergarten. Where do you begin? Eat home cooked food more often. Right. Because again, you know exactly what's going to it. You have control over it, and you can make it taste the way that you want to taste. So that is going to be number one, something that resonates with you and is better for you. Focus on again the plant based food, so specifically wholegrains leafy greens and legumes, beans and legumes. Focus on those things. No matter how you're eating, then quantity is important and proportions of these items are important. So make vegetables half of your plate. Whole grains and proteins ideally a leaner protein including plant based proteins one quarter each of your plate. And then getting to that plate. This goes back to my Michelin starred experience... Plate your food. Make it look good. We eat with our eyes first. You know, we talk about satiety often and like, do we feel full satiety actually is contributed to by what is our pleasure of that eating experience? If the food looks beautiful, you're going to take your time to eat it. You're going to have that joy of like eating a beautiful plate of food, even if it's leftovers. And, focus on exploring spices. You know, my cookbook Spicebox Kitchen focuses on that because one, I love spices, but they're also... they have health benefits. They're are first medicines they bring us and connect us to different cultures around the world, and they're kind of fun to play around with. You can't go wrong, and I think that's a good way for people to diversify their diets, even if they only know how to cook two things. Let's say they only know how to roast a vegetable and grill some protein. If you play around with 20 different spices, you have 20 different meals there. I think that getting back to the mindful eating part of it, really, let's try to shift from our kind of dominant culture of being productive all the time, even that that's the culture that we all live in. Focus solely on your food. Enjoy that food. Take your time and chewing it so you can savor the flavor, absorb those nutrients better, and just give that as a gift to yourself. I think those sorts of things any of us can do, and it will improve most people's eating experience and nutrition if they do that. Yeah, I think the idea of the mindless eating is, is that I'm, I'm a victim of that, or I'm somebody who falls prey to that. I guess, you know, the idea of being mindful when you eat, not being on your phone, not trying to multitask whenever I've done that. And it's funny, I will just be candid. It happens rarely for me because I feel like I'm always on the run, but when I do it, it's kind of magical, right? I really do enjoy each bite. Doctor Shiue says tuning into your body's needs can really help drive better choices, but you got to be intentional about this. She recommends following the principles of what's called intuitive eating, listening to your body's signals about whether or not you're actually hungry, or whether there might be something else you need at that moment. Are they thirsty? Are they tired? Are they upset? Is that really what they're seeking when they think they're looking for food? So one, listening and trying to just take a moment to really establish what it is that they need at that time. And then when they're making the food choice, thinking about, is this going to make me feel good right in the moment or also later? And then seeing what happens when you eat whatever you're eating, notice that, like, do I feel better now or is this dragging me down? Did I feel better for a few minutes? And now I wish I hadn't eaten that? And when it comes to noticing your feelings around food and around eating, Doctor Shiue says, try and let go of the guilt or shame. It really doesn't serve much of a purpose. Many of us have experienced shame or guilt around food, and that a lot of that is a product of our culture. And you know what the food industry has taught us, and what the fashion and whole dieting industries have created where there is an idealized image. And even though we as an individual may not even think that we care that much about that message, it's reached all of us in all of our subconscious. And so I think that most people at some point feel like, oh, I shouldn't eat that. That's bad for me. It might affect my weight. Let's get away from the weight as the reason why we maybe want you to make a different food choice. Let's focus on your health, which is not always accurately reflected by your weight, whether it's your weight gain or your inability to lose weight. But how.. what you eat, how it makes you feel, and what it does in terms of promoting the health of your body overall. I think for so many people it feels like I'm just trying to get my calories in. I know I need to eat, probably not gonna eat that healthy. I'm eating bland, whatever it might be, depriving myself. You have flipped the script on that. Enjoy your food. I mean, I think that's probably the biggest point of this podcast, is that you can enjoy your food and eat healthy at the same time. Don't demonize certain foods for being bad. And there's still room for indulgence. I really want to always acknowledge that that we should eat for pleasure, even if that means eating something which we may not categorize as being great for our health. And so I think that people have to put it all in the context. It's not what you do every second, it's the overall pattern of how you're eating. And I think if people really lean into that and pay attention to their body signals of how their body is processing certain foods and how that makes them feel, you know, right after eating and from day to day that that will help guide people, you know, kind of listen to your body. I think that will never steer you wrong. 'You know, in a world where talking about food often revolves around weight, calories, nutrition, it is refreshing to hear Doctor Shiue's perspective on all of this, that we should also focus on satisfaction and well-being, and try and let go of guilt and strict rules or labels. There's also a lot of room for the foods we love because it's not about being perfect. Instead, it's about listening to your body signals about what you need not only what's good for you, but what also makes you feel good. Because let's be honest here, food is one of life's greatest joys. I heard from a lot of you about that. My comfort food is pizza. My goodness, it just hits all the things and I don't even need toppings. Grilled cheese sandwiches with tomato soup just reminds me of childhood. Butter beans. No one ever thinks about them. Hot tea. And if something Really wretched has happened.... Then it's hot tea with sugar and lemon,. Greek avgolemono soup which has chicken broth, eggs and lemon juice. My mom passed away when I was about 20, and I realized that some of those processed foods from my childhood remind me of being with my mom. So I would say Oreos are my biggest comfort food. You know, I'm really grateful for all the conversations we've had on this season of Chasing Life. Doing this podcast is such a privilege because I always learn so much. I set out on this journey to find out what weight means for our health. What is the connection really between those two things? Whether it is possible to feel good and be healthy without agonizing over the numbers on the scale, and also why it can feel so hard to lose weight. Again, I learned a lot, not only about the latest weight loss drugs and why obesity is considered a disease, but also how to simply think about weight in a different way. To get some perspective on ourselves and others. Our society is evolving quickly and right now it has a lot of catching up to do. There is still so much to learn about weight and health, but I'm glad we get to do this together. I'm glad so many of you show so much interest in this topic, which I know can feel personal and complicated. In celebration of all this, we're going to be diving into one of the biggest mysteries of life. Something I'm really excited about happiness, the science behind it, what it really means, and how you can be happier. Chasing life is a production of CNN audio.

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN\n—\nUnder the searing New Delhi sun, more than a dozen of India's top opposition leaders joined hands in a rare show of unity imploring voters to 'save democracy.'\nStanding before thousands of supporters at the city's historic and politically important Ramlila Maidan, the March 31 rally marked the opposition's strongest attempt yet to sway voters against electing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third straight term.\nThe consequence of continued Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rule, they say, would be the erosion of the very foundation upon which modern India was built: democracy.\n'This election is for saving democracy and we must fight united,' main opposition party Indian National Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge told the crowds, who were waving the party flag of orange, white and green. 'There is no level playing field in this election.'\nIt echoed a similar rally more than 40 years earlier on the same spot, when opposition leaders fired up huge crowds to help change the course of the 1977 election – ending the 10-year rule of India's powerful third prime minister and political scion Indira Gandhi.\nGandhi had imposed a state of emergency, jailed key opposition leaders and curtailed civil freedoms. To some, India's future was perched on a needle point between autocracy and democracy. She lost the election and, in the eyes of many, India's democracy was saved.\nTo many supporters in the crowd three weeks ago, India is now at a similar crossroads with this high-stakes election deciding which path the country follows.\n'Our democracy is being murdered, India is becoming a dictatorship,' Hazari Lal Rajput, a resident from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, told CNN at the Ramlila Maidan.\nSupporters of India's opposition party, Indian National Congress, during an election rally in Puducherry on April 15, 2024\nSupporters of India's opposition party, Indian National Congress, during an election rally in Puducherry on April 15, 2024\nR. Satish Babu/AFP/Getty Images\nDemocracy under threat?\nUnless there is a major upset, Modi's BJP is set to win its third straight five-year term thanks to his potent, populist mix of economic empowerment and Hindu nationalism.\nAccording to 2023 Pew research, about eight in 10 Indian adults have a favorable view of Modi, including 55% who have a very favorable view. Such levels of popularity for a two-term incumbent prime minister defy all modern conventions, both in India and throughout much of the democratic world.\nBut India's opposition leaders accuse Modi's right-wing government of becoming an electoral autocracy by attempting to rig the vote, weaponizing state agencies to stifle, attack and arrest opposition politicians, and undermining democratic principles ahead of elections, which began on April 19 and run until June 1, with results counted on June 4.\nThey also warn Modi's brand of Hindu nationalism is uncorking dangerous religious divides in a country with a long and tragic history of sectarian bloodletting.\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking during a rally in Sydney, Australia, on May 23, 2023.\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking during a rally in Sydney, Australia, on May 23, 2023.\nMatthew Abbott/The New York Times/Redux Narendra Modi was born in 1950, three years after India's independence, to mother Hiraben and father Damodardas, a teaseller, in the western state of Gujarat.

It has been beset by ideological differences, has seen a host of defections to the BJP and, even with the election in full swing, has yet to even name a prime ministerial candidate.\n'What kind of a democracy can you have if you don't have a vibrant opposition, a robust opposition that can question the government?' asks Arati Jerath, an independent political commentator and journalist.\n'That's why it's not really a question of whether Modi wins or not, it's a question of keeping the opposition alive to fight another day so that democracy in India survives.'\n‘Scorched earth'\nAmong those leading the charge for the opposition alliance is Rahul Gandhi, longtime face of the Congress and the latest member of his family to bid for power.\nHe is the son of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. His grandmother Indira was India's first female leader, and his great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the country's founding prime minister.\n'If the BJP wins these fixed elections and changes the constitution, the country will be on fire. Remember this,' Rahul Gandhi told the crowd in Delhi last month.\nThe BJP and its allies are gunning for a supermajority of more than two-thirds of the seats in India's parliament, the Lok Sabha. A rising fear among critics is that this would give the BJP the power to change India's constitution, which is rooted in the democratic principles of justice, liberty, equality and – crucially – secularism.\nThe BJP has repeatedly denied it has plans to change the constitution.\nCongress party leader Rahul Gandhi speaks during a press conference in New Delhi on March 25, 2023.\nCongress party leader Rahul Gandhi speaks during a press conference in New Delhi on March 25, 2023.\nMoney Sharma/AFP/Getty Images\n'When I say that I have big plans, no one should be scared. I don't take decisions to scare or run over anyone, I take decisions for the wholesome development of the nation,' Modi said in an interview with Indian news agency ANI earlier this week.\nBut the party has already begun publicly pulling India's government away from its secular foundation and leading BJP figures have openly advocated for the country to be declared a Hindu nation.\n'There shouldn't be politics on the basis of religion in any country, they should talk about real issues. Until people's financial situation improves, there won't be any social reform,' said voter Mohammad Irfan at the opposition rally in Delhi.\nOpposition parties have found themselves facing a slew of legal and financial challenges in the run-up to this year's election.\nGandhi's Congress – the largest party in the INDIA alliance — has accused the BJP of 'tax terrorism' and crippling its ability to campaign after its accounts were frozen by the tax department, leaving it unable to use some $20 million in funds. It has also been landed with a $218 million tax bill.\nThen came the arrest of Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi chief minister and head of the popular Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).\nKejriwal's detention on graft allegations came after the announcement of the general election last month, sparking protests in the capital. Analysts say it's the first time in post-independence history that an Indian chief minister has governed from behind bars.\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal speaks during a protest against alleged attacks on federalism by the federal government, in New Delhi, India, on February 8, 2024.\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal speaks during a protest against alleged attacks on federalism by the federal government, in New Delhi, India, on February 8, 2024.\nAltaf Qadri/AP\nKejriwal has denied the allegations, claiming they are politically motivated. He is just one of several prominent members of the opposition, including three other senior AAP leaders, that have also been arrested or investigated by state agencies in moves decried as political by their parties.\n'I think there are very serious concerns about how free and fair the elections are going to be in India this time around,' said Atishi, Delhi minister of education for the AAP, who goes by one name.\nReports have emerged of opposition party members being coerced into joining the BJP with the threat of arrest, while they were under investigation by state agencies. Other reports suggest politicians have had their probes dropped after switching sides.\nAtishi said she was also approached to switch to the BJP. 'Either you join the ruling party, and then the cases are closed or put into cold storage or if you don't, like the Aam Aadmi Party leaders, then the cases go ahead and you're arrested and put into jail,' she said, without specifically naming who approached her.\nCNN cannot independently confirm the incidents and has reached out to the BJP for comment.\nIn his interview with ANI, Modi denied any sliding of democracy under his rule and emphasized the independence of the Election Commission and state agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate, saying political leaders make up just 3% of cases.\n'Shouldn't we let the ED work independently when it is supposed to do so?' he said. 'I am convinced that corruption has destroyed the country. We should fight against corruption with our full strength.'\nAnalyst Jerath said a BJP-led campaign to weaken the opposition was part of Modi's 'scorched earth policy.'\n'Just wipe out whatever comes in your way so that this juggernaut can move on without any kind of challenge, without any obstruction,' she said.\nGandhi ‘not a contender'\nModi is enduringly popular, analysts say, appealing to both the poor and the affluent, especially among much of the roughly 80% of India's population who are Hindu.\nDuring his 10 years in power, he has launched a raft of welfare policies including free food handouts, housing, cheap gas cylinders for women and infrastructure projects.\nIndia is also the world's fastest-growing major economy and Modi's presence on the world stage — including hosting the G20 — has cemented the country as a modern global power, along with a history-making moon landing.\nAuthor Christophe Jaffrelot told CNN Modi makes people feel 'proud again of being Indian.'\n'There is a sense in India, a constant sense, of vulnerability, a lack of self-esteem. So to be recognized as a great power in spite of everything, (that) is attributed to him,' he said.\nThat does not mean there aren't key issues the opposition could rally around, analysts say, including the BJP's failure to increase education opportunities or improve health infrastructure – especially following the coronavirus pandemic, which hit India especially hard.\nYouth unemployment also remains a huge problem, close to 50% among 20-to-24-year-olds.\nBut the INDIA alliance has failed to capitalize on these weak spots, Jerath said.\n'They haven't been able to weave together a cohesive kind of campaign, come up with a catchy slogan that will fire the imagination of the voting public,' she said.\nCongress leader Gandhi is one of the few opposition figures considered to have the kind of star power and name recognition to stand against Modi.\nBut though he may have the name, Gandhi lacks leadership skills, some analysts say.\nRasheed Kidwai, journalist and author of '24 Akbar Road,' a history of the Congress party, said it's a winner-takes-all election and there is 'no silver medal in politics.'\n'The problem with INDIA alliance is there is nobody who has that kind of hunger, who has that kind of personal(ity), who has that kind of inner sense of belonging or ownership to go in this election. Rahul is doing it but is not a contender,' he said.\nGandhi recently completed a 6,713-kilometer (4,200-mile) walk across the country, starting in the violence-hit northeastern state of Manipur, to raise issues of poverty, unemployment, diversity and democracy with voters.\nDespite these efforts, the BJP has dominated the campaign narrative.\nA key gauge of opposition strength will be in those parts of India where the BJP has historically failed to make inroads.\nSupporters of the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) participate in an election campaign rally on Hill Cart Road in Siliguri, India, on April 16, 2024.\nSupporters of the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) participate in an election campaign rally on Hill Cart Road in Siliguri, India, on April 16, 2024.\nDiptendu Dutta/NurPhoto/Getty Images\nRegional opposition heavyweights, such as the West Bengal chief minister and All India Trinamool Congress head Mamata Banerjee and the south's Tamil Nadu chief minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin, will be vying to block a BJP takeover in their respective states.\nBut the only other major national party is the Congress, which has been the main opposition since 2014.\nCongress governed the country for much of the 77 years since independence, and while it was once a powerful political force with its legacy rooted in the formation of modern India, it now finds itself in the doldrums, dogged by infighting and accusations of corruption within the party.\n'In the Congress, the best and brightest are not fighting the election,' Kidwai said.\nAnalysts say that during a decade in opposition, Congress has failed to rebuild its organization and political machinery to effectively take on the BJP.\nThe Congress organization has 'decayed and almost died over the years, particularly in north India, and particularly in Uttar Pradesh, which is the largest, most populous state,' Jerath said.\n'There was a time after independence, and for many years after independence, that they used to say that you would find a Congress flag in every single village in India,' she said. 'That's no longer true.'\nStill, there is optimism from some.\nThe AAP's Atishi said that despite repeated attacks against her party, it has been able to defeat the BJP in Delhi again and again.\n'Democracy becoming an autocracy … That is what we are fighting against,' she said. 'I think that the people of India have always voted very sensibly, and we hope that they do so this time.'",
