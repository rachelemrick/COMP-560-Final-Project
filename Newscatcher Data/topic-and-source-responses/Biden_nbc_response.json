            "excerpt": "The president's re-election campaign, meanwhile, was sending out some thinly veiled jabs about the former president's legal woes.",
            "summary": "As he kicked off a series of events in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania on Tuesday, President Joe Biden freely ripped into his nemesis.\nFrom his hometown, Scranton, Biden chided Donald Trump about his past tax plan for giving tax breaks to billionaires and his comments about Social Security. He joked about Trump's personal financial predicament. He accused Trump of ballooning the federal debt, razzed him for suggesting that injecting bleach could battle Covid-19 and called him ' Donald Herbert Hoover Trump.'\n'Donald Herbert Hoover Trump.' What Biden didn't do is touch the lowest-hanging fruit of all — the fact that at the same time, Trump was sitting in a New York City courtroom, the first president or former president in history to stand criminal trial.\nAs eventful as the trial commencement has been and as salacious as the details of Trump's case are — involving paying off a porn star to evade political reprisal — Biden didn't budge from his longtime practice of steering clear of any specific talk about Trump's legal predicaments. Though he has nibbled around the edges from time to time, Biden doesn't delve into the indictments Trump faces even, it seems, when a criminal trial is actually underway.\nAt the same time, Biden's campaign was having a field day with memes coming out of the trial, ribbing Trump for possibly having nodded off in court. It also put out a news release this week titled: 'After Stormy Abortion Ban Coverage, Trump Poll Memo Attempts to Hush Panic.'\nIt tried to capture the onslaught of rough media Trump faced after last week's Arizona Supreme Court decision that cleared the way for a near-total ban on abortion in the state, while playing off of porn star Stormy Daniels and 'hush money,' the oft-repeated shorthand for the charges he faces.\nThe campaign seemed to relish poking fun at Trump, calling him 'Sleepy Don,' turning the tables on his onetime nickname for Biden, 'Sleepy Joe.' But beyond that, the campaign, like Biden, evaded actual commentary on the charges themselves. The White House did the same. Asked whether Biden was being briefed or was watching Trump's courtroom happenings, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre shifted and laid out Biden's itinerary in Pennsylvania.\n'The president is going to Pennsylvania today, and he's going to do a three-stop tour,' she said before the event. 'He's going to focus on how he's continuing to help the American people.'\nThere is an inherent danger for Biden in getting too close to the criticism of Trump's indictments. Trump has repeatedly told his supporters that the array of court charges he faces is akin to election interference and accused Biden of persecuting him. Celebrating criminal charges against Trump could play into that narrative.\nA Biden campaign official said the recent references to Daniels were a creative way to get out a broader message about abortion. As for picking at Trump for falling asleep, the official said that's consistent with the campaign's highlighting Trump's gaffes and that, in this case, it was too good to pass up.\n'It's smart of the president to continue doing what he's doing, which is talk about his positive vision for the American people,' said Brandon Weathersby, a spokesman for American Bridge 21st Century, the key opposition research group for Biden.\nHis group, in the meantime, is rapidly responding to the trial, highlighting 'chaos' surrounding Trump.\n'With Donald Trump being in court just the last few days, we've seen a lot of chaos. He's intimidating jurors. He's getting reprimanded by the judge. He's going on rants on social media,\" Weathersby said, pointing to the split screen with Biden, who was out campaigning and laying out his platform. 'Right now he's doing the job. He looks like a president.'\nOn Tuesday, against a backdrop that read 'Tax Fairness for All Americans' Biden, 24 hours after Tax Day, laid out a tax plan he said would benefit the middle class and working-class people. It would expand the child tax credit, he said, and add a minimum tax for billionaires. At the same time, he vowed he wouldn't raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year.\nBut he was far from sparing about Trump, seeming to take joy in a string of snarky comments.\nHe bashed Trump, saying he cut taxes only for the wealthy.\n'I have to say if Trump's stock in Truth Social, his company, drops any lower, he might do better under my tax plan than his,' Biden joked to the Scranton crowd.\nHe had the supporters clapping and laughing at another point when he told a story about being confronted by someone who complained about not feeling the benefits of the economy. He was, however, setting up a joke at Trump's expense.\n'Just the other day a defeated-looking guy came up to me and asked if I could help. He was drowning in debt,' Biden said. Then he delivered the punchline: 'I said, ‘I'm sorry, Donald, but I can't help you.''\nIt was a line Biden had used in private events but hadn't said publicly before.\nBiden is to spend the next two days traversing Pennsylvania in a series of events, including in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.\nNatasha Korecki",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The policy contrasts between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are sharpening as the general election campaign gets fully underway.\nBut what does the choice represent for ordinary voters and the economic and cultural issues they care about? A rematch between the Democratic incumbent and his Republican predecessor may feel uninspiring to many voters, but the policy stakes are enormous for tens of millions of Americans — and the world.\nHere are seven big issues at stake in the 2024 election.\nAbortion The contrast: Biden favors federal abortion protections; Trump opposes them. Trump supported nationwide restrictions on abortion as president but now downplays the need for a federal ban, as Republicans are divided over the issue. Biden does not support federal limits.\nThe contrast: Biden favors federal abortion protections; Trump opposes them. Trump supported nationwide restrictions on abortion as president but now downplays the need for a federal ban, as Republicans are divided over the issue. Biden does not support federal limits. Biden has championed the Women's Health Protection Act, a bill to protect abortion rights in all 50 states under federal law and prohibit medically unnecessary hurdles to accessing the procedure. He has asked voters to send him a Democratic Congress that supports legal abortion to achieve that.\nTrump has boasted that he \"broke Roe v. Wade\" by picking three of the five Supreme Court justices who overturned it, delivering on a four-decade goal of the GOP. More recently, Trump has openly fretted that the backlash may cost him and his party the election. Last week, Trump said the issue should be left to states, a shift from his support for nationwide restrictions when he was president. His new stance has drawn pushback from GOP allies, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and anti-abortion-rights advocates, who say that he is wrong and that Republicans should not be deterred from their long-standing goal of enacting some nationwide abortion limits.\nSome Republicans downplay the prospects of federal abortion restrictions' passing Congress, even if they win full control. Biden and his allies are telling voters to look at the GOP's long history of championing federal restrictions and not their recent rhetoric.\nImmigration The contrast: Trump has promised a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration and tougher executive actions; Biden is asking Congress to give him more tools to manage an overwhelmed border and create new legal pathways to immigrate to the U.S.\nThe contrast: Trump has promised a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration and tougher executive actions; Biden is asking Congress to give him more tools to manage an overwhelmed border and create new legal pathways to immigrate to the U.S. Trump has called existing border laws an existential threat to the U.S., saying migrants are 'poisoning the blood of our country' and bringing new 'languages.' His campaign website says: 'President Trump will shut down Biden's border disaster. He will again end catch-and-release, restore Remain in Mexico, and eliminate asylum fraud. In cooperative states, President Trump will deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement to assist with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals.'\nAfter having rescinded some of Trump's policies, Biden has recently shifted to support stricter immigration laws as the system remains overwhelmed. He championed a bipartisan bill to raise the bar for gaining asylum, grant more U.S. resources to process asylum claims and turn away migrants who do not qualify, and empower the president to temporarily shut down the border if migration levels hit certain triggers. (Republicans blocked the bill in the Senate amid lobbying by Trump, who wants to use the border as an election issue.) Biden has also endorsed the U.S. Citizenship Act, which would grant a pathway to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally if they pass background checks and pay their taxes.\nFundamentally, Trump has aligned with forces who want less immigration into the country, while Biden has embraced the belief that immigrants make the U.S. better.\nHealth care and prescription drugs The contrast: Biden wants to extend Affordable Care Act provisions and empower Medicare to negotiate more prescription drugs; Trump has aggressively criticized the ACA but not offered a health care plan.\nThe contrast: Biden wants to extend Affordable Care Act provisions and empower Medicare to negotiate more prescription drugs; Trump has aggressively criticized the ACA but not offered a health care plan. Biden, who was vice president when the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, sees it as a cherished achievement to protect and strengthen. The law, also known as \"Obamacare,\" which has extended coverage to 45 million people through subsidies, insurance mandates and a Medicaid expansion, continues to face conservative opposition.\nSeparately, Biden has touted a provision in his party-line Inflation Reduction Act that empowers Medicare to negotiate lower prices for 10 prescription drugs. He said he wants to boost that to 50 if he is re-elected, with the goal of $200 billion in savings.\nTrump spent his four years as president fighting unsuccessfully to repeal and unravel the law — through legislation and executive action and endorsing lawsuits to wipe it out. In November, Trump called for revisiting plans to \"terminate\" the ACA. He has recently sought to downplay that and insists he only wants to improve the law. But he has not offered a health care plan. Many of his GOP allies in Congress still favor repealing or undoing the ACA, including a budget by the Republican Study Committee, which boasts about 80% of the House GOP conference as members, including Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana.\nTaxes The contrast: Trump's 2017 tax cuts expire at the end of next year, and he has called for extending them; Biden has called for raising taxes on families earning over $400,000 to fund various priorities.\nThe contrast: Trump's 2017 tax cuts expire at the end of next year, and he has called for extending them; Biden has called for raising taxes on families earning over $400,000 to fund various priorities. A series of Trump tax cuts, which Republicans passed on a party-line basis in 2017, expire at the end of 2025. Congress and the winner of the election will decide what happens to them.\nIn a recent private speech to wealthy donors, Trump said his policies include \"extending the Trump tax cuts\" if he is elected, according to a Trump campaign official. That would preserve lower rates across the income spectrum, with the biggest benefits for top earners.\nBiden has attacked that law as a giveaway to the wealthiest Americans, vowing to make \"big corporations and the very wealthy finally pay their fair share.\" He has backed a corporate tax rate hike from 21% to 28% and said that \"nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny in federal taxes.\" Biden is also calling for a $3,600-per-child tax cut for families, an $800 average tax break for \"front-line workers\" and a 25% minimum tax on billionaires, according to a newly released campaign plank.\nThe expiration of the Trump tax cuts will restore the unlimited federal deduction for state and local taxes, which Republicans had capped at $10,000 in the 2017 law. Republicans broadly support preserving the cap, with some exceptions, while most Democrats want to lift it.\nJudges and the Supreme Court The contrast: Their track records tell a clear story. Trump has picked young conservative judges to serve on the federal bench, while Biden has picked liberals with a focus on professional and personal diversity.\nThe contrast: Their track records tell a clear story. Trump has picked young conservative judges to serve on the federal bench, while Biden has picked liberals with a focus on professional and personal diversity. One of the clearest contrasts is what kinds of judges Trump and Biden would pick for lifetime appointments on the federal courts. A simple way for voters to think about it is whether they prefer new judges with the conservative views of Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump's first Supreme Court pick, or with the liberal views of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, Biden's (so far only) high court pick.\nAs president, Trump nominated young conservative judges who will serve for generations. Biden has focused on finding judges with diverse backgrounds and résumés, including more civil rights lawyers and public defenders.\nPerhaps the biggest question is whether a Supreme Court vacancy will open up in the next four years. The presidential election winner and the party that controls the Senate would fill it.\nTrade The contrast: Trump is pushing a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports; Biden's White House opposes that, saying it would raise inflation.\nThe contrast: Trump is pushing a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports; Biden's White House opposes that, saying it would raise inflation. Trump, long a skeptic of U.S. trade deals, has proposed to impose a 10% tariff on all imported goods if he returns to the White House. He recently told Fox News that it could be 60% — or potentially 'more than that' — on imports of Chinese goods.\nBiden opposes that idea. In a memo over the weekend, the White House slammed the idea of \"across-the-board tariffs that would raise taxes and prices by $1,500 per American family,\" without naming Trump; it referred to an estimate by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, that Trump's 10% tax on imports could cost an average American household $1,500 per year.\nBiden, instead, has sought to boost domestic manufacturing with major federal investments in semiconductors and electric vehicles.\nForeign policy and NATO The contrast: Biden favors Ukraine aid, while Trump is skeptical of it; Biden supports NATO and a traditional view of American power, while Trump has criticized NATO and voiced some isolationist views.\nThe contrast: Biden favors Ukraine aid, while Trump is skeptical of it; Biden supports NATO and a traditional view of American power, while Trump has criticized NATO and voiced some isolationist views. The clearest example of the foreign policy differences between the two concerns the fate of Ukraine, which is running low on ammunition and says it needs U.S. assistance to continue holding off Russia's aggression. Biden is an ardent proponent of helping Ukraine, while Trump has poured cold water on U.S. aid to Ukraine and successfully pressured House Republicans to block it since they took the majority in January 2023.\nAnd that points to a deeper divide: Biden is an outspoken supporter of the NATO alliance as a bulwark against adversaries like Russia and China and of preserving the post-World War II order. Trump has dialed up his criticisms of NATO and aligned with a growing isolationist wing in the U.S. that wants to be less involved in global affairs. Trump recently said that as president, he 'would encourage' Russia 'to do whatever the hell they want' to member countries who are 'delinquent' in their dues.\nSahil Kapur",

            "summary": "More than a dozen members of the Kennedy family will endorse President Joe Biden for a second term Thursday, passing over family member Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Biden campaign announced.\nThe Kennedy family has stepped up its involvement in the Biden campaign, working to lift Biden's odds as Democrats worry that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s bid could pose a spoiler risk that could hand the election to former President Donald Trump.\nFormer Rep. Joseph Kennedy III, the independent candidate's nephew, said in an interview that he believes his uncle's 'candidacy poses a threat to the country that I love and the values that I hold.'\n'I believe that his candidacy is likely to divert support away from President Biden and end up increasing support for Donald Trump,' he said.\nThe 15 Kennedy family members making the endorsement include the candidate's siblings Rory Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, Joseph Kennedy II, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Christopher Kennedy and Maxwell Kennedy Sr.\nThis endorsement has been 'months in the making,' according to a source familiar with the Biden campaign's planning, who added that family members came forward to 'do something to show they're united by the president.\"\nJoseph Kennedy III, who serves in the Biden administration as special envoy to Northern Ireland, said the family endorsement is intended to blunt third-party support that could 'siphon votes' from the president.\n'We want to be able to make that case not just for the risk that Bobby's candidacy shows, but because of who Joe Biden is, what Joe Biden has done and what Joe Biden will do with four more years in office,\" he said.\nJoseph Kennedy III acknowledged 'challenging' feelings involved in the endorsement, while noting that 'it's something we believe has to be done.'\n'Bobby knows that we stand by him as a family member, while also being able to clearly communicate that his candidacy poses a risk to the country that we love,' the younger Kennedy said.\nThe family members will formally make their endorsement at an event in Philadelphia with a speech by the candidate's sister Kerry.\n\"We can say today, with no less urgency, that our rights and freedoms are once again in peril,\" she will say, according to prepared remarks sent by the Biden campaign. \"That is why we all need to come together in a campaign that should unite not only Democrats, but all Americans, including Republicans, and independents, who believe in what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.\"\nAccording to excerpts of prepared remarks, Kerry Kennedy will directly attack Trump and invoke her father, Robert F. Kennedy. The prepared remarks do not appear to mention her brother, though only an excerpt of the prepared speech was shared with news outlets.\n\"I can only imagine how Donald Trump's outrageous lies and behavior would have horrified my father, Robert F. Kennedy, who proudly served as Attorney General of the United States, and honored his pledge to uphold the law and protect the country,\" she will say before going on to compare Biden to her father.\nAfter the speech, Biden and members of the Kennedy family will hold a campaign event, where Biden will be introduced by Joseph Kennedy III.\nFamily members will also make calls to voters and knock on doors, according to the campaign.\nMembers of the Kennedy family have praised Biden and boosted images of family members posing with him, such as a St. Patrick's Day photo depicting three generations of the Kennedy family with him.\nLikewise, Biden describes Robert F. Kennedy as a political hero \"who inspired him early in his career to leave corporate law to become a public defender, and then go on to run for public office,\" the Biden campaign said. Biden also has a bust of the elder Kennedy, who was attorney general in his brother John's administration, in the Oval Office.\nSome members of the family have been more direct in their criticism of Robert Kennedy Jr., such as when Stephen Kennedy Smith referred on social media to what he called his cousin's \"misguided stands on issues, his poor judgement, and tenuous relationship with the truth.'\nRory Kennedy said in an MSNBC interview this month: \"I love my brother, and it pains me to come out against him. But I am very concerned with the stakes in this election.\"\n\"I'm concerned that his campaign and running for office as an independent is going to lead to Trump's election,\" she added.\nRobert Kennedy Jr. responded to family members' criticism of his campaign this month, telling CNN's Erin Burnett, \"I don't know anybody in America who's got a family who agrees with them on everything.\" He has reiterated that he loves his family and that he understands \"why they don't like me running.\"\nThe campaign is intentionally keeping the event to immediate family members, such as several of the candidate's siblings, a member of the large political family said.\n'This event is only going to involve the immediate RFK family so that Bobby can't fall back on his claim that he ‘has big family ... and we aren't all going to agree,'' the family member said, referring to how RFK Jr. has previously deflected questions about his family's criticisms of his campaign.\n'The message is crystal clear that Bobby's own brothers and sisters are endorsing the president,' the person added.\nJoseph Kennedy III was sympathetic to the security concerns that his uncle has raised regarding his denied request for Secret Service protection. The younger Kennedy said he was not aware of the specific threat assessments, but 'I would want my uncle, just like anybody else that's running for office, to make sure that they have the safety and security that they need to be able to run a campaign.'\nPolling indicates that Biden and Trump are headed for a neck-and-neck race — and a high-profile third-party candidate, such as Kennedy, could further shake up both candidates' prospects. If the presidential election were held in March and the candidates were Biden, Trump and Kennedy, Kennedy would get about 16% of the vote, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.\nKelly O'Donnell Megan Lebowitz Nnamdi Egwuonwu contributed.",

            "excerpt": "NBC News' latest national poll shows Biden's numbers inching up as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., inflation and abortion all scramble the 2024 contest.",
            "summary": "The share of voters who say they have high interest in the 2024 election has hit a nearly 20-year low at this point in a presidential race, according to the latest national NBC News poll, with majorities holding negative views of both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\nThe poll also shows Biden trimming Trump's previous lead to just 2 points in a head-to-head contest, an improvement within the margin of error compared to the previous survey, as the president bests Trump on the issues of abortion and uniting the country, while the former Republican president is ahead on competency and dealing with inflation.\nAnd it finds inflation and immigration topping the list of most important issues facing the country, as just one-third of voters give Biden credit for an improving economy.\nBut what also stands out in the survey is how the low voter interest and the independent candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. potentially scramble what's been a stable presidential contest with more than six months until Election Day. While Trump holds a 2-point edge over Biden in head to head , Biden leads Trump by 2 points in a five-way ballot test including Kennedy and other third-party candidates.\n'I don't think Biden has done much as a president. And if Trump gets elected, I just feel like it's going to be the same thing as it was before Biden got elected,' said poll respondent Devin Fletcher, 37, of Wayne, Michigan, a Democrat who said he's still voting for Biden.\n'I just don't feel like I have a candidate that I'm excited to vote for,' Fletcher added.\nAnother poll respondent from New Jersey, who declined to provide her name and voted for Biden in 2020, said she wouldn't be voting in November.\n'Our candidates are horrible. I have no interest in voting for Biden. He did nothing. And I absolutely will not vote for Trump,' this voter said.\nDemocratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies, said that 'Americans don't agree on much these days, but nothing unites the country more than voters' desire to tune this election out.'\nThe poll was conducted April 12-16, and it comes during yet another turbulent time in American politics, including the beginning of Trump's criminal trial in New York, as well as new attacks and heightened tensions in the Middle East.\nAccording to the poll, 64% of registered voters say they have a high level of interest in November's election — registering either a '9' or a 10' on a 10-point scale of interest.\nThat's lower than what the NBC News poll showed at this same point time in the 2008 (74%), 2012 (67%), 2016 (69%) and 2020 (77%) presidential contests.\nThe question dates back to the 2008 election cycle. The lowest-ever level of high election interest in the poll during a presidential cycle was in March 2012 — at 59%. But it quickly ticked up in the next survey.\nThis election cycle, high interest has been both low and relatively flat for months, according to the poll.\nMcInturff, the Republican pollster, says the high level of interest in the poll has 'always been a signal for the level of turnout' for a presidential contest.\n'It makes it very hard for us to predict turnout this far in advance of November, but every signal is turnout will be a lower percentage of eligible voters than in 2020,' he said.\nBy party, the current poll shows 70% of self-identified Republicans saying they have high interest in the upcoming election, versus 65% of Democrats who say this.\nIndependents are at 48%, while only 36% of voters ages 18 to 34 rate themselves as highly interested in the election.\n'They just aren't low interest,' McInturff said of young voters. 'They are off-the-charts low.'\nBiden trims Trump's lead The poll also finds Trump narrowly ahead of Biden by 2 points among registered voters in a head-to-head matchup, 46% to 44% — down from Trump's 5-point advantage in January, 47% to 42%.\nThat movement, within the poll's margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, is consistent with what other national polls have showed in the Trump-Biden race.\nTrump's biggest advantages are among men (53% to 37%), white voters (54% to 37%) and white voters without college degrees (65% to 25%).\nBiden's top advantages are among Black voters (71% to 13%), women (50% to 39%) and Latinos (49% to 39%).\nThe poll shows the two candidates are essentially tied among independents (Biden 36%, Trump 34%) and voters ages 18-34 (Biden 44%, Trump 43%). One of the big polling mysteries this cycle is whether young voters have defected from Biden (as the NBC News poll has shown over multiple surveys), or whether Democrats have maintained their advantage among this demographic.\nWhen the ballot is expanded to five named candidates, Biden takes a 2-point lead over Trump: Biden 39%, Trump 37%, independent Robert F. Kennedy 13%, Jill Stein 3% and Cornel West 2%.\nAgain, that result between Biden and Trump is within the poll's margin of error.\nNotably, the poll shows a greater share of Trump voters from the head-to-head matchup supporting Kennedy in the expanded ballot compared with Biden voters, different than the results of some other surveys.\n(Read more here on how Kennedy's candidacy impacts the 2024 race, according to the poll.)\n(Read more here on how Kennedy's candidacy impacts the 2024 race, according to the poll.) The president's approval rating ticks up to 42% Additionally, the poll shows 42% of registered voters approving of Biden's overall job performance — up 5 points since January's NBC News poll, which showed Biden at the lowest point of his presidency.\nFifty-six percent of voters say they disapprove of the job he has done, which is down 4 points from January.\nBiden's gains over the past few months have come from key parts of his 2020 base, especially among Democrats and Black voters. But he continues to hold low ratings among Latinos (40% approval), young voters (37%) and independents (36%).\nbase, especially among Democrats and Black voters. But he continues to hold low ratings among Latinos (40% approval), young voters (37%) and independents (36%). 'The data across this poll show that Joe Biden has begun to gain some ground in rebuilding his coalition from 2020,' said Horwitt, the Democratic pollster. 'The question is whether he can build upon this momentum and make inroads with the groups of voters that still are holding back support.'\nBut McInturff, the GOP pollster, points out that the only recent presidents who lost re-election had approval ratings higher than Biden's at this point in the election cycle: George H.W. Bush (43%) and Donald Trump (46%).\nwho lost re-election had approval ratings higher than Biden's at this point in the election cycle: George H.W. Bush (43%) and Donald Trump (46%). 'President Biden has a precarious hold on the presidency and is in a difficult position as it relates to his re-election,' McInturff said.\nOn the issues, 39% of voters say they approve of Biden's handling of the economy (up from 36% in January); 28% approve of his handling of border security and immigration; and just 27% approve of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war (down from 29% in January).\nVoters gave Biden his highest issue rating on addressing student-loan debt, with 44% approving of his handling of the issue, versus 51% who say they disapprove.\naddressing student-loan debt, with 44% approving of his handling of the issue, versus 51% who say they disapprove. Biden leads on abortion and unity; Trump leads on inflation and competency The NBC News poll asked voters to determine which candidate they thought is better on several different issues and attributes.\nBiden holds a 15-point advantage over Trump on dealing with the issue of abortion, and the president is ahead by 9 points on having the ability to bring the country together — though this is down from Biden's 24-point advantage on this issue in the Sept. 2020 NBC News poll.\nTrump, meanwhile, leads on having the ability to handle a crisis (by 4 points), on having a strong record of accomplishments (by 7 points), on being competent and effective (by 11 points), on having the necessary mental and physical health to be president (by 19 points) and on dealing with inflation and the cost of living (by 22 points).\nInflation, immigration are the top 2024 issues As for inflation and the cost of living, it tops the list of issues in the poll, with 23% of voters saying they're the most important issue facing the country.\nThe other top issue concerning voters is immigration and the situation at the border (22%) — followed by threats to democracy (16%), jobs and the economy (11%), abortion (6%) and health care (6%).\nimmigration and the situation at the border (22%) — followed by threats to democracy (16%), jobs and the economy (11%), abortion (6%) and health care (6%). Additionally, 63% of voters say their family's income is falling behind the cost of living — essentially unchanged from what the poll showed in 2022 and 2023.\nAnd 53% of voters say the country's economy has not improved, versus 33% who say it has improved and Biden deserves some credit for it and another 8% who agree the economy has improved but don't give the president credit for it.\n'If I look back to when I had all three of my children in the house — we only have one child left in the house now, and we're spending more now than what we did when we had a family of five,' said poll respondent Art Fales, 45, of Florida, who says he's likely voting for Trump.\nBut on a separate question — is there an issue so important that you'll vote for or against a candidate solely on that basis? — the top issue responses are protecting democracy and constitutional rights (28%), immigration and border security (20%) and abortion (19%).\nIndeed, 30% of Democrats, 29% of young voters and 27% of women say they are single-issue voters on abortion.\n'I have a right to what I do with my body,' said poll respondent Amanda Willis, 28, from Louisiana, who said she's voting for Biden. 'And I don't believe that other people should have the ability to determine that.'\nOther poll findings With Trump's first criminal trial now underway, 50% of voters say the former president is being held to the same standard as anyone else when it comes to his multiple legal challenges. That compares with 43% who believe he's being unfairly targeted in these trials.\n52% of voters have an unfavorable view of Biden, while 53% share the same view of Trump.\nAnd Democrats and Republicans are essentially tied on congressional preference, with 47% of voters preferring Republicans control Congress and 46% wanting Democrats in charge. Republicans held a 4-point lead on this question in January. The NBC News poll was conducted April 12-16 of 1,000 registered voters nationwide — 891 contacted via cell phone — and the poll has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\nThe NBC News poll was conducted April 12-16 of 1,000 registered voters nationwide — 891 contacted via cell phone — and the poll has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\nMark Murray Sarah Dean",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — \"Outraged,\" \"point of no return\" and \"absolute disaster\" are how some Muslim American organizers have described their reactions to an aid package for Israel that is making its way through Congress for President Joe Biden to sign into law.\nMany Muslim Americans were already furious with the Biden administration over its handling of the Israel-Hamas war, with activists organizing Democrats to vote 'uncommitted\" rather than support the president in some state primaries this year.\nFor several activists and leaders of prominent Muslim American organizations, Biden's support for $26 billion in aid for Israel reaffirms their view about November's election: They cannot back Biden for a second term.\nAhead of the House's vote to pass the aid package to Israel on Saturday, Muslim American organizations urged voters to contact members of Congress to demand they vote against the aid. It ultimately passed 366-58, with 37 Democrats and 21 Republicans voting against the aid and seven members absent.\nIf Biden signs an Israel aid package, as he intends to, \"that heartless decision could mark the point of no return for what remains of the White House's relationship with the American Muslim community and other Americans opposed to the genocide in Gaza,\" said Council on American-Islamic Relations' government affairs director Robert McCaw in a statement.\n'The administration is already at its lowest point in its relationship with the American Muslim community,' McCaw said.\nFor others, it's too late.\nThe rift between the president and Muslim American voters is unlikely to be repaired \"unless the president can undo what has been done for the past six months\" in Gaza, said Osama Abu Irshaid, the executive director for Americans for Justice in Palestine Action.\nAbu Irshaid, who lives in Virginia, cast a ballot for Biden in 2020 but is not planning to vote for Biden nor former President Donald Trump in November, he said.\nMore than 33,000 people in Gaza have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Gazan health ministry. About 1,200 people in Israel were killed during the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, according to the Israeli government, and more than 240 people were taken hostage. More than 100 hostages remain in Gaza, though it is unclear how many are alive.\nThe aid package, which now heads to the Senate for likely passage next week, would mark a significant boost of U.S. support for Israel, though the U.S. has already sent weapons to the country since the start of its war with Hamas. Democratic lawmakers have been increasingly critical of arms support to Israel as well. Earlier this month, more than three dozen members of Congress — including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. — signed a letter asking the White House to \"reconsider your recent decision to authorize the transfer of a new arms package to Israel.\"\nProgressive Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., is among the lawmakers who voted against the Israel aid Friday. She said that she and her colleagues were working to \"make sure that we don't send more weapons\" to Israel as part of the aid package.\n\"Just because we authorize it doesn't mean it has to be sent immediately,\" she said.\nBiden praised the House's passage in a statement after the vote, urging the Senate to \"quickly send this package to my desk so that I can sign it into law.\"\n\"This package will deliver critical support to Israel and Ukraine; provide desperately needed humanitarian aid to Gaza, Sudan, Haiti, and other locations impacted by conflicts and natural disasters around the world; and bolster security and stability in the Indo-Pacific,\" the president said in the statement.\nIn a close election, anger at Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war could be key in swing states that the president won in 2020 by a slim margin.\nBiden flipped Michigan, which has a sizable Arab American population, winning the state by about 154,000 votes in 2020. In 2016, Trump won the state by about 11,000 votes. But during the 2024 presidential primary, more than 100,000 Michiganders cast ballots for uncommitted, many as an act of protest.\nBut the relatively tiny proportion of uncommitted delegates — just 0.008% of the Democratic delegates awarded so far — points to uncertainty about the movement's impact on the November general election. While Biden has more than 3,000 delegates, only 26 have been designated \"uncommitted.\"\nBiden also flipped Arizona in 2020 by a tight margin, beating Trump by just over 10,000 votes.\nAhmed Ewaisha, the chairman of the Arizona Muslim Alliance, said he was \"very excited\" about Biden in 2020. Now, he serves as the co-chair of the Abandon Biden campaign in the crucial swing state. Ewaisha said he's \"definitely concerned\" about Trump, adding that he \"would never, ever support Trump at all.\"\nStill, he said he wanted to vote against Biden as punishment for the president's policies toward Israel and Gaza.\nIn a statement, a Biden campaign official said that 'the President believes making your voice heard and participating in our democracy is fundamental to who we are as Americans.'\n'He shares the goal for an end to the violence and a just, lasting peace in the Middle East,' the official continued. 'He's working tirelessly to that end.'\nSeparately, a White House official pointed to the administration's numerous meetings with state, local and interfaith leaders, as well as outreach to Muslim, Arab and Palestinian communities.\nBiden administration officials have also traveled to Michigan and Illinois to meet with Arab American and Muslim community leaders.\n'White House officials have had more than 100 conversations with leaders at the local and state level concerning the conflict and humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza,' the official said.\nAyah Ziyadeh, the advocacy director for Americans for Justice in Palestine Action, said she voted for Biden in 2020 and tried \"to convince everybody to vote for him.\"\nNow, her organization is working alongside other groups on an American Muslim election task force, which she said will guide how she votes in November. The task force recommendations are expected in a month or two, she said.\nWhen criticizing Biden's response to the war, she said that she doesn't know \"that anything can change my views because I've had to watch six months of genocide against my people.\"\nAs the war progressed, Biden has increasingly sharpened his rhetoric against Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli military's tactics.\nAfter an Israeli air strike killed aid workers in Gaza, Biden said he was \"outraged and heartbroken\" and argued that \"Israel has also not done enough to protect civilians\" and aid workers.\nSimilarly, Biden expressed support for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's public rebuke of Netanyahu.\nThe New York Democrat roundly criticized Israel's prime minister and called for new elections in the country. Later, Biden said that Schumer \"made a good speech, and I think he expressed a serious concern shared not only by him but by many Americans.\"\nWhile several Muslim American organizations are critical of Biden's policies toward Israel, organizers are contemplating how their November votes could impact Trump's prospects for regaining the Oval Office.\nIn the early days of his 2016 campaign, Trump released a policy plan calling for \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" In October of last year, he called for expanding travel bans from several Muslim-majority countries and barring potential refugees from Gaza from entering the U.S.\nHowever, several Muslim American organizers say that the onus is on Biden to regain their votes to avoid handing the election to the former president.\n\"We don't think it's on us. It's on Biden,\" Abu Irshaid said. \"If our votes and the votes of people who support the Palestinian human rights are so important, then Biden should be listening.\"\nActivist Linda Sarsour echoed his sentiments, arguing that \"trying to explain that Joe Biden is better right now during a genocide is not a talking point that lands within our communities.\"\nSarsour is the executive director of the Muslim grassroots organization MPower Change and an organizer for the campaign to vote uncommitted to protest Biden. She said she voted for the president in 2020.\n\"There is no community in this country that knows that Donald Trump is worse than we know him,\" she said, referring to the travel ban on Muslim-majority countries.\nSalam Al-Marayati, president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, voted for Biden in 2020 \"because I really care about our democracy. I saw what Trump was doing.\"\nHe said he has not yet decided how he will vote in November. His organization has not decided whether to make an endorsement for the presidential election, adding that some feel that \"it's not worth endorsing anyone.\"\n\"My concern is that you have a candidate for president who cannot do any more public events for fear of protest, who will not be able to galvanize his own party because it is fractured and is not listening to his own base in his own party,\" Al-Marayati said.\nBiden continues to do public events, although he has faced anti-war protesters interrupting his speeches. At an event in March, he conceded that pro-Palestinian protesters who interrupted his remarks \"have a point.\"\n\"We need to get a lot more care into Gaza,\" he said after the protesters, who called for care in Gaza, were escorted out.\nMegan Lebowitz",

            "excerpt": "Trump is taking aim at Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as several recent polls show he may have more to lose from the independent's presence on the ballot.",
            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he's confident that independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will pull more votes away from President Joe Biden than from him — a net win for the Republican's candidacy.\n'He is Crooked Joe Biden's Political Opponent, not mine,' Trump wrote on Truth Social late last month. 'I love that he is running!'\nBehind closed doors, however, Trump is less sure. A Republican who was in the room with Trump earlier this year as the former president reviewed polling said Trump was unsure of how Kennedy would impact the race, asking the other people on hand whether or not Kennedy was actually good for his candidacy.\nAnd after mostly ignoring Kennedy early in his campaign, Trump has stepped up his efforts to brand the independent candidate as left-wing and make him Biden's problem, suggesting that he and allies are concerned about Kennedy's ability to attract Republican voters. In the same post in which he called Kennedy Biden's political opponent, Trump called Kennedy 'the most Radical Left Candidate in the race, by far,' someone who was 'a big fan of the Green New Scam' and 'other economy killing disasters.'\nIn a video monologue he posted to his social media page this month, Trump described Kennedy as being to Biden's left but said Kennedy has 'got some nice things about him' and 'I happen to like him.'\n'If I were a Democrat, I'd vote for RFK Jr. every single time over Biden because he's frankly more in line with Democrats,' Trump said, adding, 'I do believe that RFK Jr. will do very well. And I do believe he's going to take a lot of votes away from crooked Joe Biden.'\nTrump's increased focus on Kennedy comes as Democrats have increased their attention on third-party contenders, standing up super PACs and other anti-spoiler efforts meant to kneecap independent challengers who could pull from Biden and reduce the vote share Trump needs to get over the top this fall. And in defiance of earlier conventional wisdom about the 2024 race, new polling shows that right now Trump might have the most to lose with Kennedy on the ballot.\nAn NBC News national poll released Sunday found that Kennedy cut deeper into Trump's support than Biden's. The survey found that 15% of voters who picked Trump in a head-to-head matchup with Biden switched to choose Kennedy in a five-way ballot test, while just 7% of those who initially selected Biden in the head-to-head switched to Kennedy when third-party candidates were added.\nThat trend meant Trump went from leading Biden by 2 percentage points in a head-to-head survey to trailing him by 2 points when the race is expanded to five named candidates, including Kennedy. The survey's margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\nRepublican voters view Kennedy much more favorably than Democrats. The poll found that 40% of self-identified Republicans viewed Kennedy favorably, while 15% held negative views of the independent candidate. For Democrats, just 16% had positive views of Kennedy, while 53% expressed a negative view of him.\nThat's in part the result of conservative media and Trump allies heaping praise on Kennedy when he was initially running in the Democratic primary against Biden, as well as prior to this election cycle as Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, railed against the medical establishment and so-called social media 'censorship.'\nA Republican who worked on a door-knocking effort in an early state for a Trump primary opponent told NBC News that Kennedy often came up as the second choice among people who said they were backing Trump.\nA changing posture Trump himself has offered kind words for Kennedy in the past. During a June 2023 interview on the Howie Carr Show, Trump described Kennedy as 'a common sense guy.' Right-wing allies like Steve Bannon, Alex Jones and Roger Stone openly pined for Trump to pick Kennedy as his running mate.\nThe vibe is different now.\nThe pro-Trump PAC MAGA Inc. this month launched a 'Radical F---ing Kennedy' website dedicated to promoting the candidate's left-wing positions. Kennedy, meanwhile, has criticized Trump from the right, hitting him for taking advice from Dr. Anthony Fauci during the pandemic and for running up the deficit. He said another Trump term 'would be bad for the country.'\n'President Trump calls me an ultra-left radical,' Kennedy posted on X in response to the MAGA Inc. website. 'I'm soooo liberal that his emissaries asked me to be his VP. I respectfully declined the offer.' (Trump's campaign has denied that Kennedy was ever approached about being the former president's running mate.)\n'I am against President Trump, and President Biden can't win,' Kennedy's post continued. 'Judging by his new website, it looks like President Trump knows who actually can beat him.'\nOn the whole, there have been public surveys showing both major party candidates suffering more as a result of Kennedy's campaign. The dynamic also may change depending on which state is being surveyed — and which states feature Kennedy on the ballot in November, a battle that is still in progress.\n'Nobody has conducted more polls than I have on Kennedy and his place in the race — and continuously I have seen him draw equally from Biden and Trump,' said Jeremy Zogby, a managing partner at John Zogby Strategies who has polled for Kennedy's campaign. 'Sometimes a point or two towards one side in a poll, and vice versa in another poll. The fact remains Kennedy has crossover appeal among those disaffected within both parties,' like the 'double haters' who dislike both Biden and Trump.\nDemocrats have long worried that Kennedy's association with his famous father and uncles will win over some liberals who are fond of the family. Plus, Kennedy for years gained acclaim as an environmental activist and an anti-corporate crusader, two causes that have him finding common ground with Democratic voters.\nLast week, Biden held an event with Kennedy family members who touted the president and warned of the danger their relative's campaign posed. And on Monday, the Democratic National Committee announced it was launching billboards in Arizona depicting Kennedy as a pro-Trump spoiler candidate.\nA strategist working on the Democrats' anti-third party effort said the data shows Kennedy is clearly taking a slice from both major party candidates, as well as a portion of voters who wouldn't be open to voting for either Trump or Biden.\n'I think the data's moved a little bit over the last month-plus,' this person said. 'But it's all on the margins, it's tough to tell whether this is RFK appealing more to Trump voters, or some Trump voters just looking for an off-ramp, or both. Ditto on the Biden end — is this just reflecting the fact that Biden's ticked up a few points?'\nOne Trump ally said the presumptive GOP nominee should hold off on hitting Kennedy for now, arguing there will be time later this fall to go after him as 'too liberal for America' if these polling trends continue.\n'The second you start attacking him or even addressing him, you start giving credibility to and you start firming up those votes,' this person said, 'At the moment, he's irrelevant. As you get close and votes start hardening in terms of who people are voting for and when and why and how, then you've got to start making moves.'\nIn a statement, Trump's campaign railed against Kennedy's environmental positions and described him as 'no independent , ' while also hitting Democrats for challenging his efforts to get on the ballot.\n,' while also hitting Democrats for challenging his efforts to get on the ballot. 'RFK Jr. is an AOC lover and opposes really any human advancement, preferring that we all live in caves by candlelight, except of course supports charging stations for your $150,000 electric car that can only drive a few miles before dying just like his presidential campaign,' said Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director.\nTony Lyons, a co-founder of the pro-Kennedy super PAC American Values 2024 and the president of Skyhorse Publishing, said there will be a 'pendulum swinging back and forth' throughout the campaign that shows Kennedy at times being better for Trump and at other times boosting Biden's candidacy.\nLyons said Kennedy will soon be promoting a 30-minute infomercial posted online that aims to hit back on the attacks he's facing from his rivals.\n'The fascinating part of it is that Trump says he's ultra left-wing,' Lyons said. 'And Biden says that he's ultra right-wing.'\nAllan Smith Alex Seitz-Wald and Vaughn Hillyard contributed.",

            "excerpt": "The president will make the announcement in an address to union workers in Pennsylvania.",
            "summary": "PITTSBURGH — President Joe Biden will call for tripling tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum Wednesday when he speaks to union members in battleground Pennsylvania.\nBiden, who is set to speak at the headquarters of the United Steel Workers, is in the middle of a three-day swing through the state focusing on economic issues, while his opponent, former President Donald Trump, faces jury selection in New York in his trial on charges he falsified business records to cover up an alleged affair with an adult film star.\nThe Biden administration says China is overproducing goods to export to the U.S., driving down prices and hurting the American economy because higher-quality U.S. products must compete with artificially low-priced alternatives.\nThe current average tariff on steel and aluminum from China is 7.5%, and Biden is calling on the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative — the federal agency charged with developing U.S. trade policy — to triple the tariff rate.\nBiden is also directing his administration to work with Mexico to prevent China's evasion of tariffs on steel and aluminum that's imported from Mexico into the U.S. The trade representative's office is also launching an investigation into China's trade practices in the shipbuilding, maritime and logistics sectors.\nStill, critics argue increased tariffs would backfire and raise consumer prices and inflation. China has denied the overcapacity accusation as 'groundless,' and it accuses the U.S. of trying to prevent global competition.\n'If taken, these actions will not increase inflation,' a senior administration official said. 'But they will protect American jobs and the steel industry.'\nBiden has been ramping up his economic rhetoric against China. So has Trump, who has said he'd consider a 60% tariff on all Chinese imports.\nDuring his administration, Trump imposed new tariffs on imports of washing machines, solar panels, steel, aluminum and billions of dollars' worth of goods from China. The new levies amounted to a tax increase of $80 billion a year, according to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit tax policy group. Biden has kept most of Trump's China tariffs.\nThe push comes amid the White House's controversial opposition to a buyout of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel. Shareholders just approved the potential deal, but it faces stiff backlash from union members and Biden, who has redoubled his efforts to ally himself with unions after he joined a picket line with the United Auto Workers last year and won the endorsement of the United Steel Workers.\nWith polls showing Biden trailing Trump significantly when it comes to voters' perception of who would better handle the economy, the White House is touting that nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs have been created during the Biden administration and that construction employment is at a record high.\nSome see the crackdown on China as an acknowledgment that the Biden administration needs to do more to show it's taking the reins of an unpopular economy.\n'It has nothing to do with elections,' a senior administration official said. 'I think it has to do with the fact that we're actually acting from a place of self-confidence and strength because our economy is growing and manufacturing is rebounding.'\nBut John Basalyga, a developer in Scranton who adamantly backs Trump, blames the Biden administration for the rising costs of doing business.\nBiden 'says his policies are helping middle America,' he said. 'Just walk around and ask the real people of this country and they'll tell you the exact opposite.'\nThe White House hopes the push for higher tariffs on China will resonate with blue-collar voters in Biden's native Pennsylvania. Joe Padavan, a retired steelworker from Wilkes-Barre, said Biden has stood up for union members and stood up to China — and he doesn't blame him for high inflation or rising prices.\n'The problem today is corporate greed more than anything,' Padavan said. 'So hopefully by putting on some tariffs, it's going to bring some of our people here. Why pay the tariffs when you could build it here?'\nGabe Gutierrez Bianca Seward",

            "excerpt": "American politics has largely been stuck in a narrow band of close division for most of the Biden era. New polling shows what could break it one way or the other.",
            "summary": "The good news for President Joe Biden in our new national NBC News poll is that it appears he's climbed out of the political hole he was in this winter: His overall approval rating is up 5 points from January, and he now trails former President Donald Trump by just 2 points among registered voters, down from a 5-point deficit three months ago.\nThe bad news for Biden is that his current political standing is back to where it was in the fall of 2023, when his re-election prospects were already on shaky ground.\nIt underscores an important point about 2024's presidential election with six months to go: The Biden-Trump contest has been remarkably stable — and remarkably competitive — with the movement coming within the margin of error.\nTake the two-way ballot between Biden and Trump, for example. Over the course of almost a year, Trump's percentage has been stuck between 45% and 47% of registered voters, matching his share of the popular vote in both the 2016 and the 2020 elections. Biden's percentage, meanwhile, has hovered between a high of 49% in the summer of 2023 and a low of 42% in January.\nOr look at Biden's approval rating, which has consistently been below 45% since the start of January 2023, and which hit a low of 37% in the first month of this year. It's now at 42% in our latest poll.\nOr look at the favorability ratings for both Biden and Trump, which are almost identical:\nBiden: 38% positive, 52% negative (minus 14 net rating)\nTrump: 38% positive, 53% negative (minus 15 net rating) Or take the names at the top of the ticket out of the equation and note the stable congressional preference in the poll. Right now, 47% prefer a GOP-controlled Congress in the new NBC poll, compared to 46% who want Democrats. The parties have been locked in that competitive position for years: The GOP number hasn't moved more than 2 points in either direction in NBC News polling since August 2021, while the Democratic number dipped outside that range just once.\nSo, despite all the news, developments and drama over the past year, this race has barely budged. And it's extremely close.\nBut the new NBC News poll also points to at least three potential wild cards that could upend this stability.\nThe first is Trump's criminal trial in New York. While his multiple criminal indictments and legal challenges helped him with Republican primary voters in 2023 and early this year, the NBC poll finds 50% of voters saying he's being held to the same standard as anyone accused of such a crime, versus 43% who believe he's being unfairly targeted.\nhelped him with Republican primary voters in 2023 and early this year, the NBC poll finds 50% of voters saying he's being held to the same standard as anyone accused of such a crime, versus 43% who believe he's being unfairly targeted. That majority saying Trump is being held to the same standard as anyone else is higher than the vote share Biden gets in the head-to-head matchup against the former president. Bottom line: The legal challenges don't seem to be a political winner for Trump with the general electorate — at least right now.\nAnother potential wild card is the third-party vote. For months, the conventional wisdom has been that the bigger the size of the third-party vote, the worse it would be for Biden. And that could still be the case, given that Trump's consistent 46% to 47% vote share becomes a winning percentage if the third-party vote is greater than 6%.\nYet, our NBC News poll shows independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hurting Trump more than he is hurting Biden at the moment.\nAnd a final wild card is the eventual turnout in the 2024 presidential race. As our poll finds, the level of high interest in this contest is at a nearly 20-year low, signaling that turnout in November could be significantly lower than it was in 2020.\nDoes that lower turnout help Trump, given that more Republicans have high interest (70%) than Democrats do (65%), according to the NBC News poll?\nOr does it help Biden, given that many of the voters who say they're supporting Trump are the ones who didn't participate in 2020 or in the 2022 midterms?\nThese are all reasons how a stable race can quickly become unstable — and unpredictable.\nMark Murray",

            "summary": "President Joe Biden will on Tuesday deliver a speech in Florida denouncing that state's new six-week abortion ban and other efforts to restrict abortion access across the country, according to Biden campaign aides who shared details of the trip first with NBC News.\nAt the event, which is scheduled to take place in Tampa about one week before the state law is set to go into effect, the president will talk about the 'the stakes of this election for reproductive freedom across the entire country.'\nBiden will also tie Florida's restrictions on the procedure to other consequences of Roe v. Wade being overturned in 2022, including the Arizona state Supreme Court decision last week which upheld a near-total abortion ban dating from 1864, according to the aides.\n'From Arizona to Florida, more and more Americans are seeing up close the devastating impact of Trump overturning Roe v. Wade,' Morgan Mohr, senior advisor for reproductive rights for the Biden-Harris campaign, said in a statement. 'While Donald Trump continues to brag about unleashing these extreme and dangerous bans, President Joe Biden is running to restore reproductive freedom. Since the overturning of Roe, whenever reproductive rights have been on the ballot, they have won, and this November will be no different.'\nThe event is significant for Biden: While voicing full support for abortion access, he has often looked to Vice President Kamala Harris to be the administration's most prominent voice on the issue. Since the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturned the federal right to abortion, Harris has held more than 80 events across 20 states focused on reproductive freedom, including delivering a speech last week in Arizona criticizing the ban in that state and tying in former President Donald Trump's role allowing abortion restrictions to take place.\nOn Tuesday, though, Biden will take center stage on the issue. The president is expected to attack Trump for saying he is proud of appointing the Supreme Court justices who made overturning Roe v. Wade possible, as well as for other comments related to recently enacted state abortion bans. Biden is also expected to say that if re-elected, Trump and his allies will enact a federal abortion ban, though Trump has recently claimed he would not do so, saying instead that he wanted the issue left to the states.\nMeanwhile, the Biden-Harris campaign has been hammering Republicans as more and more states restrict abortion. The campaign has rolled out emotional ads focused on the issue and has used women impacted by the abortion restrictions as campaign surrogates across the country.\nBiden's trip to Tampa is part of the campaign's broader effort to nationalize the fallout and the conversation around state abortion bans. The campaign sees Florida's abortion ban as especially salient because, once in effect, the six-week ban will impact the entire Southeast, given that many women have previously traveled to Florida from states with stricter abortion bans to get abortions.\nYamiche Alcindor",

            "excerpt": "Abortion is at the center of President Joe Biden's re-election campaign — an improbability for a politician who long expressed his personal discomfort with the practice.",
            "summary": "The issue has been particularly fraught for Biden, an 81-year-old steeped in Catholic teachings and reliant on religious faith to cope with unthinkable tragedy: the deaths of two children and his first wife, Neilia.\n'One of the things that carried him through his numerous difficulties is his Catholic approach of giving yourself to the Lord,' said Ted Kaufman, a longtime Biden confidant and his former Senate chief of staff.\nOn a human level, Biden has never fully overcome his misgivings about abortion. That's evident even in the language he occasionally uses. Two years ago, talking to reporters before he boarded Air Force One, Biden referred to the procedure as aborting 'a child' rather than a fetus, a clue about the point at which he believed life began.\nStill, his stance is that he won't impose his personal views on Americans who believe differently. In 1974, the year he said in an interview that Roe. v. Wade went 'too far,' he also voiced opposition to a constitutional amendment to ban abortion, albeit with some ambivalence, a hometown news report at the time shows.\nA column in the Morning News of Wilmington in January 1974 said Biden told a group of anti-abortion activists: \"I am not sure my stand against such a constitutional amendment is right, nor am I sure the anti-abortionist stand is right, but right now I think I am more right than you are.\"\nLauren Hitt, a campaign spokesperson, said in a prepared statement: 'Joe Biden has opposed abortion bans since the 1970s. As a senator, he voted repeatedly to protect Roe, and as President, he has used his full executive authority to fight back on extreme MAGA attacks on reproductive freedom.'\nBiden described the tensions between faith and policy last year at a Maryland fundraising event.\n'I happen to be a practicing Catholic,' he said. 'I'm not big on abortion. But guess what? Roe v. Wade got it right.'\nA look at his record shows that his path has had its share of starts and stops. As a senator in 1982, he voted in a committee meeting in favor of a constitutional amendment that would have given states the power to restrict abortion if they chose, effectively overturning Roe v. Wade.\nAt the time, Biden said his aim was to push the vote to the Senate floor, where it would finally be resolved. The measure never got that far, and when it came up again the next year, he voted against it.\nIn 2019, as the Democratic front-runner for the presidential nomination, he reversed his long-held position in favor of the so-called Hyde Amendment banning federal funding for abortions.\nThat about-face came at head-spinning speed. One day, his campaign said he supported the Hyde Amendment; the next day, amid blowback from fellow Democrats, he dropped that position. He justified the switch by saying he could no longer support the policy because Republicans were restricting access to abortion in poor neighborhoods.\n'Joe Biden is an Irish Catholic kid from Scranton,' said John Carr, founder of the Initiative on Catholic Life and Social Thought at Georgetown University. 'He seems to stay with Catholic orthodoxy until he thinks the political or other costs are too high.'\nBiden recognized early on that his nuanced position — wary of abortion at his core, accepting of abortion rights in the public square — was bound to cause him grief. He told fellow Sen. Abe Ribicoff of Connecticut in 1973 that his stance would most likely please no one, according to his 2007 memoir, 'Promises to Keep.'\nThat proved prescient.\nIn Biden's first year as president, conservative Catholic bishops argued that he shouldn't receive communion given his backing of abortion rights. He met privately with Pope Francis at the Vatican in October of that year, and afterward he said the pope had assured him that communion shouldn't be withheld.\nKathleen Sebelius, who was health and human services secretary in President Barack Obama's administration, said in an interview that she sympathized with Biden's predicament.\n'I'm born and raised Catholic and went to Catholic schools for 17 years of my life,' said Sebelius, a former governor of Kansas. 'I understand this issue. I've been called out by the archbishop. I was ordered not to take communion.\n'I've been on the personal side of this and the political side of this, and I understand the struggle that those of us who are raised in a faith community and then live in a political world deal with,' she added. 'It's not easy. I think Nancy Pelosi [the former House speaker, who is also Catholic] understands that. I think Joe Biden understands it. It's not a simple choice.'\nWhatever Biden's journey, most advocates say they now have full confidence that he is a reliable champion of abortion rights. When Biden left the Senate in 2009, he had a 100% rating from what was then called NARAL Pro-Choice America, a group promoting abortion access.\n'Biden is not the same man as he used to be when it comes to abortion rights,' said Ilyse Hogue, former president of the organization. 'I don't think he's been hiding his agenda just to win a second term and then secretly plans to turn around and become this anti-choice guy. I'm not worried about it at all.'\nSome still don't believe Biden goes far enough to promote reproductive rights.\nRenee Bracey Sherman, founder and a co-executive director of We Testify, an abortion rights advocacy group, said Biden should use his megaphone to remove the stigma tied to abortion instead of airing his personal doubts. She pointed to recent surveys indicating that 6 in 10 Catholics support abortion rights.\n'He's the president of the United States; he's not the pope of the United States,' Bracey Sherman said. 'I'm sorry, he's allowed to have his personal feelings. But at the end of the day, he is the president, and he is supposed to defend the Constitution and people in this country who need abortions.'\nBracey Sherman said her organization reached out to the Biden administration multiple times offering to bring Catholics who have had abortions into the White House to share their stories — but has yet to hear back.\n'He makes it seem as though he's the one who's following the Catholic teachings,' she said. 'But what about the rest of the Catholics in America who do support access to abortion and have abortions?'\nElections are a choice. Even Biden detractors say they're fully aware that the only realistic alternative at this point is Trump, whom they view as an extremist on the issue.\nAbortion looks to be one of Trump's glaring vulnerabilities. He has boasted about his role in overturning Roe v. Wade through his appointment of three conservative Supreme Court justices during his single term.\n'There is a fundamental question and a fundamental difference between the president and Donald Trump and their belief on whether the Constitution affords women a right to choose. Donald Trump does not; Joe Biden does,' said Kate Berner, a former Biden White House official.\nTrump recently said abortion decisions should be left to the states after he was criticized that he has been murky about what he believes. Even so, he sought to dissociate himself from a recent state court ruling in Arizona upholding a 19th century law imposing a near-total abortion ban.\nDisavowing Arizona's strict anti-abortion measure isn't so easy for Trump. The reason it can take effect springs directly from the votes of conservative Supreme Court justices whom Trump worked to install.\n'The fact is that he announced he was going to stack the court with justices who could be counted on to overrule Roe v. Wade,' said Laurence Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor emeritus. 'He succeeded in that. They did it. That led to the revival of laws like Arizona's, even if Trump says: ‘Oops, I'm sorry that's the consequence. It doesn't make me look good politically.''\nBiden was at the White House last Sunday, dealing with the fallout from Iran's attack on Israel. When he's in Washington on the weekends, he'll often attend services at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Georgetown, the church frequented by the nation's first Catholic president, John F. Kennedy. A Black Lives Matter banner hangs from a fence outside.\nBiden wasn't in the pews that day; he was attending a virtual meeting with U.S. allies about the Iranian attack.\nThe Rev. Patrick Earl led the Mass and greeted congregants at the doorway afterward. He said in an interview that Biden is a 'good presence' during services, recalling how he once left his seat to congratulate a boy's family celebrating his First Communion.\nEarl said he understood Biden's position, even if it conflicts with church teaching.\n'As the political leader of a very varied country, you can't just say, ‘You've got to believe as I believe,'\" he said. \"You just can't.\"\nPeter Nicholas Natasha Korecki",

            "summary": "The prime minister of Papua New Guinea defended the Pacific Island nation after President Joe Biden appeared to imply that his uncle's body was eaten by 'cannibals' there during World War II, urging the United States to clean up the remnants of the conflict in the region.\n'President Biden's remarks may have been a slip of the tongue; however, my country does not deserve to be labeled as such,' Prime Minister James Marape said in a statement Sunday, referring to Biden's comments about cannibals.\nSpeaking at an event in Pennsylvania last week, Biden said that his uncle, Army Air Corps aviator Ambrose J. Finnegan, had been 'shot down in New Guinea.'\n'They never found the body because there used to be — there were a lot of cannibals, for real, in that part of New Guinea,' he said.\nU.S. military records about Finnegan's death make no mention of the aircraft being downed or of cannibalism, saying the plane was forced to ditch in the ocean off the north coast of New Guinea for unknown reasons and that the three men killed in the crash were never found.\nWhite House spokesperson Andrew Bates did not address Biden's apparent mischaracterization but told NBC News in a statement last week that Biden was 'proud of his uncle's service in uniform who lost his life when the military aircraft he was on crashed in the Pacific after taking off near New Guinea.'\nThe Asia-Pacific was a theater of heavy fighting during World War II, with the remains of bodies, plane wrecks, shipwrecks, tunnels and bombs still littering Papua New Guinea and other countries more than seven decades later. Marape pointed out that residents live in daily fear of being killed by unexploded ordnance.\n'World War II was not the doing of my people; however, they were needlessly dragged into a conflict that was not their doing,' he said.\nMarape said many unsolved mysteries of World War II remained in the seas, mountains and jungles of Papua New Guinea.\n'I urge President Biden to get the White House to look into cleaning up these remains of WWII so the truth about missing servicemen like Ambrose Finnegan can be put to rest,' he said.\nBiden's comments appeared to offend a key U.S. strategic ally in the southwestern Pacific Ocean as it competes for influence in the region with China, which already has a security pact with the neighboring Solomon Islands. The U.S. signed a security pact with Papua New Guinea last year.\nMarape met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sunday, and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is visiting this week.\nMithil Aggarwal Megan Lebowitz contributed.",

He said if Biden 'gets his way' people would be facing 'colossal' tax increases. He included no information about his 2023 tax filing.\nBiden and his wife earned four-fifths of their income from their jobs as U.S. president and teacher at Northern Virginia Community College, respectively. Joe Biden drew a $400,000 wage, while Jill Biden earned $85,985 from her job teaching English at Northern Virginia Community College.\nThe additional income was drawn from interest on investments, pensions and a corporate entity that collects the couple's book royalties. Most of the increase of income relative to 2022 was from interest paid on one of the couple's bank accounts, according to the tax return.\nThe proportion of Joe Biden's income that went to federal taxes was roughly equal to the prior year.\nBiden plans to deliver a speech on tax policy from his Scranton, Pennsylvania, birthplace on Tuesday that is expected to include a call for the wealthy to pay higher rates. Pennsylvania is expected to be one of the most closely contested 2024 election states in November.\nThe president's return also showed that Biden donated $20,477 to charity, roughly 3.3% of their income, with the beneficiaries including several churches and public health groups like the Epilepsy Foundation and the Fraternal Order of Police.\nBiden's running mate Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, also released a tax return showing $450,380 income for 2023, federal taxes of $88,570 and charitable donations of $23,026.",

            "excerpt": "The decision has raised some concerns on campus, and administrators are set to host a forum about it on Thursday.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Morehouse College is set to announce that President Joe Biden will deliver its commencement address on May 19, but some faculty members have raised concerns about the decision, according to a person familiar with the matter and an email to faculty reviewed by NBC News.\n'This week, I received an inquiry from concerned faculty about rumors they were hearing about President Biden's selection as the 2024 Commencement speaker,' Kendrick Brown, Morehouse College's provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, wrote in the email to faculty members on Friday.\nKendrick said he would convene a virtual meeting on April 25 'to extend an opportunity for faculty with different perspectives on the selection of our Commencement speaker to ask questions and make comments.' He said students would also engage with the president of the college, David Thomas.\nKendrick did not return a request for further comment, and a spokesperson for Morehouse declined to offer more details.\nThe pushback on Morehouse College leadership's decision comes amid increasing protests on college campuses over Biden's support for Israel in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The protests since the war began in October have already forced Biden, and other top administration officials, to dramatically scale back appearances at college campuses.\nCommencement season is typically a time when presidents reach young audiences and offer an opportunity to deliver a keynote address highlighting their accomplishments and future. In an election year, commencement speeches can carry particular significance.\nBut Biden's addresses this year are poised to be fraught, largely due to growing protests over his refusal to call for a permanent, immediate ceasefire in Gaza without conditions. The president is struggling with younger voters, and recent polling also shows many Black voters are not enthusiastic about supporting his candidacy.\nSpeaking at an Historically Black College and University would provide an 'opportunity' for the president, according to the person familiar with the controversy.\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment.\nPro-Palestinian protesters gather outside of Columbia University in New York City on April 18. Kena Betancur / AFP - Getty Images Brown wrote in his email that Morehouse first extended its invitation to Biden in September, and that the college would announce the president as its speaker early this week.\nAnd, he wrote, 'the College does not plan to rescind its accepted invitation to President Biden.' The meeting on Thursday 'is a forum for discussion and to respond to questions about the invitation that was extended and accepted,' Brown wrote in the email.\nMorehouse, like other colleges, has faced students speaking out about the war in Gaza. In February, the Maroon Tiger — Morehouse's student publication — reported that a student pulled an Israeli flag down from the chapel and was detained by campus police.\n'Students are not in favor of the way in which the United States has handled this situation, and are surely not in favor of the trauma and the pain and the genocide that the Palestinian people are going through — but also that innocent civilians and Israel are going through as well,' Calvin Bell, a Morehouse College student said in February, after the flag incident.\n'It's not been a secret nationwide, if not globally, that there are a lot of concerns…about how the war has been handled and how America and the presidency has been in the war,' a source familiar with the Morehouse commencement planning told NBC News. 'We've heard conversations like that. There's also plenty of people who are excited to have a sitting president as their commencement speaker.'\nCarol E.

The United Kingdom on Thursday announced sanctions against Iranian military figures and organizations, and European Union leaders also said earlier this week that they would increase sanctions against Iran.\n'Let it be clear to all those who enable or support Iran's attacks: The United States is committed to Israel's security,' Biden said. 'We are committed to the security of our personnel and partners in the region. And we will not hesitate to take all necessary action to hold you accountable.'\nThe Treasury Department on Thursday said the U.S. is targeting 16 individuals and two entities enabling Iran's drone production, including engine types that powered the unmanned aerial vehicles used in the attack over the weekend.\n'Today, in coordination with the United Kingdom and in consultation with partners and allies, we are taking swift and decisive action to respond to Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. \"We're using Treasury's economic tools to degrade and disrupt key aspects of Iran's malign activity, including its UAV program and the revenue the regime generates to support its terrorism.

Let us know\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know It underscores an important point: Despite all of the news, developments and drama over the past year, the Biden-Trump contest has been remarkably stable — and competitive — with any movement coming within the margin of error.\nTake the two-way ballot test. Over the course of nearly a year, Trump's percentage has been stuck from 45% to 47% of registered voters. Biden's percentage, meanwhile, has hovered from a high of 49% in the summer of 2023 to a low of 42% this January.\nOr take the names at the top of the ticket out of the equation and note the stable congressional preference. Right now, 47% prefer a GOP-controlled Congress in the poll, compared to 46% who want Democrats. The parties have been locked in that competitive position for years: The GOP number hasn't moved more than 2 points in either direction in NBC News polling since August 2021, while the Democratic number dipped outside that range just once.\nBut the latest NBC News poll also points to at least three potential wild cards that could upend this stability.\nTrump's trial: While Trump's multiple criminal indictments and legal challenges helped him with Republican primary voters in 2023 and early 2024, the NBC poll finds 50% of voters saying he's being held to the same standard as anyone accused of such a crime, versus 43% who believe he's being unfairly targeted.\nTrump's trial: While Trump's multiple criminal indictments and legal challenges helped him with Republican primary voters in 2023 and early 2024, the NBC poll finds 50% of voters saying he's being held to the same standard as anyone accused of such a crime, versus 43% who believe he's being unfairly targeted. Third party-candidates: For months, the conventional wisdom has been that the bigger the size of the third-party vote, the worse it would be for Biden. And that could still be the case, given that Trump's consistent 46% to 47% vote share becomes a winning percentage if the third-party vote is greater than 6%. Yet the poll shows Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hurting Trump more than Biden at the moment.\nThird party-candidates: For months, the conventional wisdom has been that the bigger the size of the third-party vote, the worse it would be for Biden.

Kennedy Jr. hurting Trump more than Biden at the moment. Turnout: The level of high interest in this contest is at a nearly 20-year low, signaling that turnout in November could be significantly lower than it was in 2020. Does that lower turnout help Trump, given that more Republicans have high interest (70%) than Democrats do (65%)? Or does it help Biden, given that many of the voters who say they're supporting Trump ended up not participating in the 2020 or 2022 elections?\nTurnout: The level of high interest in this contest is at a nearly 20-year low, signaling that turnout in November could be significantly lower than it was in 2020.

Trump orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election,' said Matthew Colangelo, a lawyer with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office. 'Then he covered up that criminal scheme by lying in his New York business records over and over and over again.'\nThe prosecution detailed allegations of a sensational tabloid scheme to 'catch and kill' stories that could have proved damaging to Trump, a plan, the DA's office said, that was elicited with Trump's blessing and that he was directly implicated in.\nHere's what else happened on the fifth day of trial:\nThe ‘Access Hollywood' tape emerges: Prosecutors have argued that when the 'Access Hollywood' tape surfaced during the 2016 campaign, it triggered the worry that led Trump and his allies to try to keep Stormy Daniels quiet, setting off the hush money payments.\nThe ‘Access Hollywood' tape emerges: Prosecutors have argued that when the 'Access Hollywood' tape surfaced during the 2016 campaign, it triggered the worry that led Trump and his allies to try to keep Stormy Daniels quiet, setting off the hush money payments. Judge Juan Merchan has ruled that prosecutors can't play the tape for jurors, but that government lawyers can read from the transcript. And before opening statements were over, prosecutors did just that. Colangelo quoted the tape to the jury, including Trump saying: 'I just start kissing them … when you're a star, they let you do anything.'\nTrump faces a full jury for the first time: Merchan warned the full panel of 12 jurors and six alternates that they must guard carefully against outside bias as they listen to evidence in the case. While jurors may tell their employers that they are among the small group of New Yorkers who will judge Trump, they must not talk about it. Instead, as they listen to the evidence and render a verdict, they must avoid all news related to the case and not research the details or anyone involved.\nTrump faces a full jury for the first time: Merchan warned the full panel of 12 jurors and six alternates that they must guard carefully against outside bias as they listen to evidence in the case.

            "excerpt": "Analysis: Don't discount voters' interest in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s third-party candidacy, even if he seems to be trying not to be taken seriously.",
            "summary": "What happens when an electorate wants change but there's no obvious change candidate on the ballot?\nThis question popped into my head after I watched one of Rich Thau's fascinating monthly focus groups of Biden-Trump voters, with the latest edition convening Pennsylvania voters who voted once for either President Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton and once for former President Donald Trump.\nThau has been doing these qualitative monthly check-ins with voters across the country ever since the rise of Trump. For the 2020 election cycle, he gathered voters who voted Obama-Trump. Now, he has shifted the voter résumé to the mix of folks above, still focusing on people who have switched their votes election to election. (Thau and his company, Engagious, are also partnering with NBC News on another recurring focus group project gathering key voting groups in battleground states.) You can see some of the archived focus groups at his website. This is one of those projects that become exponentially more impactful with each new monthly addition to the archives, so pay attention!\nThe headline-grabber for this month's Pennsylvania check-in was the surprising level of interest in Robert F. Kennedy Jr. among these swing voters. In some ways, this shouldn't be a surprise. These voters are by definition not hard partisans, and they certainly aren't pleased with either major party, as they've been comfortable voting against both of them over the last two elections.\nAs I wrote months ago, there was always going to be a moment in this campaign cycle when both major parties had finished their nominating processes and selected Biden and Trump — and yet the public wasn't satisfied with that outcome. We are at that moment.\nSix months ago, while we knew his trials were always going to be a disruptive moment for Trump, it wasn't clear how much other issues were going to be disruptive to Biden. But clearly, the Middle East is becoming a hugely disruptive political issue for him.\nIronically, it was this moment in the calendar that the folks at No Labels had once identified as the perfect time to pick their ticket and start selling it publicly. The convergence of a front-loaded primary calendar with ballot deadlines made it inevitable that an April lull would be an ideal opportunity to fill an obvious void. This spring period in 1992, after it became clear that Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush would be their parties' nominees, was when Ross Perot got an opening — and he used it brilliantly. The strongest 90-day period for Perot's campaign was essentially April 1 to mid-July (the start of the Democratic convention).\nUltimately, No Labels failed to find a compelling ticket, so it has since called off its effort. But No Labels didn't fail because the vacuum of people looking for an alternative to Biden and Trump ceased to exist.\nWith no mainstream third-party alternative available for now, that vacuum is being filled by Kennedy. For many voters, one can tell, he's simply a famous name filling a void. You can hear the lack of knowledge many of these Pennsylvania voters had about Kennedy other than his name, and those who knew something about him knew only a few things. Moreover, it was clear that his best asset was the fact that his last name was neither Trump nor Biden.\nWatching the initial interest in Kennedy's candidacy among these voters serves as a reminder that there was a powerful opportunity for a true potential unity ticket — not one that professed 'centrism' per se, but one that promised to take a partisan timeout for four years and attempt to focus on hard choices to solve hard problems, like immigration.\nBut given the stakes of this election, it has also been clear to me that while an opening exists with the true middle-of-the-road or less partisan crowd, the lane is very narrow. And unless partisans from one or both parties also wanted an alternative, there really wasn't a path to victory.\nBut there is a path to relevancy.\nI'm convinced that if Kennedy were merely just anti-Covid vaccine, rather than anti-most vaccines, the voters he needs to persuade wouldn't view him as skeptically, and that would make others take him more seriously. Every one of these new measles outbreaks around the country has the fingerprints of the anti-vax crowd on it, and whether those outbreaks are in South Florida or Northern California or Oklahoma or elsewhere, they all serve as a reminder that anti-vaccine messaging has done real damage to real human beings.\nDespite all of that, the initial interest in Kennedy does tell me that he is going to be a very powerful 'none of the above' candidate on the ballot.\nNationally I think it's pretty clear Kennedy pulls from both Trump and Biden about evenly, reinforcing this notion he's most likely a placeholder for 'none of the above.' Where this will get tricky is in the battleground states, because I'm not as convinced Kennedy will pull evenly from the two major candidates when you start to measure this in Michigan versus North Carolina or Arizona versus Wisconsin.\nNot all anti-Biden and anti-Trump voters around the country act the same. Military veterans in North Carolina who choose to vote for Kennedy, say, may also vote GOP down the ballot, but they don't trust Trump as commander in chief. And while those votes won't hurt the GOP in other ways, they will lower Trump's support and give Biden a lower 'winning' number to carry North Carolina. If Biden can make 47% a winning number in North Carolina, he'll carry the state.\nKennedy could also become a place to park votes for folks uncomfortable with Biden's execution of foreign policy, particularly all things having to do with Israel and Gaza.\nThat same math problem could affect the Democrats if, say, a big chunk of progressive voters in Michigan or Wisconsin decides both Trump and Biden have the same basic policy toward Israel and they vote for Kennedy as a protest vote. Perhaps that wouldn't hurt Democrats down the ballot in either state, but it would lower the winning number Trump needs to carry either. As in North Carolina for Biden, if Trump can make 47% a winning number in Wisconsin or Michigan, he'll carry it.\nI don't foresee Kennedy's getting north of 'none of the above' territory come Election Day, but the likelihood that he continues to poll in double digits until at least October seems high. And if that means he ends up qualifying for the national debates, then we could enter some rarely charted territory.\nIf he's in the debates, it's a potential opportunity for Kennedy. But I'm hesitant to believe he can make the most of that opportunity, because, so far, every time he has had a chance to grab a mainstream spotlight, he has instead either eagerly traveled down rabbit holes marked 'vaccines' and 'Jan. 6' and 'Kennedy conspiracies' or he has gotten so defensive when asked about them that it quickly derails him.\nDespite every effort by voters wanting to take Kennedy seriously as a candidate, he has a hard time presenting himself as a serious candidate.\nI am curious whether, in a moment when both Trump and Biden are proactively going after Kennedy, the combination of being attacked by both major-party nominees has a bizarre boomerang effect that boosts the independent, especially if Trump and Biden are attacking him for different things.\nBottom line: Pay attention to Kennedy and to voters' flirtation with his candidacy. It has nothing to do with Kennedy the person and everything to do with Trump and Biden. The stronger Kennedy looks in the polls, the more it appears to be a direct reflection on the collective weakness of the two parties. And the stronger he looks in the fall, the more variance you should expect in how the battleground states shake out.\nWhen the news became a reality TV show To say I have a lot of thoughts about O.J. Simpson is an understatement. For one: The impact he had on the news industry and the TV consumption habits of all Americans is quite remarkable.\nLooking back, I now realize the entire O.J. experience — from the feeding frenzy coverage the week Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were murdered to the multiple televised trials over the following three years — is probably one of the five most impactful events to happen in my lifetime.\nObviously, 9/11 tops that list, as does the election of the country's first Black president. I was a teenager when the Challenger space shuttle exploded on live television, and I distinctly remember heading to a Cub Scout meeting the day Ronald Reagan was shot. After those four events, 'where were you when O.J. was in the White Bronco?' is probably next. (I was co-hosting a house party that Friday evening, if you must know.)\nBut looking back, the profound impact Simpson had was on how media and its consumers interact.\nI'd argue that pre-O.J., the news business was a healthy mix of delivering information you needed to know balanced with information we knew you wanted to know. And I'd argue what that episode taught news executives was that the 'news' could be profitable if you packaged it in a way that made consumers want to watch! What if you simply gave consumers what they wanted to know or hear and didn't drive them away by giving them information they didn't want to know or hear?\nneeded to know balanced with information we knew you wanted to know. And I'd argue what that episode taught news executives was that the 'news' could be profitable if you packaged it in a way that made consumers want to watch! What if you simply gave consumers what they wanted to know or hear and didn't drive them away by giving them information they didn't want to know or hear? Thirty years later, I think the media-industrial complex has learned how to deliver everyone what they want to hear to the point that people can live in different realities. We don't have a shared set of facts anymore, because the news business is stuck with a revenue model that provides financial incentives for catering to whoever it thinks are their readers or consumers.\nSadly, it's hard to explain to anyone who was born after the Simpson trial that a different media landscape did exist before. While news networks always wanted more eyeballs, there was a line between news and entertainment that wouldn't get crossed. In trying to explain this pre-O.J. world to my 17-year-old and to some college students I've been meeting with weekly this semester, I realized how hard it's going to be to try to go back to some of the old ways we did business.\nUltimately, you go to war with the army you have, not the one you want. But I hope, as we all look back at the O.J. saga of the '90s and all the bad decisions that were made in the attempt to make that coverage more compelling to viewers, that we don't repeat many of them as we gear up for coverage of at least one, and perhaps two, trials of the century this spring and summer — involving another celebrity from the '70s and the '80s.\nCameras in the courts: Hot take alert I've been unofficially polling friends and colleagues with the following question: When have cameras in the courtroom been truly a good thing for the public as a whole?\nI started from a position of 'I've yet to find one example.' But there was one televised trial that made me hesitate for a minute: the trial of the cops involved in the killing of George Floyd. I think a strong argument can be made that more good than bad came from the televised testimony in that trial.\nBut outside that example, I'm struggling. I don't think cameras were a net plus for the public with Simpson. Ditto Johnny Depp. Now, just because I'm a no-camera guy doesn't mean I'm anti-transparency. I think audio-only, which the Supreme Court temporarily gave us during the Covid-19 pandemic, should become the norm, with all trials available live via audio.\nBut the more I see cameras in the courtroom, the less I believe they have been a net positive for understanding the courts or the justice system. It's clear all the televised courts have given us is access to cheap and free reality TV programming. Click.",

            "summary": "Last July, a town hall attendee in Salem, New Hampshire, asked Sen. Tim Scott if he 'believed he could swing the historically Democratic-supporting African American community.' Scott's response was guarded.\n'Maybe,' the then-presidential candidate replied. 'I'm a fairly conservative candidate. That does not necessarily bode well for my ability to persuade die-hard Democrats, Black or white or any other color.'\nBut now, with Scott in the middle of speculation about former President Donald Trump's pick for a 2024 running mate, the South Carolina senator is leaning into his ability to engage with the growing number of Black voters that polling data suggest are open to voting for Trump in this election.\nScott has launched a weekly series, 'America's Starting Five,' with other Black Republicans in Congress, in a bid both to make Black conservatives more visible and to reach Black voters. The series, which will discuss ' politics, race, and the 2024 election' and which Scott hopes to continue at least through the summer, is also a vehicle for him to lean into a skill set that could be an asset for Trump: his perceived ability to expand the party's tent.\n' politics, race, and the 2024 election' and which Scott hopes to continue at least through the summer, is also a vehicle for him to lean into a skill set that could be an asset for Trump: his perceived ability to expand the party's tent. 'Sen. Scott recognizes that he can draw people into the party, particularly Black men,' said a source familiar with the planning of the series. 'This is an effort to highlight that.'\nA composite analysis of NBC polling data from 2023 found that among Black voters, men under 50 years old gave by far the lowest ratings to President Joe Biden — and the highest ones to Trump, though a majority still viewed Trump negatively.\nStill, almost 40% of those voters said they'd vote for Trump over Biden in a general election, compared to no more than 15% in any of the other age and gender categories among Black voters, a split well outside the margin of error for those subgroups.\nThat's largely what's behind other recent surveys showing Trump garnering more support from Black voters than ever, cutting into Biden by double digits compared to the 2020 results, even though the president still leads among Black voters.\nA shift in tone Scott's willingness to focus on his race is a departure from the early days of his presidential campaign, when he was at times hesitant to lean too deeply into his identity, even as supporters encouraged him to highlight a factor they believed made him the most electable 2024 presidential candidate on the GOP side.\n'Here are four non-Black, Black people,' Scott said while leading a roundtable discussion alongside four other prominent Black Republicans in the first episode of his new series: Reps. Burgess Owens of Utah, Byron Donalds of Florida, John James of Michigan and Wesley Hunt of Texas.\nThe panelists were taking their turns dissecting a past misstep by Biden, and the focus of the group had turned to a 2020 interview he did with radio host Charlamagne tha God, during which Biden suggested that Black Americans who don't vote for him 'ain't really Black.'\n'The good news is in 2024, it looks like four out of 10 of us ain't Black enough for Joe Biden,' Scott continued.\nAs Scott's presidential campaign went on last year before he dropped out in November, his tune began to shift. He became more vocal not only about his appeal to the small but growing number of Black conservatives nationwide, but also how he was uniquely positioned to help the party make more inroads with voters of color, as arguably the most prominent Black Republican elected official in the country.\n'I believe that I create a red wave where we win back the Senate, we expand our majority in the House, and you do that by having the kind of candidate who — the literal truth of my life — destroys the lies of the radical left and creates a red wave,' Scott said at one of his final campaign stops in October.\nThat 'red wave,' in his view, would be fueled in part by his life story: A Black man from South Carolina, raised by a single mother in a low-income neighborhood, who went from 'cotton to Congress' in a single generation, as he often riffed during his events.\n'I have lived a similar experience to people who find themselves trapped in poverty, who are today growing up in single parent households, who are wondering whether the American dream can work for them,' Scott said.\nA valuable surrogate Trump seems aware of Scott's potential and has certainly worked to keep his former primary opponent close.\nIn addition to appearing alongside Trump at several campaign rallies in the waning days of the Republican primary, Scott was invited by Trump to attend and speak at his Mar-a-Lago fundraiser last week, which the campaign said netted $50 million across groups including Trump's main super PAC and other fundraising committees.\nA day before the South Carolina Republican primary, Scott accompanied Trump to the Black Conservative Federation's annual gala, where Trump was the recipient of the 'Champion of Black America' award. Scott was the only former Trump rival to appear at the event.\nAnd Trump has repeatedly said that Scott is better at campaigning on his behalf than he was campaigning for himself.\nThe Biden-Harris campaign appears skeptical that Scott — or whoever Trump ultimately selects as a running mate — will be successful in recruiting more Black voters to the Republican Party.\n'Regardless of who Donald Trump's running mate is, these are the facts: While he was president, Black unemployment and uninsured rates spiked, his encouragement of white nationalism divided the nation, and his botched Covid-19 response disproportionately left Black people dead,' said Jasmine Harris, the Biden campaign's Black media director. 'Black voters remain some of the most informed and engaged voters every election, and this November they will get behind Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who put Black Americans at the forefront of their administration's work.'\nNnamdi Egwuonwu",

He had promised to dismantle rules created by former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who added new protections for students accused of sexual misconduct.\nNotably absent from Biden's policy, however, is any mention of transgender athletes.\nThe administration originally planned to include a new policy forbidding schools from enacting outright bans on transgender athletes, but that provision was put on hold. The delay is widely seen as a political maneuver during an election year in which Republicans have rallied around bans on transgender athletes in girls' sports.\nInstead, Biden is officially undoing sexual assault rules put in place by his predecessor and current election-year opponent, former President Donald Trump. The final policy drew praise from victims' advocates, while Republicans said it erodes the rights of accused students.\nThe new rule makes 'crystal clear that everyone can access schools that are safe, welcoming and that respect their rights,' Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said.\n'No one should face bullying or discrimination just because of who they are, who they love,' Cardona told reporters. 'Sadly, this happens all too often.'\nBiden's regulation is meant to clarify schools' obligations under Title IX, the 1972 women's rights law that outlaws discrimination based on sex in education. It applies to colleges and elementary and high schools that receive federal money. The update is to take effect in August.\nAmong the biggest changes is new recognition that Title IX protects LGBTQ students — a source of deep conflict with Republicans.\nThe 1972 law doesn't directly address the issue, but the new rules clarify that Title IX also forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. LGBTQ students who face discrimination will be entitled to a response from their school under Title IX, and those failed by their schools can seek recourse from the federal government.\nMany Republicans say Congress never intended such protections under Title IX. A federal judge previously blocked Biden administration guidance to the same effect after 20 Republican-led states challenged the policy.\nRep. Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina and chair of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, said the new regulation threatens decades of advancement for women and girls.\n'This final rule dumps kerosene on the already raging fire that is Democrats' contemptuous culture war that aims to radically redefine sex and gender,' Foxx said in a statement.\nThe revision was proposed nearly two years ago but has been slowed by a comment period that drew 240,000 responses, a record for the Education Department.\nMany of the changes are meant to ensure that schools and colleges respond to complaints of sexual misconduct. In general, the rules widen the type of misconduct that institutions are required to address, and it grants more protections to students who bring accusations.\nChief among the changes is a wider definition of sexual harassment. Schools now must address any unwelcome sex-based conduct that is so 'severe or pervasive' that it limits a student's equal access to an education.\nUnder the DeVos rules, conduct had to be 'severe, pervasive and objectively offensive,' a higher bar that pushed some types of misconduct outside the purview of Title IX.\nColleges will no longer be required to hold live hearings to allow students to cross-examine one another through representatives — a signature provision from the DeVos rules.\nLive hearings are allowed under the Biden rules, but they're optional and carry new limits. Students must be able to participate from hearings remotely, for example, and schools must bar questions that are 'unclear or harassing.'\nAs an alternative to live hearings, college officials can interview students separately, allowing each student to suggest questions and get a recording of the responses.\nThose hearings were a major point of contention with victims' advocates, who said it forced sexual assault survivors to face their attackers and discouraged people from reporting assaults. Supporters said it gave accused students a fair process to question their accusers, arguing that universities had become too quick to rule against accused students.\nVictims' advocates applauded the changes and urged colleges to implement them quickly.\n'After years of pressure from students and survivors of sexual violence, the Biden Administration's Title IX update will make schools safer and more accessible for young people, many of whom experienced irreparable harm while they fought for protection and support,' said Emma Grasso Levine, a senior manager at the group Know Your IX.\nDespite the focus on safeguards for victims, the new rules preserve certain protections for accused students.\nAll students must have equal access to present evidence and witnesses under the new policy, and all students must have equal access to evidence. All students will be allowed to bring an advisor to campus hearings, and colleges must have an appeals process.\nIn general, accused students won't be able to be disciplined until after they're found responsible for misconduct, although the regulation allows for 'emergency' removals if it's deemed a matter of campus safety.\nThe latest overhaul continues a back-and-forth political battle as presidential administrations repeatedly rewrite the rules around campus sexual misconduct.\nThe DeVos rules were themselves an overhaul of an Obama-era policy that was intended to force colleges to take accusations of campus sexual assault more seriously. Now, after years of nearly constant changes, some colleges have been pushing for a political middle ground to end the whiplash.\nThe Associated Press",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The House is poised to vote Saturday on a quartet of bills that would authorize new U.S. aid to Israel and Ukraine, alongside security assistance for the Indo-Pacific and a bill that would force TikTok's parent company to sell it or be banned in the U.S.\nThe chamber is scheduled to vote in the afternoon on the four bills in succession, one day after a rare and extraordinary bipartisan coalition teed up the votes, with more Democrats (165) than Republicans (151) voting for the 'rule' to proceed to the measures.\nThe bills are expected to pass and then go to the Senate for approval as soon as in the next few days. Taken together, they include the $95 billion aid package championed by President Joe Biden, with some changes from the version passed by the Senate two months ago.\nHolding the vote represents an act of defiance by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., against an outspoken faction of conservative rebels who oppose Ukraine funding and pushed him not to bring it to a vote. Three of them — Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. — have threatened to oust him as speaker. The passage of the bill may bring Greene one step closer to forcing a vote to remove him.\nAfter months of wavering, Johnson sided with Biden, Democrats and the Republicans who believe that helping Ukraine fend off Russian aggression is essential to U.S. national security interests, citing briefings he has received and warning: 'Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed.'\n'I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,' Johnson told reporters, noting that his son will enter the Naval Academy this year. 'This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is so many American families. This is not a game, this is not a joke.'\nAhead of the vote, former President Donald Trump issued a confusing statement that sympathized with both the pro- and anti-Ukraine aid factions of the GOP without taking a clear position.\nApart from the three aid bills, the fourth measure includes a policy to force the China-based ByteDance to sell TikTok within nine months — which the president could extend to a year — or face a nationwide ban. The policy, which lengthens the time frame for a sale from an earlier House bill, has Senate buy-in along with Biden's support, putting TikTok closer than ever to a ban in the U.S.\nIf they pass, the bills are expected to be packaged together and sent to the Senate, which will have to vote on the whole legislation to send it to Biden's desk to sign into law. It's unclear when that will happen, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are outspoken proponents of the foreign aid provisions in the package.\n'I hope that President Biden will soon have on his desk long-awaited funding to support our friends in Ukraine and Israel and the Indo-Pacific, and aid for innocent civilians in need of humanitarian aid in Gaza and around the world,' Schumer said before the House vote, cautioning that Ukraine's hopes against Russia would diminish without additional U.S. weapons to defend themselves.\nLate Friday, Schumer said the Senate was working to get unanimous agreement to move quickly to vote on the foreign aid legislation. 'We are working on an agreement for consideration of the supplemental,' he said on the Senate floor.\nMcConnell said earlier this week: 'Here's the political reality: If you think the fall of Afghanistan was bad, the fall of a European capital like Kyiv to Russian troops will be unimaginably worse, and if stalled American assistance makes that outcome possible, there's no question when the blame will land, on us.'\nSahil Kapur Rebecca Kaplan and Frank Thorp V contributed.",

Welcome to Sunday, it's Meet the Press.\nANNOUNCER:\nFrom NBC News in Washington, the longest-running show in television history. This is Meet the Press with Kristen Welker.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nGood Sunday morning. We begin with our brand new NBC News poll and the headline President Biden is closing the gap with former President Trump. Trump leads Biden by two points in a head-to-head matchup, 46 to 44%. Biden has narrowed that deficit against Trump from 5 points in January. And when third party candidates, including Robert F. Kennedy, are included, Biden leads by two points, 39 to 37%. The president's job approval has also ticked up to 42%, up five points from January. The last time we've seen a five-point increase for an incumbent president in their re-election year was Bill Clinton in 1996. There are still troubling numbers in the poll for Biden. He trails Trump by 22 points on dealing with inflation and the cost of living. All of it comes amid a major foreign policy development. Six months after the president delivered an Oval Office speech pleading for wartime aid for Ukraine, $61 billion dollars in new funding finally passed on Saturday 311 to 112.\n[START TAPE]\nREP. MARC MOLINARO:\nThe bill is passed.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nA moment of bipartisanship in a Congress primarily defined by its dysfunction. 101 Republicans and 210 Democrats voted in favor. But more Republicans, 112, opposed it. Congress also passed new aid for Israel and Taiwan, along with a measure to force TikTok parent company ByteDance to sell the app. New aid for Ukraine came only after Republican Speaker Mike Johnson, who once opposed it, did an about-face and put his job on the line to get it through, amid threats from three far right Republicans to oust him.\n[START TAPE]\nSPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON:\nIf we turn our backs right now, the consequences could be devastating.\nREPORTER:\nYou're being asked to resign, will you?\nSPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON:\nNo, listen, I – I – as I've said many times I don't walk around this building being worried about a motion to vacate. I have to do my job. We – we did. I've done here what I believe to be the right thing and that is to allow the house to work its will and as I've said you do the right thing and you let the chips fall where they may.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThe Pentagon has said it has a massive infusion of military aid for Ukraine ready to go. It comes as Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said that without this support, we will have no chance of winning. Ukraine's top military commander issued a bleak assessment of the army's positions on the eastern front, saying they have worsened significantly in recent days. And the top American military commander in Europe told members of Congress that Russia will soon be able to fire ten shells for every Ukrainian shell.\n[START TAPE]\nGEN. CHRISTOPHER CAVOLI:\nIf one side can shoot and the other side can't shoot back, the side that can't shoot back loses.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nJoining me now is the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. President Zelenskyy, welcome back to Meet the Press.\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nGood morning, and greetings to you.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, President Zelenskyy, it is an historic morning. I want to get your reaction to this major news, the House approving $61 billion in aid to Ukraine. It's expected to pass through the Senate. But you have been asking for this aid for six months. In that time, you have run out of ammunition. You've suffered setbacks on the battlefield. Will you get this aid in time to make a difference?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nYeah, it's been so important. And we'd like to say thanks to the Congress for the bipartisan support. And we'd like to say thanks to Speaker Johnson and President Biden. Indeed, it is so important, the support from the United States of America. Of course, we need the support of the American people because, of course, the political decisions depend on the public opinion. And this aid will strengthen Ukraine, and send the Kremlin a powerful signal that it will not be the second Afghanistan. The United States will stay with Ukraine, will protect the Ukrainians, and they will protect – they will protect democracy in the world. This is the show of leadership and strength of the United States. And I think, indeed, now we've reached this important moment. For half a year we've been waiting and I would like to say thanks to all the team on my side and on the U.S. side, the team who did everything so that we would get this positive vote. And today, we definitely need this aid. And Kristen, we really need to get this to the final point. We need to get it approved by the Senate. And then we want to get things as fast as possible so that we get some tangible assistance for the soldiers on the front line as soon as possible, not in another six months, so that they will be able to move ahead.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou know, you said this week, President Zelenskyy, that Ukraine would have 'no chance of winning' without more U.S. support. And I guess the question is can Ukraine now win this war? Or is the United States merely giving you enough aid to prolong this war?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nThank you. I think this support will really strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine. And we will have a chance for victory if Ukraine really gets the weapon system which we need so much. We - thousands of soldiers need so much, and this aid should not be just spread into layers all over, but it has to end up in tangible weapon systems. Some really crucial weapon systems which are hard to get. The long-range artillery and I really appreciate that it mentions ATACMs, long-range weapons. And it's important because we need long-range weapons to not lose people on the front line. Because we have – we have casualties because we cannot reach that far. Our weapons are not that long-range. So we need it, and air defense. This is crucial. These are the priorities now.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, as you know, this aid was held up for half a year because there is fierce opposition to sending war aid to Ukraine, particularly amongst some Republicans. How long should Americans be expected to fund the war in Ukraine?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nThe Americans are not funding the war in Ukraine. They foremost protect freedom and democracy all over Europe. And Ukraine is fighting, and Ukraine is sending its best sons and daughters to the front line and this reduces the price for all Europe, for all NATO. It reduces the price for everyone, including the U.S. as the leaders in NATO. U.S. army now does not have to fight protecting NATO countries. Ukrainians are doing that. And it's only the ammo that the civilized world is providing. And I think it's a good decision. That is why we do need to keep supporting. While Ukraine stands, there's no direct war between U.S. or NATO and Russian aggression. So Ukraine is still fighting, and Ukraine is protecting all the others.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nBut President Zelenskyy, can you give Americans a sense of the timeline? Will you still need as much aid this time next year? Or do you think you can turn the corner on Russia? What's the timeline?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nWell, it depends on when we actually get weapons on the ground, as you said it Kristen. If we get it in half a year. Well, we've had the process to hold for half a year. And we had losses in several directions. The losses in men, in equipment. In the east it was very difficult. And we did lose the initiative there. Now we have all the chance to stabilize the situation and to overtake the initiative. And that's why we need to actually have the weapon systems. When we get it, when we have it in our arms, then we do have the chance to take this initiative and to move ahead to protect Ukraine. But giving U.S. specific timeline of the war, well, it depends on how soon we get this aid. There are so many variables, so many factors. And sometimes when we protect the important line, you retreat because you don't have enough forces and equipment. And then retaking the climb would take two or three times more. And I'm not saying that this is how it's going to end up. But things are possible, and I can give you an example with F-16. It's a great example. The decision to supply F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, we've had it a year ago. One year ago, we got the positive response. Ukraine should receive these fighter jets, so that not only air defense could protect the sky, but we also have more than jets. A year has passed. We still don't have the jets in Ukraine. So it's very difficult to do any forecast. I would like us to be open and very, very specific. From the moment we get our hands on these weapon systems, well, from that moment, we can talk about the timeline.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, Ukrainian intelligence suggests that the Kremlin is preparing for a major offensive in the coming months. You have said by your own account that they are prepared to outgun you ten to one in fire power by some estimations. Will you be ready for that offensive?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nWe are preparing. The personnel is preparing. The soldiers are engaged in training. And I don't want to repeat myself, but we are waiting for the weapon systems because we want to have the brigades fully equipped. Some of them are exhausted. We need to replace them. But these new brigades, they have to have the equipment. Russia wants to mobilize 300,000 people by June 1st. We are getting ready for this. By May 9th, Russia expects that in the east of Ukraine they will take Chasiv Yar city. I visited the region recently. I talked to the soldiers. The soldiers say that they lack equipment. They need to fight Russian reconnaissance drones, which essentially guide the artillery and we need artillery shells. I hope we will be able to stay, and the weapons will come on time, and we will repel the enemy and then we'll break the plans of the Russian Federation with regards to this full-scale offensive.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nI want to ask you, President Zelenskyy, about reports of a lack of morale. Some 650,000 men who are eligible to fight, we are told, have fled Ukraine. You have lowered the draft eligible age, but you've resisted a full call-up of all Ukrainian men. What do you say to young men who don't want to fight, who don't want to risk their lives in this war for their country?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nThis war is the war for the sake of all of us. This is our land. We don't have another place to go. And the citizens of Ukraine understand that. Of course, there are people who don't want to, are not ready. But we do have this mobilization campaign. We do have the draft. We do have a strong army. And we can be frank. In Russia, of course they have more people and people are forced there. So, for example, if someone in Russia is deserting the battlefield, they just shoot them on sight. We cannot do that because we have the democratic values, believe in the democratic country. So, to be frank, in Ukraine we have a lot of people who are ready to protect the motherland. But of course the motivation, the morale can go down, especially when they go to the front line and they see that, well, there are no shells. There is no equipment. That's why the aid from the states is so important. And people need to be trained by professional people and they need to have the equipment to be used so that they have this so people, not only on the training field, but also on the actual battlefield. And then, indeed, they can show the performance on the front line. This is very important.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy –\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\n– And then the morale will go high. And then they will indeed defend the motherland.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThe Washington Post is reporting that Donald Trump has said privately he could end Russia's war in Ukraine by pressuring Ukraine to give up some territory like Crimea, like the Donbas region. What is your reaction and realistically speaking do you see this war ending in a negotiation with Russia.\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nLet's just say that, well, I'm a president of a country at war. And rumors and different hearsay, I don't believe that. When Trump comes here and would tell me their formula of peace, then I would be able to provide the response. At the moment, I know that, well, things Putin wants to show, they cannot happen.And I'm sure that people who know him well, they know. But you can never trust Putin. It's impossible. So the strategy of ending the war should be based not on the words which Putin says or some other people from his entourage say, but on something very specific. Something – something very tangible in Ukraine that is independent and democratic. And I'm confident that everyone is interested in that. All the political leaders in the U.S., they are also interested to have Ukraine independent and sovereign and democratic. It's of interest for both the Republicans and the Democrats.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, back in February Donald Trump encouraged Putin to invade NATO countries that he doesn't believe are contributing enough to defense spending. What kind of a message do you think that sends to the world?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nWell, I don't know the details of that speech. I know for sure if Ukraine fails, then Putin – then Putin definitely will invade the Baltic countries. Why? Not because there's some interesting idea, strategy, but because Putin wants to return the influence of the Soviet Union. And he really wants to retake the force to war. He wants to retake all former Soviet republics and now independent states. Whether they are in the NATO or not, he doesn't care. That is why this is his strategy. Of course, after the Baltic states, also Poland and parts of Germany would also –\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, big picture. Germany's top military official has warned that Putin could be ready to attack NATO countries in as soon as five years, following up on what you're saying. How big of a threat do you see Putin to the West?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nI think he does want to go further. As I said, he wants to reinstate Soviet Union and the Soviet – the Soviet bloc. And they do that in terms of information, misinformation. They just drive different political groups and democracies. Not only Europe, in Latin America, in Africa, they have the influence everywhere. And they do this to split the world. So the risk is high. I think this German diplomat said that it's not even about the wish of Putin, but it's that if Putin is not stopped, then Putin is ready to attack NATO. Even look at the sheer size of the army and the weapons that they have. So we have to be ready to stop him now. Because the froze in conflicts, well, we've seen that in Georgia. We've seen that in other countries. So if we give the big pause to Putin, if we freeze the war right where we are, this will enable him because all his industry will start working not for the war in Ukraine, but will start working for the war against NATO.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, you are not just a president. You are also a father. You have survived multiple assassination attempts. Tens of thousands of your fellow citizens have been killed and injured. Millions have left their homes. Have you ever lost hope?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nYou can never lose hope. You can never lose hope. You can never lose freedom. You can never lose independence. Otherwise, you just lose everything. You lose your state. You lose your security for your children, for – all the children in Ukraine are my children. I will then lose everything. And I have to show the example. If I lose hope, well, my children would lose their future independent country. And then we would lose Ukraine as – as the nation. It's not only about the territory. It's about ourselves, our identity. So we cannot lose hope. We've had different moments, some very cruel. There were moments of challenge. And I'm sure in the history of the United States they also had many moments when the people of the U.S. had to fight for their independence. We remember the period of struggling, when many people lost hope. Or some people emigrated to France. But some people raised the banner, the United States, the banner of independence. And some people were skeptical on both sides of the ocean, in Europe too. But people didn't give up. And I think, well, you got the independent country. And the world got this great democracy. So we cannot lose hope either.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, thank you for being here on this monumental morning. We really appreciate your perspective and having a chance to talk to you. When we come back, Steve Kornacki is here with the results of our latest NBC News poll.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. For more on the NBC News poll, I'm joined by National Political Correspondent Steve Kornacki to break down the numbers. A lot of headlines here, Steve.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nAbsolutely, Kristen. I think the biggest headline, this. Let's give you the bottom line. Donald Trump does lead Joe Biden 46% to 44% in our poll. But this is a tightening from our last poll. You could see three months ago Donald Trump had a five-point lead against the current president. That five-point lead, now down to two points, so there is progress here for Biden in the last three months.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nComing after the State of the Union, and he's had a campaign blitz.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nYeah, and the Democratic primaries, such as they were, coming to an end. Perhaps there's Democrats rallying around Biden, too. Also, I think not coincidentally, this slight improvement here for Biden tracks with a slight improvement in his job approval rating. It now sits at 42%. Again, go back to our last poll, look at this. He was in all-time-low-for-him territory last time around. Now up back over 40%, the highest Biden's job approval has been in our poll since last spring. So, again, these are encouraging signs for Joe Biden; although, broader picture here, this 42% approval rating, history says probably by itself not enough. He's probably going to need more because put this in some context here: these are other recent presidents. At this point in their reelection campaigns, where were their approval ratings? Again, you see Biden's 42%. One thing that jumps out: they were all higher than Joe Biden. The other thing, the two presidents on this list who did not win reelection of course: Donald Trump four years ago, he was at 46%; and back in 1992 George H.W. Bush, he was at 43%. Biden below both of those. The last time Biden's been at this level, 46%, you've got to back to the start of 2023. The last time he was higher than that, you've got to go back to the summer of 2021, his first year as president. So Biden has some work to do on that front. And also troubling for the Biden campaign, the erosion of public confidence on a number of critical fronts. We asked voters in this poll about a number of leadership characteristics here. \"Which candidate would be better?\" There are two, only two, where Biden has the edge over Trump. Abortion, we've talked about this one, seen this for a long time here.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThat's a big one.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nIt is. Certainly, that's the biggest Biden advantage in this poll. And then bringing the country together, Biden you see performing better than Trump. But I think the headline here is you add those two numbers together, you're not even close to 100. That means a lot of voters think neither candidate is better on that. And then on every other front here, we talk about the erosion for Biden and now, you start to see it. Look at these numbers. Trump advantages on all of these traits.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd I stop here because competent and effective, that was President Biden's, the crux of his campaign pitch back in 2020.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nAnd we actually polled this question in 2020, and it was basically the exact opposite. It was Biden with about a ten-point advantage over Trump and, again, same with handling of crisis. Biden had the edge over Trump. And how about this? It's the former president, the current president. We don't really see matchups like this. Well, now we can measure it. Who has the strongest record as president? And, again, Trump outpacing Biden on that front. And, again, you've got to mention this one, too. \"Necessary mental and physical health.\" We asked this four years ago, it was a wash. It's now a clear liability for Joe Biden. So these are all troubling numbers for Biden, but it's not to say there aren't warning signs for Donald Trump in this poll either.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, Trump and his campaign are hoping a third-party candidate might give them a little bit of a boost, but our poll shows it's a little bit murkier than that.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nThat's the thing, because, again, we show a 46-44 race here for Donald Trump. Again, all those liabilities for Biden, Trump only ahead two. What the Trump folks have been hoping is RFK, third-party candidates, they gobble up some votes and Trump doesn't need to get to 50%. But look what happens when we add RFK's name to the mix. Suddenly, we have a new leader. Joe Biden, 39%; Donald Trump, 37%. There's Kennedy getting 13%. In other words, we're seeing by a better than 2:1 margin, it's Trump voters who are flipping over to Kennedy in this scenario, not Biden voters. You see it right here. 15% of Trump voters, when we add RFK's name to the mix, they go to RFK. Only 7% of Biden voters. There's a big change right there.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nDefies conventional wisdom. There's no doubt about that.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nAbsolutely. I think we haven't seen this in other polls. And one final note, Kristen, as well, is the question of enthusiasm. And I thought this really jumped out here. The most engaged voters, those who voted in 2020, voted in the midterm elections, those folks are voting for Biden by nine points. Where Trump's strength is, why he leads Biden, it's voters who don't typically turn out in many elections. Didn't vote in '20, didn't vote in '22, they are with Trump by more than 20 points. And the warning sign for Trump in relying on this kind of voter is this: we are seeing the lowest level of –\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWow.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\n– interest since we started asking this question back in 2008. \"Are you very interested in the election?\" Sixty-four percent, that's lower than any other time at this point where we have polled this before. So, again, lower interest. Maybe those voters who in the polls are saying they're for Trump, are we sure they're going to actually vote in November? The Trump campaign better hope so.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWe'll have to see if that ticks up if we get closer to Election Day. Steve Kornacki, thank you so much for being here.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nYou got it.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWe really appreciate it. When we come back, the jury will hear opening statements in Donald Trump's first criminal trial. What impact will it have on voters? The panel is next.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. The panel is here: NBC News chief Washington correspondent Andrea Mitchell; Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher; and Matt Gorman, former senior communications advisor for Tim Scott for America. Andrea, I have to start with you. There's a lot to unpack. Let's start with President Zelenskyy. What were your key takeaways from our conversation?\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nThat he's really worried about the surge – the Russian surge in what we expect to be May, June, July. This six months was critical. They had a really good chance of winning, before the six months of no aid from the U.S., the weapons that only the U.S. can provide. And after six months, they can lose. They can lose, if the weapons don't get there soon enough. So now it's supply chain. He pointed out that the F-16s are still not there, and they were approved a year ago. And talking to Ukrainian officials, and you heard him today, they need the long-range weapons. They still don't have the ATACMS, those long-range missiles. They're supposedly in the package, the administration is deciding. Ukrainian officials say they've got to get them because the Russian launches, the artillery launches, not only do they have the ammo – they don't have the ammo, they don't have the manpower, Ukraine doesn't have any more – but Russia has that huge advantage, 10:1 in artillery, but they can't take that artillery out, because they don't have the long-range missiles. U.S. has been really worried about not letting them fire into Russian territory. The Ukrainians tell me they really want to, but they do have that restriction. They have restrictions that, frankly, are not placed on Israel. And they're watching Israel getting, you know -- despite all the controversy over Gaza, Israel has the support that Ukraine doesn't have. And I also think that it was really interesting that he ducked the two questions you asked about Donald Trump. He knows this is a close election. And the bottom line is he knows that Donald Trump has said that Ukraine can be forced at the negotiating table to give territory up to Russia. By next November, if Donald Trump is elected, I think it's all possible that Ukraine can still lose this war, despite their great spirit.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, I'm so glad that you bring up two points: One, that he did choose his words very carefully on Donald Trump; and the factor of Israel, the fact that Ukraine is so concerned, Matt Gorman, that the world has forgotten about them as attention has turned to the Middle East, to what's happening in Gaza. And of course, House Speaker Mike Johnson really at the center of the battles for more aid for Ukraine and Israel. Both were approved yesterday, but there's so much opposition within his own party, three conservative Republicans threatening to oust him over this. But it seemed like the temperature was turned down a little bit, yesterday. What is your assessment? How in jeopardy is his job?\nMATT GORMAN:\nIn the short term, not as much as I think people think. The real threat to Mike Johnson isn't now; it's November, it's post-election. Republicans are going to choose their leaders for the next Congress. They'll already have to choose a Senate leader. I think, until then, Democrats and Republicans will cobble together a majority on a motion to vacate, if it comes up. And I think Republicans want to hold on until then. Let's face it: also, too, no one really wants to be speaker right now, other than Mike Johnson. I thought it was notable that Steve Scalise and Tom Emmer voted with Johnson; notable who didn't, Elise Stefanik. If a successful move is going to be made, it's not until November.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYeah. Only member of the Republican leadership who did not vote for it. Cornell, let's talk about this poll: President Biden narrowing the gap with former President Trump, not a big surprise. But what stood out to you in the crosstabs?\nCORNELL BELCHER:\nWhat stands out to me is – well, first of all, great interview, by the way, groundbreaking interview. Spot on. What stood out to me is – surprise, surprise – polls are closing. And polls continue to shrink and get tighter and tighter because that's what happens in this country. And if you go back to our polling, go back to our polling back in October of last year, Donald Trump was at 46%. What is he, throughout all our NBC polling? He's at 46%. What is he at right now? At 46%. Donald Trump, what did he get in the last election? He got 46%. His support stays solid. Where I'm worried about or where I see you can see growth here is, I think Donald Trump is at his ceiling, and Biden is close to his floor. Where he's off most? He's off most among young voters. He is – and the other part about this is the enthusiasm, which I think is really the headline, is that if these young voters aren't enthusiastic and they don't show up and break for Biden big, that's how Trump wins.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAndrea, pick up on that point, because this is all going on against the backdrop of Donald Trump in court for his first criminal trial this week.\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nYet, the fact is we don't know how that is going to play. Up until now, these legal cases have only helped him fundraising, made him, you know, tell people he's a victim, energized his base. And so he's risen in the polls with every indictment. Now, we're going to see him really powerless. The judge has been very effective. And how they handle the gag order is yet to be seen, while Joe Biden is campaigning. The problem for Joe Biden and the Democrats is it's is crowding out – the trial is crowding out the trial, is crowding out everything else. So Joe Biden goes out and does major policy things, the steel tariffs in Pennsylvania, everything else that he's doing. Student loans is breaking through, a lit bit. But everything else is crowded out. And it's the Trump story. And that's what happened in 2016 to Hillary Clinton. And that could be replicated this year. I think it's really – I think the enthusiasm issue and the young voter issue is critical. And as long as this war in Gaza goes on, this is going to be a problem with young voters because they have off ramp. That off ramp is RKF Jr. And I know your poll shows that RKF Jr. would hurt Trump more than Biden, hypothetically, and it's very early in polling, you know, to say who, but I know the White House is more afraid of –\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nIs jittery, yeah.\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nThe family certainly is because it was very hard for those siblings to come out and do that. They only did it because they think he really hurts them, Joe Biden, more than Donald Trump.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nMatt Gorman, what about all of that?\nMATT GORMAN:\nYeah. Look, I was encouraged because when I was going into the trial, I was nervous that all the talk was going to be simply coming from Trump, his message was going to be about himself and the trial. I was surprised, going in the bodega, I thought it was smart, it leaned into issues like immigration, the migrant crisis, and crime that are winning issues, as we saw in the poll, for Republicans and Trump. He needs to continue to do that, get a message that's not just about himself, while he's sitting in the courtroom.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nHow does the courtroom optics play, Cornell?\nCORNELL BELCHER:\nAndrea, you're spot on about him – about him dominating the news, but it's negative news, right? This is different –\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nThat's a very good point.\nCORNELL BELCHER:\nAnd he doesn't look strong. He looks - he looks weak there. And so, to a certain extent, I don't –I don't mind if he's in court every day, dominating the news, because it's negative news.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nOkay. All right. Great conversation. We covered a lot of ground, but thank you.\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nCongratulations on a great interview.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThank you, Andrea. Thank you, all. When we come back, as the athletes prepare for the Summer Olympics in Paris, we look back on the U.S. decision to boycott the games after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Our Meet the Press Minute is next.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. We have officially crossed the 100-day mark to the 2024 Olympics, as Paris prepares to host the competition, this summer. But the Olympics are not just about sports; they've also made history. The United States led an international boycott of the 1980 games in Moscow to protest the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. President Jimmy Carter announced his historic decision right here on Meet the Press.\n[START TAPE]\nPRES. JIMMY CARTER:\nNeither I know the American people would support the sending of an American team to Moscow with Soviet invasion troops in Afghanistan. I'll send a message today to the United States Olympic Committee, spelling out my own position, that unless the Soviets withdraw their troops, within a month, from Afghanistan, that the Olympic games be moved from Moscow to an alternate site or multiple sites, or postponed, or canceled. If the Soviets do not withdraw their troops immediately from Afghanistan within a month, I will not support the sending of an American team to the Olympics.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd you can watch the Paris Olympics this summer on NBC and streaming on Peacock. When we come back, presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin joins me for our Meet the Moment conversation with lessons from the past, as America's democracy is being tested once again.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. As she likes to say, Doris Kearns Goodwin has spent most of her career writing about dead presidents, immersing herself in their papers, diaries and letters in an attempt to being them back to life. In a new book, \"An Unfinished Love Story,\" the presidential historian turns that same attention to her marriage. Before his death, she opened more than 300 boxes of documents and memorabilia with her husband Richard Goodwin, who served as a speechwriter for President John F. Kennedy: a time capsule of their life in the 1960's. In her twenties, Doris was chosen to be a White House fellow for President Lyndon Johnson, one of only three women out of the 16 fellows selected, and developed a loyalty and closeness to President Johnson which has lasted her entire life. I sat down with Doris for a Meet the Moment conversation on her new book and the resilience of America, even in turbulent times.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou have typically written presidential biographies. This is a biography to some extent of your husband, and it is also a love story. What was the process like of writing this book as compared to all of your other incredible works?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nWell, I was so used to writing about presidents who had archives, and I would want to talk to them. I knew them so well, because it took me so long to write those books, longer to write the book about World War II than the war to be fought, longer to write about the Civil War than twice the Civil War. And I would always ask them questions, and they never answered me. So this time, I had this guy, my guy, right across the hall from me in the same study, and I was able to talk to him. And he could answer my questions. And he had an archive – a mini archive of what presidents have – memos, diaries, letters. He just had saved everything in 300 boxes and finally decided when he turned 80 to open them. And what it really opened was a door to the 1960s, a decade that I'd lived in but I was able to learn through him starting at the beginning with John Kennedy, ending with Bobby Kennedy's death and the Democratic Convention.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou talk about the fact that after your husband passed, it was a struggle for you to finish this project that was a labor of love. You write, \"I found myself edging toward a commitment to finish the project influenced by headlines announcing divisions between Black and white, old and young, rich and poor, divisions that made it increasingly evident that the momentous issues emanating from the '60s remain the unresolved stuff of our everyday lives.\"\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nYeah, I think that's what really decided me. I knew if I were going to work on it, it was going to take years. My books take so long, so it was a huge commitment, and I was going to be writing as an historian, not simply as somebody writing about my husband. And so, once I realized that the '60s really had a message to the people today, and I believe that's so. Because we look at the '60s in a sad way because it ended with the riots, it ended with anti-war violence, it ended with Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy being killed. But when you start at the beginning, it was a decade in which young people in particular were powered by the conviction they could make a difference. And they joined the Peace Corps. The people who were in the Freedom Rides and the sit-ins, in the marches against segregation, marches for the vote. The beginning of the women's movement is there, the gay rights movement. It's a time when the air is filled with that belief that if you work together, you can change the government.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, when you look across the political spectrum, do you see leaders right now who are meeting this moment where so many people wonder if our democracy will stay intact?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nI mean, I don't know that we're fighting it the same way we need to be. This is one of the most perilous moments, and there are people obviously in local areas. There are people in states. There are some people in Washington. But the overall sense is, sometimes we've become too much of spectators watching what's happening to ourselves. And – and one of the things Dante said is that \"The lowest place in Hell are for those people in a moral crisis who remain neutral or remain silent.\" We are in a moral crisis right now, and that's what history – I always feel so – so positive about what history can teach us, because we've lived through really hard times before. And these are hard times, however, and it won't get better unless we act, unless we take seriously our citizen responsibilities and use the qualities of character that we need to bring into politics.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nHow afraid, how concerned are you that January 6th could happen again?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nWell, because we're not remembering it correctly. That – that – what history – I was so certain as an historian, and I was on television saying, \"This is going to change public sentiment.\" Just as certain things happened in the '50s that made people understand in the '60s that slavery had to be ended, public sentiment finally got changed. I thought it had, but everything is so breaking news today, and one thing tops on another. I thought the summer after January 6th when the hearings took place, that would change public sentiment. But I still think in the end that the majority of the people understood what happened in that election. I think the majority of people are for the basic values that we're talking about right now for democracy. And it's just a matter of them speaking out and recognizing that it is in danger, and it's up to us. It's not up to somebody else, it's up to us to save it.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd the Republican nominee has yet to accept the results of the last election. Within the context of this conversation and your concerns about the nation's democracy, how much of a threat do you think the democracy is facing right now, and do you think the country can survive this threat?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nWell, I think the real threat is when the Republican – former President says that \"if he doesn't win, he won't accept the results of this next election,\" which means that we may have a recurring battle for who's really – who's really elected each time we do this. And that's a real problem. I mean, all the candidates, when you look at the ones who lost, it's really hard to lose, and every single one was able to say, as – as Carter did, \"I promised I'd never tell you a lie. This hurts, it really hurts.\" Or Al Gore working on that concession speech that my husband was honored enough to help him on, where he talked about the fact, \"The law of the land has said that this election is lost. I don't agree with it, but I must do it.\" And Hillary Clinton say, \"We not only believe in the transition of power, we cherish it.\" I looked at all those, and it just makes you so proud of each one of those candidates who had been through an election. They'd lost it, they'd let down their constituents, and they were able to make that transfer of power. And it's an essential part of our democracy that has to happen this next November.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAs we sit here today, how concerned are you that it may not happen?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nI am concerned that it may not happen, but I somehow think if the majority of the people come out who have different values from that and they vote, voting is absolutely essential. It's the premium value. As Lyndon Johnson said, \"It's the – it's the one thing that all the rest of our democracy depends on.\" And what is democracy? You throw a candidate out or you call him in. You either want him to come in, or you want to throw him out. We have to be able to do that. And I think, if the majority comes out to vote, and the majority never comes out in enough numbers to vote, not only young people. They've made a big difference in 2020, 2018, 2022, and they're saying now that they may not vote if they're not happy with either candidate. Again, if they only could know what we felt like in the '60s when we felt we were making a difference, you feel larger. You feel a sense of – of exhilaration, the word you used earlier. And I just hope they feel that this election could turn on them, and the uncommitted people and the undecided people have to come out and vote, and we have to just take the results of the election. That doesn't mean we know how it's going to happen, but if the overwhelming majority vote, then somehow maybe it won't be as close as we think it is going to be. And then we'll have a clear-cut choice.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nI hear so much optimism in your voice still.\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nYes, I think I was born that way, and I think it's the only way we can live. I mean, it sometimes may sound naïve. I remember thinking what I was feeling when I was at the Civil Rights march, that we're going to change America. Maybe we didn't change America completely, but we made huge changes at that time. And if you have optimism, at least you have the confidence that if you act, something will happen. And it may take a long time, as – as Martin Luther King talked about, \"the arc of the universe,\" all that stuff takes a long time, but it moves toward justice. And I do believe that.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThank you, Doris Kearns Goodwin for this incredible conversation.\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nThank you. I'm so glad to have been with you.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell that's all for today, thanks for watching. We'll be back next week, because if it's Sunday it's Meet the Press.",

Flint later disavowed that statement at Heard's trial, but a jury found Heard guilty.\nLawyers at the Georgia Innocence Project are trying to get Bharadia and Heard freed, arguing both cases were deeply flawed.\n'The harm that Sterling Flint has done to these two men is exactly why law enforcement should be wary of relying on a witness who has every incentive to fabricate testimony in order to help their own case,' said Olivia Vigiletti, a lawyer who volunteers with the Georgia Innocence Project.\nChina's youth skip the tea and reach for coffee Barista Wang Binqi at a coffee shop in Beijing on March 6. Fred Dufour / NBC News For more and more people in China, coffee has become their cup of tea. Last year, China overtook the U.S. as the country with the most branded coffee shops in the world, World Coffee Portal reported. The number of outlets in China grew 58% last year, to almost 50,000, compared with about 40,000 in the U.S.\nThe Chinese coffee market used to be dominated by foreign brands such as Starbucks, Tim Hortons of Canada and Costa Coffee from Britain.

But if there's going to be change, it could take several years for the business to renegotiate the way money flows. Last year, the WNBA was projected to make $180 million to $200 million for the 2023 season, according to a Bloomberg News report. That compares with about $10 billion for the NBA in the season ending in 2022, the most recent year for which data is available.\nThe WNBA's lower revenue is a key reason for the pay disparity between the leagues and why rookies, including Clark, will earn a base salary of just $76,000 this season.\n‘Harold and Kumar' helped weed out stereotypes Justine Goode / NBC News; Alamy / Getty This year marks the 20th anniversary of ' Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle ,' one of the only mainstream movies of its decade to star two Asian American leads, hitting theaters across the country.\nHarold & Kumar Go to White Castle,' one of the only mainstream movies of its decade to star two Asian American leads, hitting theaters across the country.

            "summary": "PITTSBURGH — In the heart of one of America's most prominent historically Jewish neighborhoods, Dan and Baila Cohen keep the front entrance of their 70-year-old Judaica store locked during business hours.\nIt's not how they'd prefer it. But in light of Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack in Israel, Israel's ongoing military campaign in Gaza and tensions at home, they said, the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh told them they needed to be vigilant about who enters their business.\n'That's the reality of the world,' Dan Cohen said.\nIt's not the first time they've had to take additional safety precautions. The couple completed their purchase of Pinsker's Books and Judaica in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood in 2018 just days after a white supremacist gunned down 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue a few blocks away in the deadliest antisemitic attack in American history. But this time feels different.\n'Oct. 27 really unified' Squirrel Hill and Pittsburgh, Baila Cohen said of the Tree of Life massacre. 'Oct. 7 … really started polarizing the community itself, because that's when we started seeing much more of the infighting and conflicts.'\nConversations with more than 30 political strategists, activists and voters outlined how that tension has put Jewish voters in an unfamiliar spot ahead of the 2024 elections: on the front lines of the fight for control of the White House and Congress. Nowhere is that more apparent than in Pennsylvania, the swing state with the largest Jewish population — about 300,000 voting-age Jews in a state President Joe Biden won by roughly 80,000 votes in 2020.\nWhat's more, the congressional district that includes Squirrel Hill features a primary Tuesday that is among the first electoral tests of sentiment on both sides of the conflict in Gaza and concerns over rising antisemitism in the U.S. Democratic Rep. Summer Lee, a 'squad'-aligned progressive critical of Israel's handling of the war and one of the first lawmakers to call for a cease-fire last year, will face Bhavini Patel, an Edgewood Borough Council member who has painted Lee's advocacy as harmful to Biden's re-election chances and out of step with her district.\n'We have communities that are hurting. The Jewish community is one of them. And there are people who are … not going to agree 100% on everything that you say,' Lee said in an interview, adding she has been 'very clear and very upfront' about her cease-fire position. 'I have condemned Hamas. We've worked with the families of hostages; we've done everything that I think is necessary to do that. And at the end of the day, we disagree.'\nA dozen Jewish voters in the district who spoke to NBC News, whether supporting Lee or Patel, almost universally said their votes in November would be driven by issues beyond Israel, saying that the Jewish electorate isn't a 'monolith' and that democracy, abortion rights and the economy weighed heavily on them.\nMost Jewish voters in Squirrel Hill — and nationally — align with the Democratic Party. A Pew Research Center survey released this month found 69% of Jews leaning Democratic, while 29% aligned Republican.\nBut Republicans aren't looking for a massive defection. GOP strategists and Republicans involved in Jewish outreach expressed confidence that Democratic divisions over Israel will help move a small but potentially significant number of Jewish voters into their camp in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona. They pointed to surveys showing President Donald Trump's improved performance among Jews in 2020, compared with his 2016 race, as evidence of a slow shift that could continue.\n'Before Oct. 7, most candidates would say this issue is so messy. … It's not necessarily something that I want to focus on in my campaign,' said Tali deGroot, political director for the liberal Jewish group J Street. 'And I would have said, ‘Absolutely, this isn't a voting issue for people we poll year after year.' And it's too soon to tell if it's going to be a voting issue. But not talking about it is not an option.'‘Playing with fire' In Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, the war and its impact at home took center stage last week at a campaign event where Lee launched her 'Jews for Summer' coalition.\nLee talked about 'how our liberation is tied together,' whether 'in western Pennsylvania or the West Bank.' She spoke about how the district still needs 'deep healing' following both the Oct. 7 attack and the killing of Jews at Tree of Life. And she framed her primary as a covert Republican effort to divide a multiethnic, cross-religious support base by using splits over Israel.\n'There are people who have to convince you that the only reason why I could believe in peace is because I actually hate some of our neighbors, not because we love each other,' said Lee, who overcame significant spending by groups aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group, when she narrowly won her first congressional primary in 2022.\nIsrael didn't have the salience it does now. Lee has accused the Israeli government of committing 'war crimes,\" called for an end to unconditional military aid to the country and joined a handful of other progressives in mid-2022, before the Israel-Hamas war, who voted against a GOP-led resolution that said Israel wasn't 'a racist or apartheid state.' She has also condemned Hamas' attack and repeatedly spoken out against antisemitism.\nOn Saturday, she joined 36 Democrats and 21 Republicans in voting against an aid package to the country, which passed overwhelmingly. She and Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., were the only Pennsylvania members to vote against it.\nHer early call for a cease-fire is now largely in step with Democratic voters, but Jewish leaders have expressed unease with how Lee and some of her allies have discussed the issue. Last month, more than 40 Pittsburgh-area rabbis wrote in a letter, after an earlier meeting with Lee, that she has 'continued to use divisive rhetoric' that the group has at times 'perceived as openly antisemitic.'\nTheir letter didn't describe that rhetoric, but it said Lee opposed House measures to condemn antisemitism and criticized her calls for an 'unconditional cease-fire from one side,' which they said 'devalues the lives and beliefs of one group.' They also called on her to return campaign contributions 'from people who have voiced virulently antisemitic sentiments.' In February, Lee canceled an appearance before the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations amid backlash over other speakers' antisemitic and homophobic remarks, which she condemned.\nKaren Hochenberg, president of a local Democratic club that has endorsed Patel, said Lee has lost considerable support in the Jewish community, including hers. While Hochenberg aligns with Lee on many issues, she and others have been 'hurt' by some of her votes and actions, and she said she wished Lee had been more vocal about the Hamas attack.\n'Many Jews now are starting to question where are we on the road map of intersectionality,' Hochenberg said. 'Jews are starting to really take a look at how comfortable we are and if we're going to send candidates to Congress who's going to be there and have the voice of the Jewish community in mind, as well.'\nJeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgher leading a new Jewish voter group, said the pushback Lee faces isn't so much about Israel but about what he called an unwillingness to meet with constituents who don't share her views.\n'She finds the individuals who agree with her already who are anti-Zionist, who are extremist or fringe of the left of politics, and she will hold them up on a pedestal while spreading things' that, Kazzaz said, make local Jews 'less safe.'\nBut overall, Lee is looking stronger in her district now than in her first run, even to some opponents. AIPAC-linked groups aren't getting involved in her primary this time. Lee has framed her campaign around efforts to counter MAGA Republicans and bring federal dollars to the district.\nJonathan Mayo, a Squirrel Hill resident co-leading the Jews for Summer coalition, told NBC News he aligns with Lee's position on Israel but emphasized that he's not a single-issue voter.\n'It is so important to speak out and show that there are members of the Squirrel Hill Jewish community who still very much support Summer Lee,' he said.\nPatel, meanwhile, is framing her challenge to Lee around who offers Biden the most support, hitting Lee for not criticizing activists and groups calling for 'uncommitted' votes against the president in Tuesday's primary.\n'It's essentially playing with fire,' Patel said in an interview, arguing it could boost Trump.\nLee allies have countered that anti-Biden GOP megadonors support Patel's campaign. An outside group boosting Patel recently disclosed that it received an $800,000 donation from right-wing billionaire Jeffrey Yass. (Patel said she 'denounces' Yass, calling any focus on him a distraction.)\nLee has said she is supporting Biden in the fall. She's endorsed by congressional Democratic leadership and by Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has become arguably the most staunchly pro-Israel Democrat in Congress. And in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, Biden shouted out Lee as someone 'who had my back.'\n'We're going to make sure that the person who's sitting in the White House is not going to be replaced,' Lee said at her event on a recent Sunday.\nSeveral attendees said they were casting anti-Biden protest votes Tuesday. But most said they would support him this fall.\nOne of them, Harry Hochheiser, said Biden 'is the only legitimate choice' against Trump. He said the divisions opened up in the Jewish community over the war have been devastating.\n'I don't think any of us enjoy these divisions,' Hochheiser, a University of Pittsburgh professor and pro-Palestinian activist voting uncommitted in the primary but backing Biden against Trump, said of tensions in the Jewish community over Israel.\n‘More salient than it has been' The fight for Jewish votes in Pittsburgh is only part of a bigger landscape. Across Pennsylvania, Republican Dave McCormick has put Israel at the forefront of his campaign against Democratic Sen. Bob Casey. Nationally, groups in both parties are preparing for what they say could be the largest investment ever made to court the Jewish vote at the presidential level.\nBiden's handling of the war is the main flashpoint. Initially, he was more deferential to Israel. But as the death toll mounted in Gaza and left-wing blowback intensified at home, he has sharpened his criticism of Israeli leadership, pushed for increased humanitarian aid and ramped-up efforts to reach a cease-fire agreement. Still, he hasn't gone as far as his critics to his left would like.\nAs for whether Republicans can pick up voters disaffected by the Democratic divide over Israel, Mark Mellman, president of Democratic Majority for Israel, said it's 'mostly noise' but cautioned 'there is a serious chance' depending how the coming months play out.\nJewish voters have 'been extraordinarily appreciative of the support that President Biden and Democratic leaders have given Israel over the course of this conflict,' he said. 'I hear from some people that is beginning to change as people perceive some change in the positions of those Democratic leaders. But look … Biden has been extraordinary.'\nA 2021 Pew Research Center survey found a wide split in partisanship among Jewish voters depending on which movement they aligned with. Orthodox Jews favored Republicans over Democrats by 75% to 20%, while 70% of Conservative Jews and 80% of Reform Jews backed Democrats.\nSam Markstein, national political director at the Republican Jewish Coalition, said much of the Jewish vote is based in states where Republicans have no shot at all, contributing to the gulf in support between Republicans and Democrats. Pointing to an Associated Press VoteCast survey after the 2020 election that found Trump improved on his 2016 performance among Jewish voters, Markstein predicts the Republican Jewish Coalition will make its 'largest investment at the top of the ticket ever' this cycle to target Jewish voters in battlegrounds.\n'That's where you're going to see the most success this year,' he said.\nSome other surveys had more positive trends for Democrats. This month's Pew survey found the share of Jewish voters who align with Democrats has increased 8 points since 2020.\nDan Siegel, who led Jewish outreach for Biden's 2020 campaign, said Jewish voters' foremost concerns are similar to those of any other voting group: the economy, health care and education.\n'I do think [Israel] may be a little bit more top of mind. But I also think at the end of the day, elections are a binary choice,' Siegel said, predicting Jewish voters 'are going to want that strong, steady hand, not an authoritarian demagogue who is unwieldy at best in a crisis.'\nTrump, who strongly favored Israel as president, has offered limited commentary on the war. Speaking last month with Israel Hayom, an Israeli newspaper, Trump said, 'You have to finish up your war. You have to get it done. We have to get to peace. We can't have this going on.'\nBiden's campaign has zoomed in on recent comments Trump has made about Jewish voters; he said on Real America's Voice that 'any Jewish person who votes for Biden does not love Israel and, frankly, should be spoken to.'\nIn a statement, Karoline Leavitt, Trump's national press secretary, slammed Democrats for caving in 'to the demands of far-left Palestinian extremists.\"\nAsked about Trump's comments on the war, Markstein said he believed Trump 'was just giving voice to the frustration of … people [who] want this to be concluded, with Israel defeating Hamas and rescuing the hostages.' On Trump's remarks about Jewish voters, Markstein said Trump 'was just trying to say in a Trumpian way … why haven't they been more vocal in their opposition to what their own leaders of their party are doing?'\nBack in Pittsburgh, Kipp Dawson, a Jewish civil rights activist backing Lee, said she would be horrified by Trump's re-election and expressed hope that Lee would be able to bring skeptical Democrats back on board with Biden this fall.\n'My sense is that things are extraordinarily in flux in this country right now,' she said. 'The big issue for November is who's going to come out to vote.'\nAt Pinsker's, the Cohens declined to say whom they'd support in next week's primary or the general election, though they said a number of Jews in Squirrel Hill were eager to back Patel.\n'The Jewish community really feels that if they don't take the stand now, [U.S. support for Israel] is not going to be assured,' Baila Cohen said. 'Everyone's very interested in getting actively involved and being part of the political scene in a way that doesn't always play out.'\nAllan Smith Emma Barnett",

            "excerpt": "The latest gun rights dispute concerns the Biden administration's effort to regulate gun-making kits the same way as commercially available firearms.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to consider whether the Biden administration can lawfully regulate so-called ghost guns — firearms that are made from kits available online that people can assemble at home.\nThe justices took up a Biden administration appeal in defense of regulations that a lower court invalidated. The provisions in question are currently in effect while litigation continues.\nIn August of last year, the Supreme Court allowed the regulation to be enforced on a 5-4 vote, with Chief Justice John Roberts and fellow conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the three liberal justices in the majority.\nThe federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, commonly known as ATF, issued the regulations in 2022 to tackle what it claims has been an abrupt increase in the availability of ghost guns. The guns are difficult for law enforcement to trace, with the administration calling them a major threat to public safety.\nThe rule clarified that the parts used to make ghost guns fit within the definition of 'firearm' under the federal Gun Control Act, meaning the government has the power to regulate them the same way it regulates firearms manufactured and sold through the traditional process.\nThe regulations require manufacturers and sellers of the kits to obtain licenses, mark the products with serial numbers, conduct background checks and maintain records.\nTexas-based U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor last year ruled in favor of Jennifer VanDerStok and Michael Andren, who own components they want to use to build guns. Plaintiffs also include gun rights groups and makers and sellers of ghost guns.\nAfter the Supreme Court allowed the regulation to remain in effect while litigation moved forward, the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals mostly ruled for the challengers.\n\"Because Congress has neither authorized the expansion of firearm regulation nor permitted the criminalization of previously lawful conduct, the proposed rule constitutes unlawful agency action, in direct contravention of the legislature's will,\" the ruling said.\nIf that decision were allowed to go into effect, \"anyone could buy a kit online and assemble a fully functional gun in minutes — no background check, records, or serial number required,\" Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in court papers.\n\"The result would be a flood of untraceable ghost guns into our nation's communities, endangering the public and thwarting law-enforcement efforts to solve violent crimes,\" she added.\nThe challengers agreed with the Biden administration that the Supreme Court should take up the case, citing its nationwide importance.\nTheir lawyers wrote that it is not the job of the ATF to expand the meaning of \"firearm\" under the Gun Control Act.\n\"If that definition has become obsolete or unsatisfactory in any way, that is an issue for Congress to address,\" they wrote.\nThe Supreme Court's conservative majority has backed gun rights in multiple cases, including the landmark 2022 ruling that for the first time recognized that the Constitution's Second Amendment includes a right to bear arms outside the home.\nThe court is currently weighing the scope of that decision in a case concerning whether people accused of domestic violence have a right to own firearms.\nThe ghost guns case, however, is on a separate legal question related to ATF's regulatory authority, not the right to bear arms.\nThe justices are set to decide a similar case in the coming weeks, a challenge to another ATF regulation that banned \"bump stocks,\" an accessory that allows semi-automatic rifles to be fired rapidly.\nLawrence Hurley",

            "excerpt": "The senator has outrun other members of her party in rural areas before. This November, she'll have to manage being on a ballot with Donald Trump.",
            "summary": "REEDSBURG, Wis. — In rural Wisconsin, dairy farmer Randy Roecker is at a breaking point — and he blames it partly on President Joe Biden, so is planning to vote for Donald Trump for a third time this November.\n'Farmers are hurting like you wouldn't believe, and I myself, I am to the point of throwing up my hands and saying I'm done,' said Roecker, who owns and operates Roecker's Rolling Acres in Loganville and cited inflation as straining his business for the last two years.\nBut while he's planning to vote on booting the Democratic president, Roecker's also planning to vote to keep his Democratic senator, Tammy Baldwin.\n'I support her all the way. I mean, no question,' Roecker said. 'And everybody I know — the farmers — everybody says that she's great for Wisconsin agriculture.'\nBaldwin is bracing for a tough re-election race against likely Republican nominee Eric Hovde, a multimillionaire and bank owner who loaned $8 million of his own money to his campaign in the first quarter of the year, according to FEC filings. But she has the advantage of incumbency, and has used it to often outperform other statewide Democrats in rural counties, even as the party as a whole has lost significant ground in rural America in recent decades.\nBaldwin is already pouring more effort into rural campaigning this year as she prepares for the challenge of sharing the ballot with one of the forces driving GOP margins in rural areas sky-high. Unlike her first two races for the Senate, in 2012 and 2018, Donald Trump will be running this November, too.\n'In Wisconsin, in rural America, I think a lot of people vote straight-ticket, either Republican or Democrat,' said Roecker, who sits on the board of directors for the National Dairy Board, Foremost Farms USA and Dairy Management Inc. 'And, you know, like I said, I don't know how many people go down through there like I do and check her separate.'\nRoecker said he didn't know much about Baldwin's Republican opponent, but Hovde's campaign said it plans to work across the state to tell voters that Baldwin is a 'rubber stamp for the Biden administration.' A new Marquette University Law School poll out Wednesday showed Baldwin running a single point ahead of Biden among likely voters and 3 points ahead of the president among registered voters. The likely voter results showed Baldwin and Hovde tied, while she had a small lead among registered voters.\n'When Tammy Baldwin's in Washington ... she's voting like a Washington Democrat,' said Ben Voelkel, senior adviser for the Hovde campaign. 'And she's not, you know, the same person that goes around and campaigns and shows up, you know, every fifth year to campaign.'\nWisconsin Democrats' rural campaign push Late last month, Baldwin sat around a kitchen table with Roecker and others from the Farmer Angel Network for a 90-minute discussion about farmers' mental health. The event was part of the senator's 'Dairyland' tour through 19 counties, none of them among Wisconsin's five most populated counties.\n'I think that there has been a real opportunity for me to be a champion for issues that I might not hear about if I only was going to the population centers of the state,' Baldwin told reporters at a stop at the New Glarus Brewing Co.\nThe 'Dairyland' tour is one example of a concerted effort by Wisconsin Democrats to court the rural voters who have increasingly rejected the party over the last few elections — as Wisconsin will again play a huge role in determining which party wins the White House and controls Congress. Ben Wikler, chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, calls rural voters 'essential to the Biden coalition' in 2024.\n'There's no path to victory without organizing in rural Wisconsin and across the country, as well as suburbs, cities and small towns and big towns,' he said. 'In a state like Wisconsin, where four of the last six presidential elections came down to 1 percentage point, you can't write anyone off or take anyone for granted.'\nWisconsin GOP Chair Brian Schimming calls the Democrats' efforts in rural Wisconsin a 'fool's errand' and says the Republican Party plans to focus on the economy as a 'constant reminder of the failure of the [Biden] administration' when making its case to rural Wisconsin voters.\n'You don't talk your way out of that,' Schimming said, speaking about the current economic situation. 'I mean, you can talk till you're blue in the face, but when people leave your talk or turn off your television ad or put down their smartphone, and then pull into a convenience store and pay, you know, a dollar and a quarter more than they're paying for gas four years ago, they get it.'\nDemocrats have an uphill battle in the state's rural areas, as their statewide victories have increasingly relied on wider margins in the state's most densely populated metro areas.\n'They have lost huge swaths of the rural/outstate vote in this state, and they are not going to get them back by running Tammy Baldwin around. They're just not,' Schimming said. 'And it's a problem endemic for the whole party out there.'\nChanging coalitions When Baldwin won a second Senate term in 2018, the 'blue wave' midterm during Trump's presidency, she increased her statewide margin by over 5 points, but she won seven fewer counties than in 2012, though she got larger margins in heavily populated counties.\n'Look, in a state like Wisconsin, a 50/50 battleground state, it is — you don't have to win every county,' Baldwin said at the campaign stop in New Glarus. 'But it is really critical that we get folks out to vote, we have the discussions and up the turnout in every community that you can.'\nSimilarly, in 2022, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers slightly increased his margin of victory from four years before but won fewer of the state's 72 counties. Democrats also narrowly lost Wisconsin's rural 3rd Congressional District after longtime Democratic Rep. Ron Kind retired, with the seat going to Republican Derrick Van Orden by just under 4 points. Republicans have also controlled both the 7th and 8th districts in northern Wisconsin since the 2012 election.\n'My county voted for Obama twice. And it was after the second Obama election that it started to shift,' said Peggy Fullmer, chair of the Democratic Party in Marquette County, about an hour north of Madison. 'You know, then all of a sudden, it's been really red ever since.'\nDemocratic organizers in rural areas are feeling the pressure.\n'It's like pulling hen's teeth to get votes for Democrats in our areas,' said Linda Wilkins, chair of the neighboring Green Lake County Democratic Party.\n'Every Democratic vote makes a difference, and we get a few more each time in these extremely difficult red areas,' Wilkins said of the work of Democratic organizers in rural Wisconsin. 'And without our votes, they wouldn't win either.'\nBut Wilkins thinks it's time for the Biden campaign to visit rural Wisconsin. 'They need to go and visit them and not just go to Milwaukee and Madison,' she said. Biden made trips to Milwaukee and Madison in recent weeks, but he visited Superior in January. First lady Jill Biden visited the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin's reservation last October.\nJoni Anderson, vice-chair of the Adams County Democratic Party and a coordinator of Democratic efforts across several rural counties, said she wishes the state party would give more support to candidates who run in rural areas.\nWikler said the state party will soon announce its largest-ever investment in state legislative races.\n'This is something that I've been really listening to — the feedback from rural county parties and rural Democrats,' Wikler said. 'We want to make sure that when somebody's the Democratic nominee, wherever they live in Wisconsin, they have the backing of our state party.\"\nFor farmers like Roecker, showing up means a lot, but it's not everything.\n'They just can't show up at the farm and do a photo op, you know what I mean?' he said, adding that farmers feel like elected officials 'don't care what's going on out here' as long as there's food in the grocery store.\n'It's a shame when farmers are on food stamps themselves and they produce food for 155 other people. And that's how broken the system is here,' Roecker said.\nSarah Dean",

How Trump has hobbled his legal team before the first witness is even called at his historic trial By Laura Jarrett For the better part of the last year, former President Donald Trump has sought to turn what would ordinarily amount to significant legal trouble into a political asset.\nFour indictments and one mugshot later, he's successfully managed to dodge any dip among his supporters. Yet now that he stepped into a no-frills Manhattan courtroom this week for the start of his first criminal trial, the legal downside of his political strategy has come into sharp view.\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know The rules of criminal procedure don't change, no matter the defendant, even for a former president. And the courtesies and customs recognized between seasoned prosecutors and defense lawyers begin to break down, if not completely collapse.\nIn a telling moment near the end of a long day in court Thursday, Trump's lead attorney, Todd Blanche, asked if he could get the names of the first three witnesses the prosecution intends to call. That's a routine and reasonable request. But the prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, rebuffed him.\nWhy? Because 'Mr. Trump has been tweeting about the witnesses,' Steinglass said. 'We're not telling them who the witnesses are. I'm sorry.'\nJudge Juan Merchan, who has been the subject of his own wave of attacks from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, then said: 'I can't fault the People for that.'\nThe issue came up again late Friday afternoon, and the prosecution agreed to turn over the name of the first witness to the defense on Sunday. But the implication remains: Trump's legal team is facing a distinct strategic disadvantage with less time to plan cross-examinations of the state's witnesses. In other words, instead of being able to focus all weekend on prioritizing the expected testimony of just a few witnesses, all are up for grabs.\nAnd it's all because Trump has been railing against multiple witnesses online, and has only ramped up his vitriol in recent days, notwithstanding a court order directing him not to do so.\nThis is the year the legal and political lives of Trump have been on a collision course. The only difference is, now the side that's feeling the burn is his own team.\nTrump trial latest: Jury selection completed during a tense day inside and outside the courtroom By Adam Reiss, Lisa Rubin and Dareh Gregorian Opening statements are set to begin next week in Trump's criminal trial after the final members of the jury were seated Friday, following a dramatic day in which two prospective jurors broke down in tears, an appeals court judge rejected the former president's request for a stay, and a man set himself on fire in front of the New York City courthouse.\n'We're going to have opening statements on Monday morning. This trial is starting,' Merchan said towards the end of the day, after successfully seating the remaining five alternate jurors that were needed.\nThe case — the first-ever criminal trial of a former president — will be heard by a panel of 12 jurors and a total of six alternates. It's expected to last roughly six weeks.\nThe five alternates ultimately selected Friday include an unemployed married woman who's into art and described herself as not political, an audio professional, a contract specialist, a clothing company executive and a construction company project manager. It took four days of jury selection to find the 18 jurors.\nAround the same time the judge declared 'we have our full panel' inside the courtroom in the early afternoon, a man set himself on fire outside the courthouse. A spokesperson for the NYPD said the man was in critical condition. He appears to have had pamphlets describing a conspiracy involving cryptocurrency that he threw around before setting himself ablaze, police said.\nRead more from the fourth day of the Trump trial here →\nVolodymyr Zelensky and Joe Biden in 2023 in Washington, D.C. Drew Angerer / Getty Images file A pivotal moment for Biden, Ukraine and Congress By Kristen Welker A pivotal moment has arrived for President Joe Biden, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and House Speaker Mike Johnson.\nCan the GOP-led House pass the aid Ukraine says it needs in its two-year-old war against Russia?\nIf it does, is it already too late to help?\nHow much longer does Ukraine need assistance?\nAnd how much is riding on the outcome of the 2024 election, given Trump's past opposition to this aid?\nThese are among the questions that I plan to ask Zelenskyy on Sunday when I interview him on 'Meet the Press.'\nThe congressional fight for Ukraine aid has also underscored an important point about the Biden presidency: It's been largely defined — and unsettled — by events overseas.\nIt began with the botched and deadly U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021.\nThen there was Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.\nAnd then came the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack in Israel, which has led to a six-month war.\nJust in the past week, we saw Iran launch missile strikes and drones at Israel, while Israel responded Thursday night by carrying out what appears to be a limited response inside Iran.\n'We don't want to see this escalate. ... We're not looking for a wider war with Iran. ... I think, you know, the coming hours and days will tell us a lot,' National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told me last Sunday.\nHow foreign affairs has defined Biden's presidency has carried over with Russia's invasion of Ukraine — and with the current congressional drama over whether the U.S. will continue to provide Ukraine with the funding it needs.\nAll of it creates a fraught backdrop as the 2024 race heats up.\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

            "excerpt": "The agenda is heavy on economics and lighter on cultural issues, carrying echoes of FDR's New Deal. It omits some issues that lack Democratic consensus, like \"Medicare for All.\"",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Top House progressives will unveil a sweeping agenda Thursday to lay down a marker for the policies they'll push next year if Democrats win the 2024 election, from a higher minimum wage and strengthening antitrust laws to new federal benefits for seniors on Social Security and parents raising kids.\nThe Congressional Progressive Caucus agenda, first shared with NBC News, doubles as a blueprint of political advice for how it believes President Joe Biden can win over progressives and young voters who are uninspired by his re-election bid ahead of a rematch with former President Donald Trump.\n'If the progressive base is not excited and enthusiastic — and if they don't feel like we are trying to earn their votes and that they are important — then I think the horrific idea of a second Donald Trump presidency could become reality,' Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the progressive caucus chair, said in an interview. 'We cannot afford to let that happen. And we won't.'\nThe seven-point agenda is heavily focused on economics and lighter on cultural issues, carrying echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. It begins with provisions to boost the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour by 2028 and pass the PRO Act to strengthen unions, as well as other provisions, such as guaranteeing overtime pay. It includes policies to reduce the cost of living — by capping child care costs at 7% of income for all families; expanding Social Security benefits by closing tax loopholes; adding dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare; and enacting a series of policies to protect renters and make housing more affordable.\n2028 and pass the PRO Act to strengthen unions, as well as other provisions, such as guaranteeing overtime pay. It includes policies to reduce the cost of living — by capping child care costs at 7% of income for all families; expanding Social Security benefits by closing tax loopholes; adding dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare; and enacting a series of policies to protect renters and make housing more affordable. 'It's really about worker power and raising wages and lowering costs for poor people, middle-class Americans and the working people across this country,' Jayapal said.\nThe five other planks are investments in education, including universal pre-K and kindergarten; aggressive clean energy standards to tackle climate change; 'making our democracy work' with federal voting rights mandates, Washington, D.C., statehood and elimination of the Senate filibuster; taking on corporations and monopolies; and 'advancing justice' though abortion rights, pro-LGBTQ measures, pro-immigrant policies and setting national policing standards.\nThe agenda is also notable for what's not included. 'Medicare for All,' a rallying cry of the left for years, is excluded. Foreign policy issues like Israel and Gaza, which have sparked fiery pro-Palestinian protests across the country, are also kept out. Jayapal said that's partly because the caucus decided to make it a domestic-issue-only blueprint and partly out of pragmatism — to focus more on unifying issues for Democrats and steer clear of the ones that divide them.\n'The way we came to this agenda is to say that we were going to put into this agenda things that were populist and possible ... and affected a huge number of people,' she said. 'We haven't taken a position on particularly Israel and Gaza in the progressive caucus, and so that's not on here.'\nA supermajority of the 103 lawmakers in the caucus weighed in on the agenda, and 98% supported it, a spokesperson said.\nMuch of the agenda will have no realistic chance of passage unless Democrats sweep control of the White House, the House and the Senate this fall. And Jayapal emphasized that, in addition, Democrats would need 50 senators ready to pierce the 60-vote filibuster rule to get around likely GOP opposition. That would be a herculean task, as Democrats face a daunting map in 2024 Senate races, defending a slew of seats in purple and red states.\n'We are assuming that this is an agenda for a Democratic president with a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House,' Jayapal said.\nProgressives have had a rough two years, having been marginalized after Republicans took control of the House and steered the agenda rightward. Biden has broken with the left on issues like tougher asylum laws and crime. Some prominent Democrats, like Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, have eschewed the 'progressive' label as conservatives have found success in associating it with the left's most divisive ideas. Gallego, who is running for the Senate in his purple state, quietly left the progressive caucus. The caucus recently missed an opportunity to elect one of its members to a rare open Senate seat in deep-blue California, with two of them running and losing.\nStill, Jayapal said she believes that if Democrats win the 2024 elections, the progressive caucus will be well-positioned to advance the ideas in its new agenda, as it did with it opening bid that shaped two of Biden's signature laws, the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act. She has sought to institute changes to make the caucus more cohesive. It recently raised its dues for members.\nSome of the provisions in the new agenda represent items in Biden's 'Build Back Better' agenda that were left on the cutting room floor because of the thin majorities. Others could spark intraparty disagreements, including a far-reaching liberalization of the immigration system with a path to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally. Yet other pieces resemble popular causes that progressives want Biden to get behind, like expanding Social Security and legalizing marijuana.\n'We have to excite our base. We have to show them what the path forward is — not just say, ‘This is the most important election of your life, and we expect you to vote.' I don't think that's going to turn people out. And so I think this agenda, really, speaks to the needs of poor people, working people, progressives across the country who want us to make that case to them,' Jayapal said. 'We are not seeing the momentum that we would like to see. We're going to have a tough election. ... We know we're going to have to put together that progressive coalition. And I think this is the thing that allows us to say, ‘Look, here's what we're fighting for.''\nSahil Kapur",

            "excerpt": "Biden's latest environmental announcements come as he is working to energize young voters for his reelection campaign.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is marking Earth Day by announcing $7 billion in federal grants for residential solar projects serving 900,000-plus households in low- and middle-income communities. He also plans to expand his New Deal-style American Climate Corps green jobs training program.\nThe grants are being awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency, which unveiled the 60 recipients on Monday. The projects are expected to eventually reduce emissions by the equivalent of 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and save households $350 million annually, according to senior administration officials.\nBiden's latest environmental announcements come as he is working to energize young voters for his reelection campaign. Young people were a key part of a broad but potentially fragile coalition that helped him defeat then-President Donald Trump in 2020. Some have joined protests around the country of the administration's handling of Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\nSenior administration officials said young Americans are keenly invested in the Biden climate agenda and want to actually help enact it. The Climate Corps initiative is a way for them to do that, the officials said.\nSolar is gaining traction as a key renewable energy source that could reduce the nation's reliance on fossil fuels, which emit planet-warming greenhouse gases. Not only is it clean, but solar energy can also boost the reliability of the electric grid.\nBut solar energy can have high costs for initial installation, making it inaccessible for many Americans — and potentially meaning a mingling of environmental policy with election-year politics.\nForty-nine of the new grants are state-level awards, six serve Native American tribes and five are multi-state awards. They can be used for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens.\nBiden is making the announcement at northern Virginia's Prince William Forest Park, about 30 miles southwest of Washington. It was established in 1936 as a summer camp for underprivileged youth from Washington, part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps to help create jobs during the Great Depression.\nBiden used executive action last year to create the American Climate Corps modeled on Roosevelt's New Deal. He is announcing Monday that nearly 2,000 corps positions are being offered across 36 states, including jobs offered in partnership with the North American Building Trades Unions.\nBiden has often used Earth Day as a backdrop to further his administration's climate initiatives. Last year, he signed an executive order creating the White House Office of Environmental Justice, meant to help ensure that poverty, race and ethnic status do not lead to worse exposure to pollution and environmental harm.\nHe has tried to draw a contrast with GOP congressional leaders, who have called for less regulation of oil production to lower energy prices. Biden officials counter that GOP policies benefit highly profitable oil companies and could ultimately undermine U.S. efforts to compete with the Chinese in the renewable energy sector.\nBiden will use his Virginia visit to discuss how 'a climate crisis fully manifest to the American people in communities all across the country, is also an opportunity for us to come together,' said White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi.\nHe said the programs can 'unlock economic opportunity to create pathways to middle-class-supporting careers, to save people money and improve their quality of life.'\nThe awards came from the Solar for All program, part of the $27 billion 'green bank' created as part of a sweeping climate law passed in 2022. The bank is intended to reduce climate and air pollution and send money to neighborhoods most in need, especially disadvantaged and low-income communities disproportionately impacted by climate change.\nEPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe said she was 'looking forward to these funds getting out into the community, giving people skills, putting them to work in their local communities, and allowing people to save on their energy bills so that they can put those dollars to other needs.'\nAmong those receiving grants are state projects to provide solar-equipped roofs for homes, college residences and residential-serving community solar projects in West Virginia, a non-profit operating Mississippi solar lease program and solar workforce training initiatives in South Carolina.\nThe taxpayer-funded green bank has faced Republican opposition and concerns over accountability for how the money gets used. EPA previously disbursed the other $20 billion of the bank's funds to nonprofits and community development banks for clean energy projects such as residential heat pumps, additional energy-efficient home improvements and larger-scale projects like electric vehicle charging stations and community cooling centers.\nThe Associated Press",

The Supreme Court will consider that question today when it weighs the constitutionality of multiple ordinances enacted by an Oregon town. An appeals court ruling said that several of the ordinances in the city of Grants Pass are prohibited under the Constitution's Eighth Amendment, which bars cruel and unusual punishment. The city ordinances in question bar sleeping or camping on publicly owned property, including sidewalks, streets, bridges and city parks. The key issue in the case is punishment, which can include fines of up to several hundred dollars and exclusion orders that bar people from public property.\nBut advocates for the homeless argue that the ordinances punish people for existing when they don't have anywhere else to go and do nothing to address the underlying issue of housing shortages.

            "summary": "China said it 'firmly opposes' the U.S. investigation into its maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries, calling the move a 'mistake on top of a mistake.'\nIn an official statement late Wednesday, China's ministry of commerce said the U.S. provides hundreds of billions of dollars in 'discriminatory' subsidies to its domestic industries, 'yet accuses China of adopting so-called ‘non-market practices.''\n'In fact, the development of China's industries is the result of companies' technological innovation and active participation in market competition,' the Chinese ministry said.\nOn Wednesday, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative initiated a probe into China's maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries, alleging that Beijing used 'unfair, non-market policies and practices' to dominate these sectors. Under the Trade Act of 1974, Section 301 seeks to address unfair foreign government practices impacting U.S. commerce.\n'By launching a new Section 301 investigation, the U.S. is making a mistake on top of a mistake,' the Chinese ministry said.\nBeijing called on the U.S. to 'respect multilateral rules' and vowed to 'take all necessary steps to resolutely defend its rights and interests.'\nThe investigation comes after five national labor unions launched a petition on March 12 requesting the U.S. to probe the policies and practices of China's maritime, logistics and shipbuilding sectors.\nU.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Katherine Tai has pledged to launch a 'full and thorough investigation into the unions' concerns.'\n'The allegations reflect what we have already seen across other sectors, where [China] utilizes a wide range of non-market policies and practices to undermine fair competition and dominate the market, both in China and globally,' she said, according to the USTR statement.\nPresident Joe Biden has also called on the USTR to triple tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports, in a bid to protect American industries.\n'Chinese policies and subsidies for their domestic steel and aluminum industries means high-quality U.S. products are undercut by artificially low-priced Chinese alternatives produced with higher emissions,' the White House said in a statement.\nIn an address to union workers in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, Biden accused China of 'cheating' in its steel trade practices.\n'They're not competing. They're cheating,' he said, adding that 'we've seen the damage here in America.'\n'The bottom line is that I want fair competition with China, not conflict.'\nDeborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Asia-based Hinrich Foundation, said the Section 301 investigation could be more significant than Biden's call for tariff increases on Chinese steel and aluminum imports.\nThe total amount of Chinese steel into the U.S. market is less than 1%, Elms told CNBC's 'Capital Connection' on Thursday.\nShe said the launch of a Section 301 investigation on shipbuilding 'is becoming more of an issue potentially.'\n'Now, that could be much more significant because it sets up the stakes for further retaliation by the U.S. against China, and then potentially by China against the U.S.,' Elms said.\n'As we head into a very tight election season, both parties [Democrats and Republicans] are competing in the U.S. to see who could be toughest on China.'\nSheila Chiang, CNBC",

            "excerpt": "House Speaker Johnson plans to package TikTok legislation with critical aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, and send it to the Senate. President Joe Biden vowed to sign it into law.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Legislation that could ban TikTok in the U.S. unless it cuts ties with its Chinese parent company is on a path to quickly get to President Joe Biden's desk and be signed into law.\nThe bill, which has the backing of Biden and key members of Congress, would allow the administration to ban the popular video-sharing app nationwide if it does not divest from China-based ByteDance within one year.\nA similar bill already passed the House in a lopsided, bipartisan 352-65 vote in March. But it's been stalled in the Democratic-controlled Senate, where Commerce Chairwoman Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., had been looking to put her mark on the bill.\nNow, the House is planning to package a slightly revised TikTok bill with billions in foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, all but guaranteeing the potential TikTok ban will become law.\nUnder the strategy used by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., the House plans to pass the combined foreign aid and TikTok package Saturday night and send it to the Senate, setting up a possible vote in the upper chamber as early as next week.\nIn recent weeks, Johnson's team worked closely with the White House on the package and Biden has already said he will swiftly sign into law the broader package, which also includes other GOP national security priorities like the REPO Act and sanctions against Iran. Biden backed the original TikTok ban legislation in the House as well, though his campaign has an account on the app.\nThe fast-track process for the TikTok bill comes as leaders in both parties, as well as national security officials, warn that the popular video-sharing app is a national security threat. There are worries that the Chinese Communist Party is using TikTok to access data and spy on its American users, spread disinformation and use the app's algorithms to manipulate elections, like the one in November.\nTikTok has argued that the bill amounts to a ban that would violate the First Amendment rights of its millions of U.S. users and harm small businesses that reach customers through the app.\n'It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,' TikTok said in a statement.\nDubbed the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the House TikTok bill creates a process for the president — through the FBI and intelligence agencies — to designate certain social media applications under the control of foreign adversaries, like China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, as national security threats.\nOnce an app is deemed a risk, it would be banned from online app stores and web-hosting services unless it severed ties with entities under control of the foreign adversary. The legislation specifically cites TikTok as a target.\nThe revised TikTok language would lengthen that divestiture period to nine months, up from the original six months, and would also allow the president to grant an additional, one-time 90-day extension.\nThat change satisfied Cantwell, the Senate Commerce chair, who had slow-walked consideration of the House-passed bill. She said the change was her recommendation.\n\"It assures that divestiture will more likely happen, so we think that's an important part,\" Cantwell told reporters Thursday, adding that other tweaks would have to be put off until later.\n\"They didn't put other language and so we could look at things down the road, but for now we support what they're doing,\" she added.\nWhile there is overwhelming bipartisan backing for the TikTok bill in both chambers, a handful of lawmakers have argued that the legislation would stifle free speech. Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., introduced an amendment that would strip the TikTok language out of the package.\n\"Banning TikTok is beating the same drum as other communist countries controlling what content we are able to see,' Mace said last month. 'Let's not give the government any more power to control social media.'\n'Let's not give the government any more power to control social media.' Progressive Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., who has more than 240,000 followers on TikTok, has led the opposition to the ban on Capitol Hill.\n\"A lot of people on the Hill seem to be ignoring that an outright ban of TikTok would hurt the livelihoods of a lot of working class people, many of whom are people of color,\" Bowman told NBC News.\n\"We need to protect people's constitutional rights of free speech and privacy. We need to pass comprehensive social media safety legislation that protects people on all platforms from Big Tech overreach,\" he said. \"Let's get to work on that, right now.\"\nScott Wong Kyle Stewart Rebecca Kaplan, Frank Thorp V, Kate Santaliz and Sahil Kapur contributed.",

            "excerpt": "How moderate Democrats joined with old enemies on the left to stop their own friends in the center from challenging Joe Biden.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Once upon a time, before the multimillion-dollar negative campaigns and allegations of running 'a conspiracy to commit extortion, voter intimidation, and other criminal behavior,' they were friends. Good friends.\nThe people who run No Labels and Third Way, two of the most prominent centrist organizations in Washington, had all come up together in the small world of Clinton-era center-left politics.\nNancy Jacobson, an early Bill Clinton hire and the founder of No Labels, helped raise the initial money and secure the necessary political blessings to start Third Way. The think tank was co-founded by Jon Cowan, whom Jacobson viewed as something of a mentee. Cowan, now Third Way's president, even signed the ketubah (the Jewish wedding contract) at Jacobson's wedding to Mark Penn, whose firm conducts No Labels' polls.\nThen came the 2024 election — and No Labels' decision to try to field a bipartisan 'unity ticket' against both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, backed by a reported budget of $70 million. Third Way, which may be centrist but is firmly Democratic, viewed this as a misguided, no-hope effort that could only spoil the election for Biden and help to re-elect Trump, with potentially disastrous consequences.\n\"There were deep personal stakes and relationships,\" Cowan said.\nA centrist civil war broke out in the C-suites and steakhouses of Washington and Manhattan. Like so many insider conflicts, it was deeply personal. There were betrayal, a double agent, a secret team of political operatives, some very unlikely allies — and a decisive victory for one side that left the other seething and bitter.\nEven some people close to No Labels acknowledge the campaign against it largely succeeded in its mission: dissuading any potential candidates from joining its ticket. But the cost, they say, will be a gaping wound at the center of what's left of American centrism.\n\"What does Third Way go back to?\" asked former Rep. Max Rose, a moderate New York Democrat who spoke to NBC News at Jacobson's request. \"Because it doesn't seem logical that an organization that considers itself a centrist policy organization randomly makes war on another organization like this.\"\nOr as Holly Page, a longtime moderate Democratic strategist who has worked for both groups but ended up in No Labels' camp put it of Third Way: 'They sold out the center so they could get a seat at the table with [former Biden chief of staff] Ron Klain.\"\nNo Labels was so incensed by what Page referred to as the anti-No Labels campaign's \"little fraternity games\" that the group lodged a complaint with the Justice Department. In a letter and an indignant news conference, they accused their old friends and their new allies of violating anti-racketeering laws, typically used to prosecute the mafia, by engaging in an \"unlawful conspiracy to subvert Americans' voting rights.\" There is no sign the Justice Department took any action on the compliant.\nThird Way and its allies, meanwhile, believe they're the real moderates here. They forged an actual bipartisan coalition of groups spanning Republicans to progressives to support a moderate Democratic president and to stop Trump, few people's idea of a moderate, whom they note No Labels praised as a \"problem solver\" during his 2016 campaign.\nthey're the real moderates here. They forged an actual bipartisan coalition of groups spanning Republicans to progressives to support a moderate Democratic president and to stop Trump, few people's idea of a moderate, whom they note No Labels praised as a \"problem solver\" during his 2016 campaign. 'You're not building a pro-Biden coalition; it's an anti-Trump coalition,' said Sarah Longwell, a Republican strategist and publisher of the conservative website The Bulwark, who supported the anti-No Labels effort. 'They absolutely would subtract people who, when push comes to shove, will vote for Joe Biden.'\nSimilar beginnings go separate ways In many ways, Third Way was an unlikely marshal for a No Labels counterstrike.\nBoth have long been dismissed by the left as stodgy corporatists and crypto-Republicans, and Third Way and No Labels exist in overlapping social circles, draw from similar funders and promote a common ideology. Third Way's previous campaigns took on the left, like when it fought progressive challengers in House primaries and tried to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., from winning the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.\n'Everybody in the centrist donor universe knew No Labels was doing this ticket, and everybody knew we were leading the opposition. You were on one side or the other,' Cowan said. 'And on the other side were some of the wealthiest people in the country and they were very angry at us.'\nThird Way lost a board member who sided with No Labels, and its leaders received word from several other unhappy donors that they should not expect another cent.\nBut while Third Way is fundamentally a Democratic organ, Jacobson has fallen (or been pushed, depending on whom you ask) out of the party's ranks, and now, No Labels views itself as the only group righteous and innovative enough to think outside the red-blue divide.\nStill, that familiarity meant Third Way spoke enough of No Labels' language to understand it and the people funding it — and how to reach the potential candidates it tried to recruit.\nAnd Third Way's moderate credentials helped it pick off potential No Labels allies, from its affiliated members of Congress to New York Times columnist David Brooks — the first major voice to hoist the unity ticket flag, only to later lower it — to the Clintons, the first family of Democratic centrism.\nThe former president and secretary of state hardly needed convincing of the threat a third-party campaign posed to Biden — Hillary Clinton had partly blamed the Green Party for her 2016 loss. So over lunch last July at their home in Chappaqua, New York, the Clintons, each joined by a top aide, talked through strategy with Cowan and Third Way Vice President Matt Bennett and vowed to help privately through their networks, according to three sources familiar with the meeting.\nBill Clinton joined the anti-recruiting team working against No Labels, making personal appeals to two prominent No Labels targets — Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican — that a third-party candidate could not win.\n'Pearl Harbored' Jacobson expressed anger, dismay and a sense of betrayal about Third Way's actions. 'We were Pearl Harbored,' she told supporters on a call, first reported by Puck.\nBill Clinton's lobbying effort was part of a broader campaign, which included dozens groups and prominent figures from the left, the center and the anti-Trump right, built around Third Way's 'war room.'\nAs Bennett put it in the first large gathering of the group, they had to 'build the idea in the minds of the political elites and the people that they talk to ... that if you get involved with this ... you're really risking your entire reputation and your legacy.'\nThird Way identified a long list of potential No Labels targets and set about finding common friends and allies between the potential candidates and the anti-No Labels coalition — people who would be seen as credible messengers. No Labels said 30 candidates passed. And by the end, the opposing coalition says, it reached every name that surfaced.\nThird Way leaders worked the Democratic side of the aisle after securing the blessing of party leaders in the White House, on Capitol Hill and in the Democratic National Committee. Meanwhile, its anti-Trump GOP allies and a clandestine team of 10 to 20 Republican operatives worked to 'surround' potential candidates with appeals, including survey research commissioned from former Rep. Liz Cheney's pollster, which concluded that they could not win running with No Labels.\nEvery potential candidate got a message tailored to their pressure points — their financial needs, their legacies, their future political prospects — from credible figures like local business leaders, clergy and former aides.\nThe chief goal was to make it impossible for No Labels to deliver the kind of big-name ticket it had promised.\n\"This was elite-driven,\" Bennett said. \"We knew they had enough donors that we couldn't deny them money. But we also knew enough about their donors to know they would expect a high-level candidate with a certain stature and would not accept someone who was not obviously credible.\"\nTheir targets included highly publicized suspects like Manchin, Hogan and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, though they were particularly worried about Bill Haslam, the former governor of Tennessee, because he is a billionaire who could self-fund.\nUnlikely allies It wasn't just anti-Trump Republicans like the Lincoln Project and former Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol who joined Third Way's efforts to brush back No Labels. Mainstream Democrats like Klain and former Democratic Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama were joined by leaders on the left who were used to warring, not collaborating, with Third Way.\nLunching with Bennett and working with his group helped 'humanize' people she had viewed as 'an enemy,' said Melissa Byrne, a left-wing activist who has often sparred with moderate Democrats over issues like student debt.\nByrne stressed — 'print this in all caps, bold,' she said — that she will go to war again with Third Way over policy if and when the time comes.\nBennett and the executive director of the liberal group MoveOn, Rahna Epting, ended up working together closely, playing up an odd-couple routine in a series of meetings on Capitol Hill, in the media and even in a public debate against No Labels strategists.\n'Our partnership with Third Way to come together and stop No Labels may be surprising to some, but it is a testament to how high the stakes are to keep Trump out of the White House,' Epting said.\nMeanwhile, some Republicans joined a campaign run by Democrats thanks to a similar calculation: Despite their policy differences, they were united by opposition to Trump and a shared belief that a third-party candidate could be a decisive boon to him.\n\"If you want to go experiment with third-party stuff, go crazy — just not this year,\" said Rick Wilson, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project, another cornerstone of the anti-No Labels campaign.\nThe broad coalition even included a secret member from the most unlikely of sources: No Labels itself.\nNo Labels did its best to keep the names of its delegates, donors and potential candidates under wraps. But the anti-No Labels campaign felt it had a good idea what was going on behind the curtain, thanks to a No Labels delegate who had grown disillusioned and started leaking to the other side.\nThe turncoat, whom Cowan and Bennett would only say was an 'average citizen' who initially joined No Labels out of a sincere belief in its mission, 'was incredibly helpful to us and did so at some personal sacrifice and risk,' Bennett said.\nPeople familiar with No Labels' thinking did not dispute that they had a leaker and said they were unaware of who it might be.\nBut No Labels allies say these kinds of cloak-and-dagger tactics highlight the hypocrisy, as they see it, of supposed champions of democracy and voting rights opposing another party's ballot access.\n'It's just discouraging to see partisans and politicians protecting their turf,' said former Rep. Joe Cunningham, a Democrat from South Carolina who worked with No Labels.\nRose, the former New York congressman, said No Labels' presidential ticket was always a long shot, so its opponents' victory lap is just \"someone seeing where things were going anyway and trying to claim credit.\"\n\"No Labels considered something that didn't really have legs and made a pretty noble decision to not pursue it,' he said.\nWhile No Labels' 2024 push is over, third-party candidates are still in the campaign, especially another ex-Democrat who could affect Biden's chances in November: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Countering Kennedy, though, will be a very different kind of conflict, even as Third Way remains committed to battling Biden's third-party foes.\nThird Way turned out to be the right group for the job of taking down No Labels. Can they take down an outsider too?\nAlex Seitz-Wald",

            "excerpt": "On the first day of the trial, Trump's campaign raised $1.6 million in small-dollar donations, a campaign official told NBC News.",
            "summary": "Donald Trump emerged from a Manhattan courtroom Monday ready for a fight.\nAfter day one of a trial that has Trump facing 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to a porn star, the former president stood in front of reporters ready to unleash a grievance-laced tirade that, at times, did not totally reflect reality but guaranteed he would continue to dominate the headlines even from court.\nHis immediate focus was Judge Juan Merchan's decision to not yet rule on whether Trump can attend his son Barron's May 17 high school graduation. Merchan did not say Trump could not go, but rather he was not yet ready to rule on the matter. Specifics aside, however, it gave Trump just enough to paint the picture for his supporters of a biased judge blocking a loving father from seeing his son's graduation.\n'My son is graduating high school, and it looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation,' Trump told the assembled group of reporters.\nIt's emblematic of how Trump has tried to control the narrative — an instinct that has defined his political career — even while stuck in a camera-less Manhattan courtroom. The judge has ordered Trump to attend court hearings in person, so it's a predicament he will find himself in at least four days a week for the foreseeable future as President Joe Biden continues to run a more traditional presidential campaign.\nThe false claim a judge was not allowing him to attend his son's graduation spread like wildfire in the conservative ecosystem, a conflagration helped by some of his top supporters with huge followings. Kari Lake called Merchan 'heartless & cruel.' Piers Morgan used a New York Post column to call the-decision-that-was-not 'disgusting.' Donald Trump Jr. called it 'pure evil.'\nFor millions of Trump supporters, the half-truth became the truth and a cause celebre for those eagerly looking to maintain the belief that the entire legal fight is an attempt by Democrats to get Trump locked up.\nThose sorts of distortions and fights about nearly every aspect of the trial dominated the first week, which focused on jury selection.\nIt was often reality versus Trump's version of it.\nThere were reports Trump may have fallen asleep in court, where cameras are not allowed in these types of cases. He responded forcefully on Truth Social that 'I was PRAYING not sleeping!!!'\nTrump had a misunderstanding about the jury selection process. It led him to post on Truth Social that the process is another example of 'ELECTION INTERFERENCE!'\nAnd Trump has broadly used a torrent of Truth Social posts and media interviews to paint a picture of both Merchan and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg as biased and out to get him, a sentiment that has been taken as gospel and amplified by conservative media.\nIn fundraising text messages, Trump has also told supporters that he left the courtroom, which at no point during the week happened except during scheduled court recesses or when court was over for the day.\n'I JUST STORMED OUT OF COURT!' read a fundraising text message from Trump's campaign. 'They think I'm finished, but I'LL NEVER SURRENDER!'\nTrump also tried to raise political cash off the claim that he has been blocked from attending Barron's graduation.\n'THEY ARE FORCING ME TO SKIP MY SON'S GRADUATION,' Trump's campaign texted. 'I'LL BE IN COURT.'\n'Heartless thugs,' it continued.\nThe trial-focused fundraising efforts have been breaking through the noise.\nOn the first day of trial, Trump's campaign raised $1.6 million in small-dollar donations, a campaign official told NBC News. Trump raised that much online on only three days in the first three months of 2024, according to a recent campaign finance filing from WinRed, the Trump campaign's online donation platform. Each of those three days came toward the end of March.\n\"Crooked Joe Biden and the Democrat's entire strategy to defeat President Trump is to confine him to a courtroom and unconstitutionally silence him throughout this sham Biden trial,\" said Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. \"Polling shows the American people see right through the Stalinist tactics employed by Crooked Joe and his allies.\"\n\"President Trump and his team will continue fighting for truth in the courtroom, while working to earn votes on the campaign trail,\" she added.\nMuch of the nation's attention is focused on the historic nature of an ex-president on trial, a saturation that has helped Trump continue his unmatched ability to get and retain attention regardless of the specific situation — which, in this case, is being stuck in court facing unflattering revelations about his personal life and accusations about trying to hide the information to get elected.\n'I don't think any of it matters. He totally rewrote the rules,' said a longtime Republican operative granted anonymity to speak freely about Trump's week-one performance. 'There are between 75-80 million people who will vote for him because he is a scrappy fighter. Working class folks see him as a billionaire bubba.'\nThe entire episode sets up a split screen of a former president mired in legal fights and stuck in court and an incumbent president checking all the boxes of what would be considered a traditional presidential campaign. Biden has a significant fundraising advantage and continues to hold in person campaign rallies, most recently a swing through Pennsylvania, including events in his hometown of Scranton, where he attacked Trump on a range of issues — but noticeably did not mention his legal woes. Biden's campaign has previously said it would avoid directly taking shots at Trump's legal problems to try and avoid the perception of a weaponized Justice Department.\nBeyond fundraising text messages, Trump's political operation has continued to work in the background. On Wednesday — the trial's off day — Trump had dinner with Polish President Andrzej Duda at Trump Tower in New York, and on Saturday, he is set to hold a rally in North Carolina, a key swing state.\nTrump has also installed top allies to lead the Republican National Committee, which has generally been focused on the more basic types of political blocking-and-tackling as the presidential nominee is likely to be stuck in courtrooms for most of the 2024 election cycle. Including the current trial, Trump faces four separate criminal indictments and a handful of civil lawsuits, some of which will continue to play out through November.\n\"We are getting a lot of data being shared with us to help us register and engage voters,\" an RNC member said.\nTrump has also used post-trial campaign stops to attract attention, including a Tuesday visit to a New York bodega. Trump at times tried to use the stop to focus on the rising cost of consumer goods and crime, which have been two policy themes of his presidential campaign, but the focus inevitably turned to his trial.\nTrump was asked what he thought about the seven jurors who had been selected as of Wednesday — the full 12-member jury was chosen Thursday — and he was blunt that the outcome would drive his assessment.\n'I'll let you know in about two months,' Trump said of the trial's likely timeline.\nMatt Dixon",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The Senate voted to reauthorize a powerful surveillance tool the U.S. government describes as critical to combating terrorism, after defeating efforts by civil liberties advocates on the left and right to rein it in.\nto reauthorize a powerful surveillance tool the U.S. government describes as critical to combating terrorism, after defeating efforts by civil liberties advocates on the left and right to rein it in. The vote of 60-34 sends the bill to President Joe Biden, who has championed it. The legislation extends Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, for two more years.\nThe final vote came after the Senate defeated six amendments from progressive and conservative senators who said the spying powers are too broad and demanded protections for Americans' civil liberties and privacy. The Biden administration and FISA supporters had warned that even a brief lapse could have a detrimental impact on the intelligence-gathering process.\nSenators just missed the midnight deadline to reauthorize the FISA Section 702 statute but voted to reauthorize it minutes later. Had any amendments been adopted, the bill would have been sent back to the House, potentially forcing a lengthy lapse of the law.\n'In the nick of time, bipartisanship has prevailed here in the Senate,' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said.\n'It wasn't easy, people had many different views, but we all know one thing: letting FISA expire would have been dangerous. It's an important part of our national security to stop acts of terror, drug trafficking, and violent extremism,' Schumer said on the Senate floor. 'Thank you to all my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their good work in getting this done.'\nThe House passed a two-year FISA renewal last week after defeating, by the slimmest of margins, an amendment to require a warrant to search through the communications of Americans as part of data collected while surveilling foreigners. Senators delayed a vote for days by pushing for amendments to make changes to the bill.\nThe bill's passage came on the heels of a pitched battle between the U.S. intelligence community and an unusual coalition of progressive and conservative civil liberties advocates, who argued that the powers are too expansive and impinge on the privacy of Americans.\n'It's important that people understand how sweeping this bill is,' said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Intelligence Committee and outspoken proponent of privacy protections. 'Something was inserted at the last minute, which would basically compel somebody like a cable guy to spy for the government. They would force the person to do it and there would be no appeal.'\nIn a rare break with Schumer and Biden, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the president pro tempore, opposed the bill, saying: 'I have strong concerns that this expansion of FISA Section 702 authorities would allow for increased abuse and misuse of the law — infringing on the rights of Americans here at home.'\nSenate Intelligence Committee Chair Mark Warner, D-Va., pushed back on that and other criticisms of a House amendment added to the FISA reauthorization bill, arguing that it 'is narrowly focused on a significant intelligence gap,' but some members like Wyden worry it could be abused.\n'Contrary to what some have been saying, it expressly excludes coffee shops, bars, restaurants, residences, hotels, libraries, recreational facilities and a whole litany of similar establishments,' Warner said on the Senate floor Wednesday. 'It also absolutely would not, as some critics have maintained, allow the U.S. government to compel, for example, a janitor working in an office building in Northern Virginia to spy for the intelligence community.'\nWarner said that allowing FISA to expire would have put the U.S. in 'uncharted territory' as companies who work with the government to provide intelligence might have stopped doing so without a reauthorization.\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said that '60% of the president's daily brief is composed of 702-derived materials, so this is absolutely critical.'\nFrank Thorp V Sahil Kapur Ryan Nobles Rebecca Kaplan contributed.",

            "summary": "The Biden administration sent about 50 Haitians back to their country on Thursday, authorities said, marking the first deportation flight in several months to the Caribbean nation struggling with surging gang violence.\nThe Homeland Security Department said in a statement that it 'will continue to enforce U.S. laws and policy throughout the Florida Straits and and the Caribbean region, as well as at the southwest border. U.S. policy is to return noncitizens who do not establish a legal basis to remain in the United States.'\nAuthorities didn't offer details of the flight beyond how many deported Haitians were aboard.\nThomas Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data, said a plane left Alexandria, Louisiana, a hub for deportation operations, and arrived in Cap-Haïtien, Haiti, after a stop in Miami.\nMarjorie Dorsaninvil, a U.S. citizen, said her Haitian fiancé, Gerson Joseph, called in tears from the Miami airport Thursday morning to say he was being deported on a flight to Cap-Haïtien with other Haitians and some from other countries, including the Bahamas.\nJoseph lived in the U.S. more than 20 years and has a 7-year-old U.S. citizen daughter with another woman. He had a deportation order dating from 2005 after losing an asylum bid that his attorney, Philip Issa, said was a result of poor legal representation at the time. Though Joseph wasn't deported previously, his lawyer was seeking to have that order overturned.\nJoseph was convicted of theft and burglary, and ordered to pay restitution of $270, Issa said. He has been detained since last year.\nDorsaninvil said her fiancé has 'nobody' in Haiti. 'It is devastating for me. We were planning a wedding and now he is gone,' she said.\nMore than 33,000 people fled Haiti's capital in a span of less than two weeks as gangs pillaged homes and attacked state institutions, according to a report last month from the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration. The majority of those displaced traveled to Haiti's southern region, which is generally peaceful compared with Port-au-Prince, which has an estimated population of 3 million and is largely paralyzed by gang violence.\nHaiti's National Police is understaffed and overwhelmed by gangs with powerful arsenals. Many hospitals ceased operations amid a shortage of medical supplies.\nThe U.S. operated one deportation flight a month to Haiti from December 2022 through last January, according to Witness at the Border. It said deportation flights were frequent after a camp of 16,000 largely Haitian migrants assembled on the riverbanks of Del Rio, Texas, in September 2021 but became rare as fewer Haitians crossed the border illegally from Mexico.\nHaitians were arrested crossing the border from Mexico 286 times during the first three months of the year, less than 0.1% of the more than 400,000 arrests among all nationalities. More than 150,000 have entered the U.S. legally since January 2023 under presidential powers to grant entry for humanitarian reasons, and many others came legally using an online appointment system at land crossings with Mexico called CBP One.\nHomeland Security said Thursday that it was 'monitoring the situation' in Haiti.' The U.S. Coast Guard repatriated 65 Haitians who were stopped at sea off the Bahamas coast last month.\nHaitian Bridge Alliance, a migrant advocacy group, urged a halt in deportation flights to Haiti, saying Thursday that the U.S. was 'knowingly condemning the most vulnerable, who came to us in their time of need, to imminent danger.'\nWith Republicans seizing on the issue in an election year, the Biden administration has emphasized enforcement, most notably through a failed attempt at legislation, after record-high border arrests in December. Arrests for illegal crossings dropped by half in January and have held pretty steady since then after Mexico stepped up enforcement south of the U.S. border. Biden says he is considering executive action to halt asylum at the border during times when illegal crossings reach certain thresholds.\nThe Associated Press",

Tammy Baldwin fights to maintain appeal in Wisconsin's Trump country By Sarah Dean REEDSBURG, Wis. — Dairy farmer Randy Roecker is at a breaking point — and he blames it partly on President Joe Biden, so is planning to vote for Donald Trump for a third time this November.\n'Farmers are hurting like you wouldn't believe, and I myself, I am to the point of throwing up my hands and saying I'm done,' said Roecker, who cited inflation as straining his business for the last two years.\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know But while he's planning to vote on booting the Democratic president, Roecker's also planning to vote to keep his Democratic senator, Tammy Baldwin.\n'I support her all the way. I mean, no question,' Roecker said. 'And everybody I know — the farmers — everybody says that she's great for Wisconsin agriculture.'\nBaldwin is bracing for a tough re-election race against likely Republican nominee Eric Hovde, a multimillionaire and bank owner, in the evenly divided Wisconsin, one of a handful of states that will determine which party controls the Senate. But she has the advantage of incumbency, and has often outperformed other statewide Democrats in rural areas, even as the party as a whole has lost significant ground in those regions in recent decades.\nBaldwin is already pouring more effort into rural campaigning this year as she prepares for the challenge of sharing the ballot with one of the forces driving GOP margins in rural areas sky-high. Unlike her first two races for the Senate, in 2012 and 2018, Donald Trump will be running this November, too.\nLate last month, Baldwin sat around a kitchen table with Roecker and others from the Farmer Angel Network for a 90-minute discussion about farmers' mental health. The event was part of the senator's 'Dairyland' tour through 19 counties, none of them among Wisconsin's five most populated counties.\n'I think that there has been a real opportunity for me to be a champion for issues that I might not hear about if I only was going to the population centers of the state,' Baldwin told reporters at a stop at the New Glarus Brewing Co.\nRead more →\nWhy you shouldn't discount voters' interest in RFK Jr. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Mario Tama / Getty Images Analysis by Chuck Todd What happens when an electorate wants change but there's no obvious change candidate on the ballot?\nThis question popped into my head after I watched one of the fascinating monthly focus groups organized by Rich Thau, the president of the research group Engagious, with the latest edition convening Pennsylvania voters who voted once for either Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton and once for Donald Trump.\nThe headline-grabber for this month's check-in was the surprising level of interest in Robert F. Kennedy Jr. among these swing voters. In some ways, this shouldn't be a surprise. These voters are by definition not hard partisans, and they certainly aren't pleased with either major party, as they've been comfortable voting against both of them over the last two elections.\nAs I wrote months ago, there was always going to be a moment in this campaign cycle when both major parties had finished their nominating processes and selected Biden and Trump — and yet the public wasn't satisfied with that outcome. We are at that moment.\nWith no mainstream third-party alternative available for now, that vacuum is being filled by Kennedy. For many voters, one can tell, he's simply a famous name filling a void. You can hear the lack of knowledge many of these Pennsylvania voters had about Kennedy other than his name, and those who knew something about him knew only a few things. Moreover, it was clear that his best asset was the fact that his last name was neither Trump nor Biden.\nWatching the initial interest in Kennedy's candidacy among these voters serves as a reminder that there was a powerful opportunity for a true potential unity ticket — not one that professed 'centrism' per se, but one that promised to take a partisan timeout for four years and attempt to focus on hard choices to solve hard problems, like immigration.\nBut given the stakes of this election, it has also been clear to me that while an opening exists with the true middle-of-the-road or less partisan crowd, the lane is very narrow. And unless partisans from one or both parties also wanted an alternative, there really wasn't a path to victory.\nBut there is a path to relevancy.\nRead more from Chuck here →\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

            "summary": "Hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of frozen Russian government assets are sitting in banks across the U.S. and Europe and on Saturday a vote is expected in the House of Representatives that would pave the way for President Joe Biden to confiscate billions of them and hand it over to Ukraine.\non Saturday a vote is expected in the House of Representatives that would pave the way for President Joe Biden to confiscate billions of them and hand it over to Ukraine. 'Somebody has to pay for reconstruction,' said former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, a proponent of using the Russian assets to help Ukraine, in an interview Friday. 'And I think it should be Putin, not the American people.'\nThe REPO Act, which would authorize Biden to confiscate the frozen Russian assets in U.S. banks and transfer them to a special fund for Ukraine, is part of the foreign aid package that has been stalled for months in the House. More than $6 billion of the $300 billion in frozen Russian assets are sitting in U.S. banks. Most of the $300 billion are in Germany, France and Belgium.\nOn Wednesday, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson released the package which would include tens of billions of dollars in aid for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan.\n'I'm going to a allow an opportunity for every single member of the House to vote their conscience and their will on this,' Johnson told reporters, defending his decision to allow the vote to go forward Saturday.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and his government invested heavily in the euro and the dollar over the years to keep the ruble stable, planting some $300 billion worth of foreign currency reserves.\nBut in early 2022, following Putin's invasion of Ukraine, all of the Group of Seven (G7) countries including the U.S., U.K., Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan banded together and froze all of the $300 billion dollars of Russian foreign currency reserves held in banks in those countries, most of the money in Europe.\n'The Russians were surprised when, right after the war started, the Europeans took the exact same measures as the United States, freezing all of the reserves that were there and the Japanese did the same, which is why most of Russia's reserves today are frozen in western banks,' said Chris Miller a professor at the Fletcher School at Tufts University.\nThe idea to confiscate the Russian assets emerged last year and has been hotly contested by economists and foreign policy experts.\nIn a recent op-ed in the New York Times, contributing opinion writer Christopher Caldwell argued that it's a 'terrible idea' to confiscate the Russian funds because other countries might stop investing in the U.S. which could negatively affect the economy in the long run.\n'This could weaken the dollar's status as the main global reserve currency. The dollar is probably the most valuable strategic asset the United States has,' Caldwell argued.\nMcFaul, whose been lobbying for the REPO Act for months, clapped back at Caldwell's assertion and said the use of Russian assets for Ukraine would send an important message to autocratic nations around the world.\n'There are those that say, 'Well, this will hurt the dollar. It's bad for our reputation.' I have a pushback to that. I don't want criminals investing in American Treasury bonds,' McFaul said.\nOne of the diplomatic challenges would be to convince the other G7 countries to do the same. While the U.K. is on board with the idea, France and Germany have been reticent.\n'We're making good progress in how to access that funds on an agreed basis that I think we can take forward to the G7,' U.K. foreign minister David Cameron told reporters April 9.\nAmid the diplomatic maneuverings, one group in the background has been persistently applying pressure on members of Congress, the White House and G7 countries to move forward with the idea of confiscating the funds.\nmembers of Congress, the White House and G7 countries to move forward with the idea of confiscating the funds. The Renew Democracy Initiative, a Washington DC-based nonprofit organization promoting democracy and American interest overseas sent a letter Friday urging Majority Leader Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to work together to get the REPO Act passed.\n'Your leadership through legislative action will increase the likelihood that the administration does what is necessary to confiscate Putin's billions,' wrote RDI Chairman Garry Kasparov and RDI CEO Uriel Epshtein.\nIn an interview Friday, Epshtein said he believes it will take U.S. action to bring about a G7 collaboration to confiscate the funds.\n'Other G7 countries will only act to confiscate Russian assets if the U.S. leads,' said Epshtein.\nAnna Schecter Natasha Lebedeva Matt Bradley",

            "summary": "Three deepfake-detection software experts testified to the Senate's subcommittee on privacy, technology and the law Tuesday about how Congress can regulate the artificial-intelligence space, particularly the rise of malicious deepfakes.\nDeepfakes are misleading audio, video or images that are created or edited with AI technology.\nIn January, deepfake audio that impersonated President Joe Biden telling Democrats not to vote in the New Hampshire primary was sent to thousands of voters in a robocall. Other deepfakes use AI to \"undress\" real photos of women and girls, juxtaposing their real faces with fake nudity. Both types of deepfakes were discussed during Tuesday's hearing, which focused on disinformation in the 2024 election cycle.\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., chairman of the committee, said that Congress' proposed regulatory framework would require independent testing of AI technology before it is released to the public, along with potential penalties.\n'We should make no mistake, the threat of political deepfakes is real, it's happening now,' he said. 'It's not science fiction coming at some point in the future, possibly or hypothetically. Artificial intelligence is already being used to interfere with our elections, sowing lies about candidates and suppressing the vote.'\nZohaib Ahmed, CEO and co-founder of Resemble AI; Ben Colman, CEO and co-founder of Reality Defender; and Rijul Gupta, CEO of DeepMedia, testified at Tuesday's subcommittee hearing.\nEleven states have passed laws banning deepfake election interference, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. Other states have passed legislation that creates civil litigation opportunities for victims of deepfake sexual abuse. But proposed federal legislation around both issues has stalled in the House and Senate without a vote, which Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, urged both party leaders to schedule.\n\"The danger of this technology without guardrails or safety features is becoming painfully apparent,\" Hawley said. \"Let's not allow these same companies that control the social media technology in this country, that control the news in this country, to also now use AI to further their hold on this country and the political process.\"\nIn the case of the New Hampshire Biden robocall, NBC News reported that the voice-cloned audio was created by a street magician who had ties to a rival Democratic campaign. The audio was created with software from ElevenLabs, which anyone can access and use.\nNBC News also reported that audio created with ElevenLabs contains a hidden watermark — watermarking technology has been proposed by numerous big tech companies as a solution to deepfakes — but in the process of creating the robocall, the watermark was stripped from the audio that primary voters received.\n\"Anybody with a Google search and internet connection can make anything as entertaining and dangerous as they can imagine,\" said Colman of Reality Defender. \"We've seen time and time again, they just aren't going to follow the rules.\"\nKat Tenbarge",

            "excerpt": "But behind every scowl, whisper or even yawn, Trump's team sees a clear message the presumptive GOP nominee has the opportunity to get across: Defiance.",
            "summary": "Donald Trump has spent most of his adult life seeking the limelight. Inside a frigid New York City courtroom this week, a closed-circuit camera provided arguably the brightest light he's stood before.\nNot even during his jaw-dropping presidency nor at his raucous rallies has Trump's every move been so meticulously tracked as during his initial appearances in Manhattan for the start of his hush money trial. Every smirk, turn, stare and scoff he made in the courtroom was chronicled by reporters and blasted out to the world to offer even a glimpse or small insight into how he was handling developments in the case — the first criminal trial ever involving a former president.\nBut behind every scowl, whisper or, yes, even yawn, Trump's team sees a clear message the presumptive GOP nominee has the opportunity to get across: Defiance. The aim? Convince the American people that the 34 counts of falsifying business records he faces are a sham to harm his electoral odds this fall.\n'President Trump proved he will remain defiant in the face of this unprecedented political lawfare, and it is clear that his support from the American people will only grow as they watch Joe Biden, [Manhattan District Attorney] Alvin Bragg, and the Democrats putting on this bogus show trial six months before the election,' said Karoline Leavitt, a Trump spokesperson.\nThe central thesis of the charges, as Bragg alleges, is that Trump falsified records to conceal that he reimbursed his former lawyer Michael Cohen for the $130,000 paid to adult film actor Stormy Daniels just prior to the 2016 presidential election — a move made to preemptively silence her from alleging that she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. (Trump denies sleeping with Daniels but has acknowledged repaying Cohen, who pled guilty in 2018 to federal campaign finance charges related to the payment).\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to the charges and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison.\nMost of the week's court proceedings featured jury selection, with Trump listening as prospective jurors were questioned about their media diet, opinions on Trump's presidency and ability to judge him fairly. Some were even pushed on past social media posts, such as one possible alternate juror who was questioned about a 2020 social media post where he called Trump 'the devil and a sociopath.' (He was dismissed.)\nIn Manhattan, a New York City borough he lost by 70 points in 2020, Trump didn't find many of the jurors' answers satisfactory, and at multiple points stared down individuals. Nevertheless, a full jury and alternate jurors were selected, with Trump's ears perking up when candidates referenced watching Fox News or otherwise making comments he viewed favorably.\nHe crossed his arms Friday, muttering to an attorney seated beside him when one prospective juror described him as seemingly 'very selfish and self-serving.' But Trump smiled when the prosecution noted to jurors that some witnesses they will call 'have what you might consider to be some baggage.'\nTrump was admonished by Judge Juan Merchan in court Tuesday for his behavior toward the prospective jurors, with Merchan telling Trump and his lawyer Todd Blanche: 'I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom. I want to make this crystal clear.'\nMerchan said he heard Trump say something in the direction of a juror and that he had been 'muttering' and 'gesturing' toward her.\nBut nothing from the week garnered more attention than Trump looking as if he was dozing off, closing his eyes for extended periods, prompting speculation he had fallen asleep. This was not a single occurrence, he sat with his eyes closed at least once every day he was in court.\nTrump ignored a hallway questions about whether he was napping, but did post to his Truth Social platform on Friday that the trial, which could go on for weeks, 'is a Long, Rigged, Endurance Contest, dealing with Nasty, Crooked People, who want to DESTROY OUR COUNTRY.'\nBiden's campaign seized on the possible snooze, poking fun at Trump. The campaign seemed to take particular pleasure in calling him 'Sleepy Don,' after years of Trump, 77, jabbing Biden, 81, as 'Sleepy Joe.'\nIn a statement, Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer took a dig at Trump for appearing to get some shut-eye but otherwise did not address the former president's actions in court, instead touting the sitting president's tour of Pennsylvania this week — pointing to his rally with steelworkers and stops at popular Keystone State convenience chains Sheetz and WaWa.\n'Our campaign and the president are focused on the American people — not Donald Trump's trials and tribulations,' Singer said. 'We're also not sleeping on the fact that campaigns are won by the candidate who remains focused on fighting for the American people — not distracted by their own grievances or pursuit of revenge and retribution.'\n'We are proud of the week we had,' Singer continued, 'you'll have to ask the Trump campaign if they are proud of theirs.'\nBut Trump's campaign sees the spotlight on his court appearances as a boon, expressing optimism that the difficult jury selection process will wake up voters to the overarching points Trump and allies have made about the case against him: That it's illegitimate. What's more, the endless media coverage Trump received this week eclipsed Biden's much-heralded trip across a key battleground state this week, another win in team Trump's eyes.\nTrump has been able to be more voiceful outside of court, posting to his Truth Social platform his belief that he is being 'railroaded' or lamenting the case as 'ridiculous' when addressing the press this week. (He also echoed concerns from others of how 'freezing' the courtroom was.)\n'Donald Trump has made clear that the Bragg indictment is politically motivated,' Garrett Ventry, a Trump-aligned GOP strategist, said. 'His stone coldness in court shows his defiance to the case, and his creative press gaggles outside of court enforce that strategy. Never before have a presidential candidate successfully turned indictments into bumps in the polls, until Trump.'\nThere have been reminders that Trump is not able to act the same inside court as out. At one point on Thursday, Trump pulled out his phone while seated at the defense table and appeared grumpy after his attorney told him to put it away.\nUltimately, much of the proceedings have been mundane. That same day, Trump yawned as Merchan read through jury instructions. For the most part, Trump appears resigned to his new reality: Court appearance after court appearance for weeks to come.\nAllan Smith Katherine Doyle and Natasha Korecki contributed.",

            "excerpt": "Republicans are publicly dismissing concerns about fundraising, saying their House candidates can remain competitive with Democrats.",
            "summary": "Republicans have sounded the alarm in recent years that Democrats are overwhelming their candidates in fundraising. And despite making some improvements last year, some of the most vulnerable House Republicans are once again falling behind their Democratic opponents.\nDemocratic candidates outraised Republicans in almost every one of the most competitive seats in the race for the House, according to new fundraising reports filed this week, a setback for Republicans who had been hoping their candidates were turning a corner.\nMoney alone doesn't determine winners and losers, especially in a presidential cycle where most voter attention will be focused on the top of the ticket. And Republicans expect their candidates and outside effort to be well-funded. But as Democrats need a net gain of just four seats to retake control of the House, their incumbents and challengers entered April in a significantly better financial position than their Republican rivals.\nRepublicans admit the fundraising gap isn't ideal, but they're tamping down concerns — at least publicly\n'Our swing-district incumbents continue to stack the cash they'll need to beat their extreme challengers,' National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Will Reinert said in a statement.\nThe latest fundraising reports, spanning the first three months of the year, also come as Republicans navigate life without an experienced prolific fundraiser as speaker after Kevin McCarthy's ouster (and with current Speaker Mike Johnson fighting continual intraparty threats to his leadership).\nTen of the 11 Republican incumbents in races rated as 'toss ups' by The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter were outraised by at least one Democratic challenger. Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer was the only GOP incumbent in that category to lead her district in fundraising.\nRepublican incumbents who were outraised include: Arizona Reps. David Schweikert and Juan Ciscomani; California Reps. John Duarte, David Valadao, Mike Garcia and Ken Calvert; New Jersey Rep. Tom Kean Jr.; and New York Reps. Mike Lawler, Marc Molinaro and Anthony D'Esposito.\nIn races against Schweikert, Garcia, Calvert, Lawler and Molinaro, a Democratic candidate also finished the first quarter of 2024 with more cash on hand than the incumbent.\nAnd Republican candidates were also outraised in two other 'toss-up' seats being vacated by Democratic incumbents in Michigan.\nDemocrats also showed strong fundraising in a handful of other seats more likely to stay in Republican hands, with their candidates outraising Republican Reps. Kevin Kiley of California, Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Zach Nunn of Iowa, Don Bacon of Nebraska and Nick LaLota of New York. But those Republicans still had more cash banked away.\nHouse Democratic candidates have held a financial edge over their GOP rivals ever since the Democratic small-dollar fundraising boom that took place after former President Donald Trump took office. In 2018, that advantage has helped them take control of the House. But just two years later, the GOP won big across the House battlegrounds despite operating at a financial deficit, setting the party up to retake the majority in 2022.\nDespite those gains, party strategists have still raised concerns about disparities in candidate fundraising, which gave Democrats a significant edge on the airwaves, since candidates receive lower TV ad rates than outside groups.\nDemocrats are confident they'll continue to have a financial advantage heading into November. Just two of their vulnerable incumbents — Connecticut Rep. Jahana Hayes and Texas Rep. Vicente Gonazalez — were outraised by their likely GOP opponents.\nOn average, Democratic incumbents in 'tossup' races raised more than $1 million on average in the first quarter, while the average GOP incumbent in a similar race raised $619,000.\n'Everyone can see the writing on the wall: House Republicans, consumed by chaos and crisis, are about to lose their majority,' Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Viet Shelton said in a statement.\nRepublicans in competitive races did step up their fundraising last year as they look to defend their slim majority. The NRCC also launched a 'million dollar mission' to encourage lawmakers to give to their colleagues' campaigns and boost vulnerable incumbents' accounts in the off-year.\nMcCarthy's exit has dealt a blow to GOP fundraising. Speaker Mike Johnson's joint fundraising committee, which funnels money to vulnerable GOP lawmakers and state parties, raised $9.1 million from January through March. McCarthy's similar committee brought in three times more — $28.9 million — over the same period last year.\nStill, even those within the party who have sounded the alarm about the GOP fundraising disadvantage in the past believe the gap has been narrowed enough to mute any significant impact.\n'You can't get outspent 5- or 6-to-1, but that's not what's happening in the races that matter. In this environment, you could get narrowly outspent and still have the edge,' said Corry Bliss, a veteran GOP strategist who previously ran the House Republicans' top super PAC, Congressional Leadership Fund.\nBliss argued that the top of the ticket will have a more significant impact than the GOP candidates' fundraising disadvantages, especially considering super PACs like CLF continue to rake in strong fundraising hauls.\n'Joe Biden's approval rating, Joe Biden's foreign policies, Joe Biden's economic policies will be the most important thing in these House races,' he said.\n'Of course given the choice you want more money than your opponent. But given the voice, I'll take a $5 gallon of gas and Joe Biden with 34% approval rating over [stronger] online fundraising.'\nOutside super PACs like CLF will still play a major role in House races, especially in the costly TV markets in New York and California, which are hosting many of the top battlegrounds. CLF, and the House Democrats' House Majority PAC, both remain well-funded.\nBut strong candidate fundraising can allow outside groups to supplement GOP candidate spending, rather than shouldering the entire load.\n'It allows CLF and the super PACs to be the whipped cream and the cherry on the advertising sundae, not the full three scoops,' said Matt Gorman, a former NRCC spokesman, arguing Republican candidate fundraising is better off than it was just a few years ago.\nStill, not everyone is dismissing worries about a potentially widening fundraising gap.\n\"It's always a concern when we see our incumbents and candidates being outspent,' said one national GOP strategist involved in House races.\nBen Kamisar Bridget Bowman Joe Murphy",

            "summary": "When an Afghan national on the FBI terrorist watchlist was arrested last Thursday after having spent nearly a year in the U.S., immigration officials said he had been enrolled in a program that tracked his location via ankle monitor, mobile app or telephone.\nBut the man's participation in the monitoring program, known as Alternatives to Detention, lasted only a little over two weeks, NBC News has learned.\nMohammad Kharwin, 48, is believed to have then spent 10 months in the U.S. without any kind of monitoring system, according to sources familiar with his case.\nThe national terrorist watchlist indicates Kharwin is a member of Hezb-e-Islami, or HIG, an Afghanistan-based political and paramilitary group that the U.S. has designated a terrorist organization.\nHIG was responsible for attacks in Afghanistan that killed at least nine American soldiers and civilians from 2013 to 2015. The group is not seen as a top threat in terms of attacks inside the U.S.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security Department officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nNBC News reported last week that Customs and Border Protection agents first arrested Kharwin on March 10, 2023, near San Ysidro, California, after he crossed the Mexico-U.S. border illegally.\nAt the time, Customs and Border Protection agents did not have complete information about Kharwin and could not confirm that he was on the terrorist watchlist. So he was treated like other low-threat migrants coming into the U.S.\nWhen border agents released him, Kharwin was referred to Alternatives to Detention, run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. Kharwin was enrolled in the tracking program on March 12, 2023, and then taken out of it on March 28, 2023. It is not clear why he was dropped from the program.\nRoughly a year later, ICE agents arrested Kharwin in February after the FBI passed information to them indicating that Kharwin had potential terrorist ties. But when Kharwin appeared in court, ICE prosecutors did not share some classified information with the immigration judge that purportedly showed Kharwin's ties to a terrorist group, two U.S. officials said.\nProsecutors argued that Kharwin should be detained without bond because he posed a flight risk, but they did not say he was a national security risk, according to sources familiar with the case. The judge ordered Kharwin released on $12,000 bond.\nSeveral hours after NBC News broke the news last Thursday that Kharwin remained in the U.S., he was arrested in San Antonio and taken into ICE custody, according to a Homeland Security spokesperson.\nExperts said Kharwin's case raises questions about how migrants who may pose a security threat are vetted and tracked inside the U.S.\nIt also raises questions about the Alternatives to Detention program, which the Biden administration has vastly expanded as a way to keep tabs on hundreds of thousands of migrants in the U.S. awaiting immigration court proceedings.\nRepublicans in Congress, who oppose the program, have cut funding to it, forcing ICE to drop migrants from being monitored, often as soon as they make their first check-ins at ICE offices.\nIn February 2023, NBC News reported that Homeland Security officials said they would have to begin cutting migrants from Alternatives to Detention because Congress had not provided adequate funding.\nIt is not clear how ICE determines which migrants to drop from the program. The Homeland Security Department can also work with other law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, to gather intelligence and learn the whereabouts of migrants.\nA Homeland Security official told NBC News that many migrants who are determined to be low flight risks are not kept in Alternatives to Detention until their court dates, which could be a year or more into the future.\nAn estimated 183,901 migrants have been in Alternatives to Detention for an average of 554 days, according to data provided by Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse for immigration data. At the time Kharwin was dropped from the program, 281,613 migrants had been in the program for an average of 429 days.\nA source familiar with the program who spoke on condition of anonymity defended it and said Alternatives to Detention is 'the only way to track an individual through GPS technology.' The source added, 'Otherwise, you're relying on people to show up on their own accord.'\nAlternatives to Detention began in 2004, during the Bush administration. According to the Homeland Security Department, the number of migrants absconding from the program has 'dropped dramatically' in recent years, and enrollment in Alternatives to Detention increases the chances that immigrants show up for their immigration court hearings.\nImmigration advocates praise the program as a more humane and less costly way for the government to keep tabs on migrants awaiting hearings. Republicans in Congress have pressed Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for not filling all beds in ICE detention facilities, instead.\nIt is rare for migrants crossing the southern border to be on the terrorist watchlist.\nAn NBC News analysis found that the percentage of migrants on the terrorist watchlist as a proportion of the total number of Customs and Border Protection encounters across all U.S. borders was slightly lower during the Biden administration than during the Trump administration. It remained an average of 0.02% during the Biden administration, lower than the 0.05% under former President Donald Trump.\nJulia Ainsley",

Trump's trial: A ‘freak show' on the outside and solemn on the inside By Jonathan Allen Inside a courthouse nestled between Tribeca and Chinatown on Monday morning, former President Donald Trump's lawyers argued with the district attorney's office over procedures for a hush-money case that could send an ex-commander in chief to prison for the first time in American history.\nJudge Juan Merchan advised lawyers that he was getting a little annoyed by the 'minutia.' With a pool of 500 prospective jurors waiting, he wanted to get started with the process of picking 12.\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know The judge also delivered Trump his 'Parker warnings,' including that he could be jailed for contempt if he is absent without leave at any point during the trial. Trump, betraying little emotion, said he understood.\nOutside, in a sun-filled park across the street, peculiarity reigned over pedantry.\nA smattering of pro-Trump demonstrators — some wearing costumes, others carrying signs, one temporarily lowering the top of her dinosaur-themed one-piece before writhing on the ground in performative ecstasy — lent their support to the presumptive Republican nominee.\nThe presence of high-profile gawkers accentuated the carnival-like nature of the gathering: The Daily Show's Jordan Klepper, former Republican gubernatorial candidate Andrew Giuliani and filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, a daughter of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n'I never miss a freak show,' the younger Pelosi, a longtime resident of nearby Greenwich Village, said.\nThe unlikely tandem of Klepper and Giuliani provided a clear window into a series of truths about this trial: The charges are at once the least consequential of the set pending against Trump and as fundamental to democracy as the question of whether special treatment — either targeting or protection — can be avoided in the case of such a powerful figure.\nAt times during the lengthy proceedings, the former president suggested disinterest or exhaustion by closing his eyes.\nMost of the jurors sat quiet and expressionless. Merchan emphasized his desire to shield their identities from the public, going so far as to warn the rival legal teams not to reproduce lists of their names. More than half of them were dismissed when they raised their hands to say they could not be impartial in this trial.\nOne dismissed prospective juror was overheard in a hallway saying, 'I just couldn't do it.'\nFinding 12 adults with no particular feelings about Donald J. Trump, and the will to sit through a multi-week trial, is no easy feat. That process will continue inside Merchan's court. For the rest of the world, the 'freak show' rolls along on the outside.\nRead more →\nWhere public opinion stands on Trump's trial — for now Analysis by Mark Murray It's unclear how the criminal trial into the hush money charges against Trump will ultimately play out, but recent national polling gives us a good idea where voters stand on the matter.\nAt least for now.\nSizable majorities say the charges against Trump are serious: 64% of voters said the charges that Trump falsified business records concerning the payment of hush money to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election are very or somewhat serious, according to an April Reuters/Ipsos poll.\nSizable majorities say the charges against Trump are serious: 64% of voters said the charges that Trump falsified business records concerning the payment of hush money to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election are very or somewhat serious, according to an April Reuters/Ipsos poll. Yet that's smaller than the share of voters who believed the charges in the other criminal cases are serious — such as trying to overturn the 2020 election results (74%), pressuring Georgia state officials to overturn the 2020 election (72%) and illegally removing classified documents (69%).\nA recent New York Times/Siena College poll also found 58% of registered voters saying the hush-money charges are 'very' or 'somewhat' serious, including 30% of self-identified Republicans.\nViews about Trump's guilt are divided along party lines: But the same NYT/Siena poll showed a smaller share of voters (46%) believing that Trump should be found guilty in the hush-money case, while 36% said he should be found not guilty; another 18% say they didn't know or refused to answer.\nViews about Trump's guilt are divided along party lines: But the same NYT/Siena poll showed a smaller share of voters (46%) believing that Trump should be found guilty in the hush-money case, while 36% said he should be found not guilty; another 18% say they didn't know or refused to answer. And look at the results by party:\nDemocrats: 84% guilty, 6% not guilty, 10% didn't know\nRepublicans: 13% guilty, 71% not guilty, 16% didn't know\nIndependents: 40% guilty, 35% not guilty, 25% didn't know\nNotice how those independents are right down the middle, with a sizable number not having an opinion. The general election ballot slightly shifts if Trump is found guilty: Finally, the January 2024 national NBC News poll showed a slight shift in the horse race between Trump and President Joe Biden when voters are asked about their opinions *if* Trump is ultimately convicted of a crime.\nThe general election ballot slightly shifts if Trump is found guilty: Finally, the January 2024 national NBC News poll showed a slight shift in the horse race between Trump and President Joe Biden when voters are asked about their opinions *if* Trump is ultimately convicted of a crime. In the original ballot test, Trump was ahead of Biden by 5 points among registered voters, 47% to 42%, which was within the poll's margin of error.\nBut when voters were asked — on the survey's final question — about their ballot choice if Trump is convicted of a crime, Biden jumped ahead of Trump by 2 points, 45% to 43%.\nThat's a 7-point swing.\nA caveat about that hypothetical, however: It assumes voters would see a conviction is fair and square. But as we all know, Trump has already spent months trying to cast the prosecution as unfair and politically motivated.\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

            "summary": "BEIRUT — Iran-backed Hezbollah is determined not to ramp up its monthslong firefight over Lebanon's southern border, but will respond in kind to any Israeli escalation, the political party and militia's second-in-command told NBC News in a rare and exclusive interview.\nNaim Qassem faulted Israel and the United States for perpetuating tit-for-tat attacks that have killed hundreds in southern Lebanon and displaced tens of thousands of civilians on both sides of the Israeli-Lebanese border. The conflict started with Hamas' terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7, which killed more than 1,200 people and sparked Israel's bloody incursion into the Gaza Strip that has since killed nearly 34,000 people, according to the Ministry of Health in Hamas-ruled Gaza.\n'We didn't expect the war would last this long because we didn't think that Netanyahu was that foolish, same for Biden and the other countries,' Qassem said, as Israel's two-front conflict drags into its seventh month.\nNaim Qassem, the Shia Lebanese cleric and politician who is Hezbollah's second-in-command, speaks with NBC News on Thursday. NBC News As Hezbollah's deputy secretary-general, Qassem ranks second behind the group's revered leader, Hassan Nasrallah.\nQassem's comments came as Israel prepares its response to an unprecedented retaliatory Iranian missile and drone barrage against the Jewish state — an impending reprisal that would bring the Middle East closer to a region-wide war than at any time in recent memory.\nBut the latest round of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah began months before last weekend's direct confrontation between Israel and Iran. Hezbollah is estimated to have upward of 150,000 rockets and missiles, in addition to drones and anti-tank, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, according to a Reuters report, citing data from the CIA.\nHezbollah, a powerful, Iran-backed Shia political party and militant organization, was formed in the early 1980s during the Lebanese civil war and was an active force during the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, when it set a mission to expel Israeli forces from the country. The group has long claimed solidarity with the Palestinian cause. The U.S. considers Hezbollah a terrorist organization.\nHezbollah first struck a disputed border region of northern Israel on Oct. 8, the day after Hamas' attack on Israel. At the time, Hezbollah called that strike an act of 'solidarity' with Hamas. Iran also has backed Hamas for years.\nHezbollah claimed responsibility Wednesday for a missile and drone attack on northern Israel that injured 18 people, 14 of whom were Israeli soldiers, saying the strikes were retaliation for Israel killing two of the group's commanders in a cross-border attack the day before.\nAmong the multiple Iran-backed groups that oppose Israel in the Middle East, Hezbollah is by far the strongest and the largest beneficiary of Iranian largesse.\nIran has declared that its attack Saturday night, which saw it launch more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel, marked the full extent of its retaliation for an April 1 strike by Israel on the Iranian Consulate in Syria's capital, Damascus, that killed two senior commanders and five advisers from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\nQassem said Iran repeated its public messaging to Hezbollah.\n'Tehran speaks publicly and clearly. They do not want war and they have responded to the attack on their embassy and that's it for them,' Qassem said. 'I think Iran is honest. This is what they told us and this is what they keep reiterating to the media.'\nQassem offered measured criticism of the three Arab countries — Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — that assisted in Israel's defense against the Iranian salvo Saturday night.\n'It wasn't adequate for any Arab nation to support Israel no matter what justifications they had,' he said. 'Their populations will hold them accountable for all those who took this decision.'\nQassem laid equal blame for the civilian losses in Gaza on both Israel and the United States, dismissing a recent public rift between U.S. President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as little more than cosmetic politics meant to 'safeguard America's image.'\n'I consider that Biden and Netanyahu are both complicit in one scheme with very minor differences,' Qassem said.\nIn an earlier interview in November, Qassem told NBC News that Hezbollah would push more forcefully into its fight with Israel if the Jewish state continued its incursion into Gaza.\nBut nearly six months later, both Hezbollah and Israel have mostly hewed to 'rules of engagement' — an unstated understanding between both sides that has so far tempered the fighting and confined it to the two states' border regions.\nhewed to 'rules of engagement' — an unstated understanding between both sides that has so far tempered the fighting and confined it to the two states' border regions. 'We will not accept that the Israelis transgress the rules of engagement that are currently set in the south' of Lebanon, he said. 'If the Israelis increase their attacks, we will increase our attacks as well.'\nWhile Israel is playing by the rules of engagement for now, senior Israeli officials have threatened to destroy Lebanon if Hezbollah escalates.\nIn January, an assassination by drone strike in Beirut of a Hamas leader was believed to have been carried out by Israel, ratcheting up tensions then, though Israel did not claim responsibility.\nDespite its limited engagement, Qassem said Hezbollah's fight is 'serving its purpose' by 'luring the Israeli forces to get busy in the north,' referring to their shared border, rather than Gaza, which borders southern Israel.\n'Therefore, we will continue to do so, and we will not wage a full-scale war unless the Israelis decide to get into war against us,' he said. 'Then we are ready for the full confrontation.'\nMatt Bradley Ziad Jaber Natasha Lebedeva",

            "summary": "The Sheetz convenience store chain has been hit with a lawsuit by federal officials who allege the company discriminated against minority job applicants.\nSheetz Inc., which operates more than 700 stores in six states, discriminated against Black, Native American and multiracial job seekers by automatically weeding out applicants whom the company deemed to have failed a criminal background check, according to U.S. officials.\nPresident Joe Biden stopped by a Sheetz for snacks this week while campaigning in Pennsylvania.\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed suit in Baltimore against Altoona, Pennsylvania-based Sheetz and two subsidary companies, alleging the chain's longstanding hiring practices have a disproportionate impact on minority applicants and thus run afoul of federal civil rights law.\nSheetz said Thursday that it 'does not tolerate discrimination of any kind.'\n'Diversity and inclusion are essential parts of who we are. We take these allegations seriously. We have attempted to work with the EEOC for nearly eight years to find common ground and resolve this dispute,' company spokesperson Nick Ruffner said in a statement.\nThe privately held, family-run company has more than 23,000 employees and operates convenience stores and gas stations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, Ohio and North Carolina.\nThe lawsuit was filed in federal court on Wednesday, the day Biden stopped at a Sheetz market on a western Pennsylvania campaign swing, buying snacks, posing for photos and chatting up patrons and employees.\nFederal officials said they do not allege Sheetz was motivated by racial animus, but take issue with the way the chain uses criminal background checks to screen job seekers. The company was sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits workplace discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion and national origin.\n'Federal law mandates that employment practices causing a disparate impact because of race or other protected classifications must be shown by the employer to be necessary to ensure the safe and efficient performance of the particular jobs at issue,' EEOC attorney Debra M. Lawrence said in a statement.\n'Even when such necessity is proven, the practice remains unlawful if there is an alternative practice available that is comparably effective in achieving the employer's goals but causes less discriminatory effect,' Lawrence said.\nIt wasn't immediately clear how many job applicants have been affected, but the agency said Sheetz's unlawful hiring practices date to at least 2015.\nThe EEOC, an independent agency that enforces federal laws against workplace discrimination, is seeking to force Sheetz to offer jobs to applicants who were unlawfully denied employment and to provide back pay, retroactive seniority and other benefits.\nThe EEOC began its probe of the convenience store chain after two job applicants filed complaints alleging employment discrimination.\nThe agency found that Black job applicants were deemed to have failed the company's criminal history screening and were denied employment at a rate of 14.5%, while multiracial job seekers were turned away 13.5% of the time and Native Americans were denied at a rate of 13%.\nBy contrast, fewer than 8% of white applicants were refused employment because of a failed criminal background check, the EEOC's lawsuit said.\nThe EEOC notified Sheetz in 2022 that it was likely violating civil rights law, but the agency said its efforts to mediate a settlement failed, prompting this week's lawsuit.\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\nThe Associated Press",

            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday ripped the jury selection process for his historic New York criminal trial, the day after the first seven jurors were selected out of a pool of nearly 100 people.\nPosting about the hush money trial on its scheduled off-day, Trump — who has repeatedly accused the judge in the case of being biased against him — suggested incorrectly that he should be entitled to unlimited strikes of potential jurors in his criminal case.\n'I thought STRIKES were supposed to be 'unlimited' when we were picking our jury? I was then told we only had 10, not nearly enough when we were purposely given the 2nd Worst Venue in the Country,\" he wrote in a post on Truth Social, before decrying the criminal cases against him as \"election interference\" and part of a \"witch hunt.\"\nUnder New York law, each side does have an unlimited number of strikes 'for cause,' but the judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan, can decide whether or not that cause is worthy of a strike.\nbut the judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan, can decide whether or not that cause is worthy of a strike.\nThe two sides are also entitled to a limited number of \"peremptory strikes\" — potential jurors they can dismiss. Because Trump is charged with a Class E felony, which is a lower-level felony, he and prosecutors are entitled to 10 peremptory challenges each. (The number goes up to 20 for defendants facing the highest level of felony charge, Class A.)\nWhile the judge has dismissed scores of potential jurors in the case who said they could not be impartial or had scheduling conflicts, he's only dismissed two \"for cause\" in the two days since jury selection began. One was a person who'd written \"lock him up\" of Trump in a 2017 social media post. The judge denied some other Trump \"cause\" dismissal requests, including a woman who'd posted on Facebook about celebrating Joe Biden's 2020 election win.\nTrump's attorney Todd Blanche then used one of his peremptory challenges to have the woman removed.\nBy the end of the day Tuesday, both Trump and prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office had used six of their 10 challenges, meaning they only have four each left for the remaining jurors.\nTwo potential jurors the DA's office used its strikes on were people who said they'd read Trump's book \"The Art of the Deal.\"\nTrump is required to attend the trial, which is expected to last as long as eight weeks and take place every weekday except Wednesday and holidays. The rigorous trial schedule will limit his ability to join in-person campaign events as part of his presidential bid — something the former president has complained about repeatedly. NBC News reported last month that Trump plans to leverage his legal issues for political gain by falsely blaming President Joe Biden.\nJury selection is scheduled to resume Thursday morning with a pool of an additional 96 prospective jurors. Once a full 12-person jury has been selected, the two sides then pick alternate jurors.\nMerchan appeared hopeful Tuesday that jury selection will be done by the end of the day Friday. He told the seven jurors who have been selected to return Monday morning for opening statements, while also cautioning the date could change.\nTrump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to a porn star during the closing days of the 2016 presidential election. He faces up to four years in prison if convicted.",

            "summary": "American officials expect a possible Israeli response to Iran's attack over the weekend to be limited in scope and likely involve strikes against Iranian military forces and Iranian-backed proxies outside Iran, four United States officials told NBC News.\nThe U.S. assessment is based on conversations between American and Israeli officials that happened before Iran fired more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel on Saturday night.\nAs Israel was preparing for a possible Iranian attack last week, Israeli officials briefed U.S. officials about possible response options, the U.S. officials said.\nThe U.S. officials stressed that they have not been briefed on Israel's final decision about how it will respond and that the options could have changed since the weekend attack. They also said it is not clear when an Israeli response will happen but say it could happen at any time.\nPresident Joe Biden and other leaders have called for restraint after Israel vowed it would respond to Iran's Saturday attack, which was in retaliation for an Israeli strike April 1 on an Iranian consular building in Syria that killed two of Tehran's top generals.\nThe scenarios briefed last week regarding possible retaliatory action for the consular strike ranged from a modest attack by Iran to a widespread attack that resulted in Israeli casualties and the destruction of Israeli facilities, the officials said.\nThe potential Israeli responses ranged from no military action to strikes inside Iran.\nBecause the Iranian attack did not result in Israeli deaths or widespread destruction, the U.S. officials said Israel could respond with one of its less aggressive options — strikes outside Iran.\nThe options could include striking inside Syria, three U.S. officials told NBC News. The officials do not expect the response to target senior Iranian officials but to instead strike shipments or storage facilities with advanced missile parts, weapons or components, that are sent from Iran to Hezbollah.\nThe U.S. does not intend to take part in the military response, the officials added. They do expect Israel to share information about the actions with Washington in advance, specifically if it could have negative repercussions for Americans in the region.\nAn Israeli official said Monday, after a meeting of Israel's war cabinet that its response to the Iranian attack may be 'imminent,' noting that decision-makers believed it was important for any response to follow in close proximity to the attack. The Israeli official said several diplomatic and military options were examined during the meeting.\nIsraeli Iron Dome air defense system launches to intercept missiles fired from Iran, in central Israel, over the weekend. Tomer Neuberg / AP The U.S. and other allies came to Israel's aid during the strikes, helping it intercept the vast majority of drones and missiles fired at the country. But in a call Saturday, President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. would not participate in offensive operations against Iran, a senior administration official has said.\nA chorus of nations and diplomats have condemned the weekend strikes while also cautioning against further escalation in the region.\n'I urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid any action that could lead to major military confrontations on multiple fronts in the Middle East,' United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said at a meeting of the organization's Security Council on Sunday.\nGilad Erdan, Israel's representative to the U.N., said at the meeting that Israel 'reserves the legal right to retaliate,' and that the world 'cannot settle for inaction.'\nIran has said in a statement from its foreign ministry that the strikes were carried out 'in exercise of its inherent right of self-defense.' The statement said it 'would not hesitate to take further necessary defensive measures' to protect its legitimate interests against any act of military aggression or unlawful use of force.'\nCourtney Kube Monica Alba Mosheh Gains",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump might be able to declare victory in his upcoming Supreme Court case on presidential immunity even if the justices reject his most extreme arguments.\nAt issue in the high-stakes showdown Thursday is whether Trump's criminal charges over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election results should be dismissed based on a broad claim of immunity.\nEven if the court rejects that bold argument, it could still send the case back to Washington-based U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan for more proceedings on whether some of Trump's actions are insulated from prosecution.\nWith the case, initially scheduled for trial in March, already plagued by delays, such a ruling would further imperil the chances of any trial being concluded before November's election.\n\"Trump's first preference would be a ruling that he is immune, but a second preference would be a ruling that there is some kind of complicated factual test for immunity so it has to be remanded,\" said Richard Bernstein, a lawyer who filed a friend-of-the-court brief opposing Trump on behalf of former government officials.\nIn that scenario, \"the case would get bogged down\" on questions about to what extent each of the four counts in the indictment rest on official acts of the then-president, which might be protected, he added.\nThe case in Washington, separate from the ongoing criminal trial in New York, concerns Trump's involvement in a scheme to submit fake election certificates to Congress in the hope that it would nullify Joe Biden's victory, a chain of events that led to the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.\nProsecutors led by special counsel Jack Smith say those acts constituted a series of crimes. Trump says he was merely expressing his concerns, which were not based on any evidence, that the election was plagued with fraud.\nThe four charges he faces are: conspiracy to defraud the United States, obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy to violate the right to vote and have one's vote counted.\nThe question of whether the obstruction charge can be used to prosecute people involved in the Jan. 6 riot is the subject of another Supreme Court case argued last week.\nThe legal issues in the election interference case have sometimes served as a sideshow to the issue of timing, with Trump opponents hoping that a trial could take place before the election in the belief that a guilty verdict could affect the 2024 general election, in which Trump once again faces off against Biden.\nSome legal commentators say Trump has in many ways already won by persuading the Supreme Court not to intervene in the case at an earlier stage, making it less likely that a trial can take place before the election even if the immunity claim is outright rejected. The court also dithered when deciding how to frame the legal question when it ultimately took up Trump's appeal.\nThe Supreme Court's handling of the case so far might suggest it will fall short of a sweeping ruling against Trump as some have predicted, legal experts say.\nThe court might think that there are some official duties that do merit immunity but leave it to a trial court to figure out how that applies to Trump's case, according to Randall Eliason, a former federal prosecutor who teaches at the George Washington University Law School.\n\"The reason they took the case is because they want to write something more nuanced that accepts there may be immunity in some circumstances,\" he added.\nSmith has argued in court papers that Trump has no immunity and that the case should go immediately to trial.\nBut in his latest brief, Smith offered his views on what the court should do if it thinks that there is some form of immunity for official acts.\nIn that scenario, the trial should still go ahead, he argued, because the charges in the indictment also include \"private conduct\" that has nothing to do with Trump's official duties.\nIf there are concerns about actions that should be subject to immunity being used as evidence against Trump, the trial court could weigh whether that evidence should be excluded, Smith argued.\n\"The district court can make evidentiary rulings and craft appropriate jury instructions for trial clarifying that petitioner may be held criminally liable based only on the private conduct alleged in the indictment,\" Smith wrote.\nThe prosecution's theory of the case is that any use of official presidential power \"was merely an additional means of achieving a private aim\" — remaining in office after losing an election.\nSmith cited, among other things, Trump's coordination with private lawyers in forming the scheme to submit false alternative election certifications to Congress in the hope that then-Vice President Mike Pence would refuse to certify Biden's victory.\nSmith also argued that, at a minimum, some evidence arising from official duties could be used at trial in order to show Trump's \"knowledge or notice of the falsity of his election-fraud claims.\"\nTrump's own brief calls for sweeping immunity, seeking an extension of a 1982 Supreme Court ruling called Nixon v. Fitzgerald that said presidents cannot be sued for conduct within the \"outer perimeter\" of their official duties. That was a civil case and has never been applied in the criminal context.\nThe possibility of a remand is also addressed in Trump's brief, with his lawyers appearing to envisage a pretrial proceeding that would include detailed consideration of whether his conduct constituted protected official acts.\nThey cite an appeals court ruling that allowed civil claims to move ahead against Trump over his involvement in Jan. 6. That court rejected Trump's broad immunity argument, but said he could raise the issue again later in the litigation.\nTrump could also seek to appeal any adverse ruling in a pretrial proceeding, although, depending on how the process works, he might have to wait until after trial.\nOpinions vary on how much more time, from days to weeks, additional litigation on immunity could add before a trial commences.\n\"How much delay that causes is a real open question,\" said Matthew Seligman, another lawyer who filed a brief backing prosecutors.\nChutkan, who put the case on hold while Trump appealed the immunity issue, has previously indicated that a trial could start three months after she gets the case back following a Supreme Court ruling.\nIf that ruling comes at the end of June, when the Supreme Court typically issues decisions in its most consequential cases before breaking for the summer, that would lead to a trial starting no earlier than the end of September. The trial could last up to 12 weeks.\nA trial before the election is \"still theoretically possible,\" Eliason said, but \"the window is closing.\"\nLawrence Hurley",

            "excerpt": "The foreign aid package moved forward with the support of an extremely rare bipartisan coalition, with Democrats helping to carry the \"rule\" in committee and on the floor.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The House voted 316-94 to tee up votes on four separate bills that include aid to Ukraine and Israel, a good sign for the prospects of Congress approving U.S. funding for the two countries after months of delay and partisan fighting.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, facing intense opposition from right-wing members, received crucial help from Democrats to move forward with the votes. More Democrats (165) than Republicans (151) voted to pass the 'rule,' a procedural step to set up the votes.\nThe move tees up four House votes that are expected Saturday afternoon: one on Israel aid, another on Ukraine aid, another on Indo-Pacific security and a fourth bill that includes a bill designed to ban TikTok in the U.S. if it does not divest from its China-based owner, as well as various national security priorities. If they pass, the measures would be packaged together and sent to the Democratic-controlled Senate.\nTaken together, the foreign aid measures closely resemble the $95 billion national security package pushed by President Joe Biden. The Senate would have to pass it again, due to some differences with the version that passed the upper chamber in February.\n\"The world is watching what the Congress does. Passing this legislation would send a powerful message about the strength of American leadership at a pivotal moment,\" the White House budget office said in a statement Friday endorsing the House package. \"The Administration urges both chambers of the Congress to quickly send this supplemental funding package to the President's desk.\nThe House's move followed a vote of 9-3 in the Rules Committee late Thursday to send the bills to the floor for a final vote, with Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., breaking with Johnson to vote against it. But all four Democrats voted for the rule and rescued it, an extremely unusual move for the minority party.\n\"We only control one chamber, and I barely have control of that,\" Johnson said Thursday on Newsmax, explaining why he couldn't include GOP immigration measures in the package as some want. \"The Senate won't advance our legislation and the president won't sign it. ... I have a handful of my Republicans, at least, who will not advance a rule to bring that to the floor to combine it with the Ukraine and Israel funding. They won't do it. And so if I don't have Republican votes, that means we have to have Democratic votes.\nJohnson's decision to move forward with the bills comes as two of his members — Massie and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. — threaten to remove him as speaker. They and many other House conservatives oppose additional aid to Ukraine.\n'We'll see what happens. I'm going to do my job. I'm not deterred by threats,' Johnson said Friday. 'We're going to do the right thing and let the chips fall where they may.'\nBut Johnson, who opposed Ukraine aid last year before he became speaker, now says he believes it is \"critically important,\" based on the intelligence and briefings he has since gotten.\n'I think Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed,\" he told reporters earlier this week.\n\"I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,\" Johnson said, adding that his son is entering the Naval Academy this fall. \"This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is so many American families. This is not a game, this is not a joke.'\nThe fourth bill includes a provision to force China-based ByteDance to sell TikTok within nine months, which the president can extend to a year, or face a ban in the U.S. The provision, which has Senate buy-in as well as Biden's support, puts TikTok closer than ever to a prohibition in the country.\nDemocrats praised the move to proceed to House votes, highlighting their party's key role.\n\"It is vital that Congress act to send assistance to support Ukraine and fend off Russian aggression,\" Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., said on X. \"We may be in the minority, but we are not going to let that urgent mission fail. Democrats are doing what it takes to make sure Ukraine gets help.\"\nRep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., said Democrats were effectively in charge: \"We may be in the minority in the House right now, but @RepJeffries is essentially functioning as the real Speaker already.

            "summary": "More than six months since Hamas militants attacked Israel and seized more than 250 hostages, it remains unclear exactly how many of the captives are still alive in Gaza, according to U.S. and Israeli officials.\nThe uncertainty has caused anguish among the families of those held in Gaza and undermined international efforts to negotiate a cease-fire deal and the release of at least some of the hostages, the officials told NBC News.\nA proposed cease-fire formula calls for Hamas to free 40 hostages who are women, children or sick and elderly men, and in return, Israel would release possibly hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. But Hamas so far has been unable to confirm it has identified 40 hostages who meet those criteria, and that has bogged down the negotiations, U.S., Israeli and Western officials said.\nIn November, more than 100 hostages were released as part of a four-day pause in the fighting in Gaza. Israel says more than 130 hostages remain, and about a quarter of those are believed dead.\nFar fewer hostages may be alive than is publicly known, but it is difficult to say for certain, given there has been limited visibility into the locations and conditions of some of the hostages, U.S. officials said.\nAsked whether there was a firm estimate of how many hostages remained alive, a former senior Israeli official said: 'Not at all. No one reliable has this information. It's all speculation.'\nU.S. officials accused Hamas of making demands that it knows are unobtainable.\n\"Hamas' refusal to accept a hostage-cease-fire deal shows their disregard for the lives of the Palestinian people,\" a senior Biden administration official said Wednesday. \"They started this war and seem to be perfectly fine with this conflict continuing.\"\nAn Israeli official said, 'Hamas is dragging its feet, is not interested in a deal and continues to hope for a regional escalation, which is why the negotiations remain stalled.'\nHamas said in a statement Saturday it was prepared to sign on to a 'serious and true' deal but renewed its demand for a permanent cease-fire and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops.\nAccording to Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, whose country has acted as an intermediary for the hostage-cease-fire talks along with Egypt and the U.S., the talks have hit a 'stumbling block.'\n'We are passing through a delicate phase with some stumbling,' he said at a news conference Wednesday, without elaborating. 'We are trying as much as possible to address this stumbling block and to move forward.'\nA relative of one of the several Americans believed to be held in Gaza said families are in the dark about the fates of their loved ones: 'For 185 days, we have received no verification of life of any of these hostages — absent a limited number of videos released early on by the Hamas terrorists.'\nThe family member, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid putting their loved one's fate at risk, said that Israeli security has shown Americans who have traveled to Israel and met with Israel's security forces that they know where many of the hostages are but that the captives are constantly being moved.\n'Every day they are there, we also know that they could die of starvation, illness, injury or murder,' the relative said.\nThe Biden administration is working under the assumption that five U.S. hostages are still alive and unaccounted for, a U.S. official said. But Washington has better visibility into the locations and conditions of some hostages than others, making it difficult to say with any certainty that all five remain alive.\nBeyond the five, the U.S. believes Hamas is holding several more bodies of Americans believed to have been taken into Gaza after they were killed in the militants' Oct. 7 assault on Israel or shortly thereafter.\nIsraeli troops have searched hospitals, tunnels and even graveyards in Gaza for hostages or their remains. In February, an Israeli raid in Rafah in southern Gaza rescued two hostages.\nAviva Siegel, who spent 51 days as a hostage in Gaza until she was released as part of the November deal, said her experience in captivity was a terrifying nightmare.\n'For 186 days I was there. I was treated like I'm nothing. I didn't have any human rights. We weren't allowed to talk. We weren't allowed to even stand,' Siegel told NBC News' Andrea Mitchell last week.\n'They used to starve us and eat in front of us. They used to drink water, and we begged them for water. They used to sometimes bring us just a little bit of water and say that's the water until tomorrow at 5 o'clock. So we used to have one sip every couple of hours, each of us.\"\nHer husband, Keith, of North Carolina, remains captive.\nDan De Luce Peter Alexander Monica Alba Anna Schecter",

The current minimum target is 2%.\n'They also discussed the war between Russia and Ukraine, the conflict with Israel in the Middle East, and many other topics having to do with getting to world peace,' the campaign said.\nAfter their dinner Duda said it was 'a friendly meeting in a very nice atmosphere.'\nTrump, who is on trial in New York over accusations that he covered up a 'hush money' payment to pornographic actress Stormy Daniels, is likely to face a tight race against President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November presidential election.\nDuda is in New York to attend the United Nations, and will travel on to Canada on Friday.",

'European skies could have received the same level of protection long ago if Ukraine had received full support from its partners in intercepting drones and missiles,' he said. 'We can now see how unity can work.'\nMost galling, perhaps, is that Russia has been deploying the very same drones as Iran in its assault on Ukrainian cities. And this apparent double standard comes at a particularly perilous moment, as Ukrainian officials sound the alarm that it will be unable to hold off Russian forces from advancing without new military support. The most apparent example of how a lack of Western air defenses is affecting Ukraine is in its second-largest city, Kharkiv, where Russian missiles and drones destroyed a heat and power plant last week.\nBut the U.S. and its Western partners have made clear their reluctance to go as far in Ukraine as they did in the Middle East.\nRead the full story here.\nRead the full story here.

First jurors in Trump hush money trial are chosen The first seven jurors in Donald Trump's hush money trial have been chosen, a process that got off to a bumpy start yesterday as New Yorkers were pressed about whether they could fairly judge the former president. The selected jurors include a former waiter, an oncology nurse, an attorney, an IT consultant, a teacher and a software engineer. Their names won't be used in open court. They were told to return Monday, signaling that the selection process will be finished by the end of the week. The court still needs to select five more jurors and likely six alternates.\nTrump's lawyers excavated ancient social media posts, asked jurors to explain inconsistent answers on their questionnaires and tried to strike from the pool of candidates they feared could spell danger for their case. At one point, Judge Juan Merchan read unflattering memes about Trump after apologizing in case it caused offense.

Mayorkas impeachment trial could be a swift ordeal Republicans are hoping to drag out the impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, but they might not get that what they wish for. This afternoon, an impeachment trial will kick off with all 100 senators getting sworn in as jurors. Then, Senate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, are expected to quickly move to dismiss or table the two impeachment articles against Mayorkas and move on to other business. A conviction against Mayorkas is likely impossible because none of the Senate's 51 Democrats have said they support his impeachment.\nMayorkas is charged with 'high crimes and misdemeanors' for failing to enforce immigration and border security laws and for knowingly lying under oath in Congress.

Autopsy for ‘Unabomber' Ted Kaczynski details cancer, depression before death John Youngbear / AP file An autopsy report for Ted Kaczynski, the domestic terrorist known as the 'Unabomber,' shows that he was diagnosed with rectal cancer and 'was noted to be depressed' before his death last year at the age of 81. The report, obtained 10 months after his death by suicide, offers new details into Kaczysnki's health and final months and raises questions about whether his death was preventable.\nKaczynski was diagnosed with rectal cancer in March 2021, and he received biweekly chemotherapy until March 2023, medical examiners said. About a month before Kaczynski's death, an oncologist noted that he 'appeared depressed.' On June 10, 2023, Kaczynski attempted suicide, and later died at a hospital.\nWhether Kaczynski's depression resulted in a suicide watch is unclear. But given Kaczynski's status within the federal prison system, one expert says 'it's somewhat surprising' he was able to end his life. Read the exclusive story here.\nRead the exclusive story here. Boeing whistleblower doubles down ahead of Senate hearing A Boeing whistleblower is expected to testify before a U.S. Senate subcommittee today about his concerns with the company's 787 Dreamliner, which he said is unsafe to fly and could 'drop to the ground' midflight unless problems are addressed.

He said the company has yet to properly address tiny nonconforming gaps found in multiple planes after two sections of their fuselages were joined together during assembly.

When asked if he would put his own family on a 787 right now, Salehpour didn't hesitate. 'Right now, I would not,' he said. Watch the full interview here.\nWatch the full interview here.

As the county commissioner in charge of elections here in Pennsylvania's Montgomery County, he is determined to get as many people out to vote in November as he can. It's a big part of the reason he campaigned for the job.\n'I'm probably one of the first people to run for a county commissioner seat in Pennsylvania because of the role of administering elections,' said Makhija, 37, a Democrat who took office in January and previously taught election law at the University of Pennsylvania.\n'When this seat opened up, I thought this is a real place where we can make a difference, protect voting rights and really set the standard in Pennsylvania and for the country,' he added.\nBut to get more people to vote, Makhija realized he would need to get creative.\nThat's why on a Thursday in April, Makhija had gathered 16 Montgomery County voters at the county commissioner's office to present them with leather-bound certificates honoring a lifetime of civic duty.\nIt was the first Montgomery County Voter Hall of Fame.\nAfter official county business wrapped, Makhija and his two fellow commissioners stood in front of the room's imposing wooden desk to greet the honorees, who were found by combing through the county and state electoral records for voters who had cast ballots in the last 50 consecutive general elections. Makhija polled the room about how long they'd been voting. The oldest honoree had been voting since 1956.\n'Anybody got 1956 beat? This is like an auction,' Makhija joked.\nAs a photographer captured the moments, the honorees posed at the front of the room with the commissioners and their new certificates.\nThe mood was celebratory, but the mission behind the ceremony was serious.\nCentral to Makhija's efforts is understanding what makes people like honorees Alan and Rosemary Hinkle tick. The couple has voted in every election since 1972, when Alan was 21 and Rosemary was 18.\n'I think it's so important that in the midst of everything that's happening in politics, where people are cynical or disillusioned, that we actually recognize the people who are so committed to the system,' Makhija said.\nHe said he hopes that initiatives like the Hall of Fame will not only inspire other voters to turn out, but also inspire him to come up with new ways to make voting more accessible. According to NBC News polling going back to 2008, election enthusiasm is at an all-time low for a presidential contest.\nPennsylvania clinched the White House for Joe Biden in 2020 — thanks in large part to places like Montgomery County, a largely white, highly educated, wealthy suburb of Philadelphia that trends blue. Biden was able to expand his margin of victory in Philadelphia's surrounding counties — Montgomery, Bucks, Chester and Delaware — by more than 100,000 votes over what Democrat Hillary Clinton earned in 2016, offsetting gains former President Donald Trump made in the state's smaller counties.\n'We're the most courted voters in the whole country,' Makhija said. 'I think reminding people in our communities that we set the direction of the country will make a difference.'\nMakhija isn't just battling a lack of enthusiasm for the two candidates; he's also contending with a firehose of disinformation about the entire electoral system, just as so many other election workers are across the country.\nTrump has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that mail-in voting is a vehicle for widespread voter fraud. The former president also continues to push the baseless theory that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n'When you see them cheating, you get out there and start screaming,' Trump said at a rally in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, last weekend. 'The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020, and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election of 2024.'\nMakhija said claims like that cause 'fear and cynicism by design,' and he worries that it will cause voters of both parties to skip the ballot box in November.\n'When you challenge the whole system, people will rethink their participation,' he said.\nStill, Makhija expects the Republican nominee to continue to sow doubt about the validity of mail-in ballots, despite attempts from local GOP officials to embrace mail-in and early voting to match what's been an advantage for Democrats in recent years.\nTo that end, he's trying to build trust in the early voting system that will span across party lines. He's aiming to literally meet voters where they are by expanding election satellite offices for people who need to 'cure' their ballots — the process of allowing voters to fix their mail ballots with technical issues, such as an incorrect date or a missing signature, that otherwise may not be counted on Election Day. Makjiha also hopes to establish a mobile unit that would travel around the county to help people resolve any mistakes they made on their mail-in ballots.\n'Instead of throwing out their votes, we'll be trying to help voters cure ballots with technical errors for about 2,000 people in the last two weeks of the election,' he said.\nIn battleground Pennsylvania, every one of those votes will count — something Montgomery County's Hall of Fame inductees know all too well.\nThe Hinkels aren't sure which way they'll vote yet — but they say they are 'absolutely' decided on one thing: They'll be casting ballots in 2024.\n'If you don't want other people making the decision for you,' Rosemary Hinkle said, 'then you have to participate.'",

            "summary": "WILMINGTON, N.C. — Former President Donald Trump canceled his North Carolina rally Saturday evening at the last minute, citing stormy weather as the cause.\nTrump, who had not yet arrived to the event, called by phone to announce that the event was off as thunder and rain began to darken the outdoor rally.\n\"There seems to be some thunder and lightning. It's a pretty big storm, so if you don't mind, I think we're going to have to just do a rain check,\" Trump said over the speaker system.\nFollowing Trump's announcement, loud groans and shouts of disappointment were heard from the crowd before their swift departure.\nIt was set to be Trump's first rally since the start of his criminal trial in Manhattan.\nTrump told the crowd that he planned to reschedule the event for a later time, promising a \"rain check.\"\n\"What we'll do is we'll make up for this very quickly at another time, but we'll do it as quick as possible,\" Trump said. \"I'm so sad. I'm in North Carolina right now.\"\nThe event was taking place outdoors near the Wilmington airport. Though heavy rainfall had not yet began at the time of the cancellation, lightning strikes became increasingly visible, fueling safety concerns.\n\"We want to keep everybody safe. It's the most important thing. We want everybody there to be 100% safe,\" Trump said.\nThis rally was scheduled to be Trump's second campaign event in North Carolina — a key swing state crucial to both Trump and Biden's path to victory. Trump narrowly carried the state in 2020 by a margin less than 1.5%.\nTrump was in court most of the week for jury selection in his criminal trial, where he is charged with 34 counts of first-degree falsifying business records. Prosecutors allege that he falsified business records ahead of the 2016 election to hide payments to adult firm star Stormy Daniels.\nOpening statements begin in the trial on Monday, and the trial is expected to last six to eight weeks.",

The crime carries a maximum penalty of eight years in prison, a $250,000 fine and up to three years supervised release, according to the plea agreement.\nAttorneys for Dykes did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday evening.\nDykes, 26, was arrested in July, on a series of federal charges, including misdemeanors. Prosecutors agreed to request the dismissal of the other counts in the indictment during sentencing as part of his plea agreement, according to court documents.\nHis sentencing is scheduled for July 19.\nAccording to court documents, Dykes subscribed to a series of public Telegram groups tied to the 2020 presidential election, allegations of voter fraud and events related to the certification of President Joe Biden's victory ahead of the Jan. 6 riot. One group that he subscribed to, which called for violence and overthrowing the government by force, included a message that referred to a quote attributed to Adolf Hitler, prosecutors said.\nDykes — who previously served a prison sentence following a felony conviction tied to the 2017 torch-lit march in Charlottesville a night before the \"United the Right\" rally — wore a gray puffer jacket and neck gaiter over his face during the Capitol riot, according to court documents.\nProsecutors said Dykes was among a group of rioters who sought to push their way into the Capitol through the East Rotunda doors. Dykes was also accused of forcibly stealing a U.S. Capitol Police officer's riot shield and using it to push his way into the Capitol and to impede the police line defending the Capitol once inside.\nAmong the more than 859 defendants who have been sentenced since the 2021 riot, more than 520 have been sentenced to periods of incarceration ranging from a few days to 22 years in federal prison.\nZoë Richards Ryan J.

Mike Johnson faces his most perilous moment yet as House speaker By Sahil Kapur House Speaker Mike Johnson faces the biggest threat to his gavel nearly six months into the job, with the walls closing in from both sides of his divided Republican Party on providing aid to U.S. allies.\nAfter wavering for months and exhausting his timeouts, he's finally calling the play: a trigger for separate votes on four bills — assistance for Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and a hodgepodge of other national security priorities important to Republicans.\nEach one will have a unique coalition, and that's the point.\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know In theory, Israel aid can pass with mostly Republicans, over progressive opposition. Ukraine aid — structured as a loan — can pass with mostly Democrats, over conservative opposition. The GOP opponents of assisting Ukraine can vote against it, and the GOP proponents of giving the country weapons to fend off Russian aggression finally get off Johnson's back.\nMeanwhile, Johnson's public Republican opposition just doubled: Rep. Thomas Massie announced Tuesday that he would co-sponsor Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to remove him as speaker. Massie said he's 'pretty certain' Johnson has more GOP opponents today than the eight who ousted Kevin McCarthy as speaker in October, though he didn't name names.\n'Mike Johnson is going for the Triple Crown here against our base. He has voted for an omnibus that spends more than Pelosi. He's put his finger on the scales to pass FISA without warrants. And now he's about to do Ukraine without protecting our own border,' Massie said. 'This will get called and he will lose the vote.'\nTwo votes may not seem like much, but after this Friday, Johnson will have a staggering one-vote majority. Two defections and Johnson loses — unless Democrats step in to rescue him and vote against a motion to vacate. That would be extremely unusual, but some centrist Democrats say they'd do it, especially if Johnson brings up Ukraine aid.\n'He's got to manage his politics. And if they try and kick him out as speaker, I'm going to vote to keep him,' said Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y.\nMassie said a Democratic rescue would ultimately do more harm than good to Johnson.\n'Then he goes further in the hole with Republicans,' Massie said. 'He becomes toxic to the conference. For every Democrat who comes to his aid he'll lose 2-3 more Republicans. … There's no sustainable solution where Democrats save him.'\nAnd that sums up Johnson's dilemma: He can't govern with his far-right rebels, but he can't hold on to his job without them. The same dynamic became too much for McCarthy to navigate. Today, Johnson has an even slimmer majority.\nStill, he recognizes that he can't be cowed by such threats or he becomes fully captured by the agitators. And this could be the last major piece of business until the 2024 election, when voters will redetermine the makeup of Congress.\n'I am not resigning. And it is in my view an absurd notion that someone would bring a vacate motion when we are simply here trying to do our jobs,' Johnson told reporters. 'I am not concerned about this. I am going to do my job.'\nFirst jurors are seated in Trump's hush money trial Donald Trump during jury selection on the second day of his trial at Manhattan Criminal Court on Tuesday. Curtis Means / Getty Images pool By Adam Reiss, Dareh Gregorian, Jonathan Allen and Lisa Rubin The first seven jurors were selected Tuesday in Trump's hush money trial amid a battle over prospective jurors' old Facebook posts and calls to 'lock him up' and a warning from the judge that the former president should not try to intimidate the panelists who will be deciding his fate.\n'I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom. I want to make this crystal clear,' Judge Juan Merchan told Trump and his lawyer Todd Blanche. The judge told Blanche that Trump had 'audibly' said something in the direction of a juror while she was '12 feet away from your client.'\nMerchan said he didn't know what Trump said, but that he'd been 'muttering' and 'gesturing' at the juror, and directed Blanche to talk to his client about his behavior. Blanche then whispered something into Trump's ear.\nThe incident underscores Trump's penchant for acting up in court and the problems his lawyers might have keeping him in check.\nThe drama came on the second day of jury selection. The jury is anonymous so their names weren't used in open court, but the panelists include a salesman, an oncology nurse, an IT consultant, a teacher and a software engineer.\nOverall, the quest to find a jury of 12 people and six alternates who could be 'fair and impartial' when it comes to the polarizing New York native and former commander-in-chief moved at a brisker pace compared to Monday.\nThe trial doesn't sit on Wednesdays, so the process will resume on Thursday.\nRead more on the second day of the Trump trial here →\nTrump needs a different type of swing voter in Manhattan Analysis by Steve Kornacki Trump's legal team argues that the former president faces 'real potential prejudice' in his hush money trial because of its venue: Manhattan, the bluest borough in one of the bluest big cities in America.\nWhether this could actually have any bearing on the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's ability to receive a fair trial is a matter of debate. But simply in terms of its political leanings, Manhattan's partisan bent is stark.\nAs a whole, New York City backed Joe Biden over Trump by a 76-23% margin in 2020. But of the five boroughs that comprise the Big Apple, it was Manhattan that produced Biden's most lopsided margins:\nEach of these boroughs features its own particular demographic and political mix. The lone red redoubt of Staten Island, for instance, has by far the smallest population and is more suburban in character, with considerable local support for secession from the rest of the city.\nThe other four boroughs are densely populated Democratic bastions. But even among these four, Manhattan stands out. Why is it a shade or two bluer than the others? A comparison of its demographics to those of the city as a whole reveals an explanation:\nSimply put, compared to New York City overall, Manhattan is whiter and wealthier and contains a much deeper concentration of white residents with college degrees. That's a demographic mix that, especially in the Trump era, has been political gold for Democrats.\nRegistered voters in Manhattan (one of the sources from which potential jurors are drawn) are more than 10 times more likely to be Democrats (72%) than Republicans (7%). Political engagement runs higher in Manhattan as well: While it accounts for 19.2% of the city's population, it represented 22.9% of all New York City votes cast in 2020.\nThe combination of its size, turnout level and partisan tendencies makes Manhattan one of the biggest single sources of Democratic votes anywhere in the country. To put this in perspective, the 603,040 votes Biden received in Manhattan in 2020 was larger than his total in 20 states.\nWhen it comes to his legal fate in Manhattan, Trump is going to need a very different kind of swing voter.\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

            "summary": "BEIRUT, Lebanon — Since Iran's unprecedented retaliatory attack against Israel was thwarted over the weekend with the help of the United States and its Middle Eastern allies, the Biden administration has crowed that the 'coalition' averted a regional war.\nAn Israeli response, however, would test the durability of an informal coalition of awkward bedfellows including Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, whose recent cooperation against Iran has the potential to be damaging on the home front, analysts say.\n'Those Arab countries are in a very critical situation,' said Oraib Al Rantawi, director of the Al Quds Center for Political Studies, a think tank based in Jordan's capital, Amman. 'There is no easy position to take for all of them, especially Jordan, which for geopolitical reasons has found itself trapped between two troublemakers — Iran and Israel.'\nAfter Iran's barrage of more than 300 missiles and drones did limited damage, as many of them were shot down by American, British, Israeli and Jordanian forces, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' on Monday that the coordinated operation was 'an extraordinary military success,' that sent 'a strong message about where Israel is in the region versus where Iran is in the region, which is increasingly isolated.'\nOnlookers and security agents stand around the debris of a missile that the Jordanian forces intercepted over Amman. Ahmad Shoura / AFP - Getty Images But there was no such boasting from America's partners in the Middle East, where even acknowledgement of the weekend's events was muted.\nOne sighting of their difficult domestic messaging came Monday, when Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told state television that the country would defend itself against any threat to its sovereignty and airspace, including from Israel.\nThose comments, echoed in foreign media interviews, were among the few public statements Jordanian officials have made about the country's role.\nIran said the salvo was retaliation for an attack on the Iranian consular building in the Syrian capital of Damascus that killed two senior commanders and five advisers from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Israel has not claimed responsibility for that attack, but it is widely believed to be responsible.\nIsrael may test Jordan's commitment in a matter of hours depending on whether and how the Jewish state decides to respond.\nAmong the three Arab states that participated in Israel's defense, Jordan is the only one that shares a border with Israel and the only one that took part in the air operation to destroy the drones.\nIn a measure of the Middle East's new realignment, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates shared with the U.S. intelligence about Iranian plans after they were briefed on them in order to safeguard their airspace, as first reported on Monday by The Wall Street Journal.\nJordan's King Abdullah speaking alongside President Biden at the White House in February. Kevin Lamarque / Reuters While the UAE normalized its diplomatic relations with Israel four years ago, Saudi Arabia was on the verge of doing so before the negotiations were derailed by Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks, which Israeli officials say claimed the lives of 1,200 people.\nBoth of the monied Gulf monarchies are 'heavily reliant on Western states,' according to Tahani Mustafa, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Belgium-based think tank. Saudi Arabia 'wants a U.S. security pact,' he said. 'Until that alliance is kind of fixed, Saudi will try to do all it can to remain in the U.S.' good books.'\nJordan's participation signaled a kind of volte-face for a state that has been unsparing in its criticism of Israel's six-month military campaign in the Gaza Strip. The country was the first to withdraw its ambassador from Israel, has repeatedly called for a cease-fire and has taken the lead on aid delivery into the besieged enclave.\nRather than signaling a newfound affection for its neighbor, Jordan's participation in the operation shows its wholesale reliance on American and Israeli diplomatic and economic support, said Rantawi of the Al Quds Center for Political Studies.\nPeople march through the streets of the Jordanian capital Amman in support of Palestinians in Gaza. Alaa Al Sukhni / Reuters Despite the fact that about half of the population are Palestinian refugees, Jordan became the second Arab country to recognize Israel in 1994. Its reliance on the wider West goes even deeper: Jordan's landscape is dotted with American, French and British military bases, and its economy is largely propped up by humanitarian and military aid.\nJordan's government also signed a 2021 defense agreement that essentially gives the American military free use of the country's land and airspace.\n'I don't think they'll have much choice than to go wherever the tide takes them,' said Mustafa, at the International Crisis Group. 'It's ultimately not up to them.'\nJordan is also eager to parry calls from right-wing Israeli lawmakers to take in more Palestinian refugees — part of a long-standing push to effectively turn Jordan into a de facto Palestinian state, she said.\nBut Jordan's participation in the American 'coalition' could still stand in the way of the government's desire to close the yawning gap between public policy and public opinion, Rantawi said, citing Jordanians' relentless criticism of Israel's war in Gaza.\nSo far, the messaging has appeared to work in all three countries. Tensions between the largely Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the UAE on the one side, and Iran, which is majority Shia, on the other, have dominated the Middle East for decades.\n'There has been a narrative going on for years that Iran is trying to destabilize Jordan,' said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a former official in the Palestinian Authority.\nThe ball is now very much in Israel's court. Were Israel to launch a tit-for-tat strike on Iran, it would risk further alienating public opinion among its hard-won Middle East partners, Omari said.\n'Things can become very messy if the Israelis try to retaliate over Jordanian airspace,' al-Omari said.\nMatt Bradley",

            "summary": "The Chinese Communist Party uses tax rebates to subsidize the manufacturing and export of fentanyl materials, a House panel said in a report released Tuesday.\nThe House Select Committee on China pointed to findings indicating that China plays a key role in the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., and lawmakers made several recommendations to curb the crisis.\n'Through subsidies, grants, and other incentives, the PRC harms Americans while enriching PRC companies,' the report says, referring to the People's Republic of China.\nThe report was released just ahead of a scheduled hearing Tuesday at which Chairman Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., and ranking member Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., are expected to detail what they argue is China's complicity in fueling the fentanyl crisis in the U.S.\nThe committee said in its report it has \"found no evidence of new criminal enforcement actions\" to curb the flow of fentanyl chemicals into the U.S.\n\"This failure — when combined with new evidence establishing the PRC incentivizing the export of illegal drugs abroad and ownership stake in companies doing the same — casts doubt on the veracity of the PRC's claims that it will act to stem the massive export of illicit fentanyl materials and other dangerous synthetic narcotics, and reinforces the need for global cooperation and communication between law enforcement agencies,\" the report says.\nThe panel had launched an investigation into China's role in the fentanyl crisis, which included, according to its report, examining public Chinese websites, analyzing government documents and identifying narcotics sales online.\nTuesday's report makes recommendations to curb the flow of fentanyl components made in China into the U.S.\nOne suggestion in the report is to establish a joint task force to counter opioids that would focus on targeting the weaknesses in the global illicit fentanyl supply chain.\nThe report also advises bolstering sanctions authorities and mobilizing trade and customs enforcement measures to restrict fentanyl trafficking, as well as closing regulatory and enforcement gaps.\nU.S. officials have identified China as the main source of the key ingredients drug cartels in Mexico use to synthesize fentanyl, while China has suggested the U.S. has fallen short in its efforts to suppress domestic demand for opioids.\nThe U.S. and China held high-level talks this year about the fentanyl crisis in an effort to resume counternarcotics cooperation after President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in California in November. China had suspended counternarcotics cooperation following a 2022 trip by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, which China claims as its territory despite the current Taiwanese government's rejecting the sovereignty claim.\nZoë Richards Ken Dilanian",

            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump's campaign operation is requesting that any down-ballot candidates or Republican groups who use Trump's name, image or likeness in fundraising asks give a portion of the funds raised to Trump's main fundraising committee.\nAccording to a memo obtained by NBC News from a source who received it, Trump's co-campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita requested a split of \" a minimum of 5% of all fundraising solicitations to Trump National Committee JFC. This includes but is not limited to sending to the house file, prospecting vendors, and advertising.\"\n\"a minimum of 5% of all fundraising solicitations to Trump National Committee JFC. This includes but is not limited to sending to the house file, prospecting vendors, and advertising.\" The memo adds, \"Any split that is higher than 5% will be seen favorably by the RNC and President Trump's campaign and is routinely reported to the highest levels of leadership within both organizations.\"\nThe letter was sent on Monday and asked candidates and committees to adhere by the guidelines beginning Tuesday. Politico was first to report on the memo.\nBeyond the directive about splitting fundraising when using Trump's name, image and likeness to raise money, LaCivita and Wiles issued several additional guidelines for campaigns and committees using Trump for their own ends.\nThey forbid campaigns from \"speaking on behalf of President Trump ... questioning the readers' support of President Trump or tying their support to a financial contribution ... creating new memberships, clubs or rewards that are not authorized by the campaign ... impersonating President Trump or his campaign,\" and more.\ncampaigns from \"speaking on behalf of President Trump ... questioning the readers' support of President Trump or tying their support to a financial contribution ... creating new memberships, clubs or rewards that are not authorized by the campaign ... impersonating President Trump or his campaign,\" and more. Trump advisers have long sparred with groups raising money off his name without authorization, as other figures on the right sought to capitalize on the former president's appeal to small-dollar donors.\nThe memo comes as Trump's campaign and the RNC have trailed President Joe Biden's reelection campaign and the Democratic National Committee in fundraising.\nThe Trump campaign warned that digital vendors who disobey the directives in the menu will face consequences, including getting cut off from party business.\n\"Repeated violations will result in the suspension of business relationships between the vendor and Trump National Committee JFC. This includes list rental agreements,\" the memo reads. \"As the top Republican digital vendors, we ask that you inform your clients of these new guidelines, and to use your best judgment when mentioning President Trump.\"\nAlexandra Marquez",

            "excerpt": "The court is considering whether a charge of seeking to obstruct an official proceeding, which Trump also faces, can be applied to the events of Jan. 6, 2021.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday weighs whether those involved in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol can be charged with obstructing an official proceeding, a case that could have bearing on the election interference prosecution of former President Donald Trump.\nThe justices are hearing an appeal brought by defendant Joseph Fischer, a former police officer who is seeking to dismiss a charge accusing him of obstructing an official proceeding, namely the certification by Congress of Joe Biden's election victory, which was disrupted by a mob of Trump supporters.\nThe court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in the past been skeptical of prosecutors when they assert broad applications of criminal provisions.\nTrump himself faces charges of violating the same law, as well as conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. They are among four charges he faces in his election interference case in Washington, separate from the hush money prosecution currently moving ahead in New York.\nTuesday's hearing comes just a week before the Supreme Court hears Trump's bid to toss out his election interference charges based on a claim of presidential immunity.\nFischer and Trump both say that the obstruction law does not apply to their alleged conduct, meaning that the charges should be dropped.\nOn Jan. 6, prosecutors say, Fischer joined the crowd breaching the Capitol from the east side. 'Charge!' he yelled again and again, before pushing forward toward a police line while yelling, 'Motherf-----s!' the government says.\nHe and other rioters then fell to the ground. After other rioters lifted him up, video disclosed as evidence in other Jan. 6 trials shows that he tried to appeal to officers protecting the Capitol, telling them that he was an officer too.\nFischer faces seven criminal charges, only one of which is the focus of the Supreme Court case. He also faces charges of assaulting a police officer and entering a restricted building, among others.\nThe law in question criminalizes efforts to obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding. Conviction can result in a prison sentence of up to 20 years.\nThe provision was enacted in 2002 as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was passed after the Enron accounting scandal.\nFischer's lawyers say the law should be limited to circumstances involving tampering with physical evidence, which is what they argue the law aims to address.\nA ruling in favor of Fischer could benefit Trump, although that is not guaranteed. Prosecutors in Trump's case have said that even if Fischer wins, Trump's conduct would still be covered by a narrower interpretation of the statute.",

'European skies could have received the same level of protection long ago if Ukraine had received similar full support from its partners in intercepting drones and missiles,'\n'We can now see how unity can work,' Zelenskyy added.\nBut the U.S. and its Western partners have made clear their reluctance to go as far in Ukraine as they did in the Middle East.\n'U.S. and NATO have been adamant that they will not get into conflict with Russia,' said Frank Ledwidge, a former British military intelligence officer and senior lecturer in war studies at England's University of Portsmouth.\n'Nobody wants to get involved fighting Russia,\" he said.\nA NATO conflict with Russia would be a 'dangerous escalation,' Britain's foreign secretary David Cameron told radio station LBC on Monday, saying it was vital to prevent a 'wider European war.'\nWhen asked why British forces could not shoot down Russian unmanned drones just as they had to support Israel, he said it was an 'interesting question,' adding that Ukraine must be armed with air defense systems which are more effective than jets.\nPresident Joe Biden has also made it clear that the U.S. will not take on a combat role in Ukraine, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Monday. 'Different conflicts, different airspace, different threat picture,' Kirby said.\nThat will offer little comfort to Ukraine, which increasingly fears it could face defeat this year.\nAn emerging focal point is Kharkiv, where the impact of Western air defenses, or the lack thereof, may be felt the most.",

The recent cycle of violence between Israel and Iran began on April 1 when Israel bombed an Iranian consular building in the Syrian capital of Damascus, killing two generals and five officers in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\nIran responded 12 days later, launching an unprecedented, direct military attack on Israel involving more than 300 missiles and drones. The assault caused no significant damage, however. Nearly all of the missiles and drones were intercepted by Israeli, U.S. and other allied forces.\nAlthough Israel has been locked in a shadow war with Israel for decades, with Iran arming and training proxy forces hostile to Israel in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and the Palestinian enclave of Gaza, the Iranian aerial barrage marked the first time Tehran had staged an overt military attack on Israel.\nIn the following days, the Biden administration urged Israel to exercise restraint and not conduct a retaliatory attack that could trigger a full-blown war between the two adversaries.\nIsrael retaliated on Thursday night, striking a military airfield near the city of Isfahan in central Iran. Nuclear facilities in the area were not damaged, according to Iranian state media, and there were no reports of casualties.\nThe attack was downplayed by Iranian state media and met with mostly silence from Israeli officials. The limited scope of the strike and the lack of public statements afterward appears to indicate that both sides are looking to ease tensions, experts said.\nU.S. officials called for calm as well. \"We do not want to see this conflict escalate,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Friday.\nAmirabdollahian offered a similar sentiment but warned that Iran would respond with maximum force if Israel engages in what he described as more \"adventurism.\"\n\"If Israel makes another mistake, our next response will be decisive and immediate,\" he said.\nRich Schapiro Dan De Luce",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday weighs the constitutionality of municipal ordinances that punish homeless people for camping on public property when they have nowhere else to go.\nThe court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, will review an appeals court ruling that said several ordinances enacted by the small city of Grants Pass, Oregon, are prohibited under the Constitution's Eighth Amendment, which bars cruel and unusual punishment.\nThe ordinances bar sleeping or camping on publicly owned property, including sidewalks, streets, bridges and city parks. Punishment, which is the key issue in the case, can include fines of up to several hundred dollars and exclusion orders barring people from public property.\nExacerbated by lack of housing and the high cost of rent, homelessness and how to deal with it have become flashpoints in many communities across the country.\nAdvocates for the homeless argue that the ordinances in effect punish people for existing when they have no other place to go and that the measures do nothing to address the underlying issue of housing shortages.\nThey note that cities already have the power to regulate encampments, something that is not at issue before the Supreme Court.\n\"Can a city make it illegal on every inch of city land every minute of the day for people to live outside when they have nowhere else to go? We think the answer is no,\" said Ed Johnson, a lawyer at the Oregon Law Center who represents the plaintiffs.\nThe ruling issued by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2022 applies to all nine states within its jurisdiction, including California. Several of those states have large populations of homeless people.\nAmong those asking the Supreme Court to overturn the appeals court are local officials in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix and other cities.\nThe Biden administration has mostly backed the challengers, filing a brief in support of neither side saying laws that bar sleeping on public property are unlawful \"if they are applied in a manner that prevents an individual without available shelter from residing in the jurisdiction.\"\nThe appeals court ruled 2-1 that Grants Pass, which is about 250 miles south of Portland, cannot 'enforce its anti-camping ordinances against homeless persons for the mere act of sleeping outside with rudimentary protection from the elements, or for sleeping in their car at night, when there is no other place in the city for them to go.'\nThe decision applies only in situations in which homeless people 'are engaging in conduct necessary to protect themselves from the elements when there is no shelter space available,' the court added.\nThe case arose after a group of homeless people challenged the application of the ordinances. They say there is no shelter space, so they have little option but to sleep outside.\nDavid Wilson sits outside his tent at Riverside Park in Grants Pass, Ore., on March 21. Jenny Kane / AP file City officials maintain that the ordinances pass legal muster and are aimed at curbing the proliferation of homeless encampments.\nOfficials argue that their policies are aimed at encouraging homeless people to seek housing, although the city itself does not have its own shelter. It directs people to one run by a religious organization that has limited space and imposes various conditions.\n\"Fines and short jail terms for camping on public property are not cruel and unusual punishments,\" the city's lawyers wrote in court papers.\nLawrence Hurley",

It's the first step to have the possibility to liberate our territory.'\nAmmunition shortages linked to the aid holdup over the past six months have led Ukrainian military commanders to ration shells, a disadvantage that Russia seized on this year — taking the city of Avdiivka and currently inching towards the town of Chasiv Yar, also in the Donetsk region.\n'The Russians come at us in waves — we become exhausted, we have to leave our positions. This is repeated many times,' Oleksandr said. 'Not having enough ammunition means we can't cover the area that is our responsibility to hold when they are assaulting us.'\nOther Western leaders lauded the passing of the aid package.\n'Ukraine is using the weapons provided by NATO Allies to destroy Russian combat capabilities. This makes us all safer, in Europe & North America,' NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg wrote on X.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that 'Ukraine deserves all the support it can get against Russia.'\nIn Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the approval of aid to Ukraine 'expected and predictable.'\nThe decision 'will make the United States of America richer, further ruin Ukraine and result in the deaths of even more Ukrainians, the fault of the Kyiv regime,' Peskov was quoted as saying by Russian news agency Ria Novosti.\n'The new aid package will not save, but, on the contrary, will kill thousands and thousands more people, prolong the conflict, and bring even more grief and devastation,' Leonid Slutsky, head of the Russian State Duma Committee on International Affairs, wrote on Telegram.\nThe whole aid package will go to the U.S. Senate, which could pass it as soon as Tuesday. President Joe Biden has promised to sign it immediately.\nThe Associated Press",

            "excerpt": "Out of more than 300 missiles and drones Iran fired, only four or five hit Israel, and none caused major damage, William Burns said.",
            "summary": "Iran's missile and drone barrage against Israel last weekend 'turned out to be a spectacular failure,' with nearly all of the projectiles failing to hit Israel, CIA Director William Burns said Thursday.\nSpeaking at an event at the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas, Burns said that the thwarting of the missile and drone assault showed the strength of Israel's military and that it had 'friends' in the world, including the U.S. and other countries that helped, as well.\n'The Iranians fired off something like 330 drones and missiles combined,' Burns said. 'Of those 330 missiles, only four or five actually impacted in Israel, and none of them did any significant damage.\n'It's a reminder of the quality of the Israeli military,' he added. 'It's a reminder of the fact that the Israelis have friends starting with the United States, but others, as well.'\nPresident Joe Biden and other senior U.S. officials hope tensions may ease slightly in the region but said Israel was still weighing how it would respond to Tehran.\nThe Israeli government, 'as we sit here this afternoon, is considering a response to what happened last Saturday night,' Burns said.\n'I think the broad hope of the president and policymakers in the administration is that we'll find a way to de-escalate the situation,' he said.\nAmmunition shortages in Ukraine Burns, a former career diplomat who was ambassador to Russia, said he had visited Ukraine about a month ago and heard firsthand from Ukrainian military officers about their critical ammunition shortages.\nBurns said he was in Ukraine just days after Russian forces captured the town of Adiivka in eastern Ukraine.\n'I talked to one of the senior officers who was there, and he described it in pretty simple terms,' Burns said. 'He said, ‘We fought as long and as hard as we could, but the Russians just kept coming, and we ran out of ammunition.''\nHe said a 2,000-strong Ukrainian brigade in the Adiivka battle tried to fend off Russians with 'a grand total' of 15 artillery rounds a day and 42 mortar rounds.\n'They were overwhelmed, but it wasn't for lack of bravery or determination on their part,' Burns said.\nHe said he feared there would be more battlefield losses in Ukraine unless Congress approved a long-delayed military aid package.\nSleepless night Asked what kept him up at night, Burns mentioned the threat of terrorist attacks, the war in Ukraine, the conflict in Gaza and the risks posed to CIA employees around the world.\nBut he also recounted an experience that literally kept him up all night when he agreed to attend a training session for new CIA clandestine officers at the agency's training ground, known as 'The Farm,' near Williamsburg, Virginia.\nThe overnight instructional course, which included members of the Army's elite Delta Force, featured a training exercise in which CIA colleagues had been taken 'hostage.'\nBut no one told the trainees or the Delta Force commandos that the role player posing as a 'hostage' for the exercise was Burns himself, who had been tied to a chair for the simulation, he said.\n'It's, like, 4:30 in the morning, and this exercise culminates with a hostage rescue mission by Delta group,' Burns said. The Delta Force 'major who was commanding it had only been told that there's this simulated situation where there are some CIA officers with someone impersonating a senior CIA officer. They've been captured and they're held hostage,' Burns said.\n'So it's worth the price of admission to see the look on the face of that young major as he came up the stairs in this hostage rescue effort and saw a real live CIA director tied to a chair,' he said.\nDan De Luce",

            "summary": "Jury selection is set to resume in former President Donald Trump's hush money trial in New York City after a break in action Wednesday.\nWith seven jurors already having been selected from a pool of 96, the schedule for Thursday will focus largely on questioning potential jurors in a second group of the same size to see whether they can be fair and impartial when it comes to Trump. The judge has said he hopes to have 12 jurors, as well as alternates, selected by the end of Friday.\nProsecutors and lawyers for Trump will have less opportunity to dismiss potential jurors going forward, because both used six of their 10 peremptory challenges Tuesday.\nWhile both sides can make an unlimited number of challenges for cause, it is up to the judge to decide whether to grant those challenges and strike those jurors. State Judge Juan Merchan dismissed two jurors for cause Tuesday, one of whom had posted a 'lock him up' message about Trump on Facebook, but he denied some other challenges.\nTrump bemoaned the number of challenges he can make Wednesday.\n'I thought STRIKES were supposed to be ‘unlimited' when we were picking our jury? I was then told we only had 10, not nearly enough when we were purposely given the 2nd Worst Venue in the Country,' he wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, before he blasted the case as 'election interference.'\nUnder New York law, defendants charged with lower-level felonies like Trump are entitled to only 10 peremptory strikes.\nThe scheduled day off Wednesday followed some fireworks in the Manhattan courtroom, where Merchan chided Trump for appearing to speak to one of the potential jurors who was being questioned about a Facebook post in which she had apparently celebrated Joe Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump.\n\"I won't tolerate that. I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom. I want to make that crystal clear,\" Merchan said.\nEventually, seven jurors were sworn in Tuesday: two lawyers, a teacher, an oncology nurse, an IT consultant, a teacher and a software engineer.\nThe jury foreperson — who typically leads and steers the jury and acts as its spokesperson — is a married man who lives in West Harlem and works in sales. He told Merchan he reads The New York Times and watches Fox News and MSNBC.\nThe jurors' names were not made public because Merchan, citing security concerns, has decided to use an anonymous jury.\nTrump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records and has pleaded not guilty. He faces up to four years in prison if he is convicted.\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office alleges that Trump falsified business records to hide money he was paying his former lawyer Michael Cohen to reimburse him for $130,000 he paid adult film actor Stormy Daniels near the end of the 2016 presidential campaign. Daniels has claimed she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. Trump has denied that he slept with Daniels, but he has acknowledged repaying Cohen.\nThe DA's office also alleges that American Media Inc. paid $150,000 to model and actor Karen McDougal, who appeared in Playboy magazine and claimed that she had a nine-month affair with Trump before he was elected president, 'in exchange for her agreement not to speak out about the alleged sexual relationship.'\nTrump has also denied having a sexual relationship with McDougal.\nAdam Reiss Dareh Gregorian",

Man on terror watchlist was dropped by migrant monitoring program When an Afghan national on the FBI terrorist watchlist was arrested last week after having spent nearly a year in the U.S., immigration officials said he had been enrolled in a program that tracked his location via ankle monitor, mobile app or telephone.

Mohammad Kharwin is believed to have then spent 10 months in the U.S. without any kind of monitoring system.\nNow experts say the case raises questions about how migrants who may pose a security threat are vetted and tracked in the U.S. It also raises questions about the Alternatives to Detention, which has seen funding cuts from Republicans in Congress who oppose it, forcing ICE to drop migrants from being monitored.\nHomeland security correspondent Julia Ainsley, who broke the story last week, explains the latest developments .\nexplains the latest developments. Johnson eyes a weekend vote on foreign aid bills House Speaker Mike Johnson rolled out three bills to provide assistance to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan, with the hopes of holding final votes on Saturday. The bills will be a major test for Johnson, as he faces a deeply divided GOP and serious threats to his leadership from two right-wing representatives.\nThe biggest sticking point will be funding for Ukraine. Already, several Republicans have said they will not approve any more aid for Kyiv. In order for that funding to pass, a significant share of Democrats will be required to carry that measure over the finish line.\nAlso expected to come up this weekend through an amendment process is the House-passed bill to ban TikTok in the U.S. unless the company divests from its China-based owner. Meanwhile, House Democrats want Johnson to consider a Senate-passed foreign aid package instead, saying it's the best path to getting a bill on Biden's desk.

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — After a weeklong delay, the House of Representatives on Tuesday afternoon will send its articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to the Senate, a spokesperson for Speaker Mike Johnson confirmed.\nIt will kick off what's expected to be a very short trial in the upper chamber — one that could wrap up by week's end. However, Republicans, who are demanding a full Senate trial, are fighting to drag out the process in a bid to shine the spotlight on what they see as Mayorkas' failure to curtail migrant crossings and secure the southern border.\nAs was done for the two Donald Trump impeachments, the impeachment managers will escort a pair of articles from the House chamber, across the Rotunda and onto the Senate floor sometime after 2 p.m. ET.\nThe Senate will receive the articles, and all 100 senators will be sworn in as jurors in the trial on Wednesday afternoon. It is unclear exactly how long the trial will last, though Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has said the Senate will deal with the matter 'expeditiously.'\nIt's expected that Senate Democrats, who control the chamber, will band together and vote to dismiss or table the issue, then move on to other business, including the chamber's need to renew a critical spy tool before it expires Friday. None of the Senate's 51 Democrats have said they support the Mayorkas impeachment, and even a handful of GOP senators have said the impeachment is meritless.\n\"Impeachment should never be used to settle a policy disagreement; that would set a horrible precedent for the Congress,\" Schumer said in a floor speech Monday. \"Nevertheless, the Senate's plan has not changed since last week. We are ready to go whenever the House sends us the articles. We want to address this issue as expeditiously as possible.\"\nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican, had originally planned to send the Mayorkas articles to the Senate on April 10, but Senate conservatives, led by Mike Lee of Utah, successfully lobbied the speaker to postpone the action to prevent a speedy dismissal by Democrats at the end of the week as lawmakers were preparing to leave Washington.\nMayorkas, Biden's top border official and the first Latino to lead the Homeland Security Department, became only the second Cabinet secretary in history — and the first since 1876 — to be impeached by the House. Republicans' first attempt to impeach him collapsed spectacularly on the House floor, but they were successful on the second try, on Feb. 13, with just a single vote to spare; the tally was 214-213, with three Republicans joining all Democrats in voting no.\nIn their two articles, House Republicans charged Mayorkas with 'high crimes and misdemeanors' for failing to enforce immigration and border security laws, resulting, they said, in 'millions' of undocumented immigrants illegally crossing into the U.S. each year; and for knowingly lying under oath to Congress.\nMayorkas' Democratic allies have lambasted the GOP's impeachment as a politically motivated 'sham' launched months before the presidential election and argued that Republicans' criticism of the DHS secretary amounts to policy differences rather than impeachable offenses. Several conservatives have argued against impeaching Mayorkas as well, blasting the move as inappropriate. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., a Trump ally, called it 'the worst, dumbest exercise and use of time.'\nThe 11 House impeachment managers, the prosecutors appointed by Johnson, are a mix of senior Republicans and conservative hard-liners.\nThey are: Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green of Tennessee; the Homeland panel's vice chair, Michael Guest of Mississippi; Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul of Texas, who previously was Homeland chairman; Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York; Rep. August Pfluger of Texas; Rep. Laurel Lee of Florida; four conservative Freedom Caucus members: Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Clay Higgins of Louisiana, Ben Cline of Virginia and Harriet Hageman of Wyoming; and far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., one of Trump's top allies on the Hill who led the push to impeach Mayorkas.",

            "excerpt": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked U.S. leaders for passing a $60.8 billion aid package through the House earlier in the weekend.",
            "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday thanked U.S. political leaders for approving an aid package to Ukraine over the weekend, saying the newfound aid will give the country a chance at \"victory\" as the country defends itself from Russia.\n'I think this support will really strengthen the armed forces, I pray, and we will have a chance at victory if Ukraine really gets the weapons system, which we need so much, which thousands of soldiers need so much,' Zelenskyy, who spoke via an interpreter, said on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\"\nThe House on Saturday passed a bill providing Ukraine with $60.8 billion of aid weeks after the Senate passed a massive bill with aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, plus funding for increased border security. Speaker Mike Johnson opted not to put that bill bundling aid for the three countries on the floor, instead choosing to pass three separate aid bills.\nUkranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on April 18 in Kyiv, Ukraine. Kay Nietfeld / dpa / picture alliance via Getty Images The House bills are expected to pass the Senate this week, something Zelenskyy specifically urged.\n'We really need to get this to the final point. We need to get approved by the Senate,' he said Sunday.\n'Then we want to help get things as fast as possible so that we get some tangible assistance for the soldiers on the frontline as soon as possible — not in another six months — so that they would be able to move ahead,' he added.\nIn a statement after House passage of the bills, President Joe Biden said, 'I urge the Senate to quickly send this package to my desk so that I can sign it into law and we can quickly send weapons and equipment to Ukraine to meet their urgent battlefield needs.'\nZelenskyy spoke about those urgent needs Sunday, telling moderator Kristen Welker, 'We need long-range weapons to not lose people on the frontline because we have, we have casualties because we cannot reach that far. Our weapons are not that long-range.'\n'We need [that] and air defense. Those are our priorities right now,' he added.\nAsked whether this aid will help Ukraine win the war or just prolong it, Zelenskyy told Welker, 'It depends on when we actually get weapons on the ground. As you said it, Kristen, if we get it in half a year — well, we've had the process stalled for half a year and we've had losses in several directions. Losses in men, in equipment.'\n'Now we have the chance to stabilize the situation and to overtake the initiative, and that's why we need to actually have the weapons systems, Zelenskyy added. 'Giving the U.S. a specific timeline of the war, well it depends how soon they get this aid. There are so many variables, so many factors.'\nFor weeks, Zelenskyy has expressed the urgent need for weapons and supplies to continue defending Ukraine from Russian attacks.\nIn the months that U.S. aid to Ukraine lapsed, Ukraine's military supplied grew depleted and the military was forced to withdraw from one key eastern city — Avdiivka — in February.\nEarlier this month, Russia was firing five artillery shells for every one fired by Ukrainian forces, Gen. Christopher Cavoli, commander of the European Command, told NBC News. He warned that the disparity could increase in the near future without more aid.\nOn Sunday, Zelenskyy pushed back on complaints that the U.S. has sunk too much money into the war and will continue to have to do so, telling Welker, '[Americans] first and foremost are protecting freedom and democracy all over Europe.'\n'The U.S. Army now does not have to fight protecting NATO countries. Ukrainians are doing that. And it's only ammo that the civilized world is providing, and I think it's a good decision,' he said.\nAlexandra Marquez",

            "excerpt": "The exhibit's organizers say they want to offer visitors a 'sacred space' for remembrance, as well as a way to 'responsibly explore' the atrocities Hamas committed in Israel.",
            "summary": "Scooter Braun, the high-profile music manager, helped bring the exhibit to the U.S. from Tel Aviv, where it was available to the public late last year as Israel reeled from the killings of more than 1,200 people. In an interview, Braun said he was deeply moved after having traveled to Israel, visited the kibbutzim where civilians were slaughtered and spent time with young Nova festival survivors.\n'I saw these 20-year-old kids singing and crying and laughing together and holding each other,' Braun said. 'I felt this sense of anger. How could we ignore them? … I felt like we were letting them down.' (The proceeds from the exhibition will go to Nova Healing Journey, an initiative that supports mental health treatment for Oct. 7 victims and their families.)\nThe ambitious installation arrives in the U.S. at an especially fraught chapter in the Israel-Hamas war.\nIsrael's military campaign has devastated Gaza, killing more than 33,000 people and fueling a humanitarian crisis. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has become increasingly isolated on the global stage over its military actions. Netanyahu's war Cabinet is weighing how to respond to Iran's retaliatory drone and missile attacks on Israel, an unprecedented incursion that raised fears of a wider regional conflagration.\nBraun, the grandchild of Holocaust survivors who were imprisoned at Nazi concentration camps, said he hopes people who visit the exhibit leave with 'empathy' for everyone whose lives have been violently upended by the Middle East conflict: the Israeli victims of Oct. 7, the families of people kidnapped by Hamas militants, the 'innocent people in Gaza' who have been under siege for more than six months.\nThe exhibit's organizers were nonetheless bracing for possible protests by pro-Palestinian activists, who have rallied in major cities in opposition to Israel's conduct and the Biden administration's support for Netanyahu's government. Braun said he hopes organizers will be able to transport the Nova installation to other cities across the U.S., though for the time being he is focused on the New York installation.\nCamping items taken from the festival re-create the festival layout. Alexi Rosenfeld / Getty Images for The Nova Music Festival Exhibition The version of 'The Moment Music Stood Still' on display in Manhattan re-creates the Nova grounds in haunting detail. The floors of the venue are coated in dirt. Trees are affixed to the ground with sandbags. The festival's main stage and DJ booth are bathed in neon light. In keeping with the exhibit's name, the rooms feel frozen in time, caught between ecstasy and terror.\nIn the corner of one room, visitors can see 'Lost and Found' tables crammed with personal belongings found in the desert, many of them stored in small plastic bags: watches, car keys, glasses, purses. The rows of shoes recall a similar display at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., symbolizing the 6 million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust.\nIn a joint interview with NBC News, three of the festival attack survivors described their harrowing ordeals, recalling the frantic hours as they scrambled to reach their loved ones, flee the hail of bullets and hide from the Hamas attackers. Ofir Amar, 40, said he hopes the exhibit remains in keeping with the spirit of the Nova festival — a celebration of 'life, freedom, peace.'\n'You can feel it no matter where you come from,' Amar said. 'It's when we are on the same ground and listening to the same music, we are all the same. It doesn't matter where you're from, what religion, what color, what country. We are the same.'\nDaniel Arkin Chloe Melas",

            "excerpt": "The former president, who has largely sat silently in the courtroom during a week's worth of court proceedings, told reporters that he will take the stand.",
            "summary": "Four days into the first criminal trial of a president, Donald Trump was showing signs of frustrations.\nHe had listened to scores of New Yorkers express less-than-favorable opinions about him, was restricted in what he could say in court and had even been told to sit down by the judge.\n'Sir, can you please have a seat,' said Juan Merchan, the soft-spoken judge who is presiding over Trump's hush money trial, when the former president thought Friday's proceedings were over and got up to leave.\nAs Trump returned to the defense table, Merchan thanked him.\nTrump exited the room minutes later looking weary and promising to testify at the trial, which he slammed as a 'witch hunt.'\nHis comments capped a week that was filled with power reversals and accusations turned upside down.\nTrump, who prosecutors say used hush money payments to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, is attempting to make a parallel case in the court of public opinion.\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday, the presumptive Republican nominee for president groused that 'instead of being in Pennsylvania or Georgia, or North Carolina or lots of other places today, I'm sitting in a courthouse all day long,' adding that process 'will go on for another four or five weeks.'\nThe trial is expected to last as many as six weeks.\nTrump, who is required to be in court for the duration of the trial, also accused the district attorney's office of waging interference in the 2024 presidential election on behalf of President Joe Biden by 'keeping me off the campaign trail.'\nHe went on to argue that he was 'not allowed to speak' after the judge said he must curtail his social media attacks against potential witnesses in the case, and later told supporters in a fundraising email that he was 'FULLY GAGGED.'\nMuch of Friday's drama unfolded outside the courthouse, where a man set himself on fire in a park facing the court. He was taken to a hospital after police extinguished the flames.\nIn the courtroom, Trump sat at the defense table as prospective jurors were asked questions aimed at sussing out their ability to be impartial.\nOne alternate juror was excused for anxiety, which she believed would hamper her ability 'to be completely fair.' Another was questioned about a social media post referencing the former president, saying, 'I do believe he's the devil.'\n'I don't recall posting that,' the man said, before being dismissed.\nTrump had taken a particular interest in the man, who had volunteered for the campaign of his 2016 Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.\nSocial media posts made the case for dismissing several other potential jurors, even after they said they could judge Trump fairly.\nA retired New York high school teacher said he could 'absolutely' be fair and impartial, but was compelled to answer questions about excavated social media posts that revealed in 2017 he had attended 'a massive anti-trump rally,' according to the caption of a picture in which he had tagged himself online.\nHe was excused.\nBy Friday afternoon, Merchan had seated a full 12-person jury and assigned six alternates. All 18 will meet for the first time on Monday morning, when opening statements are set to get underway.\nTrump's defense team looked noticeably downcast during the afternoon's proceedings, with attorney Susan Necheles slumped back into her seat, arms crossed until addressing the judge late in the day. Lead attorney Todd Blanche was seated next to Trump, and the two sat watching and occasionally whispering to one another.\nAfter Merchan said he would not consider a motion on presidential immunity and other motions, Blanche insisted there was still more to discuss.\n'This sounds suspiciously like the 10 minutes we spent arguing this on Monday … with no new facts, no new application of the law,' Merchan responded.\n'There's nothing else to re-argue,' he added as the first week of the trial came to a close. 'We're going to have opening statements Monday morning. This trial is starting.'",

            "summary": "Work is set to begin Monday on a $12 billion high-speed passenger rail line between Las Vegas and the Los Angeles area, with officials projecting millions of ticket-buyers will be boarding trains by 2028.\nBrightline West, whose sister company already operates a fast train between Miami and Orlando in Florida, aims to lay 218 miles of new track between a terminal to be built just south of the Las Vegas Strip and another new facility in Rancho Cucamonga, California. Almost the full distance is to be built in the median of Interstate 15, with a station stop in San Bernardino County's Victorville area.\nIn a statement, Brightline Holdings founder and Chairperson Wes Edens called the moment 'the foundation for a new industry.'\nBrightline aims to link other U.S. cities that are too near to each other for flying between them to make sense and too far for people to drive the distance, Edens said.\nCEO Mike Reininger has said the goal is to have trains operating in time for the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028.\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is scheduled to take part in Monday's groundbreaking. Brightline received $6.5 billion in backing from the Biden administration, including a $3 billion grant from federal infrastructure funds and approval to sell another $2.5 billion in tax-exempt bonds. The company won federal authorization in 2020 to sell $1 billion in similar bonds.\nThe project is touted as the first true high-speed passenger rail line in the nation, designed to reach speeds of 186 mph comparable to Japan's Shinkansen bullet trains.\nThe route between Vegas and L.A. is largely open space, with no convenient alternate to I-15. Brightline's Southern California terminal will be at a commuter rail connection to downtown Los Angeles.\nThe project outline says electric-powered trains will cut the four-hour trip across the Mojave Desert to a little more than two hours. Forecasts are for 11 million one-way passengers per year, or some 30,000 per day, with fares well below airline travel costs. The trains will offer rest rooms, Wi-Fi, food and beverage sales and the option to check luggage.\nLas Vegas is a popular driving destination for Southern Californians. Officials hope the train line will relieve congestion on I-15, where motorists often sit in miles of crawling traffic while returning home from a Las Vegas weekend.\nThe Las Vegas area, now approaching 3 million residents, draws more than 40 million visitors per year. Passenger traffic at the city's Harry Reid International Airport set a record of 57.6 million people in 2023. An average of more than 44,000 automobiles per day crossed the California-Nevada state line on I-15 in 2023, according to Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority data.\nFlorida-based Brightline Holdings already operates the Miami-to-Orlando line with trains reaching speeds up to 125 mph. It launched service in 2018 and expanded service to Orlando International Airport last September. It offers 16 round-trips per day, with one-way tickets for the 235-mile distance costing about $80.\nOther fast trains in the U.S. include Amtrak's Acela, which can top 150 mph while sharing tracks with freight and commuter service between Boston and Washington, D.C.\nIdeas for connecting other U.S. cities with high-speed passenger trains have been floated in recent years, including Dallas to Houston; Atlanta to Charlotte, North Carolina; and Chicago to St. Louis. Most have faced delays.\nIn California, voters in 2008 approved a proposed 500-mile rail line linking Los Angeles and San Francisco, but the plan has been beset by rising costs and routing disputes. A 2022 business plan by the California High-Speed Rail Authority projected the cost had more than tripled to $105 billion.\nThe Associated Press",

            "excerpt": "Uri Berliner wrote in an essay in The Free Press last week that NPR has an 'absence of viewpoint diversity.'",
            "summary": "An editor for National Public Radio resigned Wednesday just days after he inflamed the ongoing culture war about mainstream media with an essay about what he considers the news outlet's liberal leanings.\nUri Berliner, who was a senior business editor, wrote an essay for the right-leaning online publication The Free Press in which he said he believes NPR is losing the public's trust.\nNPR, a nonprofit radio network, has an 'absence of viewpoint diversity,' he wrote in the essay, which was published April 9. It 'has always had a liberal bent,' but now an 'open-minded spirit no longer exists within NPR,' he wrote.\nThe essay triggered a wave of scrutiny of NPR from conservatives, some of whom responded to it with calls to defund the news organization, which receives federal funding through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. NPR says on its website that federal funding is 'essential' to NPR but that 'less than 1% of NPR's annual operating budget comes in the form of grants from CPB and federal agencies and departments.'\nUri Berliner in 2017. JP Yim / WireImage file In a resignation statement on X, Berliner briefly elaborated on the reason for his departure, which came days after NPR reported that it had suspended him for five days without pay following the op-ed's release.\nNPR's chief business editor, Pallavi Gogoi, had told Berliner about its requirement to secure approval before he appeared in outside media, according to NPR's report.\n'I don't support calls to defund NPR,' Berliner wrote. 'I respect the integrity of my colleagues and wish for NPR to thrive and do important journalism. But I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new CEO whose divisive views confirm the very problems at NPR I cite in my Free Press essay.'\nBerliner did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. A representative for NPR said it 'does not comment on individual personnel matters.'\nBerliner's essay gained traction on X, with many conservatives homing in on his thoughts about NPR's political makeup. He wrote: 'In D.C., where NPR is headquartered and many of us live, I found 87 registered Democrats working in editorial positions and zero Republicans. None.'\nHe also criticized NPR's coverage, or lack thereof, of certain stories, such as the Mueller report, Hunter Biden's laptop, the origins of Covid-19 and systemic racism following the murder of George Floyd.\nHigh-profile supporters of Berliner's essay, including former President Donald Trump and X owner Elon Musk, shared criticism of NPR and its CEO, Katherine Maher.\n'NO MORE FUNDING FOR NPR, A TOTAL SCAM! EDITOR SAID THEY HAVE NO REPUBLICANS, AND IS ONLY USED TO ‘DAMAGE TRUMP.' THEY ARE A LIBERAL DISINFORMATION MACHINE. NOT ONE DOLLAR!!!' Trump wrote on Truth Social on April 10.\nMusk wrote on X that the 'head of NPR hates the Constitution of the USA' in response to a clip of Maher discussing the challenges in fighting disinformation and honoring the First Amendment right to free speech.\nMeanwhile, some journalists at NPR pushed back against Berliner's accusations.\n'Morning Edition' co-host Steve Inskeep shared his take in a post on his Substack newsletter, saying he believes Berliner failed to 'engage anyone who had a different point of view.'\n'Having been asked, I answered: my colleague's article was filled with errors and omissions,' he wrote, adding, 'The errors do make NPR look bad, because it's embarrassing that an NPR journalist would make so many.'\nNPR's chief news executive, Edith Chapin, also denied Berliner's assessment of the newsroom in a memo to staff members, according to NPR.\n'We're proud to stand behind the exceptional work that our desks and shows do to cover a wide range of challenging stories,' she wrote. 'We believe that inclusion — among our staff, with our sourcing, and in our overall coverage — is critical to telling the nuanced stories of this country and our world.'\nMaher also said Monday in a statement to NPR: 'In America everyone is entitled to free speech as a private citizen. What matters is NPR's work and my commitment as its CEO: public service, editorial independence, and the mission to serve all of the American public. NPR is independent, beholden to no party, and without commercial interests.'",

            "excerpt": "Democrats and election experts say the figure is unrealistic, but expressed concerns the effort could hamper normal election operations and intimidate voters.",
            "summary": "Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the Republican National Committee announced a massive 'election integrity' operation on Friday, promising to deploy 100,000 volunteers and attorneys to battleground states to 'protect the vote and ensure a big win' in November.\nIn a press release, officials said they wanted the volunteers and lawyers to monitor logic and accuracy testing, early voting, ballot tabulation, mail ballot processing and Election Day voting, as well as post-election canvasses, audits, and recounts. The release suggests they may intend to recruit poll workers, too.\n'Having the right people to count the ballots is just as important as turning out voters on Election Day,' Trump said in the release..\n\"The RNC is hiring hundreds of election integrity staff across the map — more than ever before because our Party will be recruiting thousands of more observers to protect the vote in 2024. These campaign officials in states are tasked with recruiting, training, and when possible, shifting poll watchers and poll workers day in and day out,\" added RNC co-chair Lara Trump.\nPoll watching is a normal part of elections — both parties do it — but experts warn that unruly operations can be a problem. And as Trump and his allies continue to make false claims about the 2020 election, some experts worry that empowering these sort of observers at polling sites could hamper normal election operations or intimidate voters.\nThe GOP release notes they plan to work with \"passionate grassroots coalitions who are deeply invested in fighting voter fraud.\"\nThe planned operation would double the RNC's promised 50,000-person operation from 2020, though some experts said both numbers figures were aspirational and unrealistic. The RNC did not respond to a request for data on how many people had volunteered or been staffed in recent elections.\n'I've actually run a program like this with real people,' said Justin Levitt, a former advisor in the Biden White House on democracy issues who has previously worked in the Department of Justice on voting issues. 'We did really well and got multiple tens of thousands.'\nRecruiting individuals in particular to monitor for voter fraud, he said, is even harder than staffing poll workers.\n'They're recruiting people to stand there and watch for something that's not going to happen. Can you please show up and watch, wait for the UFO for 15 hours?' he said.\nMarc Elias, a leading Democratic election lawyer, agreed the 100,000 number was unrealistic, but said he was still concerned about the plans.\n\"I think they are going to have a massive voter suppression operation and it is going to involve very, very large numbers of people and very, very large numbers of lawyers,\" he said. \"I think we need to take the RNC literally and seriously — except on their numbers.\"\nLauren Groh-Wargo, executive director of Fair Fight PAC, the political advocacy arm of the Georgia voting rights group of the same name, said the effort would harm election administration.\n'The Republican National Committee's new voter suppression unit is just the latest version of their cynical playbook to divide and intimidate voters and steal American's voices by building an operation based on the lie of voter fraud,' she said in a statement.\nUntil 2018, the RNC's poll watching plans were limited by a consent decree, which required it seek court approval to prove that any poll watching work wasn't discriminatory.\nThat decree was put into place after Democrats sued and accused the RNC of sending armed, off-duty police officers to patrol the polls in minority neighborhoods in 1981. The decree required them to seek prior court approval for poll watching operations, but expired at the end of 2017 after 35 years.\nPoll observers are a normal and beneficial part of the election process when they are well trained and do not interfere with administrators work, said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, a group that helps support election officials. An army of 100,000 would present a different dynamic, he said, but noted that election workers are prepared to handle unruly observers if they appear.\n\"They will protect the right of their voters to vote free of intimidation. If observers are acting any way contrary to voters interests or interfering with poll workers, they will be dealt with under the laws of the state,\" he said.\nJane C. Timm",

            "summary": "LAKE HAVASU CITY, Ariz. — Arizona GOP Senate hopeful Kari Lake told supporters they can \"strap on a Glock\" to be prepared for the intensity of the 2024 campaign and urged military and law enforcement veterans to be \"ready,\" as her race heats up in a key battleground state.\n'We need to send people to Washington, D.C., that the swamp does not want there,' Lake said toward the end of a Sunday speech to a crowd of Arizonans in Mohave County. 'And I can think of a couple people they don't want there. First on that list is Donald J. Trump; second is Kari Lake.'\nShe described standing up to the 'swamp' in Washington, saying: 'They can't bribe me, they can blackmail me. That's what they don't want me in Washington, D.C. And that's exactly what President Trump wants me they're fighting with him.'\n'He's willing to sacrifice everything I am. That's why they're coming after us with lawfare, they're going to come after us with everything. That's why the next six months is going to be intense. And we need to strap on our — let's see. What do we want to strap on?' Lake asked as some in the crowd chuckled. 'We're going to strap on our, our seat belt. We're going to put on our helmet or your Kari Lake ball cap. We are going to put on the armor of God. And maybe strap on a Glock on the side of us just in case.'\n'We're not going to be the victims of crime,' Lake continued. 'We're not going to have our Second Amendment taken away. We're certainly not going to have our First Amendment taken away by these tyrants.'\nEarlier in the roughly 30-minute remarks, Lake gave another warning about the period between now and Election Day.\n'The next six months are going to be difficult. If you are not ready for action, and I have a feeling with as many veterans and former law enforcement, active law enforcement' — Lake paused to ask for a show of hands — '… you guys are ready for it,' Lake said to her supporters. 'It's going to be a crazy run, the next six months. This is the moment we have to save our country.'\nLake's campaign declined to comment when asked to clarify the point of her remarks and whether she was implying there might be political violence in the next six months.\nWhile Lake didn't explicitly warn of political violence, that's how one of her supporters took her rhetoric.\n'They're gonna do everything they can to disrupt the election, whether it's another pandemic, whether it's going to be inciting the civil war,' said Geenee Roe, 63, when asked about Lake's speech afterward. The event included a raffle of an AR-15-style rifle.\nNBC News asked the Lake Havasu City resident, who plans to vote for Trump and Lake in 2024, if she believed another American civil war is a concrete possibility.\n'The signs are all there,' said Roe, who believes the political left is trying to push the MAGA movement into trouble. 'Saying the MAGA people are bad, that we incite riots — and the whole J6 thing that happened, that was all a setup for sure,' said Roe, referencing the debunked conspiracy theory that the Jan. 6 Capitol riot was a ploy to frame Trump and his supporters.\nLake's comments came in Arizona's northwest Mohave County, which broke for Trump with 75% of the vote in the 2020 presidential election. The Senate hopeful is setting her sights on an even larger margin in 2024.\n'If Mohave County shows up 100% or close to it, they can't cheat their way out of this in Maricopa County, no matter what they do,' Lake said, leaning on a signature talking point.\nLake has continually rejected the 2020 election results, which saw President Joe Biden narrowly defeat Trump in Arizona, and the 2022 election results, which saw her bid for governor fail by a slightly wider margin. Court cases and other reviews of the results have not found evidence of fraud or malfeasance affecting the election results. And in March, Lake decided not to contest her liability in a defamation suit brought by a Republican election official in Maricopa County.\nStephen Richer, the Maricopa County recorder, who plays a key role in election administration, filed a defamation claim against Lake in June alleging that she 'repeatedly and falsely accused' him of causing her electoral defeat in the race for governor won by Democrat Katie Hobbs. Lake's legal team recently filed a default judgment motion that indicated she was not challenging her culpability. She instead will argue against damages in the case.\nShe continued questioning the integrity of Maricopa County's election results on Sunday.\n'You all know what goes on in Maricopa County. I mean, you know that you know, the garbage that they're pushing down there,' Lake said of Arizona's most populous county, where Richer and the Republican-controlled board of supervisors run local elections.\n'We're gonna need all these counties outside of Maricopa County to show up, and I'm counting on Mohave County to lead the way,' Lake said.\nAlex Tabet",

            "excerpt": "Whether or not this turns into a dangerous escalatory spiral, 'will depend on how much damage was done inside of Iran,' former CIA Director John Brennan said.",
            "summary": "Israeli forces appear to have carried out a counterstrike on Iran five days after Tehran targeted Israel with a barrage of drones and missiles in an unprecedented attack in retaliation for Israel's bombing of an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria.\nThe extent of the damage from the strike, which neither the Israeli nor Iranian governments commented on but was confirmed by two people familiar with the situation, remained unclear.\nWhile largely appearing to downplay the strikes, reports from Iranian state media said air defense systems had been engaged in several provinces early Friday morning and there were limited explosions outside Isfahan, a historic city in central Iran that is home to a nuclear installation.\nLater, Iranian state media reported that the sound of several explosions in Isfahan was caused by the destruction of three small drones.\nAn Iranian anchor described Isfahan as being 'in complete peace — people are living their normal lives.'\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency said that there is no damage to Iran's nuclear facilities.\nEarlier in the week, Iranian officials said after their strikes on Israel that they did not want to continue hostilities, but would counterstrike \"immediately\" should Israel attack in response. So far, that has not happened.\nIsraeli officials notified U.S. counterparts on Thursday that a military response was coming, according to a source.\nOn Friday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he would not 'speak to these reported events' but added that U.S. forces had 'not been involved in any offensive operations' when asked about the strike.\nThe U.S. was \"intensely focused de-escalating,\" Blinken added during a press conference in Capri, Italy, during a G7 meeting.\n'Target-rich environment' Whether or not this turns into a dangerous escalatory spiral, 'will depend on how much damage was done inside of Iran,' former CIA Director John Brennan told MSNBC.\nIntelligence agencies will be trying to determine the scope of the Israeli strike's damage, and whether there are casualties or how many could increase pressure on Iran to respond, he added. As of Friday afternoon, there did not appear to be major damage or reported casualties.\nIsfahan is a 'target-rich environment,' with an air base, a missile production facility and other areas that could be of interest, Brennan said.\nIsrael is neither confirming nor denying it was responsible for this morning's attack. When approached by NBC News, both the Israeli prime minister's office and the Israel Defense Forces responded with 'no comment,' there are currently no scheduled plans for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak publicly.\nThe official silence from the Israeli government could indicate a strategy to not further provoke Iran, which might increase public pressure there to retaliate. By remaining silent, Israel is giving Iran space to minimize the incident and plausibly claim there's no need for escalation.\nThe Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., and the CIA also declined to comment.\nPeople demonstrate demanding a regional peace agreement outside of the U.S. Embassy Branch Office in Tel Aviv. Leo Correa / AP Iran's attack last weekend marked the first time the country has launched a direct military assault on Israel. It came less than two weeks after Israel's bombing of an Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus, which killed 12 people, including seven Iranian military commanders.\nIsrael, the U.S. and their allies fended off the Iranian drone and missile attacks, which caused relatively little damage.\nIsrael's counterstrike is the latest escalation in a shadow war between the two countries that has raged since Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979. Until now, the two countries waged battle through proxy forces, top-secret assassinations, audacious cyberattacks and nuclear sabotage — but never head-to-head military engagement.\nThe counterstrike is likely to deepen anxieties in capitals worldwide about the prospect of an all-out war in the Middle East. The region has been on edge since Hamas stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing more than 1,200 people. Israel's devastating military offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip has killed nearly 34,000, according to local health officials.\nIran has vowed to wipe Israel off the map. Israel perceives Iran as an existential threat, and it has accused the country of funding terrorist organizations and armed proxies throughout the Middle East, including Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.\nIn the lead-up to Israel's counteroffensive, world leaders had urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to exercise restraint.\nAn Israeli armored personnel carrier near the Israel-Gaza border on Monday. Amir Cohen / Reuters President Joe Biden told the Israeli leaders that while the U.S. commitment to defend Israel is ironclad, the U.S. would not participate in offensive operations against Iran, a senior administration official told NBC News. U.S. officials told NBC News that Washington was concerned about Israel responding quickly without thinking through the potential fallout.\nEuropean leaders had also implored Israel to weigh its options carefully. French President Emmanuel Macron, for example, described the situation as 'unstable' and emphasized that steps should be taken to keep it from escalating.\nCourtney Kube Mosheh Gains Dan De Luce Andrea Mitchell Daniel Arkin Anna Schecter contributed.",

            "excerpt": "House Speaker Mike Johnson told members that they expect to vote on separate aid bills for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies on \"Saturday evening\" after an amendment process.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Facing a divided party and pressure to act, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced he will roll out four bills Wednesday to provide assistance to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan and advance other national security priorities, with the hope of holding final votes on Saturday.\nThe bills represent a major test of Johnson's ability to navigate a thicket of political and global challenges with a wafer-thin majority. And it comes as Johnson, R-La., faces a serious threat to his gavel from Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky.\nJohnson's biggest challenge is Ukraine funding, an issue that has bitterly divided the GOP. He has been squeezed by conservative security hawks who want to help Ukraine fend off Russia's aggression and by an empowered isolationist wing that is feeding off former President Donald Trump's criticism of NATO and prior Ukraine aid measures.\nMultiple Republicans say they oppose any funding for Ukraine, meaning that a significant share of Democrats will be required to carry that measure over the finish line.\nIn a message to members before releasing the legislation, Johnson said there would be \"three bills that will fund America's national security interests and allies in Israel, the Indo-Pacific, and Ukraine, including a loan structure for aid, and enhanced strategy and accountability.\"\nHe said Republican leadership will come forward with an amendment process \"alongside a fourth bill that includes the REPO Act,\" which is aimed at seizing Russian assets to benefit Ukraine; the House-passed bill to ban TikTok in the U.S. unless it divests from its China-based owner; as well as \"sanctions and other measures to confront Russia, China, and Iran.\"\n'We expect the vote on final passage on these bills to be on Saturday evening,' Johnson said in a text message obtained by NBC News.\nHe said there will also be a \"border security bill that includes the core components of H.R.2\" — a conservative, House-passed immigration bill — moving under a separate process. That measure serves as a sweetener for reticent conservatives who are unhappy that the aid bills don't include domestic immigration provisions.\nSwift conservative pushback Multiple House conservatives pushed back immediately on social media Wednesday after Johnson's message went out, complaining that the border measures weren't directly tied to Ukraine funding.\n\"The Republican Speaker of the House is seeking a rule to pass almost $100 billion in foreign aid — while unquestionably, dangerous criminals, terrorists, & fentanyl pour across our border. The border 'vote' in this package is a watered-down dangerous cover vote. I will oppose,\" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, wrote on X.\nRep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., the most recent chair of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, said: \"Anything less than tying Ukraine aid to real border security fails to live up to @SpeakerJohnson's own words just several weeks ago. Our constituents demand — and deserve — more from us.\"\nRep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, earlier called aid to Ukraine unnecessary, saying: 'I'm not giving them a nickel today, tomorrow or next week.\"\n'Putin is not going into Poland. I don't care what you say. Besides, anyway, it doesn't really matter because ... when Donald Trump wins, Putin's leavin'. Putin's leavin' Ukraine,' Nehls said ahead of the bill's release, without explaining his logic.\nHouse Democrats have repeatedly called on Johnson to bring up a Senate-passed foreign aid package instead, calling it the best — if not only — path to getting a bill on Biden's desk. They have posted a \"discharge petition\" with 195 signatories to end-run Johnson and force a vote on that bill. It needs 218 votes to come up, meaning it will need the backing of some Republicans in addition to Democrats.\nAt a Wednesday meeting with Democrats, House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., told members that they need to use their 'personal relationships' with Republicans to garner support for the discharge petition, according to two people familiar with her comments.\nTreasury Secretary Yellen dials up pressure At a bilateral meeting later Wednesday with Ukraine Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen plans to dial up the pressure on House Republicans to act.\n'The failure of House Republicans to act to support Ukraine in this pivotal moment of the war for so long has been inexcusable—and detrimental to our national security,' Yellen will say, according to a Treasury source. 'Every moment of delay by House Republicans strengthens Putin and emboldens America's adversaries around the world who are closely watching to see if we, the United States, maintains its resolve to support a democratic Ukraine as it fends off an autocratic Russia.'\nMeanwhile, Greene has not said when she might force a vote on her \"motion to vacate\" the speaker's chair, which would take a simple majority to remove Johnson from his job. Her effort gained a cosponsor in Massie on Tuesday, who predicted Johnson would be voted out.\nIt's not clear the votes are there to oust Johnson. Many conservatives, including some who voted to remove former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, have not joined the effort to oust Johnson. Some Democrats have also said they'll vote to protect Johnson from a motion to depose him.\nBut Massie said that would only hurt his standing with the GOP in the long term.\n'Then he goes further in the hole with Republicans. He becomes toxic to the conference. For every Democrat who comes to his aid he'll lose 2 to 3 more Republicans,' Massie said. 'He doesn't have much shelf life after that.'\nJohnson struck a defiant tone Tuesday when asked about the threat to his gavel, calling it 'absurd' while saying he's 'not concerned' about the motion and will continue to do his job.\nSahil Kapur Rebecca Kaplan Julie Tsirkin contributed.",

Wechsler, senior director of Middle East Programs at the Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank, similarly argued that the nature of Tehran's retaliatory mission was telling.\n'Iran sent an unmistakable signal that it wanted to avoid a further escalation that could spark a truly regional war,' Wechsler said in an analysis. 'It chose long-range attacks that could be readily thwarted by known Israeli defenses and pointedly did not target any U.S. facilities.'\nTehran — which does not officially recognize Israel's existence, has long championed the Palestinian cause and Hamas' Oct. 7 attack as a 'victory' — has worked to frame its weekend strikes as a 'legitimate' and 'responsible' reaction to Israel bombing its consulate in Syria. The West should be 'grateful' for Iran's restraint, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said on Monday.\nYet some in Tehran have described the Saturday attack in more drastic terms. 'We have decided to create a new equation' with Israel, the chief of the country's Revolutionary Guard Corps said.\nIsrael has battled its arch-enemy Iran through clandestine operations and proxy forces, as well as warning Tehran over its intentions as it develops its nuclear programs. (Iran has long insisted that its nuclear program is peaceful — a claim Israel rejects.)\nThrough its proxies, most notably Hezbollah, the powerful and well-armed political party and militant group in Lebanon, Iran has struck at Israel. But before Saturday, neither side had openly and directly attacked the other at home.\nIsraeli Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi leads a situational assessment at the Kirya military base in Tel Aviv on Sunday.

'Regardless of what Israel does next, there is no going back to the status quo ante,' Saad said in a subsequent post.\nWestern leaders nonetheless appear eager for Israel to show restraint in its response.\nU.S. officials told NBC News that Washington was concerned that Israel could respond quickly without thinking through the potential fallout, and Biden told Netanyahu that the U.S. will not participate in offensive operations against Iran, a senior administration official said.\nIran has long viewed its missile arsenal as the ultimate ace card to deter and threaten its adversaries, but Israel's success in defending itself against hundreds of Iranian projectiles raised doubts about Tehran's military power. In an editorial for The Wall Street Journal, a former commander of U.S. Central Command argued that Iran's aerial assault was a display of weakness.\n'The vulnerability of Iran's force has been exposed, and the regime is gravely weakened as a result,' retired Marine Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. wrote. 'Israel has been strengthened by a stunning display of military competence, a striking contrast with that seen on Oct. 7.'\nAn aerial assault on Saudi Arabia by Iranian-backed Houthi forces in 2019, which the U.S. and Israel blamed on Iran, was much more effective. In that attack, which Iran denied responsibility for, drones struck key Saudi oil facilities, penetrating Riyadh's U.S.-made air defense systems. The episode sparked concern in Washington and the region that Iran's missile and drone fleets posed a growing threat.\nIn many respects, Iran and Israel have been on a collision course for nearly half a century.\nIsrael and Iran have been enemies since the Islamic Revolution in the late 1970s. Iran's theocratic regime has vowed to wipe the Jewish state off the map; Israel and the U.S. have long accused Tehran of funding terrorist organizations and armed proxies in the Middle East, including Hamas and Hezbollah.\nThe speech notes of Gilad Erdan, the Israeli ambassador to the U.N., during a Security Council meeting on Sunday. Charly Tribbaleau / AFP via Getty Images But the hostilities between Israel and Iran have never risen to the level of face-to-face military confrontation. Instead, the two countries have carried out furtive attacks on each other by land, sea, air — and cyberspace.\nIran routinely targets Israel through its 'Axis of Resistance,' a network that extends Tehran's influence across the Arab world.\nWhile Iran has denied that it played a role in Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack, and a senior Hamas official has said Iran did not order or sanction the operation, both Israel and the United States say Tehran was complicit in the assault, having armed and trained the militants for years.\nIn the aftermath of Oct. 7, Israel concluded that its past targeting of Iranian arms shipments to Hezbollah in Lebanon and other covert actions had failed to sufficiently deter Iran, prompting it to go after the Revolutionary Guard officers at the diplomatic compound in Damascus this month, former U.S. officials and regional experts said.\nIt is rare for Iran to deploy its capabilities so directly against an enemy, even when its senior commanders are taken out. In 2020, when the U.S. launched a drone strike in Baghdad that killed Tehran's powerful Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran struck back with missiles on Iraqi bases housing American troops, injuring about 100 personnel.\nThe war in Gaza raised tensions between Iran and Israel to new heights, before the Israeli strike on Tehran's diplomatic compound in Damascus on April 1 killed at least seven of its military officers, including two top commanders.\nIran vowed vengeance — and then delivered on that promise Saturday. The question now is how Israel chooses to deliver its response.\nDaniel Arkin Dan De Luce and Jennifer Jett contributed.",

            "excerpt": "Almost a billion voters will decide whether to elect Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third term, in an election that takes place over six weeks starting Friday.",
            "summary": "Indians head to the polls on Friday in what will be the world's largest democratic election, as close to one billion voters pick their next government and decide whether to hand Prime Minister Narendra Modi a third term in office.\nThe 2024 general elections will pan out in seven phases over the next six weeks, starting April 19.\nVoters will decide who fills the seats of the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India's parliament, for the next five years. The Lok Sabha is the more powerful of the two houses of Parliament.\nWhichever party or coalition wins the majority will lead the government and pick the next prime minister. Analysts widely expect Modi's Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party to score another landslide victory in the upcoming elections.\nHere's why India's elections matter.\nIndia's meteoric rise Under Modi's rule, India's economy has scaled to new heights. It is now the world's fifth-largest economy with a GDP of $3.7 trillion and has set its sights on becoming the world's third-largest economy by 2027.\nHome to 1.4 billion people, the world's most populous country is the fastest-growing economy in the world. Its economy grew 7.2% in fiscal 2022-2023, the second-highest among the G20 countries.\nThe International Monetary Fund projects that India's economy will grow 6.8% in 2024 and 6.5% in 2025, compared with China's predicted growth of 4.6% in 2024 and 4.1% in 2025.\nThat's not all.\nIndia's stock market overtook Hong Kong's in December to become the fourth largest in the world, and is now valued at over $4 trillion.\nAnalysts expect Modi to win a third consecutive five-year term, further driving India's growth trajectory.\n'The growth story is not done. But private and foreign investments have been very subdued and exports have also declined,' Suyash Rai, deputy director and fellow at Carnegie India, told CNBC. 'So I feel that there is some weakness building up.'\nIndia has forged deeper ties with the West in the past year, and Modi's reelection could further strengthen U.S.-India relations, said Chietigj Bajpaee, senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House.\nHe said India is seen as a 'bulwark against China' as the Biden administration continues to encourage U.S. companies to move electronics and technology manufacturing operations out of China into friendlier countries, like India.\n'If there are two countries where there's the highest degree of consensus, it's China as a long-term strategic rival and India as a long-term strategic partner. That won't change,' Bajpaee said.\nKey contenders There will be 543 contested seats in the lower house, and the party or coalition that wins at least 272 votes will form the government.\nThe two main contenders are the BJP-led coalition known as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and the opposition bloc known as the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA).\nThe opposition coalition was formed last year when more than 40 opposition parties joined forces. It is led by the Indian National Congress, whose leading figure is Rahul Gandhi — the son of Rajiv Gandhi, a grandson of Indira Gandhi, and a great-grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru, who all served as prime ministers of India.\nThe Congress party, which ruled the country for most of its post-Independence era, suffered stinging defeats in the elections in 2014 and 2019.\nIn 2019, the BJP secured a total of 303 seats. Together with the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, 352 seats were clinched. The opposition Indian National Congress won 52 seats that year.\nThis time, the BJP's coalition bloc is widely expected to once again trump the opposition parties and win a historic third term thanks to the political stability in the last decade, analysts said.\n'Policy consistency and political stability are connected to each other deeply. So the expectation will be that the government that comes in will be able to maintain that,' said Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies, National University of Singapore.\n'This will be a significant year for India, and I have a feeling that whoever be the government in India, the foreign policy direction and the economic policy direction are going to remain broadly unchanged,' he told CNBC.\nModi reportedly said in March that he was confident the BJP and NDA would secure a total of 400 seats.\nChatham's Bajpaee said it's a 'foregone conclusion' that Modi's BJP will take the reins again this year, but 'what's unclear is the scale of the victory.'\n'You don't need the BJP to lose for the opposition to win. All they need to do is prove the Modi brand has weakened if they don't perform as well as last time,' he highlighted.\nVoters' concerns According to a survey conducted by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, unemployment was the top concern for 27% of the 10,000 surveyed.\nMore than half (62%) of those surveyed also said it had become more difficult to find a job in the last five years during Modi's second term.\n'You still have a large proportion of the population which is impoverished, so there are large disparities across the country,' Bajpaee said.\nRising costs is the second-biggest concern, with 23% of voters surveyed saying it was their primary concern. About 35% of respondents said their quality of life had declined in the last five years.\nAbout 13% said their biggest worry was the country's development, while 8% said corruption was their top concern.\nElection in numbers This will be India's biggest election yet, with some 968 million people registered to vote — 48% of them women, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. There will also be 18 million first-time voters, Reuters reported.\nGiven the sheer number of voters, the seven-phase election will last 44 days, from April 19 to June 1, across 554 constituencies, according to the Election Commission of India.\nThe six-week election is expected to cost more than the 2020 U.S. presidential election where $14.4 billion was spent, according to Washington-based research firm OpenSecrets.\nData from the company showed that India spent $8.6 billion on the 2019 general elections, $2.1 billion more than the 2016 U.S. presidential race.\nResults will be released on June 4.\nElectoral rules state that since there must be a polling station within two kilometers of every registered voter, there will be about a million polling stations, 5.5 million electronic voting machines, and 15 million staff and security personnel overseeing the election, data from the election commission showed.\nCharmaine Jacob, CNBC Joanna Tan, CNBC contributed.",

After the first 96 prospective jurors were brought into a New York courtroom, Judge Juan Merchan asked if any of those assembled could not be 'fair and impartial.' More than half raised their hands and were excused from serving on the jury.\nThe jury selection process got off to a slow start because lawyers from both sides spent much of the day arguing over some of the more sensational evidence in the case. Prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office want to use material — including the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, headlines from the National Enquirer from the 2016 GOP presidential primary and the timing of Trump's alleged affair with another woman — to show why Trump was eager to bury negative stories about him during the 2016 presidential election.\nMerchan said prosecutors could use a transcript of the 'Access Hollywood' tape but not the tape itself. He also greenlit the request to show jurors Enquirer headlines and said he would allow testimony about the alleged affair.\nTrump, who spent much of the day seated at the defense table flanked by his attorneys, called the case 'an assault' on the nation and repeatedly attacked the prosecution for waging 'election interference.' Merchan said Trump must be in the courtroom for every day of the trial and warned that the former president risks jail time if he disrupts the proceedings.

Israel and Iran's longstanding conflict comes into full view Israel's war Cabinet convened yesterday to weigh its options for responding to Iran's unprecedented drone and missile attack. World leaders have urged restraint — and Israel could heed that call, four U.S. officials said.\nAccording to the officials, Israel's response will be limited in scope and will likely involve strikes against Iranian military forces and Iranian-backed proxies outside Iran. However, the U.S. assessment is based on conversations between American and Israeli officials that happened before Iran fired more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel on Saturday night, and the U.S. officials stressed that they have not been briefed on Israel's final decision .

Other analysts have warned that if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decides to hit back hard, it could plunge the wider Middle East into war.\nWhile Israel and Iran have been enemies since the late 1970s, the bitter conflict has long been confined to secret assassinations, audacious cyberattacks, nuclear sabotage and war-by-proxy.

NBC News found that at least 150 paid 'Premium' subscriber X accounts and thousands of unpaid accounts have posted or amplified pro-Nazi content on X in recent months, often in apparent violation of X's rules. The paid accounts posting the content all consistently posted antisemitic or pro-Nazi material. Examples included praise of Nazi soldiers, sharing of Nazi symbols and denials of the Holocaust.\nThe findings are the latest evidence of a flourishing Nazi network on X under Musk's ownership, where Nazi sympathizers are brought in from dark corners of the internet to a massive platform where they can pay to amplify their content.

In trial's first week, Trump tried to control the narrative Jabin Botsford / Pool via Getty Images The rest of the 12 jurors — and one alternate — in Donald Trump's hush money trial were seated yesterday, but not without some hiccups along the way.

Today, the search continues for five more alternate jurors. And then the first week of the former president's criminal trial will come to a close. Looking back, the ways Trump tried to control the narrative are clear. On Monday, Trump stood in front of reporters ready to unleash a grievance-laced tirade that, at times, did not totally reflect reality. He fixated on Judge Juan Merchan's decision to not yet rule on whether Trump can attend his son Barron's high school graduation next month. The key words to keep in mind are 'not yet.'\nBut Trump painted a picture for his supporters of a biased judge blocking a loving father from seeing his son's graduation. The disdain toward Merchan from Trump's supporters was swift.\nThen there were arguments about whether Trump fell asleep at one point and about jury selection rules. Those sorts of distortions and fights about nearly every aspect of the trial dominated the first week — and earned him $1.6 million in small-dollar donations.

Taylor Swift's ‘The Tortured Poets Department' is here Taylor Swift's new album was released at midnight on the dot, heralding a new era for the pop star. And then two hours later, Swift revealed that 'The Tortured Poets Department' is actually a double album, with an extra 15 songs. Surprise!\nBefore the album's release, die-hard fans gathered for listening parties at their homes and bars across the country. Shortly after the release, the reviews started to pour in: 'Unapologetically dramatic,' Variety's Chris Willman wrote; 'proudly villainous energy,' the Los Angeles Times' Mikael Wood wrote.

Ilhan Omar's daughter, pictured above — were arrested yesterday at a pro-Palestinian protest at New York's Columbia University after school officials voiced concerns about demonstrators violating campus policies. The protests grew throughout the afternoon and eventually, more than 500 students entered the quad area, according to NYPD Commissioner Edward Cuban. The students who were arrested did not resist and said what they wanted to say 'in a peaceful manner,' Cuban said.\nThe demonstration came a day after Columbia President Nemat 'Minouche' Shafik attended a congressional hearing about antisemitism and faced questioning by Rep. Omar and other lawmakers about on-campus demonstrations.

Inside a convention for a far-right sheriffs movement Conspiracy theorists, felons and election deniers flocked to a Las Vegas hotel. They were there to attend a far-right sheriffs convention, where discussions centered around their belief in encroaching federal power and rampant voter fraud, despite a lack of evidence. The event by the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, or CSPOA, included a lackluster Pledge of Allegiance, a smooth jazz rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" disgruntled former politicians and a pizza party. Only a few actual sheriffs attended.\nMark Abramson for NBC News CSPOA, which sees sheriffs as more powerful than the federal government, used the event to set a course for the coming election. The conference's low attendance indicates just how fringe the group's ideas are, but critics fear the organization's focus on U.S. elections will nonetheless legitimize disinformation.\nSenior reporter Brandy Zadrozny was at the annual meeting, where she listened to speakers (and their conspiracy theories) and talked to a few attendees.

Lumen claims a third-party company caused the outage while installing a light pole.\nHowever, experts say a single pole should not be able to disable 911 in multiple states. This incident draws attention to the outsourcing of the running of 911 systems to private companies, like Lumen, causing outages to hit states even if the source of the problem is nowhere near them.\noutsourcing of the running of 911 systems to private companies, like Lumen, causing outages to hit states even if the source of the problem is nowhere near them.

Staff Pick: A regional reproductive care void on both sides of the border A growing number of American women are seeking abortion care in Mexico, and they're navigating a medley of laws that, like the U.S., vary according to Mexico's different states. My colleague Albinson Linares and I dug into some of these laws . What we found is that most Mexican border states ban elective abortions, despite a Supreme Court ruling last year that decriminalized the procedure nationwide. Add Arizona's recent ruling on an 1864 law that will ban most abortions in the state, and women on both sides of the border could soon find themselves in a remote and politicized region with little reproductive care. — Isabela Espadas Barros Leal, associate editor\ndug into some of these laws.

            "summary": "LAS VEGAS — A conference for a far-right sheriffs group this week drew a parade of felons, disgraced politicians, election deniers, conspiracy theorists and, in the end, a few sheriffs.\nThe Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, or CSPOA, met in Las Vegas' Ahern Luxury Boutique Hotel conference center to publicly counter reports of extremism within the group and set a course for the coming election — one that involves sheriffs' investigating what they claim, despite a lack of evidence, is rampant voter fraud.\nThe group sees sheriffs as the highest authority in the U.S., more powerful than the federal government, and it wants these county officers to form posses to patrol polling places, seize voting machines and investigate the Democrats and foreign nations behind what they claim is a criminal effort to rig the vote by flooding the country with immigrants who vote illegally.\nCritics of the group — including voting rights advocates and extremism researchers — fear the CSPOA's new focus will amount to interference and legitimize disinformation about U.S. elections.\nBut the event Wednesday, which starred MAGA celebrities speaking to a half-empty audience made up of few actual sheriffs, pointed to just how fringe the group's ideas are — and how what once seemed like a movement on its way into the mainstream has lost political pull.\nThe conference opened a little behind schedule; the Pledge of Allegiance was delayed when organizers couldn't find a flag. After he searched the conference center's rooms, Tom Hamner, a Colorado man who served over two years in prison for the felony 'interfering with law enforcement' on Jan. 6, 2021, came forward with the scarf from his wife's neck. It wasn't exactly a flag, but it was emblazoned with stars and stripes.\n'That'll work!' emcee Alex Newman, an Epoch Times contributor, said before he led the crowd of dozens in the pledge. A smooth jazz rendition of 'The Star-Spangled Banner' followed, sung by a Las Vegas man awaiting trial on multiple felony charges who is accused of fraudulently posing as a certified firearms instructor.\nI sat with a small group of reporters at a table marked 'reserved,' a section Newman and other presenters pointed to throughout the day when they invoked, in Donald Trump's style, the 'fake media.'\nWe, along with candidates and elected officials, were admitted gratis. Others paid $49 for the day, which included breakfast, a box lunch and a 'pizza party.' Sponsors staffed booths advertising unofficial Trump merchandise, supplements, prepper gear and various patriot-themed swag.\nCSPOA's finances aren't public. It charges for events like this conference, offers a $99 yearly subscription for access to weekly webinars and solicits donations. It has also provided training sessions in nearly a dozen states, where police and sheriffs earn continuing education credits toward professional requirements. Last year, the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement ended the practice in the state.\nTo the extent that the 13-hour day was structured, it was broken roughly in two: the first half dedicated to the issue of encroaching federal power and the second to election denial and conspiracy theories.\nThe morning's sessions were the group's bread and butter. Former Arizona sheriff Richard Mack founded the CSPOA in 2011 to advocate for the belief that sheriffs — who generally operate independently with little to no oversight and are accountable only to voters — are the ultimate arbiters and enforcers of the Constitution and must act as a check on tyrannical federal power.\nIts early focus was on gun laws and other tea party pet causes, including immigration, the Affordable Care Act and attention-grabbing standoffs between ranchers and the Bureau of Land Management. 'The greatest threat we face today is not terrorists,' Mack's website read in 2012. 'It is our own federal government.'\nAfter two terms as sheriff in an Arizona border county, Mack lost re-election. He sought elected office multiple times but failed in bids for sheriff of a different county, governor and seats in the U.S. House and Senate.\nThere are no public rolls today, but Mack claims 10% of the country's 3,000 sheriffs are members, along with 10,000 ordinary citizens.\nWednesday's event drew a little over 100 people by midmorning. Attendees took notes, nodded along and offered somber 'Amens' and boisterous 'Nos!' when called for.\nJared Bosley, a farmer in South Dakota, told of his fight with the state over a pipeline company surveying his land without his permission. Two convicted Jan. 6 rioters said they were 'political prisoners.' Former Rep. Steve King of Iowa, his legacy a history of racist remarks, railed against the World Health Organization, the World Economic Forum and 'ringleader' George Soros. Another disgraced former congressman, Steve Stockman of Texas, sobbed as he shared his story of serving time in a federal prison for fraud and sobbed again when he got to the part where Trump commuted his 10-year sentence.\nThe supportive crowd felt like 'a warm bath,' Stockman said, his arms stretched toward heaven.\nRichard Fleming, a cardiologist who in 2009 pleaded guilty to felony charges of health care and mail fraud, gave a lengthy presentation alleging the Covid vaccines were bioweapons. Radio show host Wayne Allyn Root thundered into the microphone promoting the 'great replacement,' a racist conspiracy theory. 'They want to replace American citizens who love this country,' Root bellowed.\nIt was nearly lunchtime when the first active sheriff spoke. Bob Songer, a CSPOA board member and the sheriff of Klickitat County, Washington, said he enforces only laws he determines to be constitutional and talked about his 'posse,' a group of 150 armed community volunteers he relies on for tasks like hunting cougars and courtroom security and keeps at the ready, as a potential militia. He offered a copy of his posse plan to sheriffs in the audience.\nDuring the break, as CSPOA volunteer Kenneth Hall sang an original song, 'I Back the Sheriff,' to the music of the Bob Marley tune, I asked Mack why there weren't more sheriffs at his conference. Mack said that didn't matter.\n'There's several candidates,' Mack said, noting the political signs littering the room. He said he hoped to draw a 'new generation' of sheriffs, but, pointing to 78-year-old Songer, he added, 'there's one, and he's one of the best sheriffs in America!'\nIndeed, there are politicians — or would-bes — who see the constitutional sheriffs group as an important bloc of support. Twenty or so candidates for local office in the crowd from Nevada, Utah, Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Georgia and Idaho spent the morning shaking hands and passing out cards.\nIt's a model that has proven effective. Trump depended on support from sheriffs in the White House and continues to rely on them at campaign events, as he did in 2016 and 2020. At a presentation in Grand Rapids, Michigan, this month, a half-dozen uniformed sheriffs stood in the background decked out in gold stripes and braided ropes as Trump railed against immigration and stood before a sign that read 'Stop Biden's Border Bloodbath.'\nAfter lunch, former sheriff Glenn Hamilton, who lost his 2022 re-election bid in Sierra County, New Mexico, regaled the audience with the time he deputized an entire church congregation to permit a gathering in violation of the governor's Covid rules. Hamilton referred to 'this old tool that's in our box called Posse Comitatus. Who's ever heard of this?' he asked.\nThe Posse Comitatus movement in the 1970s and '80s held up the county sheriff as the only true law enforcement officer and urged vigilantism through local posse groups. Latin for 'power of the county,' Posse Comitatus was preached and popularized by white supremacist William Potter Gale, but it dissolved in the wake of a spate of violence and highly publicized prosecutions.\nThe CSPOA has recently sought to distance itself from that history, the kind of messaging that may have resonated with not only tea partiers but also anti-government groups and militias and caused national hate tracking groups and Mack's Republican political opponents to label him a far-right extremist.\nMack and CSPOA leaders have consistently decried the label, but their ties with extremist organizations are well-documented. Mack was a keynote speaker at the first national conference for the far-right Oath Keepers in 2009 and sat on the militia group's board until at least 2015. The CSPOA's current CEO since 2022, Sam Bushman, operates Liberty News Radio, which has syndicated programs hosted by white supremacists. Bushman has hosted Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes on his show, 'Liberty RoundTable,' over a dozen times, including after the attack on the Capitol, for which Rhodes is serving an 18-year sentence for seditious conspiracy.\nA frustrated and defiant Bushman said it was that kind of negative publicity that had most likely caused the conference's biggest speaker, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, to bail. Without notice, Bannon hadn't shown up, he said. Bannon didn't respond to a request for comment.\nWith Bannon out, the biggest star was Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser and retired three-star general who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI but was pardoned by Trump. After he promoted a new film about himself that would be released the next day, Flynn took photos with attendees near the stage. Seeing an NBC News photographer, Flynn demanded to know whom he worked for, and when he identified himself, Flynn became incensed and yelled, 'You're a liar!' The organizers then moved Flynn to a room walled off by curtains and two guards.\nThe CSPOA has always been considered a fringe movement, but the pandemic offered a boost. Constitutional sheriffs were suddenly a viable solution to what a growing slice of the GOP saw as tyrannical lockdown orders, mask requirements and vaccination mandates. Similar constitutional sheriffs organizations began to pop up, including Pinal County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Lamb's Protect America Now and a pro-Trump think tank, the Claremont Institute's Sheriffs Fellowship.\nThe 2020 election offered another opportunity. Pushing unfounded claims of a stolen election, the CSPOA collaborated with True the Vote, the Texas-based election conspiracy theorist group behind '2000 Mules,' a widely panned and debunked film that claimed to reveal widespread ballot drop-box fraud.\nMack called the film a 'smoking gun,' and at its 2022 conference, the CSPOA called upon its members to launch investigations. But results have been lackluster.\nThe most notable investigation came from Barry County, Michigan, Sheriff Dar Leaf, who partnered with a pro-Trump lawyer bent on overturning Michigan's election results. Leaf's investigation, which has involved seizing election equipment and grilling local clerks, has seemingly only impeded a criminal case against three Trump supporters indicted last year on state charges related to their alleged tampering with voting machines. Leaf hasn't been charged with a crime.\nOnstage, Leaf, bespectacled and boyish, was giddy. The investigation had faced setbacks, he acknowledged, but he believed there would soon be justice.\n'I'm getting goose-bumpy here,' Leaf said. Later, he told me he didn't pay any attention to the criticism from state election and law enforcement officials or from the media: 'I just keep my head down.'\nAs the day wore on at the conference, the rails began to wear.\nTina Peters, a former Mesa County, Colorado, clerk facing multiple criminal charges related to a suspected security breach of her county's election system in 2021, and fresh off a home confinement for obstructing government administration in a separate case, took the stage wearing a large white lei. She is fighting the latest charges, with a trial scheduled for this summer. She had recently been to Hawaii, she said, and she offered a slideshow of photographic evidence that she suggested proved the recent deadly wildfires were the result of an intentional laser attack.\nAs Mike Lindell, MyPillow's founder and a sponsor of the CSPOA event, spoke — election denial and his prowess with the media and in business were his main topics — a blond woman in a robin's egg suit jacket walked up behind me and handed me a note: 'I would like to give you some first hand info that will be helpful to you reaching a conclusion on election fraud in NV.' The note passer, Susan Proffitt, later told me that the room was full of operatives, 'and they are doing their best to destroy us.'\nPizza was put out on long tables under heat lamps. The audience, halved from the morning, milled about. A couple of women took off their high heels. Several small groups were forming around the bar. There was still an awards ceremony, and Mack and Bushman had planned a news conference, though by the time it started the members of the media had gone.\nAs I left, I checked in with a man who had been sitting in the back, watching attentively. Jeffrey Kadlowec, a local architect, hadn't heard of CSPOA before and wasn't sure what to expect. 'I thought it would be more about law enforcement,' he said excitedly. 'I didn't expect it to be so, so radical.'\nBrandy Zadrozny",
