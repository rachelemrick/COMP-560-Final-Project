            "excerpt": "Each of the past ten months has been the hottest on record – an unprecedented streak of unprecedented temperatures that has fueled alarm among climate scientists.",
            "summary": "The heat fell upon Mali's capital like a thick, smothering blanket — chasing people from the streets, stifling them inside their homes. For nearly a week at the beginning of April, the temperature in Bamako hovered above 110 degrees Fahrenheit. The cost of ice spiked to ten times its normal price, an overtaxed electrical grid sputtered and shut down.\nWith much of the majority-Muslim country fasting for the holy month of Ramadan, dehydration and heat stroke became epidemic. As their body temperatures climbed, people's blood pressure lowered. Their vision went fuzzy, their kidneys and livers malfunctioned, their brains began to swell. At the city's main hospital, doctors recorded a month's worth of deaths in just four days. Local cemeteries were overwhelmed.\nAdvertisement\nThe scale and intensity of this hot streak is extraordinary even considering the unprecedented amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, researchers say. Scientists are still struggling to explain how the planet could have exceeded previous temperature records by as much as half a degree Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) last fall.\nWhat happens in the next few months, said Gavin Schmidt, director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, could indicate whether Earth's climate has undergone a fundamental shift — a quantum leap in warming that is confounding climate models and stoking ever more dangerous weather extremes.\nBut even if the world returns to a more predictable warming trajectory, it will only be a temporary reprieve from the conditions that humanity must soon confront, Schmidt said. 'Global warming continues apace.'\nMysterious heat\nAs soon as the planet entered an El Niño climate pattern — a naturally occurring phenomenon associated with warming in the Pacific Ocean — scientists knew it would start breaking records. El Niños are associated with spikes in Earth's overall temperature, and this one was unfolding on a planet that has already warmed 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) from preindustrial levels.\nAdvertisement\nYet this El Niño didn't just break records; it obliterated them. Four consecutive days in July became the hottest days in history. The Northern Hemisphere saw its warmest summer — and then its warmest winter — known to science.\nBy the end of 2023, Earth's average temperature was nearly 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than the preindustrial average — and about 0.2 degrees Celsius (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than climate modelers predicted it would be, even taking El Niño into account.\nResearchers have spent the past several months investigating possible explanations for that 0.2 C discrepancy: a volcanic eruption that spewed heat-trapping water vapor into the atmosphere, changes in shipping fuel that affected the formation of clouds that block the sun. So far, those factors can only account for a small fraction of the anomaly, raising fears that scientists' models may have failed to capture a longer-lasting change in the climate system.\nAdvertisement\n'What if the statistical connections that we are basing our predictions on are no longer valid?' Schmidt said. 'It's niggling at the back of my brain that it could be that the past is no longer a guide to the future.'\nThis possibility has preoccupied the climate community, sparking multipart explainers in science magazines and special breakout sessions at academic meetings. But Schmidt says it's too soon to know how worried the world should be. New data from a recently launched NASA satellite could show that changes in shipping emissions did in fact contribute to the extra warming. Studies might find that an accumulation of seemingly small shifts in the atmosphere and oceans were enough to push the planet to such extremes.\nAnother test will come over the next few months, as the planet shifts out of an El Niño and into its opposite pattern, La Niña — something that the National Weather Service predicts will happen by the summer. Because La Niña is typically associated with cooler global temperatures, scientists expect it will bring an end to Earth's record hot streak.\nAdvertisement\nThere are hints that may be happening, said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth and the payments company Stripe. Even though last month was the hottest March in history, it broke the previous record by a mere 0.1 degree Celsius — not the whopping 0.5 C margin seen last September.\n'I hope we're going to return to a predictable regime,' Hausfather said. 'But if we keep setting records, then we have to revisit some of our assumptions, because it may be there is some new persistent forcing that is not being accounted for.'\nA whole new kind of weather\nEven if global average temperatures do return to a more predictable trajectory, the effects of warming on people and ecosystems have already entered uncharted territory.\nSea ice around Antarctica shrank to its smallest extent ever last year. The mighty Amazon River has reached its lowest level since measurements began. Researchers this week declared a global coral bleaching event — just the fourth in history — and warned that the crisis in the oceans is on track to set a record.\nAdvertisement\n'The climate is warming at such a rate that we're now pushing beyond the bounds of what would have been not even normal weather but feasible weather in the past,' said Clair Barnes, a researcher at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London.\nIn the analysis published Thursday, Barnes and her colleagues reported that the recent heat wave in West Africa could not have occurred on a cooler, preindustrial planet. In one Malian city, the mercury hit 48.5 degrees Celsius (119.3 degrees Fahrenheit) — likely the hottest temperature ever reliably recorded in Africa, the researchers said.\nNights offered little relief, with temperatures often staying above 90 degrees. Studies show that high nighttime temperatures are especially dangerous, because they deny the body a chance to recover.\nKiswendsida Guigma, a climate scientist and adviser for the Red Cross Climate Center based in Burkina Faso who contributed to the new analysis, said he barely slept during the heat wave. Frequent power outages prevented him from even using a fan to cool off.\nAdvertisement\nFew people in the region have access to air conditioning, he said. And the architecture of many poorer neighborhoods — where buildings are often constructed with heat-trapping bricks and metal roofs — exacerbates the danger.\n'We are used to heat, but this level of extreme we have never experienced,' Guigma said. 'We will soon be at the very edge, the very limit of what human beings can actually tolerate.'\nThe heat wave analysis was just the latest report from World Weather Attribution — a global network of researchers who study the influence of climate change on extreme events — to find that previously unthinkable events are becoming commonplace as the world continues to warm. An October heat wave in Madagascar, where record-breaking heat persisted for 10 unbearable days, 'would not have occurred' without human-induced warming, the group said. The heavy rainfall in Libya that contributed to a catastrophic dam failure, killing thousands of people, was made 50 times more likely because of climate change.\nAdvertisement\nThe West African heat wave might have been unprecedented today, Barnes said. But if the world warms to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) — something that could happen by the middle of the century without rapid action to tackle climate change — a heat wave of that magnitude would be expected to occur every 10 years.\nto tackle climate change — a heat wave of that magnitude would be expected to occur every 10 years.",

            "excerpt": "A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 45% of U.S. adults say they have become more concerned about climate change over the past year",
            "summary": "Like many Americans, Ron Theusch is getting more worried about climate change.\nA resident of Alden, Minnesota, Theusch has noticed increasingly dry and mild winters punctuated by short periods of severe cold — symptoms of a warming planet.\nAs he thinks about that, future generations are on his mind. 'We have four children that are in their 20s,' the 56-year-old truck driver and moderate Democrat said. 'It's like, what's our grandkids' world going to be like?'\nA new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 45% of adults in the United States say they have become more concerned about climate change over the past year, including roughly 6 in 10 Democrats and one-quarter of Republicans.\nPresident Joe Biden's signature climate change policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, was intended to address some of those fears, investing billions in incentives for consumers and businesses to move toward clean energy sources. Biden has pointed to this climate agenda as a major presidential success during his run for reelection. But the poll suggests that although the law has already affected some Americans, it's not widely known among the general population — and may not be the electoral boost Biden is looking for.\nAdvertisement\nAbout one-quarter of Americans say tax credits for renewable energy projects such as wind power have benefited people like them so far, with similar numbers for incentives for companies to manufacture clean energy technologies in the U.S. rather than abroad, tax credits for individuals to add solar panels to their homes, or subsidies and tax credits for electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances like heat pumps. Those numbers are fairly substantial for a law that passed less than two years ago, where the benefits largely hinge on big-ticket purchases like cars or home improvements.\nPromoting electric vehicles has also been a major focus for the Biden administration, and 15% of U.S. adults say electric vehicles have had a good impact on them personally.\n'I totally agree with the act because it's done so many things for people,' said Charles Lopez, a 65-year-old liberal Democrat from the Florida Keys. 'They help everybody ... I'm not ready for a full electric, but I'll get there when there's enough charging stations.'\nAdvertisement\nBut the people who have benefited from the law are disproportionately Democrats. And while only about 1 in 10 U.S. adults think the individual tax credits and subsidies have hurt people like them, those provisions of the law aren't yet registering with the majority of Americans — roughly one-quarter say those credits haven't made a difference to people like them. Nearly 4 in 10 in each instance don't know enough to have an opinion about them.\n'I still think that, as much as we'd like for them to be implemented in a way that we can actually see results, it's not really happening in my eyes,' said Sandra Sherman, a 62-year-old resident of Vero Beach, Florida, who identifies as a liberal Democrat. 'With solar panels, although it seems like a really good idea, I see very few people in the area in Florida that I live in that actually have them.'\nGenerally, U.S. adults also aren't confident the IRA will have an impact even in more time. The poll found that only between 23% and 35% of U.S. adults say the law's key components will eventually help address climate change. About 2 in 10 think the main provisions of the law will make no difference in addressing climate change, and about one-third don't know enough to say.\nAdvertisement\n'A lot of the public feeling on it is, ‘well something needs to be done,' but not necessarily knowing what needs to be done or not even necessarily having strong feelings about what needs to be done,' said David Weakliem, a University of Connecticut professor emeritus.\nBiden still has an advantage over his opponent, former President Donald Trump, when it comes to climate change generally. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults and two-thirds of Democrats have 'a lot' or 'some' trust in Biden on climate change. That includes 29-year-old Jaime Said, a moderate Republican.\nBiden has 'talked about it more and he has mentioned a few plans of things he wants to do. So even if he doesn't do them, at the very least he's thinking about them. That's kind of headed in the right direction,' Said, a medical student in Panama City, Florida, said.\nAdvertisement\n'I know already, right off the bat, (Trump is) not going to address it much,' Said added. 'That's why I don't have too much faith in him doing anything about it.'\nOnly about 3 in 10 say they have 'a lot' or 'some' trust in Trump with regard to addressing climate change.\nBut one of Biden's major pitches for the IRA — that it will help the American economy and U.S. workers — doesn't seem to be resonating. According to the poll, only about 2 in 10 Americans say the law has done more to help the U.S. economy, while about one-quarter think it's done more to hurt the economy, and about half think it either made no difference or don't know enough to say.\nAnd broadly, a majority of Americans say the federal government is currently doing 'too little' to address climate change. They generally agree it's important for the government to support climate solutions. About half say it's extremely or very important to limit the use of products and technologies that harm the environment, and nearly half say it's important for the government to pass stricter environmental laws and regulations. About 4 in 10 say it's important for the government to build a national network of public charging stations for electric vehicles, which is another Biden administration priority.\nAdvertisement\nMost say it's extremely or very important for the federal government to invest in new, environmentally friendly technologies, and most, like 38-year-old Julio Carmona, a health program associate who lives in Stratford, Connecticut, and identifies as a moderate Democrat, say the same about enforcing current environmental regulations.\n'We can all do our part when it comes to saving energy, recycling and all those other things,' said Carmona. 'But if the big corporations aren't doing it, I think that, for me, would be where the government should start.'\n___\nThe poll of 1,204 adults was conducted April 4-8, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.\nAdvertisement\n___\nAlexa St. John is an Associated Press climate solutions reporter.

            "summary": "Regarding the April 14 editorial, 'A ‘climate club' could get China to clean up faster':\nWhy doesn't the Editorial Board want to hold heavy polluters such as China accountable without letting politics get in the way? There are two major misconceptions in the piece.\nFirst and foremost, the board assumes that the World Trade Organization requires a domestic carbon tax for compliance. The claim that a carbon price limited to imports would face insurmountable legal challenges and provoke retaliatory actions remains untested and relies on narrow interpretations of WTO policy. Analyses conducted by the Climate Leadership Council suggest that a climate and trade policy without a domestic carbon tax would comply with WTO regulations by leveraging existing domestic environmental regulations and addressing international emergencies.\nAdvertisement\nSecond, the board assumes Republicans resist engaging on climate even if it's through market-based mechanisms and trade policy. Democrats don't have a monopoly on environmental policy. The Foreign Pollution Fee Act, which I co-introduced with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), proposes a fee on certain imported industrial and energy products based on their emissions intensity relative to similar domestically produced goods. Former U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer, who served multiple Republican administrations, has been a consistent champion in leveraging U.S. trade policy to make China pay for its pollution.\nThe Foreign Pollution Fee Act would not only reduce global emissions but would also stimulate job creation, foster innovation, strengthen global supply-chain security and promote fair competition for U.S. companies on the international stage — all without imposing a domestic carbon tax, which I adamantly oppose.\nGiven the myth-busting above, it is essential to avoid needlessly politicizing the issue by maligning Republicans. Such actions undermine the potential for cooperation in Congress to develop meaningful policies that advance America's national economic interests and hold the world's largest polluters accountable.\nAdvertisement\nBill Cassidy , Washington\nBill Cassidy, Washington\nThe writer, a Republican, represents Louisiana in the U.S. Senate.\nThe writer, a Republican, represents Louisiana in the U.S. Senate.\nA change in perspective\nA recent family trip to Washington had a much more powerful effect on me than usual. I am always inspired when I go to D.C., but this trip was special.\nLike a lot of people over the past few years, I had absorbed the negativity and cynicism projected by many politicians and much of the media, but being in Washington changed my perception. Everyone I saw seemed so vibrant and positive and hopeful. There was something in the air and it wasn't just the cherry blossoms (which were magnificent!).\nThat something was something deeply American: Possibility. Cooperation. Innovation. Hope. Renewal. Transformation.\nIn one intersection, there were dozens of naval bronzes, alive with the bravery, fortitude and creative genius of Americans in the face of mortal danger. And the buildings all around me — the steps and the pillars and the tall windows — radiated a history of obstacles overcome, of compromises made, of forward positive movement toward a more inclusive nation.\nAdvertisement\nD.C. spoke to me. It transformed my perspective, from small and full of fear to large and full of hope.\nAnd my newly made and more hopeful perspective has led me to believe we can overcome our country's problems. We have overcome much greater threats.\nWe are not destined to bow down to tyrants. We are not destined to lose our democratic soul. We are not destined to the dustbin of history, as many would have us believe. America has power in reserve that we can draw on because that power is based on confidence and diversity and hope.\nThe primary task then is to project this confidence outward and reach those who do not feel it.\nToday, a lot of working-class people feel forgotten. They don't have this hope. They do the day-to-day, hands-on work of our country but do not feel they receive credit or are appreciated. This atmosphere fuels division, acrimony and distrust.\nAdvertisement\nWith the election almost here, President Biden can make workers feel less invisible and make them feel appreciated, but I think he has to talk about them every day.\nThe more Mr. Biden points out what workers contribute, the more he highlights their value to our country, the more he emphasizes how important they are, the more remembered workers will feel. The more appreciated they will feel. Feeling appreciated is powerful. It could help to lift our country up, to push back against our division and acrimony.\nI believe we can pull ourselves together as a nation and create a positive, innovative and fulfilling future. A future in which all of our children can achieve their full potential.\nDaniel Wasik , Fanwood, N.J.\nDaniel Wasik, Fanwood, N.J.\nThe climate is everyone's family business\nIt's little wonder that Kathryn Murdoch 'steers clear of discussing family business,' as reported in the April 10 Style article 'A climate of optimism.' She is concerned that today's youths have 'the sense that the future is doomed and we're helpless to do anything about it.' One reason scientists have been raising the alarm about the dangers of climate change is to counter the climate denialism of Fox News.\nAdvertisement\nOver the years, Fox News hosts such as Tucker Carlson, Jesse Watters, Laura Ingraham and others have tried to debunk the scientific consensus on climate change. According to Media Matters, 'On a near-daily basis, Fox News hosts, anchors, and guests spew misinformation and false narratives aimed at tanking efforts to address the climate crisis.' Perhaps Ms. Murdoch could work on her own family to encourage them to stop their climate denialism and start working on presenting positive solutions to the most important problem we face today.\nBruce Wright , Reston\nBruce Wright, Reston\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe abortion double-standard\nI have become increasingly incensed at the perspective on the abortion issue. At the moment, the theme of the abortion debate seems to be about punishing women. We have lost sight of the man (or the sperm donor).\nAdvertisement\nYou could reduce this discussion to a completely scientific one if we were talking about creating only test-tube babies, but then there would be no need to 'punish' anyone, except maybe the scientists involved. That could happen yet.\nWomen do not experience immaculate conception except in the Bible. So, what about the men?\nWhat if we propose legislation that makes it illegal for men over 50 to impregnate anyone? How about making it illegal for men to receive erectile-dysfunction medications? If a man is convicted of rape, incest or sexual assault, should he be required to get mandatory castration?\nPreventing pregnancy is almost always looked upon as a woman's responsibility. But we know it is not. There is no way measures such as those mentioned above would ever pass our mostly male legislatures — either at the state or federal levels.\nAdvertisement\nSuch measures would treat men as punitively as women are treated in the context of reproduction. And, reproduction is the subject, not abortion.\nJulie Van Egmond , Naples, Fla.\nJulie Van Egmond, Naples, Fla.\nI don't understand why the Arizona Supreme Court is punishing women for having an abortion but isn't punishing the men for impregnating them.

            "summary": "After nearly two years' worth of rain flooded the Dubai region Tuesday, attention quickly shifted to cloud seeding and whether it could have been a factor in the deluge. The geoengineering technology has successfully produced rainfall over the arid United Arab Emirates in the past.\nBut scientists said the downpour was a product of weather patterns that meteorological models predicted as much as a week earlier. Climate research has shown such intense precipitation across the Arabian Peninsula could become more frequent and extreme due to warming global temperatures.\nThe UAE National Center of Meteorology told CNBC it did not conduct any cloud-seeding operations during the storm, countering a Bloomberg News report that said geoengineering intensified the rainfall. Efforts by The Washington Post on Wednesday to reach the center were not successful.\nAdvertisement\nEven if cloud seeding did occur, it would take sophisticated research to determine whether it increased the rainfall — something that has proved difficult in past scientific inquiry. Without that, one has to assume geoengineering was not a factor, said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University.\n'Show me the analysis that shows it was cloud seeding,' Dessler said. 'Without seeing some analysis, your null hypothesis has to be that it did not contribute.'\nWhat is cloud seeding?\nThe practice involves injecting a chemical known as silver iodide into clouds that contain large amounts of water vapor. The substance can encourage the formation of ice crystals, which promote precipitation in the form of rain or snow.\nThe practice is decades old and has been used around the world and across the United States, including in California, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, Utah and Idaho, according to the Desert Research Institute.\nAdvertisement\nResearch has shown signs the technology can increase snowpack in the American West, for example, though not at a level of statistical significance that has thus far convinced many meteorologists that it actually works.\nOther research has been more definitive about cloud seeding's effectiveness, though with results not easily reproduced. A research effort known as the SNOWIE project found the practice produced enough snow to fill 282 Olympic-size swimming pools in a span of about two hours.\nStill, it is known to work only under certain circumstances, when clouds are rich with moisture, Dessler said.\nSevere rain storms brought flash floods to Oman on April 14 and the United Arab Emirates on April 16. (Video: John Farrell/The Washington Post)\nWhat happened in Dubai?\nThe floods that hit the UAE were significantly more extreme than what is considered a 1-in-100-year flood there, carrying a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year.\nIn Al Ain, about 75 miles southeast of Dubai, the National Center of Meteorology reported 254.8 millimeters of rainfall — more than 10 inches — in less than 24 hours. The center called it 'an exceptional event … in its climatic history' and the country's heaviest rainfall in 75 years.\nAdvertisement\nClose to 5 inches of rain fell at Dubai International Airport, where about 3 inches of rain is normal in an entire year.\nToday's extreme rain event in Dubai was clearly associated with a synoptic configuration that increased the odds of excessive rainfall.\nA slow-moving, positively tilted trough with a strong plume of moisture transport led to record high PWAT for April: https://t.co/vL3ZAbqkIH pic.twitter.com/Opoc8B8mRP\nA slow-moving, positively tilted trough with a strong plume of moisture transport led to record high PWAT for April: https://t.co/vL3ZAbqkIH pic.twitter.com/Opoc8B8mRP — Tomer Burg (@burgwx) April 17, 2024\nMeteorologists said significant amounts of rain would have fallen with or without cloud seeding. It was the product of a slow-moving area of relatively low atmospheric pressure and abundant moisture in the air.\nThe scale of rainfall was also much larger than what cloud seeding could have produced, according to Giles Harrison, a professor of atmospheric physics at the University of Reading in Britain. Given that heavy rain was in the forecast, there would have been no obvious reason to attempt cloud seeding, he added.\nWhat role does climate change play?\nFriederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London who leads a research effort to explore the role of climate change in extreme weather events, called any focus on cloud seeding in the floods 'misleading.'\nAdvertisement\nInstead, she and other scientists pointed to the fact that warming global temperatures are producing heavier rainfall around the world because warmer air can hold more moisture.\n'Even if cloud seeding did encourage clouds around Dubai to drop water, the atmosphere would have likely been carrying more water to form clouds in the first place, because of climate change,' she said in a statement.\nOtto said in an email that she is not certain whether her group, World Weather Attribution, will explore the role that climate change may have played in the latest floods.",

            "summary": "Regarding the April 10 news article 'European court rules Switzerland climate inaction violated human rights':\nEvery year, 218 million people are affected by climate-related disasters, resulting in at least 70,000 deaths. Despite this, our preparations remain inadequate.\nClimate change not only causes natural disasters but also creates global health emergencies. Wildfires burn in California, and Canada faces a high risk. Other disasters around the world this year have already claimed hundreds of lives. Why are we still unprepared?\nThe World Health Organization director general authored a new official report, titled 'Climate Change and Health.' This report acknowledges climate change as a critical health issue and proposes a structured approach to address it. As young physicians and global health researchers, we urge governments to prioritize health in their climate policies, enhance data collection and monitoring, and standardize protocols for capacity building.\nAdvertisement\nThe pandemic exposed gaps in our emergency response capacity. We call upon the governments to strengthen health-care capacity, preparing the health-care systems to act as pillars of sustainability in the face of climate change. The time to prepare is now.\nShreenik Kundu and Ayla Gerk , Montreal\nShreenik Kundu and Ayla Gerk, Montreal\nThe writers are PhD students at McGill University with fellowship studies at the Program in Global Surgery and Social Change at Harvard Medical School.\nThe writers are PhD students at McGill University with fellowship studies at the Program in Global Surgery and Social Change at Harvard Medical School.\nAt the most fundamental level, the world's struggle to make progress combating climate change is a product of humankind's most tragic flaw: We are incapable of protecting ourselves from ourselves. In the same vein, we might be unable to exhibit the required understanding, cooperativeness and selflessness needed to overcome the effects of climate change.\nSince the discovery of climate change a half-century ago, the world's reaction has been appalling. The response from those in the best position to do something about it, such as world political leaders and the barons of industry, has ranged from inadequate to nonexistent. For far too long, it seems the prospect of the end of humanity has paled in significance when compared with the continuation of the status quo, with its profits and comforts. The urgency of the situation is finally taking hold, but is it happening too late? Precious time has been wasted.\nAdvertisement\nPerhaps the world's best hope for survival would be the use of cutting-edge science and technology to, for example, remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. The nature of the process would be analogous to the extraction of salt from the ocean, but immensely more complex. A major advantage of such a solution is that it would be less affected by the proclivities of human behavior. Even in an advanced country such as the United States, a significant number of people still believe the whole thing is a 'hoax,' and business as usual still reigns. It really does feel like, once again, we can't help ourselves — but this time, the consequences could be fatal for the entire human species.\nHarry Flickinger , Gaithersburg\nHarry Flickinger, Gaithersburg\nRegarding the April 10 article 'U.N. climate chief presses for faster action, says humans have 2 years left ‘to save the world'':\nAdvertisement\nWhile the thought of 'two years left' seems depressingly pessimistic to me as a college student, it's important that we don't lose faith and focus on solutions. Although this article is more concerned with carbon emissions on a global scale, it is crucial that we look inward at our own domestic responsibility in reducing our emissions. The United States has yet to pass legislation for large-scale emissions reductions, such as a carbon fee to encourage polluters to turn to more renewable energy and a dividend distributed to every citizen to cushion the result of the fee.\nWhile Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University, worries this two-year warning will be ignored, it is my hope that it can be a call to action. While issues of climate change seem overwhelming to many citizens, our nation is based on the power of the ballot to prioritize the greatest threats to our future. November is coming.\nCourtney Hand , Williamsburg, Va.\nCourtney Hand, Williamsburg, Va.\nWhat Donald Trump doesn't understand about Jewish voters\nRegarding Philip Bump's April 10 analysis, 'Browbeating Jewish voters hasn't yet worked for Trump':\nAdvertisement\nDonald Trump's statement that Jews who don't vote Republican don't love Israel is a waste of breath. I am a Jew, and I love Israel. It's Benjamin Netanyahu whom I don't like or trust. There is mounting evidence that the Israeli prime minister is holding on to power for the same reason Mr. Trump wants to return to power: to keep out of the courtroom. The last time I voted for a Republican was in November 1990. But if you're wondering, I'm not voting for any current Republican, and I still love Israel.\nRobert Bronstein , New York\nRobert Bronstein, New York\nDonald Trump might be surprised to learn that Jewish voters, even those of us who are strong supporters of Israel, have strong feelings about other priorities as well. We care about education, the economy, women's health care, gun safety, foreign affairs, the environment, crime and, yes, even immigration. We are very aware that if Mr. Trump wins and the Republicans take the House and Senate, we will likely lose any progress we have made on these issues.\nAdvertisement\nHow do we know this? Mr. Trump has developed a track record since his surprising win in 2016. His overriding concern, as he seeks the presidency for the third time, seems to be avoiding convictions in his many criminal cases and, if he wins, destroying his enemies. We have a long history of democracy and freedom in this country. When countries lose that, it never works well for the Jewish people. There's a track record for that, too.\nElliott Miller , Bala Cynwyd, Pa.\nElliott Miller, Bala Cynwyd, Pa.\nThe problem with an immediate cease-fire\nRegarding the April 9 op-ed by Jordanian King Abdullah II, French President Emmanuel Macron and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, 'Three nations, one message: A permanent Gaza cease-fire now':\nBefore Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel sought a two-state solution. Under the Oslo accords, Israel wanted a two-state solution. Former U.S. ambassador Dennis Ross recounted in his book 'The Missing Peace: The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace' the proposed solution in 2000 that would have given the Palestinian Authority 95 percent of what they wanted. Then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak agreed, but Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestinian Authority, walked away. The current leader of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, does not want to live in peace with Israel, and Hamas wants to destroy Israel.\nAdvertisement\nThe proposed cease-fire will not be permanent until both sides respect each other's right to exist. Israel is threatened with hostile neighbors and acts accordingly. Are the authors of this op-ed willing to commit troops and resources to ensure that Israel is secure? With a secure Israel, a rational prime minister could be elected to build a two-state solution. What commitments will the authors and the United Nations make to provide effective, peace-loving government(s) for the Palestinians?\nRobert Finkelstein , Reston, Va.\nRobert Finkelstein, Reston, Va.\nJordanian King Abdullah II, French President Emmanuel Macron and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi have observed that 'Protecting civilians is a fundamental legal obligation for all parties and 'the cornerstone' of international humanitarian law. Violating this obligation is absolutely prohibited.' With all due respect, this statement is both inaccurate and misleading.\nAdvertisement\nYes, the protection of 'noncombatants' is a fundamental principle of the Law of Armed Conflict. However, it is not the cornerstone. Historically, the LOAC has recognized that civilian deaths and the destruction of civilian property will often occur in the course of armed conflict. The principal purpose of the LOAC has thus been to mitigate, not eliminate, this loss of civilian life and property by regulating the means and methods by which conflict might be lawfully conducted. Accordingly, a commander must refrain from an attack in which the anticipated incidental civilian harm would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained.\nThus, while the protection of civilians is indeed a fundamental consideration in conducting a military operation, this factor does not take priority over mission accomplishment. A warfighter, in developing an operation plan, cannot do so on the basis that, legally, his primary concern must not be the military necessity of accomplishing his mission, but rather the protection of the enemy's civilian population. To contend that this is the case would be to turn the LOAC on its head.\nDavid E. Graham , Charlottesville\nDavid E. Graham, Charlottesville\nAdvertisement\nThe leaders of Egypt, France and Jordan all support an immediate cease-fire, which is counterintuitive to the universally supported right of Israel to defend itself. Hamas publicly claims its members will repeat the Oct. 7 attack until Israel no longer exists.\nThe call for releasing hostages is laudable. However, bear in mind that Hamas wishes to exchange the people they kidnapped for criminals and murderers held in Israel's prisons. Will released prisoners carry out another Oct. 7?",

            "summary": "With cloud seeding, it may rain, but it doesn't really pour or flood — at least nothing like what drenched the United Arab Emirates and paralyzed Dubai, meteorologists said.\nCloud seeding, although decades old, is still controversial in the weather community, mostly because it has been hard to prove that it does very much. No one reports the type of flooding that on Tuesday doused the UAE, which often deploys the technology in an attempt to squeeze every drop of moisture from a sky that usually gives less than 4 or 5 inches (10 to 13 centimeters) of rain a year.\n'It's most certainly not cloud seeding,' said private meteorologist Ryan Maue, former chief scientist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 'If that occurred with cloud seeding, they'd have water all the time. You can't create rain out of thin air per se and get 6 inches of water. That's akin to perpetual motion technology.'\nAdvertisement\nMeteorologists and climate scientists said the extreme rainfall is akin to what the world expects with human-caused climate change, and one way to know for certain that it was not caused by tinkering with clouds is that it was forecast days in advance. Atmospheric science researcher Tomer Burg pointed to computer models that six days earlier forecast several inches of rain — the typical amount for an entire year in the UAE.\nThree low-pressure systems formed a train of storms slowly moving along the jet stream — the river of air that moves weather systems — toward the Persian Gulf, said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann. Blaming cloud seeding ignores the forecasts and the cause, he said.\nMany of the people pointing to cloud seeding are also climate change deniers who are trying to divert attention from what's really happening, Mann and other scientists said.\nAdvertisement\n'When we talk about heavy rainfall, we need to talk about climate change. Focusing on cloud seeding is misleading,' said Imperial College of London climate scientist Friederike Otto, who heads a team that does rapid attribution of weather extremes to see if they were caused by global warming or not. 'Rainfall is becoming much heavier around the world as the climate warms because a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture.'\nWHAT IS CLOUD SEEDING?\nClouds need tiny water or ice droplets called nuclei to make rain. The weather modification method uses planes and ground-based cannons to shoot particles into clouds making more nucleai, attracting moisture that falls as snow and rain. Usually silver iodide is used, but it can also be dry ice and other materials. The method, first pioneered in the 1940s, became popular in the U.S. West starting in the 1960s, mostly for snow.\nAdvertisement\nIt can't create water from a clear sky — particles must be shot into a storm cloud that already holds moisture to get it to fall, or to fall more than it otherwise would naturally.\nHOW EFFECTIVE IS IT?\nA recent study of aerial seeding found a clear precipitation pattern on a radar that mirrored the seeding and offers evidence the method works. But exactly how effective it is remains unclear, scientists say.\nThe physics makes sense, but the results have been so small that scientists just can't agree on whether it is fair to say it really works, said Maue and Mann.\nAtmospheric forces are so huge and so chaotic that technically cloud seeding 'is way too small a scale to create what happened,' Maue said. Extra rainfall from cloud seeding would have been minimal, both said.\nWHO USES IT?\nDespite not knowing its efficacy, governments in drought-stricken regions like the U.S. West and the UAE are often willing to invest in technology like seeding in the hopes of getting even a small amount of water.\nAdvertisement\nUtah estimates cloud seeding helped increase its water supply by 12% in 2018, according to an analysis by the state's Division of Water Resources. The analysis used estimates provided to them by the contractors paid to do the seeding.\nDozens of countries in Asia and the Middle East also use cloud seeding.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Reclamation spent $2.4 million last year on cloud seeding along the overtapped Colorado River. Utah recently increased its seeding budget by tenfold.\nSO WHAT CAUSED THE DELUGE?\nThat part of the Middle East doesn't get many storms, but when it does, they are whoppers that dwarf what people in the United States are used to, Maue said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nHuge tropical storms like this 'are not rare events for the Middle East,' said University of Reading meteorology professor Suzanne Gray. She cited a recent study analyzing nearly 100 such events over the southern Arabian Peninsula from 2000 to 2020, with most in March and April, including a March 2016 storm that dropped 9.4 inches (almost 24 centimeters) on Dubai in just a few hours.\nAdvertisement\nThe 2021 study said 'a statistically significant increase in the (whopper storms) duration over southeast Arabian Peninsula has been found, suggesting that such extreme events may be even more impactful in a warming world.'\nSIZE IS IMPORTANT\nWhile cloud seeding can work around the margins, it doesn't do big things, scientists say.\n'It's maybe a little bit of a human conceit that, yeah, we can control the weather in like a Star Trek sense,' Maue, who was appointed to NOAA by then-President Donald Trump, said. 'Maybe on long time scales, climate time scales, we're affecting the atmosphere on long time scales. But when it comes to controlling individual rain storms, we are not anywhere close to that. And if we were capable of doing that, I think we would be capable of solving many more difficult problems than creating a rain shower over Dubai.'\n___\nBorenstein reported from Washington, Peterson from Boulder, Colorado.\n___",

Lack of oversight, inadequate scientific review and faulty accounting have left the voluntary offset market awash in credits that studies conclude are not coming close to canceling out the level of emissions claimed, and often not erasing any.\nAs the world's climate goals slip further from reach, activists, regulators and companies are scrambling for fixes, warning that keeping warming in check may hinge on their success. One of the most ambitious initiatives launches Wednesday, when the Rockefeller Foundation unveils a pioneering plan to create offsets targeted at shutting down heavily polluting coal plants in developing Asian economies.\nAdvertisement\nThe goal is to show offsets can, indeed, be a credible and effective way to slow warming, rather than a Rube Goldberg-like mechanism enabling companies to skirt their climate commitments.\n'There has been a lot of sloppy thinking' in the offset industry, said Joseph Curtin, managing director of Rockefeller's power and climate team. 'It has led to bad practices and over crediting.'\nThis is particularly true in places such as the United States that lack a federal climate policy guiding how businesses ramp down their emissions. In that vacuum, a voluntary offset system emerged through which corporations set their own climate goals and purchase the credits to help meet them. Companies also sell credits directly to consumers of such things as plane tickets and rental cars, promising that a few extra bucks will cancel out the emissions created by the travel.\nAdvertisement\nBut the system, managed by an unregulated industry of credit sellers, is often opaque and dysfunctional. In numerous cases, assertions that projects are lowering global emissions have been debunked by scientific evidence showing otherwise. At least one offsets leader has overhauled its methodology.\nThe foundation's goal is to offer companies that purchase the credits concrete proof that they helped speed the retirement of dirty coal plants that would have been operating years longer but for the offsets. Carbon credits have never before been used to decommission coal plants. The energy is replaced with clean power through the program, and workers in shuttered coal plants will be provided alternative employment.\nprovided alternative employment.\nIt is not a cheap endeavor. The foundation would not talk publicly about the cost of the credits it plans to sell once the project is operational or identify the companies expressing interest in buying them. But one of the challenges faced by the Rockefeller-sponsored effort, called the Coal to Clean Credit Initiative, is the market is awash in flawed credits that can be bought for a fraction of the price of those used to shut down coal plants.\nAdvertisement\n'A lot of revenue will be needed to make this work,' Curtin said. 'The question is, will we find purchasers?'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe target buyers, program officials say, are financially flush corporations in sectors such as tech or banking that have made ambitious commitments to erase their carbon footprints but are struggling to find a viable path to fulfill them.\nThe program will get underway in the Philippines, working with the ACEN South Luzon Thermal Energy Corp. to shut down a large coal plant it operates there. The plant has contracts to run through 2040. Officials at the Rockefeller Foundation are aiming to sell credits to close the plant a decade earlier. Doing so, they say, would avert as much as 19 million tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere. The central bank of Singapore has also joined the effort.\nAdvertisement\n'The reality is that we are going backwards in the fight against climate change and in advancing the energy transition needed in developing countries,' said Rajiv J. Shah, president of the foundation. 'If we don't make progress this decade on increasing private investment into speeding their transition away from coal and into cleaner forms of energy, we will lose the fight on climate, period.'\nThe Philippines plant is one of 6,500 coal-fired plants around the world, most of them locked into operating for years into the future through long-term energy contracts. They are projected to dump more than 190 billion tons of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere during that time.\nDeveloping credible offsets to shut them down is a heavy lift, as they must be structured in a way that prevents shrewd energy companies from cashing in on the credits and building more coal plants nearby.

Other areas of the country saw even more precipitation.\nThe UAE's drainage systems quickly became overwhelmed, flooding out neighborhoods, business districts and even portions of the 12-lane Sheikh Zayed Road highway running through Dubai.\nAdvertisement\nThe state-run WAM news agency called the rain 'a historic weather event' that surpassed 'anything documented since the start of data collection in 1949.'\nIn a message to the nation late Wednesday, Emirati leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, said authorities would 'quickly work on studying the condition of infrastructure throughout the UAE and to limit the damage caused.'\nOn Thursday, people waded through oil-slicked floodwater to reach cars earlier abandoned, checking to see if their engines still ran. Tanker trucks with vacuums began reaching some areas outside of Dubai's downtown core for the first time as well. Schools remain closed until next week.\nAuthorities have offered no overall damage or injury information from the floods, which killed at least one person.\nAdvertisement\n'Crises reveal the strength of countries and societies,' Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, wrote on X. 'The natural climate crisis that we experienced showed the great care, awareness, cohesion and love for every corner of the country from all its citizens and residents.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe flooding sparked speculation that the UAE's aggressive campaign of cloud seeding — flying small planes through clouds dispersing chemicals aimed at getting rain to fall — may have contributed to the deluge. But experts said the storm systems that produced the rain were forecast well in advance and that cloud seeding alone would not have caused such flooding.\nJeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections, said the flooding in Dubai was caused by an unusually strong low pressure system that drove many rounds of heavy thunderstorms.\nAdvertisement\nScientists also say climate change is responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme storms, droughts, floods and wildfires around the world. Dubai hosted the United Nations' COP28 climate talks just last year.\nAbu Dhabi's state-linked newspaper The National in an editorial Thursday described the heavy rains as a warning to countries in the wider Persian Gulf region to 'climate-proof their futures.'",

            "summary": "NAPLES, Italy — Europe is the fastest-warming continent and its temperatures are rising at roughly twice the global average, two top climate monitoring organizations reported Monday, warning of the consequences for human health, glacier melt and economic activity.\nThe U.N.'s World Meteorological Organization and the European Union's climate agency, Copernicus, said in a joint report that the continent has the opportunity to develop targeted strategies to speed up the transition to renewable resources like wind, solar and hydroelectric power in response to the effects of climate change.\nThe continent generated 43% of its electricity from renewable resources last year, up from 36% the year before, the agencies say in their European State of the Climate report for last year. More energy in Europe was generated from renewables than from fossil fuels for the second year running.\nAdvertisement\nThe latest five-year averages show that temperatures in Europe are now running 2.3 degrees Celsius (4.1 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, compared to 1.3 degrees Celsius higher globally, the report says — just shy of the targets under the 2015 Paris climate accord to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n'Europe saw yet another year of increasing temperatures and intensifying climate extremes — including heat stress with record temperatures, wildfires, heat waves, glacier ice loss and lack of snowfall,' said Elisabeth Hamdouch, the deputy head of unit for Copernicus at the EU's executive commission.\nThe report serves up a continental complement for WMO's flagship state of the global climate report, which has been published annually for three decades, and this year came with a 'red alert' warning that the world isn't doing enough to fight the consequences of global warming.\nAdvertisement\nCopernicus has reported that March marked the 10th straight month of record monthly temperatures. The average sea-surface temperature for the ocean across Europe hit its highest annual level in 2023, the Europe report said.\nThe European report focuses this year on the impact of high temperatures on human health, noting that deaths related to heat have risen across the continent. It said more than 150 lives were lost directly last year in connection with storms, floods and wildfires.\nThe cost of weather- and climate-related economic losses in 2023 were estimated at more than 13.4 billion euros (about $14.3 billion).\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'Hundreds of thousands of people were affected by extreme climate events in 2023, which have been responsible for large losses at continental level, estimated to be at least in the tens of billions of euros,' said Copernicus director Carlo Buontempo. 'Unfortunately, these figures are unlikely and likely to get smaller, at least in the near future.'\nAdvertisement\nExtreme weather fanned heat waves, wildfires, droughts and flooding, the report said. High temperatures have contributed to a loss of glacier ice on the continent, including in the Alps — which have lost about 10% of their remaining glacier ice over the last two years.",

            "summary": "ANDEREN, Netherlands — Inside the barn on the flat fields of the northern Netherlands, Jos Ubels cradles a newborn Blonde d'Aquitaine calf, the latest addition to his herd of over 300 dairy cattle.\nLittle could be more idyllic.\nLittle, says Ubels, could be more under threat.\nAs Europe seeks to address the threat of climate change, it's imposing more rules on farmers like Ubels. He spends a day a week on bureaucracy, answering the demands of European Union and national officials who seek to decide when farmers can sow and reap, and how much fertilizer or manure they can use.\nMeanwhile, competition from cheap imports is undercutting prices for their produce, without having to meet the same standards. Mainstream political parties failed to act on farmers' complaints for decades, Ubels says. Now the radical right is stepping in.\nAdvertisement\nAcross much of the 27-nation EU, from Finland to Greece, Poland to Ireland, farmers' discontent is gathering momentum as June EU parliamentary elections draw near.\nUbels is the second in command of the Farmers Defense Force, one of the most prominent groups to emerge from the foment. The FDF, whose symbol is a crossed double pitchfork, was formed in 2019 and has since expanded to Belgium. It has ties to similar groups elsewhere in the EU and is a driving force behind a planned June 4 demonstration in Brussels it hopes will bring 100,000 people to the EU capital and help define the outcome of the elections.\n'It is time that we fight back,' said Ubels. 'We're done with quietly listening and doing what we are told.'\nHas he lost trust in democracy? 'No. … I have lost my faith in politics. And that is one step removed.'\nAdvertisement\nThe FDF itself puts it more ominously on its website: 'Our confidence in the rule of law is wavering!'\n___\nThis story, supported by the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting, is part of an ongoing Associated Press series covering threats to democracy in Europe.\n___\n'DON'T LET UP!'\nIn March, protesting farmers from Belgium ran amok at a demonstration outside EU headquarters in Brussels, setting fire to a subway station entrance and attacking police with eggs and liquid manure. In France, protesters tried to storm a government building.\nIn a video from another protest, in front of burning tires and pallets, FDF leader Mark van den Oever said two politicians made him sick to his stomach, saying they would 'soon be at the center of attention.' The FDF denies this was a threat of physical violence.\nAcross the EU, over the winter, tractor convoys blockaded ports and major roads, sometimes for days, in some of the most severe farm protests in half a century.\nAdvertisement\nFarmers and the EU have had a sometimes testy relationship. What's new is the shift toward the extreme right.\nDestitute after World War II and with hunger still a scourge in winter, Europe desperately needed food security. The EU stepped in, securing abundant food for the population, turning the sector into an export powerhouse and currently funding farmers to the tune of over 50 billion euros a year.\nYet, despite agriculture's strategic importance, the EU acknowledges that farmers earn about 40% less than non-farm workers, while 80% of support goes to a privileged 20% of farmers. Many of the bloc's 8.7 million farm workers are close to or below the poverty line.\nAt the same time, the EU is seeking to push through stringent nature and agricultural laws as part of its Green Deal to make the bloc climate-neutral by 2050. Agriculture accounts for more than 10% of EU greenhouse gas emissions, from sources such as the nitrous oxide in fertilizers, carbon dioxide from vehicles and methane from cattle.\nAdvertisement\nCutting these emissions has forced short-notice changes on farmers at a time of financial insecurity. The COVID-19 pandemic and surging inflation have increased the cost of goods and labor, while farmers' earnings are down as squeezed consumers cut back.\nAnd then there's the war next door. After Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, the EU granted tariff-free access for agricultural imports from Ukraine, many of them exempt from the strict environmental standards the bloc enforces on its own producers. Imports surged from 7 billion euros in 2021 to 13 billion euros the following year, causing gluts and undercutting farmers, particularly in Poland.\n'Don't let up,' Marion Maréchal, the lead candidate for France's extreme right Reconquest! party in the June elections, exhorted farmers at a protest earlier this year. 'You have to be in the streets. You have to make yourself heard. You have to —' she tried to finish the sentence but was drowned out by shouts of 'Don't Let Up! Don't Let Up!'\nFERTILE GROUND\nFarming in Europe is about more than just food; it touches on identity. In France, the far right taps into the love of 'terroir,' that mythical combination of soil, location, culture and climate.\nAdvertisement\n'The French realize that the farmers are the roots of our society,' said Maréchal.\nSuch sentiments echo across Europe. In Ireland, where more than a million people died in the famine of 1845-1852, farming 'is deep in our culture, in our psyche,' said Environment Minister Eamon Ryan, a Green Party lawmaker.\nThe far right has used farming as a way to attack mainstream parties. In Italy, the far right has mocked the EU's efforts to promote a low-carbon diet, playing on farmers' fears that lab-grown proteins and insects could one day replace meat.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'Revolt is the language of those who are not listened to. Now, back off,' warned far-right Italian lawmaker Nicola Procaccini in February. In a few months, he said, the European elections 'will put people back in place of ideologies.'\nSuch calls fall on fertile ground. According to predictions by the European Council on Foreign Relations, the radical right Identity and Democracy group could become the third biggest overall in the next European Parliament, behind the Christian Democrats and the Socialists, but edging out the Liberals and Greens. The farm protests are providing vital leverage.\nA SPADE IS A SPADE\nOne farmer sidestepping militant demonstrations is Bart Dochy in western Belgium. As the Christian Democrat mayor of the farming town of Ledegem and a regional parliamentarian in Flanders, he represents the traditional forces in European farming communities: Christianity and conservativism. When Socialism took the big cities, the countryside and its farmers remained staunchly Christian Democrat.\nAdvertisement\nThat's now changed. Once, billboards with the cry, 'Save our farmers!' would have come from his party; now, they bear the logo of the far-right Flemish Interest, predicted by polls to become the biggest party in Belgium in June.\n'In a sense it is only logical that the extreme parties have specialized in capturing that discontent. They call a spade a spade. And that is good,' he said. But farming is complicated, he warned: nature, trade, budgets, commodity prices and geopolitics are all involved. Solutions will have to come from common sense, 'not from the extremes.'\nDochy's Christian Democrats are part of the biggest group in the EU parliament, the European People's Party, once a strong proponent of the EU's Green Deal. Farmers, after all, are among the biggest losers from climate change, affected at different times by flooding, wildfires, drought and extreme temperatures.\nAdvertisement\nBut ever since the demonstrations started, EU politics on agriculture and climate have shifted rightwards, outraging many of the center right's old allies with whom it set up the Green Deal. Measures to reduce pesticide use and protect biodiversity have been weakened, while the protesters' demands to cut regulation have been heard.\nBut as the rhetoric heats up, so too does the climate. Data for early 2024 shows record-breaking temperatures in Europe. In Greece — where an estimated 1,750 square kilometers (675 square miles) burned in 2023, the worst fire in EU records — wildfires are already breaking out, weeks earlier than expected.\nThe far right offers no detailed solutions to the climate crisis but it has proved adept at tapping into farmers' frustrations. In its program for the June elections, the Dutch far-right party, the PVV, is short on details but big on slogans about 'climate hysteria' and its 'tsunami of rules.' Nature and climate laws, it said, 'should not lead to whole sectors being forced into bankruptcy.'\nUbels made the case for farmers' realpolitik.",

            "summary": "The world installed 117 gigawatts of new wind power capacity in 2023, a 50% increase from the year before, making it the best year for new wind projects on record, according to a new report by the industry's trade association.\nThe latest Global Wind Report, published Tuesday by the Global Wind Energy Council, explores the state of the global wind industry and the challenges it's facing in its expansion.\nThe increase in wind installations 'shows that the world is moving in the right direction in combating climate change,' the report said.\nBut the authors warned that the wind industry must increase its annual growth to at least 320 gigawatts by 2030 in order to meet the COP28 pledge to triple the world's installed renewable energy generation capacity by 2030, as well as to meet the Paris Agreement's ambition of capping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit).\nAdvertisement\n'It's great to see wind industry growth picking up, and we are proud of reaching a new annual record,' said GWEC CEO Ben Backwell, 'however much more needs to be done to unlock growth.'\nStill, the report shows that wind is becoming 'better understood and appreciated across the globe for the value it brings as a renewable energy source,' said George Aluru, CEO of the Electricity Sector Association of Kenya, an industry body for private investors in electricity.\n'This increased renewable energy supply supports climate goals in line with ensuring sustainable development,' he said.\nWith the growing impacts of climate change, wind power and other renewable energy sources are seen as a key to reducing electricity generation from fossil fuels and mitigating climate change. Renewables are the cheapest form of electricity in many parts of the world and among the cheapest in most others.\nAdvertisement\nThe global cumulative wind power capacity now totals 1,021 gigawatts.\nChristian Andresen, research manager at SINTEF Energy Research, a Norway-based independent institute for applied research in the energy sector, said the report shows that the wind industry is 'picking up pace' by attracting investments and gaining maturity, and that may lead to a snowball effect leading to future growth.\nFor the planet, he said, it indicates that it is possible to ramp up to reach climate targets.\n'This is an important building block in the transition towards a net-zero emission society,' said Andresen.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAs was the case in 2022, China led all other countries for both new onshore and offshore wind power installations in 2023. It had 65% of new installations, and was followed by the U.S., Brazil and Germany, respectively. Together, these four countries accounted for 77% of new installations globally last year.\nAdvertisement\nThe report notes that growth in wind power installations is highly concentrated in a few big countries and links that to strong market frameworks to scale wind installations in those countries. The top five markets at the end of last year remained as China, the U.S., Germany, India and Spain.\nStill, some other countries and regions are coming up, having witnessed record levels of growth in 2023.\nAfrica and the Middle East installed nearly 1 gigawatt of wind power capacity in 2023, almost triple that of the previous year. With upcoming projects in South Africa, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the report predicts that new onshore wind additions for Africa and the Middle East will grow fivefold by 2028 compared with 2023.\nSome of the markets to watch include Kenya, where windpower provides around 17% of electricity, the report said. The country has the largest wind farm in Africa, the 310-megawatt Lake Turkana Wind Power Project, and the report notes new planned large-scale wind projects in the country, including a 1-gigawatt wind park by local power generator KenGen.\nAdvertisement\nBut building wind power installations is expensive and entails high up-front investments, and emerging and developing countries face higher cost of capital and pay higher loan rates to build out their wind, the report said.\nWind energy also faces supply chain and grid challenges, and innovation in the electricity system is needed to integrate intermittent wind energy onto the grid while retaining reliability, said Erin Baker, professor of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at the University of Massachusetts. Offshore wind, she said as an example, has some very specialized equipment and manufacturing, and also requires expertise in finance and business models.\nBut the accelerating growth of wind energy, as shown in the report, means that countries are developing the supply chains needed to keep this growth up, and it will 'almost certainly' lead to reductions in cost and improvements in the technology as more and more is built around the world, she said.\nAdvertisement\n'The recent growth, and nations support for the wind industry, are hopeful signs that the supply chain is being established,' said Baker.\n__",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is marking Earth Day by announcing $7 billion in federal grants for residential solar projects serving 900,000-plus households in low- and middle-income communities. He also plans to expand his New Deal-style American Climate Corps green jobs training program.\nThe grants are being awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency, which unveiled the 60 recipients on Monday. The projects are expected to eventually reduce emissions by the equivalent of 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and save households $350 million annually, according to senior administration officials.\nBiden's latest environmental announcements come as he is working to energize young voters for his reelection campaign. Young people were a key part of a broad but potentially fragile coalition that helped him defeat then-President Donald Trump in 2020. Some have joined protests around the country of the administration's handling of Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\nAdvertisement\nSenior administration officials said young Americans are keenly invested in the Biden climate agenda and want to actually help enact it. The Climate Corps initiative is a way for them to do that, the officials said.\nSolar is gaining traction as a key renewable energy source that could reduce the nation's reliance on fossil fuels, which emit planet-warming greenhouse gases. Not only is it clean, but solar energy can also boost the reliability of the electric grid.\nBut solar energy can have high costs for initial installation, making it inaccessible for many Americans — and potentially meaning a mingling of environmental policy with election-year politics.\nForty-nine of the new grants are state-level awards, six serve Native American tribes and five are multi-state awards. They can be used for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens.\nAdvertisement\nBiden is making the announcement at northern Virginia's Prince William Forest Park, about 30 miles southwest of Washington. It was established in 1936 as a summer camp for underprivileged youth from Washington, part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps to help create jobs during the Great Depression.\nBiden used executive action last year to create the American Climate Corps modeled on Roosevelt's New Deal. He is announcing Monday that nearly 2,000 corps positions are being offered across 36 states, including jobs offered in partnership with the North American Building Trades Unions.\nBiden has often used Earth Day as a backdrop to further his administration's climate initiatives. Last year, he signed an executive order creating the White House Office of Environmental Justice, meant to help ensure that poverty, race and ethnic status do not lead to worse exposure to pollution and environmental harm.\nAdvertisement\nHe has tried to draw a contrast with GOP congressional leaders, who have called for less regulation of oil production to lower energy prices. Biden officials counter that GOP policies benefit highly profitable oil companies and could ultimately undermine U.S. efforts to compete with the Chinese in the renewable energy sector.\nBiden will use his Virginia visit to discuss how 'a climate crisis fully manifest to the American people in communities all across the country, is also an opportunity for us to come together,' said White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi.\nHe said the programs can 'unlock economic opportunity to create pathways to middle-class-supporting careers, to save people money and improve their quality of life.'\nThe awards came from the Solar for All program, part of the $27 billion 'green bank' created as part of a sweeping climate law passed in 2022. The bank is intended to reduce climate and air pollution and send money to neighborhoods most in need, especially disadvantaged and low-income communities disproportionately impacted by climate change.\nAdvertisement\nEPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe said she was 'looking forward to these funds getting out into the community, giving people skills, putting them to work in their local communities, and allowing people to save on their energy bills so that they can put those dollars to other needs.'\nAmong those receiving grants are state projects to provide solar-equipped roofs for homes, college residences and residential-serving community solar projects in West Virginia, a non-profit operating Mississippi solar lease program and solar workforce training initiatives in South Carolina.\nThe taxpayer-funded green bank has faced Republican opposition and concerns over accountability for how the money gets used. EPA previously disbursed the other $20 billion of the bank's funds to nonprofits and community development banks for clean energy projects such as residential heat pumps, additional energy-efficient home improvements and larger-scale projects like electric vehicle charging stations and community cooling centers.\nAdvertisement\n___\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nSt. John reported from Detroit.\n___\nAlexa St. John is an Associated Press climate solutions reporter.

            "summary": "Nine practices from Native American culture that could help the environment\nSince the first Earth Day in 1970, the world has experienced profound ecological changes. Wildlife populations have decreased by 69 percent, the result of habitat loss caused by rapid industrialization and changing temperatures. 2023 was the hottest year on record.\nCertain ancient practices could mitigate the deleterious effects of global warming. From building seaside gardens to water management in desert terrain, these time-honored practices work with the natural world's rhythms. Some might even hold the key to a more resilient future and a means of building security for both Indigenous communities and other groups disproportionately impacted by climate change.\nZuni waffle gardens\nJim Enote, 66, has been planting a traditional Zuni waffle garden (or hek'ko:we in the Zuni language) since before he could walk.\n'My grandma said I started planting when I was an infant tied to a cradleboard,' said Enote, who grew up on the water-scarce Zuni Pueblo on the southeastern edge of the Colorado plateau. 'She put seeds in my baby hands, and I dropped seeds into a hole.'\nAdvertisement\nEnote has continued this ancient garden design, creating rows of sunken squares surrounded by adobe walls that catch and hold water like pools of syrup in a massive earthen waffle. The sustainable design protects crops from wind, reduces erosion and conserves water.\n'Water is scarce here and becoming more so every year,' said Enote, referring to the increasing drought and heat caused by climate change. 'So, I continue planting waffle gardens.'\n‘Good fire'\nBefore European settlers traveled to the American West, Indigenous people managed the landscape of northern California with 'cultural burns' to improve soil quality, spur the growth of particular plants, and create a 'healthy and resilient landscape,' according to the National Park Service.\n'The Karuk have developed a relationship with fire over the millennia to maintain and steward a balanced ecosystem,' said Bill Tripp, director of natural resources and environmental policy for the Karuk Tribe. 'A good portion of the resources that we depend on, in the natural environment, are dependent on fire.'\nBut in the mid-19th century, Indigenous burning was outlawed. Not only did that cause the Karuk to lose a vital part of their culture, but also, it invited potentially worse wildfires. The burns had reduced the amount of fuel accidental fires feed on.\nplay\nPlay now\nNaN min\nFollow on\nPodcast episode\nSpotify\nApple\nGoogle\nAmazon\n'They [forestry agencies] suppressed fire for so long we're experiencing these massive burns,' said Tripp. A 2023 study published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that 10 of the largest wildfires in California's history occurred in the last 20 years.\n'And, of course, they're [fires] being exacerbated by climate change,' he said.\nPrescribed burning has returned as state and federal agencies recognize the importance of fire in managing forests. In 2022, California passed legislation affirming the right to cultural fire and is considering another bill (backed by the Karuk Tribe) to reduce the barriers to cultural burns on tribal lands.\nAccording to the Karuk Tribe, 'Passage of this bill would be an act of cultural and environmental justice.'\nAncient irrigation\nIn New Mexico, there are 700 functioning acequias, centuries-old community irrigation systems that have helped the parched state build water resilience.\nThese acequias — a design from North African, Spanish and Indigenous traditions — were established during the 1600s. The name can refer to both the gravity-fed ditches filled with water and the farmers who collectively manage water. Unlike large-scale irrigation systems, water seepage from unlined acequias helps replenish the water table and reduce aridification by adding water to the landscape. The earthen ditches mimic seasonal streams and expand riparian habitats for numerous native species.\n'For one, it's a very good and sustainable system to take water from one source and put it into the community,' said Jorge Garcia, executive director of the Center for Social Sustainable Systems and secretary of the South Valley Regional Association of Acequias. 'Without acequias, none of those ecosystems would exist in the way we know them today.'\n'We need to maintain those knowledge systems, especially if we continue through dry years,' said Garcia. 'We're going to need all of that to survive.'\nThe original carbon capture technology\nU.S. forests are carbon sinks, sequestering up to 10 percent of nationwide CO2 emissions. Indigenous forestry can play a critical role in reducing global warming by restoring biodiversity and health to these ecosystems, including the management of culturally significant plants, animals and fungi that contribute to healthier soil.\n'We know that most of the carbon in the forest is stored in the soil, and healthy soil depends on diversity,' said Stephanie Gutierrez, a member of the San Carlos Apache Tribe and the forests and community program director for Ecotrust. 'So, when forests are managed for a diversity of species or purpose and management outcomes, this will lead to better climate outcomes as well.'\nAdvertisement\nYet tribal forestry remains severely underfunded and underutilized on public lands. Indigenous Hawaiians are reintroducing ancient food forests once destroyed by overgrazing, logging and commercial agriculture. These biodiverse edible forests increase food security and build nutrient-dense soils that sequester carbon .\n.\n'Just think about that potential if we implemented tribal forestry practices on [not just] tribally owned lands. Adjacent landowners, community forests, national and state forests and parks should also work with tribes to incorporate their techniques,' Gutierrez said.\nDryland farming\nThe Hopi nation in Arizona receives an average of 10 inches of rain per year — a third of what crop scientists say is necessary to grow corn successfully. Yet Hopi farmers have been cultivating corn and other traditional crops without irrigation for millennia, relying on traditional ecological knowledge rooted in life in the high desert.\n'I like to call traditional ecological knowledge the things my grandfather taught me,' said Michael Kotutwa Johnson, a Hopi dryland farmer and academic. Hopi farming practices include passive rainwater harvesting, myriad techniques to retain soil moisture, and a reliance on traditional seed varieties superbly adapted to the desert.\n'The fact we are able to raise crops such as maize with only 6 to 10 inches of precipitation as opposed to the standard 33 inches of precipitation is outstanding,' Johnson said.\nAs climate change drives increased drought and heat in the region, Johnson looks to the knowledge and practices that have survived thousands of years of climate extremes. 'Our agriculture is integrated into our cultural belief system that has sustained us for millennia,' he said.\nRestoring salmon runs\nIn recent decades, an Indigenous-led plan has begun to restore salmon runs on the Klamath River.\nThe salmon began to disappear in 1918 when the first of five dams blocked the path of the Chinook salmon as they made their way upstream to spawn.\n'The river was cut in half,' said the Yurok Fisheries Department Director Barry McCovey Jr. of the devastating impact the dam had on the salmon runs that Indigenous people depended on. Chinook salmon populations on the Klamath River have since declined by an estimated 90 percent due to habitat loss, poor water quality and climate change.\n'We're seeing the system slowly heat up,' said McCovey, explaining that elevated water temperatures can lead to increased disease and toxic algae blooms. 'You layer climate change on top [of habitat loss], and it's not good news for salmon or anything that relies on a healthy river.'\nAfter removing the dams and implementing a massive river restoration, the salmon are returning. 'The river, in its natural state, had that climate change resiliency built into it,' McCovey said.\nResilient seeds\nSeventy-five percent of global crop diversity has been lost in the past century, further threatening food security as agriculture becomes increasingly vulnerable to climate change.\n'Our oral histories and the historical record show extreme droughts,' said Aaron Lowden, a seed keeper and traditional farmer from the Acoma Pueblo, a village west of Albuquerque. 'This isn't the first time they've [seeds] been stressed out.'\nAs former program director for Ancestral Lands and now Indigenous Seedkeepers Network program poordinator at the Native American Food Sovereignty Alliance, Lowden has successfully returned dozens of varieties of traditional arid-adapted seeds such as Acoma blue corn, Acoma pumpkin, Acoma melon and other crops to his pueblo.\nFor Lowden, building this biodiversity is both a response to climate change and a step in restoring the health and sovereignty of the Acoma people.\n'Our people were systemically removed from these lifestyle ways and practices,' said Lowden, who has seen disproportionately higher rates of hunger, diet-related disease and food insecurity in tribal communities. 'For me, it's been trying to dismantle all of that.'\nAdvertisement\nSwinomish clam gardens\nWhen Swinomish fisherman Joe Williams walked onto the shore of Skagit Bay in Washington to help build the first modern clam garden in the United States, he was overwhelmed with a sense of the past and present colliding. 'It was magic, really,' said Williams, who also serves as the community liaison for the Swinomish tribe. 'I could feel the presence of my ancestors.'\nFor thousands of years, the Swinomish built and maintained clam gardens on the coasts of the Pacific Northwest. They constructed rock terraces in low-tide lines to increase shellfish production. The gardens also help the clams weather the impacts of a changing climate by moderating water temperature and expanding habitat threatened by rising seas and ocean acidification.\n'That was how [ancestors] provided food for their communities, tending these gardens, living through climate change from then to now,' Williams said.\n'We are rediscovering this way of life that sustained our people through past natural climate change events,' he said. 'We can utilize the playbook that our ancestors left us in terms of adapting to a fast-changing environment.'\nClimate-smart Indigenous design\nIn the field of architecture, Indigenous knowledge and technologies have long been overlooked. Julia Watson's book 'Lo—TEK: Design by Radical Indigenism,' published in 2019, examines Indigenous land management practices that represent a catalogue of sustainable, adaptable and resilient design, from living bridges able to withstand monsoons in northern India to man-made underground streams, called qanats, in what is now Iran.\n'Gatekeeping how we technologically innovate for climate resilience by the West can really limit us,' Watson said. 'We're looking for solutions that can adapt to climate extremes and huge fluctuations. These Indigenous technologies evolved from those conditions, molded by huge fluctuations, extreme fire events, water and food scarcity, and flood events.'\nSome of the techniques and solutions work with nature instead of attempting to conquer it.",

On Wednesday, Baluchistan was bracing for more rains amid ongoing rescue and relief operations.\nAdvertisement\nHeavy rains also came down on the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.\nPakistan is seeing heavier rain in April due to climate change, said Zaheer Ahmed Babar, a senior official at the Pakistan Meteorological Department.\n'So far there has been 256% above normal rainfall in Baluchistan,' Babar told The Associated Press. 'Overall, there has been 61% above normal rainfall this month across Pakistan, and it shows climate change has already happened in our country.'\nIn 2022, downpours swelled rivers and at one point flooded a third of Pakistan, killing 1,739 people. The floods also caused $30 billion in damages, from which Pakistan is still trying to rebuild.",

            "summary": "BAMAKO, Mali — Street vendors in Mali's capital of Bamako peddle water sachets, ubiquitous for this part of West Africa during the hottest months. This year, an unprecedented heat wave has led to a surge in deaths, experts say, warning of more scorching weather ahead as effects of climate change roil the continent.\nThe heat wave began in late March, as many in this Muslim majority country observed the holy Islamic month of Ramadan with dawn-to-dusk fasting.\nOn Thursday, temperatures in Bamako reached 44 degrees Celsius (111 Fahrenheit) and weather forecasts say it's not letting up anytime soon.\nThe city's Gabriel-Touré Hospital reported 102 deaths in the first four days of the month, compared to 130 deaths in all of April last year. It's unknown how many of the fatalities were due to the extreme weather as such data cannot be made public under the regulations imposed by the country's military rulers.\nAdvertisement\nCheikh A Traoré, Mali's general director for health, said significantly more elderly people have died during this period although there were no statistics available due to the measures.\nMali has experienced two coups since 2020, leading a wave of political instability that has swept across West and Central Africa in recent years. Along with its political troubles, the country is also in the grip of a worsening insurgency by militants linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.\nThe Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre says that a lack of data in Mali and other West Africa countries affected by this month's heat wave makes it impossible to know how many heat-related deaths there were but estimated that the death toll was likely in the hundreds if not thousands.\nThe heat is also endangering already vulnerable children in Mali — 1 million under the age of 5 were at risk of acute malnutrition at the end of 2023 due to protracted violence, internal displacement, and restricted access to humanitarian aid, according to the World Food Program.\nAdvertisement\nProfessor Boubacar Togo, head of pediatrics at Gabriel-Touré, told The Associated Press that the hospital has had six cases of meningitis in children in the last week, an unusually high number. He also added that there were many illnesses with diarrhea as a leading symptom. Togo did not elaborate or offer specific data.\nTo protect children from the worst of the heat, Mali's military rulers have shortened the school day, to end before 1 p.m. instead of at 5.30 p.m. during the heat wave. But on the streets of Bamako, workers say they have no choice but to go out and brave the extreme heat.\n'Either I work and risk my health or I stop working for the most of the day and I earn nothing,' said 25-year-old driver Amadou Coulibaly, who offers rides on his motorbike for a small fee.\nWith the political instability, many foreign investors are leaving Mali. Rolling power cuts and fuel shortages have forced companies to shut doors, exacerbating an already dire economic situation.\nAdvertisement\nDespite the heat, 30-year-old welder Somaila Traoré worked in his shop alongside a dozen employees, urging them to work faster.\n'We've got to finish the job before the power cuts,' he said.\nAn analysis published Thursday by the World Weather Attribution — an international team of scientists looking at how human-induced climate change impacts extreme weather — said the latest heat wave in the Sahel, a region in Africa south of the Sahara that suffers from periodic droughts, is more than just a Malian record-breaker.\n'Our study found that the extreme temperatures across the region simply wouldn't have been possible without human-caused warming,' said Clair Barnes, the lead author and a researcher at Imperial College London.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe researchers say climate change has made maximum temperatures in Burkina Faso and Mali hotter by 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) — something that may not have happened 'if humans had not warmed the planet by burning fossil fuels.'\nAdvertisement\nWith sustained warming temperatures, the trend would continue, with similar events likely once every 20 years, the study said.\n'This result is a warning for both the region and the world,' Barnes said. 'Extreme heat can be incredibly dangerous and will become more of a threat as the world continues to warm.'\n___\nMureithi reported from Nairobi.",

That includes uses by residents for both washing and drinking.\nTourism represents nearly 12% of Spain's economy. But there has been growing pressure by water conservationist groups to limit the use of water by tourists during the drought.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to Barcelona's hotel guild, the average tourist to Barcelona in 2022 used some 163 liters per day, while the figure rose to over 240 liters for luxury hotels.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe limits for tourists would not include the water used to fill swimming pools.\nAlso Tuesday, the Catalan government loosened restrictions that prohibited the filling of swimming pools with fresh water. Under the new measure, a privately-owned swimming pool can be refilled in a severe drought if authorities declare it a 'climate refuge' open to residents seeking relief from the heat.\nThe regional government also made modifications to its drought restrictions to allow for the private use of desalination installations, a move hotel owners have demanded.\nCatalonia has borne the brunt of a drought driven by climate change that has also impacted parts of southern Spain, though a wet spring this year has helped the situation. The reservoirs for Barcelona and surrounding areas that were at 15% of their capacity are now 18% full.\nEven so, Catalonia has kept in place its restrictions under a water emergency declared in February to combat a drought regional authorities call historic. Those limitations include reducing average water use by 80% for crop irrigation, 50% for herd animals and 25% for industry.\n___",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — A ancient giant snake in India might have been longer than a school bus and weighed a ton, researchers reported Thursday.\nFossils found near a coal mine revealed a snake that stretched an estimated 36 feet (11 meters) to 50 feet (15 meters). It's comparable to the largest known snake at about 42 feet (13 meters) that once lived in what is now Colombia.\nThe largest living snake today is Asia's reticulated python at 33 feet (10 meters).\nThe newly discovered behemoth lived 47 million years ago in western India's swampy evergreen forests. It could have weighed up to 2,200 pounds (1,000 kilograms), researchers said in the journal Scientific Reports.\nThey gave it the name Vasuki indicus after 'the mythical snake king Vasuki, who wraps around the neck of the Hindu deity Shiva,' said Debajit Datta, a study co-author at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee.\nAdvertisement\nThis monster snake wasn't especially swift to strike.\n'Considering its large size, Vasuki was a slow-moving ambush predator that would subdue its prey through constriction,' Datta said in an email.\nFragments of the snake's backbone were discovered in 2005 by co-author Sunil Bajpai, based at the same institute, near Kutch, Gujarat, in western India. The researchers compared more than 20 fossil vertebrae to skeletons of living snakes to estimate size.\nWhile it's not clear exactly what Vasuki ate, other fossils found nearby reveal that the snake lived in swampy areas alongside catfish, turtles, crocodiles and primitive whales, which may have been its prey, Datta said.\nThe other extinct giant snake, Titanoboa, was discovered in Colombia and is estimated to have lived around 60 million years ago.\nWhat these two monster snakes have in common is that they lived during periods of exceptionally warm global climates, said Jason Head, a Cambridge University paleontologist who was not involved in the study.\nAdvertisement\n'These snakes are giant cold-blooded animals,' he said. 'A snake requires higher temperatures' to grow into large sizes.\nSo does that mean that global warming will bring back monster-sized snakes?\nIn theory, it's possible. But the climate is now warming too quickly for snakes to evolve again to be giants, he said.\n___",

            "excerpt": "Whether and how much the approach helps the environment is hotly debated. Critics say it creates the impression of benefit at the expensive of more effective efforts.",
            "summary": "IÑAPARI, Peru — At the entrance to its sprawling tract of virgin Amazon rainforest, the Peruvian timber company Maderacre turns ancient hardwood trees into flooring on an industrial scale.\nBeside the vast, modern facility, a reddish dirt road leads into the jungle where workers harvest wood that takes centuries to mature.\nwood that takes centuries to mature.\nAs it systematically removes the oldest trees from this stunning wilderness, Maderacre might seem an improbable seller of carbon credits, the financial instrument that in theory allows consumers and corporations to 'offset' their greenhouse gas emissions from air travel, ride-hailing apps, fashion purchases and other pollution-producing activities.\nAdvertisement\nThe company isn't earning credits by planting trees to absorb carbon dioxide. The offsets it sells are based on a hypothetical: An estimate of how many existing trees it prevents from being cut down.\nThere's a logic to this. Maderacre argues that unlike its neighbors — illegal loggers and homesteaders — it's carrying out selective, sustainable logging on its 1,000-square-mile timber concession that maintains the forest's ecological balance.\nBut the approach, known as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, or REDD+, raises questions about how to protect the world's forests, which sequester billions of tons of carbon, and about the booming carbon credit market. As the window to avoid catastrophic climate change closes, scientists are questioning the intricate methodologies used to calculate this lucrative counterfactual, known as 'avoided deforestation.'\nSome warn that it might actually be accelerating the climate crisis, as consumers, instead of curbing their emissions, buy credits that do not deliver on their green promises.\nThe stark contrast between Maderacre's lush concession and the barren land around it makes the benefits of offsets seem obvious. Pressing up against the forest's perimeter is a patchwork of dusty fields cleared by unregulated deforesters in a chaotic rush to settle this remote region.\nHousehold brands such as Shell, Southwest Airlines, Disney and Gucci all have used credits generated this way.\nSouthwest stressed that it offered credits to passengers on an optional basis but was not using them as part of its net zero strategy. Shell declined to comment. Disney and Gucci did not respond to requests to comment.\nAccording to S&P Global Commodity Insights, REDD+ represents nearly a third of the voluntary carbon market, worth $2 billion in 2021 but predicted to hit as much as $40 billion a year by 2030.\nBut Britaldo Soares, the professor at Brazil's Minas Gerais Federal University who created the software used by Maderacre, calls REDD+ a 'climate scam.'\n'This is a logging concession,' he said. He developed his Dinamica EGO program to measure the impact of government policies, he said, not to calculate credits. That's the equivalent, he said, of 'predicting the future with a crystal ball.'\nBarbara Haya, who heads the Carbon Trading Project at the University of California at Berkeley, said REDD+ projects around the world are generating 'phantom' credits.\nThe reason, she said, is simple: 'Everyone at the table benefits from more credits. There's over-crediting every which way you turn. It's systematic.'\nBy 'everyone,' she means project developers, the certification companies who set the rules, and the third-party auditors who determine whether a project is preventing forest loss.\nThe latter two, she stressed, have an incentive to approve projects, because rejecting them could deter others from contracting their services.\nWith some projects generating millions of credits, each representing a metric ton of carbon and trading for about $1.40 — sometimes significantly more — the temptation to exaggerate avoided emissions is powerful.\nVerra, the nonprofit that holds a 70 percent share of the global carbon project verification market, has to date issued 1.23 billion credits. But it isn't paid only for certification. The group also gets 20 cents per credit sold. Haya calls that a conflict of interest.\nDoubts exist around the baselines, the predictions of deforestation that would occur without a carbon concession. These are calculated in various ways, including projections from historical forest loss and comparisons with other parts of the forest.\n'Maybe they're deliberately exaggerated,' said Erin Sills, an environmental economist at North Carolina State University. 'But it's also perhaps because project developers are trying to predict the future. That's never possible.'\nThen there's 'additionality,' the concept that for emissions to have been avoided, the revenue generated by carbon credits must make the difference between the forest being saved or destroyed.\nAdditionality is difficult to calculate because most carbon projects are layered onto preexisting uses of the land: sustainable logging such as Maderacre's, ecotourism, Brazil-nut gathering — even protected areas with bans on extractive activities. Many should already have safeguards, such as security guards or perimeter fencing.\nAdvertisement\nSills is one of eight researchers who examined dozens of forest carbon concessions in Africa, Asia and Latin America. In a paper published last year in Science they found most reduced far less deforestation than was claimed.\nOf the 89 million carbon credits that the projects generated, they concluded, only 5.4 million represented genuine reductions in emissions.\nMaderacre had generated nearly 9.7 million credits by late 2021 for buyers including Canada's Scotiabank and the gas-guzzling Dakar Rally. The researchers said they found no evidence that the effort had achieved the deforestation claimed. (Scotiabank declined to comment; the Dakar Rally did not respond to a request for comment.)\nThat analysis is backed by Soares. 'Since it's already a [timber] concession and they have the obligation of conserving it,' he said, 'there's no additionality at all.'\nNelson Kroll, a manager at Maderacre, disagrees. 'Timber is timber, not oil or gold,' he said. 'A business based just on logging can't pay for everything you need to conserve the forest.'\nVerra acknowledges that calculating avoided emissions is complex and imperfect but disputes the researchers' conclusions. The organization stresses that the 'voluntary' carbon market was created by the private sector, pushed by consumer demand, to plug a gap left by governments' failure to set compulsory offset standards in the U.N. climate negotiations.\n'The best hasn't happened, but the good's done a lot of good,' Verra spokesman Joel Finkelstein said. The group constantly updates its methodologies, sometimes in response to harsh criticism from academics and environmentalists.\n'The science 15 years ago was very different to the science now,' Finkelstein said. 'At every point, we've been aiming for the best standard.'\nOn Maderacre's concession, squawking red and blue macaws swoop overhead as capuchin monkeys frolic in the canopy. The jaguar population is so dense that the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance runs a research project on the alpha predator.\nBut on the neighboring plots, Cebu cattle dot brown fields of low-quality pasture. Small, in many cases failed and abandoned, plantations of teak — not native to the Amazon — break up the terrain. Columns of smoke tower on the horizon.\nThe ecocide has been driven by the Interoceanic Highway. The 1,600-mile road, completed in 2011, was intended to connect Brazilian commodities to Peru's Pacific ports to feed China's insatiable economy.\nLittle freight now passes along the highway. Former Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo, who launched the highway with Brazilian President Luis Inácio Lula da Silva, is now in pretrial detention, accused of taking a $25-million bribe in return for contracts to build it.\nYet the road has, literally, paved the way to destruction for this corner of the Amazon. Maderacre has at least kept the deforestation from overwhelming its concession.\n'The deforestation's real, and someone has to do the work,' said Kroll, a forestry engineer who previously worked as an Amazon park guard.\nHe stresses that Maderacre harvests one tree per hectare every 30 years, and takes only shihuahaco trunks with diameters more than 75 centimeters, a stricter standard than the legal minimum of 51 centimeters.\nAdvertisement\n'This isn't a timber concession. It's a nature concession,' Kroll said. 'Until we find ways for living forests to be economically competitive, they're going to continue being decimated.'\nSills believes sweeping change is needed.\n'We rely on these offsets to reduce our own footprints, but the result is net higher emissions,' she said. 'The climate's the real loser.'",

People had walked for miles to be there. Soon the governor pulled up in his SUV. Women danced, and an emcee raised his hands to the sky. When the crowd gathered around an enclosure holding the camels, one man said he was looking at 'the future.'\nThe camels had arrived to replace the cows.\nCows, here and across much of Africa, have been the most important animal for eons — the foundation of economies, diets, traditions.\nBut now grazable land is shrinking. Water sources are drying up. A three-year drought in the Horn of Africa that ended last year killed 80 percent of the cows in this part of Kenya and shattered the livelihoods of so many people.\nIn this region with the thinnest of margins, millions are being forced to adapt to climate change — including those who were now drawing numbers from a hat, each corresponding to one of the 77 camels that had just arrived in Samburu County.\n'Your number?' a village chief, James Lelemusi, asked the first person to draw.\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nThe regional government had purchased the camels from traders near the border with Somalia, at $600 per head.

They were also those judged by local officials to be the most in need. They had stories of near-total cattle losses, of walking miles to find water, of violent run-ins with a neighboring tribe as they strayed farther from their territory in search of grazing space for their faltering livestock.\nStill, many said the plight of one person stood out: Dishon Leleina.\nLeleina, 42, had been wealthy by the standards of this region before the drought. He had two wives and 10 kids, and had been surrounded by an abundance of cows for nearly as long as he could remember. He even sacrificed bulls — with a stab to the back of the head — on each of his wedding days.\nBut when one rainy season failed, then another, then another, his stock of 150 cows plummeted over several years as never before. A few dozen were raided by the bordering Pokot tribe. And more than a hundred withered away — going skinny in the midsection, swelling in other areas. Some would go to sleep at night and never wake up. Some would arrive at last at a water source, drink lustily and collapse to their death. Several times, including after losing his best milking cow, Leleina roared at the sky in fury. By the time the rains resumed last year, he had seven cows left.\n'I had one status' before the drought, he said. 'And now I have another.'\nWhat hadn't changed was his daily routine; he moved in step with his livestock, often walking miles per day. But now he had cut back to one meal per day — as did many other pastoralists. He lost weight. Several times, he fainted. Even on the day of the camel distribution, as the event stretched into late afternoon, almost nobody was seen eating or drinking.\nAs the number drawing began, Leleina pressed into the crowd. An organizer with a sheet of paper recorded who would take which camel home. Some of the camels were big, some small, some muscular, many slender, and as soon as people pulled numbers — 73, 6, 27 — they darted off to find their animal in the crowd.\nThen it was Leleina's turn. He reached into the hat.\n'Number 17,' he said.\nCamel recipients, including Leleina (center, in green), crowd around a checklist keeping track of the animals and their new owners.\nHe walked toward the camels, scrap of paper in hand, and tried to use his wooden staff to poke a few of the animals, which were bunched together, obscuring the numbers painted at the base of their necks. Leleina squinted into the sun. He went in another direction. He prodded a few more animals. And then he found her: a skinny camel with a medium build, a rich tuft of longer fur on its hump.\nHe gave her a pat.\nIt would be dark soon, and Leleina still needed to guide his new camel home — several miles through the powdery dirt and shrub land. But even in this harsh place, Camel 17 could manage to find a snack.\nShe darted over to an acacia tree, pulling flowers into her mouth, working her tongue around two-inch thorns.\nAn animal built for drought The camel is sometimes described as an animal designed by committee, what with its hodgepodge of features —\nanimal designed by committee, what with its hodgepodge of features — Camel features\nthe thin legs of a whippet,\nthe rippled midsection\nof a horse,\nthe neck of a stunted giraffe.\nthe thin legs of a whippet,\nthe rippled midsection\nof a horse,\nthe neck of a stunted giraffe.\nthe thin legs of a whippet,\nthe rippled midsection of a horse,\nthe neck of a stunted giraffe.\nBut among mammals, the camel is almost singularly equipped to handle extremes.\nCamels can go two weeks without water, as opposed to a day or two for a cow. They can lose 30 percent of their body weight and survive, one of the highest thresholds for any large animal. Their body temperatures fluctuate in sync with daily climate patterns. When they pee, their urine trickles down their legs, keeping them cool. When they lie down, their leathery knees fold into pedestals that work to prop much of their undersides just above the ground, allowing cooling air to pass through.\nOne recently published paper, perhaps straying from science to reverence, called them a 'miracle species.'\n'They're unparalleled in terms of domestic animals.'\n— Piers Simpkin, the Nairobi-based global livestock adviser for Mercy Corps\nAnd yet in much of Africa — for much of human history — their attributes haven't been needed. For centuries, they've resided primarily in the driest outer ring of the continent, while cows — outnumbering camels in Africa 10 to 1 — reigned in the lush river plains, in the highlands. Kenya, where the landscape can turn from green to reddish and back in an hour's drive, has long been a middle ground: a place where some tribes use camels and more use cows, with identities forming around that choice. Because of that, neighboring tribes see the consequences of using one animal vs. the other. That has seemingly transformed Samburu County — an area the size of New Jersey that is home to the Samburu tribe — into an experiment on how livestock fare, and how humans respond, in a warming climate.\nThe experiment started about a half-century ago, according to Louise Sperling, a scholar who conducted fieldwork in Samburu in the 1980s. The Samburu were among the most 'specialized and successful' cattle-keepers in East Africa, she wrote in one account, but they were increasingly mixing with and marrying members of a nearby tribe, the Rendille — camel-keepers.\nOver the subsequent decades, they also noticed changes in traditional weather patterns. Fewer rainy seasons. Less predictability. And most importantly: more frequent droughts.\nUptake was gradual. Cows still overwhelmingly outnumbered camels. And cows still defined the Samburu identity, used in celebrations or as dowries.\nBut then came the longest series of failed rainy seasons on record in the Horn of Africa.\nThe drought started in 2020 and held its grip for three years. An international team of scientists said a drought of this severity had been 100 times more likely because of climate change. In Samburu, the smell of rotting cattle carcasses spread across this county of roughly 310,000 people. Malnutrition spiked, including among children and the elderly. The Kenyan government and the World Food Program had to step in with aid.\nAnd yet the level of need wasn't equal.\nNoompon Lenkamaldanyani, a single mother of four, lost 18 of her 20 cows and fell short on milk, but she noticed her camel-owning neighbors were willing to step in and offer help.\nLekojde Loidongo said he and his family 'didn't suffer much,' as all 22 of their camels continued to produce milk.\nEven Leleina, the new owner of Camel 17, said he noticed how the animals fared differently. He'd owned three camels before the drought hit. They all survived.\nIf he had any regrets, it was that he hadn't moved earlier. His father, who died in 2021, had been an early adopter of camels.\n'In the future,' Leleina said, echoing a conclusion shared by others, 'I foresee having more camels than cows.'\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nAdvertisement\nBecause of these realizations, there has been very little backlash to the government's camel program, which started eight years ago. Some are also obtaining their own camels by trading cattle at markets. Pastoralists — people who move with their livestock herds — are often described as among the most vulnerable people in the world to climate change, and their fortunes can swing based on the decisions they make about which animals to keep.\nA 2022 research paper published in Nature Food, analyzing a huge belt of land across northern sub-Saharan Africa, noted increased heat stress and reduced water availability in some areas and said milk production would benefit from a higher proportion of camels, as well as goats, which are also more climate-resilient than cows. Camel milk is a comparable substitute for cow's milk. It tends to be lower in fat and higher in certain minerals, said Anne Mottet, the lead livestock specialist at the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Many say it has a saltier taste.\nCamel vs cattle\nCow vs. camel milk production impacts\nFeed needed (kg)*\nWater needed (kg)*\nCO2 emissions (kg)*\n*for producing one metric ton of milk\nCows\nCamels\nCow vs. camel milk production impacts\nFeed needed (kg)*\nWater needed (kg)*\nCO2 emissions (kg)*\nCows\n*for producing one metric ton of milk\nCamels\nCow vs. camel milk production impacts\nFeed needed (kg)*\nWater needed (kg)*\nCO2 emissions (kg)*\nCows\nCamels\n*to produce one metric ton of milk\n'We're just following the trends of the drought,' said Lepason Lenanguram, another camel recipient in Samburu. 'People want camels now. The culture is changing.'\nThe Samburu governor said he believes 'totally' that shifting to the camel is the right move. He noted that Samburu — with large swaths far removed from the electrical grid and without running water — had contributed relatively little to global greenhouse gas emissions. By far the greatest source of emissions in rural areas like Samburu is methane, a byproduct of the cow's complex digestive process. Camels emit far less methane.\nThe program gives away only one camel per person. But it can still build up peace of mind, said the director of the governor's press service, Jeff Lekupe, who was on-site when the camels were distributed. With even one camel, a family has better chances of having milk during a drought. And then there is a 'ripple effect,' he said. The camel gives birth. The population grows.\n'So that next time,' he said, 'the need for the WFP will be minimal.'\nGetting acclimated to Camel 17 For Leleina, Camel 17 — a female — symbolized the start of a rebuild, but it didn't begin well. Arriving at her new home — a circular property, ringed by branches and thorns, a mile from the closest unpaved road — the animal quickly started tussling with one of the three other camels. They bit one another. They made noises. They locked necks, and they only stopped when Leleina roped the legs of the other camel as a way to keep her from moving.\na female — symbolized the start of a rebuild, but it didn't begin well.

They bit one another. They made noises. They locked necks, and they only stopped when Leleina roped the legs of the other camel as a way to keep her from moving. That night, Leleina put a mat on the floor outside his hut and felt too nervous to go to sleep. He'd heard stories about other camels darting off — something that almost never happened with a cow — or feeling uneasy in new surroundings; a neighbor's camel had escaped and been mauled by a lion. So Leleina trained his eyes on Camel 17 for hour after hour as she brayed.\nEventually the sun rose. Camel 17 was still there.\n'The camel might have been thinking about where it came from,' Leleina said.\nIn the morning, more at ease, he let the newest addition to his herd go off. She needed to eat. The job of following her fell to Leleina's 9-year-old daughter, and after the camel had been out for a while, Leleina decided to join her. So he set off in the direction of a red-rock table mountain, crunching through the scrub, occasionally coming upon bones, and moving closer to an area that he knew had foliage for camels and was free of predators. He heard nothing for five minutes, then 10, and then shouted his daughter's name.\n'Nashenjo,' he shouted.\nThen a minute later:\n'Nashenjo!'\nHe heard an animal noise.\n'The camels are not far from here,' he said.\nIn a circle of trees, he saw not only Camel 17, but a half-dozen other camels — craning their necks from branch to branch. A few of the camels were his. Others belonged to a neighbor. It was a critical mass of camels in a place that had once belonged almost entirely to cattle, and the ranks only figured to grow. A day earlier, at the same time of the distribution, a neighbor's camel had gone into labor. Leleina's neighbors had crouched at the camel's side, pulling out the healthy baby by the legs.\nLeleina sat down at the base of a tree and watched the animals eat. Camel 17 was still skinny, but that was understandable, he said. She needed time to recover. Her trip to get here had been 100-odd miles, seven days, three stops for water, and even in that journey he saw why she was suited for her new home.\n'She's a survivor,' he said.",

Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox every weekday.\nA year ago, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan announced the advent of a new 'Washington consensus.' The speech he delivered at a think tank then was something of a bombshell in the foreign policy community — a declaration by a senior U.S. official that the world's leading superpower wanted to move on from decades of economic orthodoxy and unfettered globalization to a different arrangement between nations and their societies.\nA year ago, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan announced the advent of a new 'Washington consensus.' The speech he delivered at a think tank then was something of a bombshell in the foreign policy community — a declaration by a senior U.S. official that the world's leading superpower wanted to move on from decades of economic orthodoxy and unfettered globalization to a different arrangement between nations and their societies.\nThe old 'Washington consensus' was shorthand for a set of neoliberal policies and prescriptions put forward in the last decades of the 20th century by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, its sister organization. The diktats of these Washington-based institutions — mandating austerity, deregulation and privatization — prefigured a wave of globalization that crested into the 21st century. They undergirded a sense of the world bound together by commerce and trade, and lifted up by a shared prosperity, that became a kind of dogma for political elites in the West and elsewhere.\nAdvertisement\nSuch convictions are no longer commonly held. In the West, political leaders now speak of globalization in pejorative terms — a legacy of economic policy that made some rich while weakening the middle classes of their own societies, where manufacturing jobs dried up, wages stagnated and life grew more precarious. Sullivan pointed to the Biden administration's embrace of industrial policy and major stimulus spending as a major paradigm shift — and a key cog in the United States' plans to compete with China in the decades to come.\nThe world was not 'flat,' Sullivan seemed to argue, but bumpy. And it was up to governments and alliances of like-minded states to smooth out the disturbances and disruptions caused by shocks such as the pandemic, the ambitions of rising great powers like China and wars that snarl global supply chains. Move over, laissez faire capitalism — welcome back, mercantilism and protectionism.\nEven as the contours of the new orthodoxy are still taking shape, some underlying global realities remain the same — perhaps, even more pronounced. As the IMF and World Bank staged their annual meetings this week in Washington, officials and economists put forward somewhat gloomy prognostications. The IMF projected annual global growth at levels still below what took place before the pandemic, and warned of longer-term troubles ahead.\nEven as the contours of the new orthodoxy are still taking shape, some underlying global realities remain the same — perhaps, even more pronounced. As the IMF and World Bank staged their annual meetings this week in Washington, officials and economists put forward somewhat gloomy prognostications. The IMF projected annual global growth at levels still below what took place before the pandemic, and warned of longer-term troubles ahead.\nAdvertisement\n'Rising geopolitical risks, including signs of a global trading system dividing into separate blocs oriented around the United States and China, are also troubling fund officials,' my colleague David Lynch reported. 'If that split widens, nations could suffer ‘large output losses' as goods and capital move around the world less efficiently, the fund warned in its flagship World Economic Outlook.'\nThis sluggishness has major ramifications for the West's graying societies, but it's all the more concerning for poorer nations in the developing world. The ambitious programs of stimulus and subsidies put forward by the United States and the European Union may cut against investment and opportunities elsewhere. 'Poorer and less-developed countries could be deprived of the benefits of globalization as the major economies turn inward and as trade and financial flows fragment and fall in line with deepening geopolitical fissures,' Eswar Prasad, an international trade expert at Cornell University, told Bloomberg News.\nMany countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, are also buckling under crippling public debt burdens and struggling to chart a way out. 'With growth being slow, the chances to catch up are actually worsened,' IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said earlier this year. 'You have countries that are truly facing life or death, economic, social difficulties.'\nAdvertisement\nTo some in the Global South, institutions like the IMF and World Bank remain part of the problem . A new analysis by Oxfam found that 'income inequality is high or increasing' in 60 percent of low- and middle-income countries that receive grants or loans from the IMF and World Bank. That's in part due to enforced cuts in public spending that impact the lives of ordinary citizens in these countries.\nTo some in the Global South, institutions like the IMF and World Bank remain part of the problem.

That's in part due to enforced cuts in public spending that impact the lives of ordinary citizens in these countries.\nGrieve Chelwa, a Zambian economist based in the United Arab Emirates, pointed to his country's recent experience, where IMF mandates have hobbled social spending, contributed to a rise in food prices and exacerbated a cost of living crisis. 'IMF-enforced austerity,' he told me, may 'lead to another lost generation for Zambia and Zambians.'\n'More than ever, the U.S. and other rich nations must wake up the reality that that these institutions, as they function, have not only outlived their usefulness, but fallen into a destructive obsolescence,' said Ndongo Samba Sylla, a Senegalese development economist, speaking at an event hosted by Oxfam in Washington this week.\nAdvertisement\nWhile Americans and citizens of other wealthy nations face their own economic headwinds, people in poorer countries find themselves trapped in situations where their governments sometimes have their hands tied. The strength of the U.S. dollar and the whims of foreign credit ratings agencies have as much impact on their lives as the policies of their own states.\nIn the more competitive era hailed by Sullivan, Western governments appear to be reducing their development assistance to poorer nations , at ruinous cost. Mohamed Nasheed, former president of the Maldives and the head of a bloc of nations known as Climate Vulnerable Forum, which represents some of the nations most threatened by the effects of global warming, said that the 68 economies in this bloc lost more than half a trillion dollars in wealth over the past two decades thanks to climate change, though they contributed only about 4 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn the more competitive era hailed by Sullivan, Western governments appear to be reducing their development assistance to poorer nations, at ruinous cost.

Western officials are also trying to address widening inequalities both within countries and between them. In Washington, the finance ministers of France and Brazil jointly revealed plans to crack down on tax avoidance by the wealthy. These proposals may pick up steam in the coming months as Brazil takes charge of this year's meetings involving the Group of 20 major economies.",

            "summary": "This nation, tobogganing swiftly down a steep slope of fiscal irresponsibility, barely notices a blur of alarming milestones. Last week, we sped past this one: A $1.1 trillion deficit in the first six months of fiscal year 2024 that began Oct. 1 resulted in almost as many dollars spent on debt service ($429 billion) as on defense ($433 billion).\nThis, at the most menacing geopolitical moment since 1945, makes one hope that JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon was radically wrong in saying recently that interest rates could reach 8 percent or more in coming years. If they do, deficits will explode even before the Social Security and Medicare trust funds are exhausted, within 10 years.\nThe Federal Reserve was instrumental in igniting inflation with too-cheap money for too long, and then was serene about inflation's supposedly 'transitory' nature. In 2012, the Fed announced its hubristic plan to achieve its aspiration of exactly 2 percent inflation. Even if evidence indicated the Fed capable of such precision (evidence does not), Joseph C. Sternberg's question in the Wall Street Journal is apposite: 'Who elected these folks to aim for a 50% loss in purchasing power of a dollar every 35 years?'\naspiration of exactly 2 percent inflation. Even if evidence indicated the Fed capable of such precision (evidence does not), Joseph C. Sternberg's question in the Wall Street Journal is apposite: 'Who elected these folks to aim for a 50% loss in purchasing power of a dollar every 35 years?'\nAdvertisement\nIn a recent report, the Manhattan Institute's Dan Katz and Stephen Miran argue that 'the Fed's current governance has facilitated groupthink that has led to significant monetary-policy errors while allowing the Fed the flexibility to unwisely expand its remit into inherently political areas such as credit rationing and banking regulation.' Here is groupthink: 'Despite the biggest monetary errors in four decades,' Katz and Miran write, none of the nine recent appointees to the Board of Governors was on record as having made accurate predictions about inflation's path. Mission creep: The Fed has moved beyond its traditional technocratic role and 'pursued a much more expansive monetary and regulatory agenda that is more consistent with an explicitly political institution.'\nThis has included allocating credit, thereby picking private-sector winners and losers; urging Congress to favor the Democrats' stimulus proposal (10 times the size of the Republicans' proposal) a month before the 2020 presidential election; allowing racial inducement in its operations; and injecting environmental considerations into financial regulations. What the Fed calls 'climate-related financial risks' are fictitious. This column has previously noted that the Hoover Institution's John Cochrane is correct: Measurable climate risk to the financial system's 'resilience' in the time frame that regulation can foresee and control — five years or so — simply does not exist.\nFollow this author George F. Will 's opinions\nFollow this author\nGeorge F. Will\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nIn July 2019, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said: 'We don't have authority … to lend to state and local governments.' Nine months later the Fed did that. Randal K. Quarles, leaving as the Fed's vice chair for supervision in 2020, said, 'Those whose plans are grand and whose patience with democratic accountability low' will ask 'why the Fed can't fund repairs of the country's aging infrastructure, or finance the building of a border wall, or purchase trillions of dollars of green energy bonds.' Perhaps it could. Who would stop it? Congress cannot even budget but is a geyser of opinions about everything. As government's institutions fail at their primary missions (the Fed's is to preserve the currency as a store of value), the institutions pursue grandeur through mission creep. This is perhaps partly for the pleasure of being where political fashion locates excitement (today, 'equity' and climate change).\nAdvertisement\nKatz and Miran recommend shortening the terms of members of the Fed's Board of Governors, and making them removable by the president. The authors would balance this increased democratic control by nationalizing the reserve banks, which are privately owned by local banking consortia. Katz and Miran say, somewhat puzzlingly, that making the reserve banks government institutions subject to political accountability would somehow make them a counterweight to the Board of Governors whose members would be removable by the president.\nIt is counterintuitive to advocate more direct political control of the Fed amid accumulating evidence that politics is the problem. That the biggest threat to American democracy is American democracy. The fiscal incontinence propelling the nation toward an utterly predictable crisis reflects the majority's preference: Let's make unconsenting (because unborn) future taxpayers — debt is taxation, including the tax of inflation, deferred — pay for a significant portion of our consumption of government services.

            "summary": "For decades, the federal government has prioritized oil and gas drilling, hardrock mining and livestock grazing on public lands across the country. That could soon change under a far-reaching Interior Department rule that puts conservation, recreation and renewable energy development on equal footing with resource extraction.\nThe final rule released Thursday represents a seismic shift in the management of roughly 245 million acres of public property — about one-tenth of the nation's land mass. It is expected to draw praise from conservationists and legal challenges from fossil fuel industry groups and Republican officials, some of whom have lambasted the move as a 'land grab.'\nInterior's Bureau of Land Management, known as the nation's largest landlord, has long offered leases to oil and gas companies, mining firms and ranchers. Now, for the first time, the nearly 80-year-old agency will auction off 'restoration leases' and 'mitigation leases' to entities with plans to restore or conserve public lands.\nAdvertisement\n'Today's final rule helps restore balance to our public lands as we continue using the best-available science to restore habitats, guide strategic and responsible development, and sustain our public lands for generations to come,' Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement.\nUnder President Biden, the BLM has put a greater emphasis on protecting public lands from the twin threats of climate change and development. Tracy Stone-Manning, the bureau's director, has warned that hotter, drier climates are driving longer and more intense wildfires and drought across the American West. At the same time, development has fragmented and destroyed wildlife habitat and migratory corridors.\n'We oversee 245 million acres, and every land manager will tell you that climate change is already happening. It's already impacting our public lands,' Stone-Manning said during a Washington Post Live event last year. 'We see it in pretty obvious ways, through unprecedented wildfires.'\nAdvertisement\nThe fossil fuel industry, a frequent foe of the Biden administration, has chaffed at the BLM's approach. It has called the public lands rule an example of regulatory overreach that will stifle domestic energy production, even as the United States pumps more oil than any nation in history.\nKathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, which represents oil and gas companies, said the group plans to challenge the BLM rule in court. She said the policy appears to violate the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the 1976 law that tasked the bureau with overseeing 'multiple uses' of public lands for current and future generations.\n'We have no choice but to litigate,' Sgamma said. 'These conservation leases seem to be designed to preclude energy development on federal lands.'\nThe BLM's proposed rule released last year sparked especially intense outrage in Wyoming, an energy powerhouse that accounts for nearly one-tenth of U.S. fossil fuel production. Some Wyoming Republicans have claimed that the BLM is colluding with liberal environmental groups to put millions of acres off-limits to development — and to push a form of imperialism.\nAdvertisement\n'It does seem to me this is a very top-down, Washington-centric approach that has kind of cut the legs out from the local people,' Gov. Mark Gordon (R) told The Post last year. 'Unfortunately, Wyoming finds itself imposed upon by these colonial forces of national environmental groups who are pushing an agenda onto Wyoming.'\nAaron Weiss, deputy director of the Center for Western Priorities, an advocacy group, said some Republican officials have spread 'disinformation and the conspiracy theories' about the rule. He noted that during a House Natural Resources Committee hearing last year, South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem (R) claimed the draft rule would allow Chinese citizens to purchase leases on U.S. lands.\nUnlike the proposed rule, the final rule clarifies that 'leases cannot be held by foreign persons.' It also offers 'restoration leases' and 'mitigation leases' rather than 'conservation leases' — a linguistic tweak that seems designed to skirt the politicization of the word 'conservation,' Weiss said.\nAdvertisement\nMitigation leases will allow lease holders to offset the impact of their activities. For example, a rancher whose cattle grazing is degrading the land could be required to purchase a mitigation lease during the permitting process. The rancher could then work with a local conservation group to restore nearby habitat for the greater sage grouse, an imperiled bird of the West.\nto offset the impact of their activities. For example, a rancher whose cattle grazing is degrading the land could be required to purchase a mitigation lease during the permitting process. The rancher could then work with a local conservation group to restore nearby habitat for the greater sage grouse, an imperiled bird of the West.\nThe final rule also directs the BLM to prioritize landscape health for the first time and to incorporate Indigenous knowledge into its decision-making. The latter is a top priority of Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary and lead a department that once oversaw the removal of Indigenous people from their land.\nThe Trump administration took a vastly different approach to managing public lands than Biden officials. President Donald Trump briefly moved the BLM's headquarters from Washington to Grand Junction, Colo., a hot spot for natural gas production. More than 87 percent of the affected employees either resigned or retired rather than move to Colorado, depriving the agency of expertise and disrupting its operations.\nTo lead the BLM, Trump tapped William Perry Pendley, a conservative lawyer who had previously advocated for selling off public lands across the country. Pendley, who was never confirmed by the Senate, pushed the bureau to maximize oil, gas and mineral development.\ntapped William Perry Pendley, a conservative lawyer who had previously advocated for selling off public lands across the country.

            "summary": "The Biden administration is set to block a controversial road crucial to operating a planned copper and zinc mine in northern Alaska, saying it would threaten Indigenous communities and fragment wildlife habitat, according to two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.\nThe expected decision on Ambler Road reflects the administration's selective approach toward boosting domestic mining of minerals used in electric vehicles, wind turbines and other clean-energy technologies. It underscores the challenges facing President Biden as he balances an ambitious climate agenda with the need to protect vulnerable communities and pristine wilderness.\nThe timing of the move, which was first reported by Politico, is still in flux, although it could come as soon as this week, according to the two people familiar with the matter. An Interior spokesman declined to comment.\nAdvertisement\nInterior is expected to find that there should be 'no action' on the federal land where the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA) wants to build the 211-mile Ambler Road. That would prevent AIDEA from receiving a permit to build the road, and its would effectively block the mining venture Ambler Metals from accessing the planned open-pit mine.\nAIDEA had planned for Ambler Road to extend 211 miles, crossing 11 major rivers and breaking apart unspoiled tundra. Twenty-six of those miles would have carved through Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, sending giant trucks rumbling through wildlands where tens of thousands of caribou migrate.\nThe Trump administration approved a right-of-way permit for Ambler Road in 2020, saying it could provide access to significant copper and cobalt deposits. But after Biden took office, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland ordered a fresh review of the road, saying the prior administration had not adequately studied its environmental impact.\nAdvertisement\nIn an analysis released last year, Interior's Bureau of Land Management found that the road would threaten Alaska Natives and their lifestyles more than previously thought. The agency identified 66 communities whose hunting, fishing and other subsistence activities could be affected, up from 27 communities in a highly contested 2020 analysis completed during the Trump administration.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nInterior also warned that the road would alter the movement and migration of caribou and other animals, partly because of vehicle noise. With climate change and development already putting pressure on caribou herds, the road could reduce calving and survival rates, the analysis said.\nAmbler Metals has maintained that construction of the road would bring well-paying jobs to local communities, and that the project would bolster the U.S. supply chain for minerals used in clean-energy technologies. The mining venture wants to extract roughly $7.5 billion worth of copper, a crucial ingredient in solar panels, wind turbines, power cables and energy storage systems.\nAdvertisement\nKaleb Froehlich, managing director of Ambler Metals, said in a statement Tuesday that he was 'stunned' by media reports that Interior may block Ambler Road.\n'If true, this decision ignores the support of local communities for this project, while denying jobs for Alaskans and critical revenues for a region where youth are being forced to leave because of a lack of opportunity,\" Froehlich said.\nAIDEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Biden administration has thrown its weight behind other mines for critical minerals in recent months. The Energy Department last month announced a conditional $2.26 billion loan for the developer of the Thacker Pass lithium mine in northern Nevada. The site contains the largest proven reserves of lithium, a key ingredient in electric vehicle batteries, in North America.",

            "excerpt": "The Interior Department finalized a rule limiting future oil and gas development across 13 million acres of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.",
            "summary": "Future oil and gas drilling will be limited across more than 13 million acres of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, the nation's largest expanse of public land, under a sweeping Biden administration plan aimed at protecting sensitive ecosystems and wildlife.\nThe Interior Department's final rule represents one of President Biden's most significant steps to curb fossil fuel development on federal lands. It could help the president's reelection campaign court young voters, a key Democratic constituency, after many youth climate activists criticized the administration's approval of a massive drilling project on Alaska's North Slope last year.\nIn a separate move, Interior announced Friday that it will block a controversial road crucial to operating a planned copper and zinc mine in northern Alaska, saying it would threaten Indigenous communities and fragment wildlife habitat. Together, the two decisions are aimed at safeguarding some of Alaska's last wild places from development.\nAdvertisement\nIn a statement, Biden said he was proud of his administration's efforts to protect the Arctic for current and future generations.\n'Alaska's majestic and rugged lands and waters are among the most remarkable and healthy landscapes in the world, sustaining a vibrant subsistence economy for Alaska Native communities,' Biden said. 'These natural wonders demand our protection.'\nBoth moves carry political and legal risks for the administration. In particular, the protections for the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska are expected to face lawsuits from fossil fuel companies and fierce opposition from Alaskan lawmakers, including Rep. Mary Peltola, a popular Democrat who faces a tough reelection contest.\nPeltola, whose race will help determine which party controls the House, wrote in a social media post last week that the administration was ignoring Alaskans' preferences for drilling in the reserve.\nAdvertisement\n'In the end it should be up to Alaskans to decide what they want developed in their regions,' Peltola wrote. 'I'm calling on the Biden Administration to rethink this misguided action that would only hurt Alaskans and our domestic energy production.'\nThe roughly 23 million-acre National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska is one of the most ecologically valuable tracts of federal land. It provides a critical refuge for tens of thousands of migrating caribou, as well as polar bears, grizzly bears, walruses and waterfowl.\nTeshekpuk Lake, in the eastern part of the reserve, is one of the most important places for waterfowl in the entire Arctic. Up to 100,000 geese converge on the area each summer, seeking safety from predators as they molt and become flightless. The adjacent wetlands serve as breeding grounds for several types of shorebirds, including dunlins, sandpipers and black-bellied plovers.\nYet the reserve, about the size of Indiana, is also one of the most promising onshore oil prospects in the country. Two weeks before leaving office, President Donald Trump sought to open up the reserve to oil and gas leasing, saying it would make the United States less dependent on foreign sources of energy.\nAdvertisement\nThe Biden administration has reversed course. In a proposed rule released last year, the Interior Department called for designating approximately 13 million acres of the reserve as 'special areas' where future oil and gas leasing would be limited. The agency also recommended an outright ban on new leasing across 10.6 million acres — more than 40 percent of the reserve.\nThe final rule closely resembles the proposed rule. Like the proposal, it would not affect ConocoPhillips's controversial Willow oil drilling project or other existing leases in the reserve. Willow alone could produce between 576 million and 614 million barrels of oil over the next 30 years.\n'The approval of Willow was certainly disappointing to many of us who recognize the climate impact of oil and gas development,' said Rachael Hamby, policy director at the Center for Western Priorities, a conservation group. 'With the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska rule, I think we see a more balanced approach to managing public lands for multiple uses, including conservation.'\nAdvertisement\nFossil fuel companies disagree. In public comments on the proposed rule, ConocoPhillips wrote that it could 'significantly and adversely affect future proposals for new activities and developments' in the reserve. Armstrong Oil & Gas, which has leases in the reserve spanning 1.1 million acres, said the proposal could prevent it from building the infrastructure needed to access those tracts.\nThe final rule drew a mixed reaction from Alaska Natives, who have lived on the North Slope for millennia and subsist on its caribou.\nDoreen Leavitt, director of natural resources for the Iñupiat Community of the Arctic Slope, said the administration did not adequately consult Alaska Natives about the economic benefits of fossil fuel development in this remote region. Taxes on oil and gas infrastructure have funded local schools, police officers, firefighters and sanitation services.\nAdvertisement\n'We're barely 50 years away from getting indoor plumbing, and that was brought by oil and gas,' Leavitt said, adding, 'We feel that our voices haven't been listened to.'\nRosemary Ahtuangaruak, the former mayor of Nuiqsut, a town of roughly 500 people on the North Slope, said oil drilling has brought both prosperity and peril to her community. The region around Nuiqsut (pronounced noo-IK-sut) is one of the fastest-warming places on Earth. Its average temperature has risen 4 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels — more than three times the global average, according to a Washington Post analysis of temperature data.\nThe warmer climate has taken a toll on caribou populations near Nuiqsut, where residents get half their food through hunting. Warmer waters and less sea ice have also shifted the migration patterns of bowhead whales and derailed the fall whale hunt, an essential tradition for the Inupiat of the North Slope.\nAdvertisement\n'We want to protect our cultural traditions,' Ahtuangaruak said. 'And we want to give future generations hope that they won't be continually fighting to protect our way of life.'\nInterior's decision to block Ambler Road is intended to safeguard such lifestyles. In an analysis released Friday, the agency found that the road could threaten the subsistence activities of more than 60 Alaska Native communities, up from 27 communities in a highly contested 2020 analysis completed during the Trump administration. It also found that the road could cause irreparable harm to caribou and permafrost.\nAs a result, Interior recommended that there should be 'no action' on the federal land where the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA) wants to build Ambler Road. If finalized, the decision will prevent AIDEA from receiving a permit to construct the road, and it will effectively block the mining venture Ambler Metals from accessing the planned open-pit mine. The company has yet to seek or obtain permits for the mine.\nAdvertisement\nAIDEA, the state's publicly owned development corporation, had planned for Ambler Road to extend 211 miles, crossing 11 major rivers and breaking apart unspoiled tundra. Twenty-six of those miles would have carved through Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, sending giant trucks rumbling through wild lands where tens of thousands of caribou migrate.\nThe Trump administration approved a right-of-way permit for Ambler Road in 2020, saying it could provide access to significant copper and cobalt deposits. But after Biden took office, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland ordered a fresh review of the road, saying the previous administration had not adequately studied its environmental impact.",

This allows us to see where Americans stand on the election and also how younger (those under 30) voters differ from older ones.\nWhat we find is that there are only a handful of issues to which younger voters ascribe more importance than older ones, whether we're considering issues respondents identify as the most important (red, below), very important (purple) or at least somewhat important (orange). Younger Americans are more likely to point to jobs and abortion as the most important issue to them, but the gap between younger voters and voters overall is wider when describing climate change or civil rights as very important issues.\nThe issue that scored the highest in importance to younger Americans? Inflation, same as everyone else.\nThat holds in the Harvard Youth Poll as well. Its methodology was different, presenting respondents with two options from a lengthy list and asking them to identify which was more important. The issue that was most commonly selected as most important relative to alternatives was, once again, inflation.\nBy virtue of focusing on younger respondents, the Harvard poll allows a breakdown by gender. You can see that, on several issues, there's a substantial difference in the views of young men and women, like reproductive rights. The three issues on which there's the widest difference by gender are three of the most commonly associated with liberal politics: reproductive rights, climate change and gun violence. Young women were at least 10 points more likely to identify those issues as important than were young men.\nA key finding in the Harvard poll centers on the divide by gender. Support for Biden is higher among likely voters than among young people overall — but among young men who are likely to vote his advantage is only six points compared with a 33-point advantage with young women who are likely to vote.\nSince 2020, the Harvard Youth Poll has seen the partisan advantage for Democrats evaporate among young men. In 2020, men and women were about 20 points more likely to identify as Democrats than as Republicans. Now, women are 26 points more likely to, while among men, there's virtually no difference.\n(It's worth noting that Gallup polling of partisan identity shows a rightward shift among young voters that comports with the data above.)\nAdvertisement\nOn the issue importance question, the views of young women correlate strongly to the views of young Democrats. The views of young men correlate slightly less strongly to the views of young Republicans.\nThe question of how Biden appeals to these voters, though, remains unanswered. He's put a big focus on student loan relief, as you're probably aware, and it's the issue on which Harvard found the highest level of approval for Biden from younger Americans. It is also the issue that was least likely to be identified as important in Harvard's battery. On inflation and gun violence, issues seen as more important, his approval rating was around 25 percent. On the issue of Israel — which was also surprisingly low on the importance list — his approval was under 20 percent.\nYouGov found that younger Americans were more critical of Biden across the board than Americans overall, including on education and civil rights, issues that they were more likely to identify as important.\nThe situation, then, is that the issues important to young people and those important to Americans overall don't differ that much as Biden's party has lost ground with young men. (A plurality of young men in the poll identified as independent.) Analysis from Pew Research Center found that voters under 30 backed Biden by a 26-point margin in 2020, down from the 30-point margin Hillary Clinton enjoyed four years before. If the margin had instead matched that seen in this poll — 19 points — it would have meant a shift of more than 4 million votes from Biden to Trump.",

            "summary": "A new outlook for summer from the National Weather Service is a toasty one: Hotter-than-normal conditions are favored almost everywhere, except for a small portion of the northern Plains. The highest odds for a hot summer stretch from Texas into the Pacific Northwest, as well as much of the Northeast.\nThis forecast sets the stage for bouts of record-challenging high temperatures throughout the nation and the possibility of the hottest summer ever observed. In the central states and Rocky Mountains, the combination of heat and an expectation for drier-than-normal weather will increase drought potential. It will also raise the fire threat in some areas.\nThe hot forecast is linked to the probable switch from the El Niño to La Niña climate pattern by the summer's second half.\nWhile La Niña has a small cooling effect on the planet overall, it has boosted summer heat in the United States, especially in recent years when human-caused climate change has also fueled higher temperatures.\nAdvertisement\nThe three La Niña summers from 2020 to 2022 were all historically hot. The nation's summer average temperature of 74 degrees in 2021 was tied for the hottest on record; 2022 and 2020 marked the third- and sixth-hottest summers, respectively.\n'A common feature in summer during a developing La Niña is a semi-permanent upper-level ridge over the middle of North America,' wrote DTN, a forecasting company based in Minneapolis. 'Ridges are notorious for hot and dry conditions.'\nThese ridges, referred to as heat domes, are common in summer but tend to be most persistent during La Niña.\nIncreased drought and wildfire risks\nA hot summer often goes hand in hand with drought as high temperatures increase evaporation, which strips moisture from the land surface.\nThe driest weather compared to normal is expected to stretch from western Texas into the northern Rockies. The Weather Service predicts drought will persist or develop in much of this region.\nAdvertisement\nWetter-than-normal conditions are predicted in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, which are already off to a wet start this year. A combination of above-normal temperatures and rainfall in this zone could increase the threat of flooding.\nThe hot and dry conditions predicted in the Rockies would ordinarily support an elevated summer fire threat. However, large parts of this region are coming off a wet winter, so current outlooks show limited areas of higher-than-normal fire potential.\nStill, pockets of the Southwest, Northwest and northern Rockies will see above-normal fire threats by June and July according to the Predictive Services of the National Interagency Fire Center.\nA chance for the hottest summer on record\nWhile recent La Niña summers have been hotter than normal, the potential for a scorching summer is especially high when La Niña comes on the heels of a strong El Niño event, like we just experienced.\nAdvertisement\nOf the eight strongest El Niño winters since 1950, the following summer was hotter than the summer before it by about 1.2 degrees. If that turns out to be the case this summer, it would rank as the hottest on record.\nPart of a global pattern\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAlthough the country is in the midst of a late season cool spell, featuring frosty mornings from the Midwest to the Northeast, April will probably become the 11th straight month of record-breaking warmth for the globe.\nEl Niño continues to exert a warming influence on global temperatures even while waning.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projects that 'it is virtually certain' that 2024 will rank among the 10 warmest years on record and gives 2024 a 55 percent chance of topping 2023 as the warmest year.\nGlobal temperatures are projected to be not quite as warm during the second half of the year assuming La Niña takes hold, but the super-warm start to 2024 may allow it to hold its position at or near first place.",

            "excerpt": "A California lawmaker wants to require limited liability companies and similar businesses to report the identities of their owners to the government",
            "summary": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. — A California lawmaker wants to require business owners and landlords to disclose their identities under legislation aimed at cracking down on opaque ownership structures that have enabled some companies to skirt state laws without facing consequences.\nLimited liability companies and similar corporations in the United States are often formed to protect a business owner's personal assets. In California, the world's fifth largest economy, such businesses are already required to register with the Secretary of State and share information including the name of the business, its address and the names of its executives or representatives.\nBut Democratic state Sen. Maria Elana Durazo said that that's not enough. She also wants the public to know who actually owns the company. Her bill would require these companies to list anyone who owns at least 25% of the company's assets on its registration with the state. It would apply to all LLCs and similar corporations regardless of the size.\nAdvertisement\nDurazo said the lack of that crucial information has allowed people to set up business structures where one company is owned in the name of another, all to shield their identities from the public, government officials and even law enforcement agencies. In many cases, local and state officials must spend significant time and resources to track down the owners before they can charge or sue the business for violating state laws, if they can find them at all.\n'Some owners can abuse LLC to shield not only their assets but also their identities,' Durazo said at a hearing Wednesday. 'This is a good governance bill.'\nWith support from labor, housing and environmental groups, her bill passed a key legislative committee Wednesday. There was no debate. It needs a second committee vote before reaching the Senate floor.\nAdvertisement\nA similar proposal last year did not survive the Legislature's suspense file, a mysterious process where lawmakers decide — with no explanation — whether bills should move forward or not.\nThe legislation faces fierce opposition from a number of business groups including those that represent landlords. They argue that LLCs must already share lots of information with the government and note that they will be required to disclose ownership to a branch of the U.S. Treasury Department by 2025.\nThey also point to costs. Last year, the Secretary of State estimated the new disclosure requirement would cost $9 million to implement and an additional $3.4 million annually in subsequent years to employ 28 support workers.\n'It really doesn't make any sense to us.' said Debra Carlton, an executive of California Apartment Association. 'Why add these costs onto the state,' she asked, 'when we're already having financial challenges?'\nAdvertisement\nThe practice of operating business anonymously is prevalent in many California industries, proponents of the bill said. In Oakland, after city officials condemned a dilapidated building rented out to low-income immigrant families, the city attorney's office spent more than a year investigating and combing through hundreds of city code enforcement records to find the owners of the building, said Suzie Dershowitz, who worked on the case at the time. The city eventually found and successfully sued the landlords, who owned more than 130 properties in the city through a network of LLCs and corporations. The investigation would have had taken half a day of work if Durazo's bill was law at the time, she added.\n'As a government agency, I had access to a lot of information,' said Dershowitz, who now works for Public Advocates, an advocacy group sponsoring the bill. 'But the lack of transparency in corporate ownership really hampered our investigation.'\nSome employers also rely on the practice to dodge labor violations and cheat workers out of their pay, labor attorney Ruth Silver-Taube said. She pointed to a case in San Jose where a hotel worker was fired from his job for filing a wage theft claim with the state. The state couldn't track down the business owners and had to name 14 different companies, some of which were defunct, in its lawsuit before the owners agreed to settle, she said. The agreement came nine years after the worker filed the initial complaint.\nAdvertisement\n'Justice delayed is justice denied,' Silver-Taube said.\nBy hiding behind an anonymous LLC, Silicon Valley billionaires were successful in shielding their identities in a secretive $800 million land-buying spree in rural Northern California, despite years of local scrutiny.\nOthers managed to dodge legal ramifications and responsibilities altogether through the practice, said Haley Ehlers of climate watchdog organization Climate First: Replacing Oil & Gas. The group has spent years advocating for the removal of orphan and idle wells left behind by defunct oil operations. Orphan wells are often be sold to private, anonymous shell companies designed to go bankrupt to help owners of oil businesses evade legal responsibility to clean up the site, leaving taxpayers to shoulder the cost, she said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'If we had more owner transparency, bad actors wouldn't be able to hide behind a new shell company name,' Ehlers said.\nAdvertisement\nThe federal reporting requirement was passed by Congress in 2021. The legislation requires businesses to report owners to an agency called the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which aims to cut down on shell corporations and money laundering. But currently, only law enforcement and government officials — not the public — have access to the information.\nA federal court ruled that the law is unconstitutional and exempted more than 65,000 members of a small business association in Alabama. The Justice Department is now appealing the ruling.",

The EPA also states that water managers in 40 states anticipate water shortages, under average rainfall conditions, over the next 10 years. Even in typically rainy regions like the Pacific Northwest, summers are becoming drier.\nEven in typically rainy regions like the Pacific Northwest, summers are becoming drier.\nThat's where a gravel garden comes in. 'We are trying to create a beautiful garden with what Mother Nature provides, meaning rain,' says horticulturist Jeff Epping, 'because water is incredibly precious, and it's getting more and more scarce.'\nUsing a thick layer of gravel improves drainage and water runoff by helping the rainwater make its way to the soil underneath. And putting dry-loving plants into the gravel can dramatically reduce your water bill: Once the plants are established, there is no need for supplemental watering.\nGravel gardens also make a great alternative to the traditional lawns that have dominated American landscapes for decades. And a gravel garden full of water-wise plants that don't require pesticides, fertilizers or mowing can help promote biodiversity by creating a happy habitat for local birds, pollinators and other beneficial insects. If you plant catmint, for example, it can attract bees that will help pollinate and reproduce those plants over time.

The strong scent of the leaves of catmint can also repel garden pests, including rabbits and deer.\nEpping says he's noticed a huge difference in the wildlife that visit his gravel garden in Madison, Wis. The native plants, such as prairie baby's breath, are 'chock-full of bees and wasps,' and Monarch butterflies lay eggs on the nearby milkweed.",

In an emailed statement, Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said the former president would 'make America energy dominant again.'\nAdvertisement\nEnergy analysts say they expect a second Trump administration would slow the pace of offshore wind lease sales and environmental reviews. These steps could undercut the industry at the very moment when it needs to accelerate to meet Biden's goal of 100 percent clean electricity by 2035, and to help New England reduce its deep dependence on imported gas and oil.\n'Project reviews and auction schedules could slow substantially, potentially to the point of a de facto pause,' analysts with ClearView Energy Partners wrote in a recent note to clients. 'In short: the regulatory uncertainty from the upcoming election could keep project developers on the sidelines.'\nA Trump Interior Department would also prioritize offshore oil and gas leasing in the Gulf of Mexico over offshore wind auctions, said William Perry Pendley, who served as acting director of Interior's Bureau of Land Management under Trump.\nAdvertisement\n'The priority has to be oil and gas,' Pendley said, adding, 'I don't think there's a reason to press forward on wind.'\nTrump told executives at the fundraising dinner he would open up the Gulf of Mexico to drilling, a person with knowledge of the meeting said, lift Biden's pause on new liquefied natural gas exports, speed up drilling permits, reverse regulations aimed at deploying electric vehicles and do what he could to help the oil and gas industry. He listened to each executive for about four or five minutes.\nPointing out the window to the Atlantic Ocean at one point, one attendee said, the former president claimed that offshore wind turbines break down when they are exposed to saltwater — though these projects are designed to resist saltwater corrosion.\nNear the end of the meeting, Trump told executives that they should contribute to his campaign — the leader of his main super PAC was in the room — because he was trailing Biden financially. His policies would be much better for the oil and gas industry than those of Biden, and he'd do much of what they wanted 'on Day 1,' he said.\nAdvertisement\nIn addition to political uncertainty, offshore wind developers face significant economic challenges. Rising interest rates and supply-chain bottlenecks have contributed to the demise of some projects, including two in New Jersey late last year.\noffshore wind developers face significant economic challenges. Rising interest rates and supply-chain bottlenecks have contributed to the demise of some projects, including two in New Jersey late last year.\nDemocrats are doing their best to lock in commercial-scale offshore wind projects before Trump has a chance to halt them. The Biden administration has already approved eight, including one that is up and running. Democratic governors in the Northeast have also reinforced their commitments to deploying more offshore wind energy, regardless of the balance of power in Washington.\nIf Biden were to win a second term, he would be in a position to accelerate offshore wind along the Gulf and West coasts, and add more capacity to the Atlantic. Once those steel turbines were anchored to the ocean floor, they would be hard to scuttle — once reason the stakes now are so high.\nA long battle\nTrump's crusade against wind power dates back to 2006, when he bought an 1,800-acre estate in Scotland near a planned wind farm that he warned would be 'monstrous' and 'really ugly.'\nAdvertisement\nThe Trump Organization sought to build a golf course there, and it sued to block the wind project, saying the turbines would ruin the view for golfers. In December 2015, less than a year before the U.S. election, judges on Britain's top court unanimously rejected that claim.\nBut the battle raged on. While in the White House, Trump frequently attacked the clean-energy source, suggesting without evidence that it causes cancer.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations your house just went down 75 percent in value,' Trump said in a 2020 speech. 'And they say the noise causes cancer. And of course it's like a graveyard for birds.'\nThere are no known instances of wind farms causing cancer. While turbines can kill birds, research suggests that house cats cause far more bird deaths in the United States each year, and that painting the turbine blades black can help reduce fatalities.\nAdvertisement\nYet taking a cue from Trump's anti-wind rhetoric, Interior delayed the approval of America's first major offshore wind farm in 2019. Then-Interior Secretary David Bernhardt extended the environmental review of Vineyard Wind, a proposed wind farm near Martha's Vineyard, Mass.\nThe decision pushed back the timeline for the project, which had planned to start operating in 2021. It also cast a pall of uncertainty over the entire offshore wind sector, as other developers worried about the administration potentially interfering in their own projects.\nBernhardt, who now chairs the Center for American Freedom at the America First Policy Institute, a pro-Trump think tank, did not respond to requests for comment. Bernhardt has been talking with energy executives and others in recent weeks about policies in a second Trump term, according to a person familiar with the outreach, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.\n‘A shot in the arm'\nToday, the forces opposing offshore wind have multiplied and become more powerful. Fossil fuel interests have worked with right-wing think tanks and community groups to block projects up and down the East Coast, according to a recent report by Brown University's Climate and Development Lab.\nAdvertisement\nSeveral of these groups have repeated Trump's false claims that wind turbines are killing whales and driving the marine mammals 'crazy.' Many are now feeling emboldened by the former president's rhetoric.\n'It's a shot in the arm to our movement,' said Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast New Jersey, which describes itself as a grass-roots group made up of 'residents, homeowners, business owners, fishermen and visitors.'\nTrump 'rightly sees offshore wind as a boondoggle,' said H. Sterling Burnett, director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center on Climate and Environmental Policy at the Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank that has called climate change a 'hoax' and has sued to stop an offshore wind project off Virginia.\nEarly on, Protect Our Coast received support from the Delaware-based Caesar Rodney Institute, a think tank that has been backed by fossil fuel interests such as the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers and the American Energy Alliance. The Heartland Institute received funding from oil giant ExxonMobil until 2008.\nForging ahead\nRegardless of the election, officials in the Biden administration and Northeast are forging ahead with ambitious offshore wind goals. And they are making union labor — a key Democratic constituency — central to this push.\nAdvertisement\nInterior this month approved the nation's eighth large offshore wind project south of Martha's Vineyard, Mass. Overall, the Biden administration has approved more than 10 gigawatts of clean energy from offshore wind projects — enough to power nearly 4 million homes.\nIn New England, which relies on natural gas to fuel nearly 43 percent of its power generation, Vineyard Wind is now delivering power to roughly 30,000 homes, despite the delay under Trump. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey (D), who has set a goal of 100 percent clean electricity by 2030, has praised the developers for agreeing to hire hundreds of union workers.\n'In a whole new industry like offshore wind, we're seeing the beginnings of workers coming together and collectively organizing,' said Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, the country's largest federation of labor unions. 'These are all things that would be at risk if there were a second Trump administration. So we think it couldn't be more dire.'\nYet Rebecca Tepper, secretary of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, said Trump's false claims about wind power won't stop the state's progress.",

Bellwether has been testing the tech with the National Guard, which will deploy it in time for the summer wildfire season, said Nirav Patel, a program manager with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), a Pentagon unit that helps the military integrate commercial technology and that helped organize the partnership.\nUp until now, the National Guard — which coordinates the military's response to tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and wildfires inside the United States and its territories — has had to rely on human analysts poring over aerial photos to figure out specifically which areas, buildings and infrastructure have been damaged after a disaster before being able to direct the right resources to the right places.\nAdvertisement\nWhat used to take hours or days now takes just seconds, said Patel. He said he expects the tech to only become more important. 'As climate change is impacting different parts of the Earth's surface, the [Defense Department] is being pulled in,' Patel said. 'We unfortunately only see that increasing.'\nThe collaboration between Bellwether and the National Guard shows how Silicon Valley is working more closely with the Defense Department. Though military funding and the space program were integral to getting Silicon Valley up and running in the 1950s and 1960s, few tech founders in recent decades have built companies with the goal of serving the military. The DIU was set up in 2015 to try to close that gap and find a way to cut through bureaucratic procurement processes and get the tech industry to work more closely with the Defense Department.\nMore recently, a new wave of Silicon Valley tech companies, including drone maker Anduril and AI company Shield AI, have begun building tech specifically for the military, casting themselves as patriots aiming to arm the U.S. military to retain its dominance through the 21st century. Venture-capital funding for defense tech start-ups is growing.\nAdvertisement\nGoogle has a complicated history with the U.S. military. In 2018, the company walked away from a contract to build AI image-recognition tools for the Pentagon after employees protested the deal. But since then, it has steadily returned to military work and was one of four companies awarded a massive $9 billion contract to build cloud services for the Defense Department.",

            "summary": "Millions of people around the world will pause on Monday, at least for a moment, to mark Earth Day. It's an annual event founded by people who hoped to stir activism to clean up and preserve a planet that is now home to some 8 billion humans and assorted trillions of other organisms.\nHere are answers to some common questions about Earth Day and how it came to be:\nWHY DO WE CELEBRATE EARTH DAY?\nEarth Day has its roots in growing concern over pollution in the 1960s, when author Rachel Carson's 1962 book 'Silent Spring,' about the pesticide DDT and its damaging effects on the food chain, hit bestseller lists and raised awareness about nature's delicate balance.\nBut it was a senator from Wisconsin, Democrat Gaylord Nelson, who had the idea that would become Earth Day. Nelson had long been concerned about the environment when a massive offshore oil spill sent millions of gallons onto the southern California coast in 1969. Nelson, after touring the spill site, had the idea of doing a national 'teach-in' on the environment, similar to teach-ins being held on some college campuses at the time to oppose the war in Vietnam.\nAdvertisement\nNelson and others, including activist Denis Hayes, worked to expand the idea beyond college campuses, with events all around the country, and came up with the Earth Day name.\nWHY WAS APRIL 22 CHOSEN FOR EARTH DAY?\nA history of the movement by EarthDay.org, where Hayes remains board chair emeritus, says the date of the first Earth Day — April 22, 1970 — was chosen because it fell on a weekday between spring break and final exams and the aim was to attract as many students as possible.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIS EARTH DAY A REAL HOLIDAY?\nIt's not a federal holiday. But many groups use the day to put together volunteer events with the environment in mind, such as cleanups of natural areas. You can see a list of events worldwide, or register your own event, at EarthDay.org.\nHAS IT HAD AN IMPACT?\nIt has. The overwhelming public response to the first Earth Day is credited with adding pressure for the U.S. Congress to do more to address pollution, and it did, passing landmark legislation including the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. More broadly, it's seen as the birth of the modern environmental movement. In later years, Earth Day expanded to become a truly global event. It now claims to have motivated action in more than 192 countries.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2000, Earth Day began taking aim at climate change, a problem that has grown rapidly more urgent in recent years.\nWHAT'S THE THEME THIS YEAR?\nThis year's Earth Day is focusing on the threat that plastics pose to our environment, with a call to end all single-use plastic and find replacements for their use so they can quickly be phased down.\n___",

            "summary": "BRASILIA, Brazil — Indigenous representatives from 35 countries issued a declaration Thursday criticizing the fact that they are too rarely consulted about mining that takes place on or near their lands, an issue that has become more acute with increased demand for minerals needed in the transition to a cleaner energy system.\n'We recognize and support the need to end fossil fuel reliance and shift to renewable energy as critical in addressing the climate crisis,' the statement read. 'However, the current trajectory of the energy transition fails to meet the criteria of justice, social equity, and environmental sustainability, particularly from the perspectives of Indigenous Peoples' rights and well-being.'\nThe document comes out of the Conference on Indigenous Peoples and the Just Transition which took place in New York last week. Indigenous leaders from the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Kenya, Australia and Norway among other countries attended.\nAdvertisement\nLithium, nickel and cobalt are often used in batteries, which are key to both electric vehicles and extending production from solar and wind farms. Copper and aluminum are in higher demand as countries expand their electrical grids. Lesser-known rare earth elements are used in magnets in electric motors.\nMining has left a legacy of environmental damage in many places for more than a century and is now expanding.\nThe declaration also mentioned increasing criminal persecution and attacks against Indigenous leaders.\nThe statement called out both the International Council of Mining and Metals, a trade group that says it represents a third of the industry, and the International Seabed Authority, for failing to respect Indigenous rights and conducting what it calls business as usual. Neither group responded to queries from The Associated Press.\nAdvertisement\nAbout half of energy transition minerals and metal projects are located on or near the lands of Indigenous and other subsistence farmers, according to a study published in 2022 by the journal Nature Sustainability.\n'We are those who generate the least impact on the planet,' Ruth Alipaz Cuqui, an Indigenous leader from the Bolivian Amazon who attended the conference, told the AP in a phone interview. 'But even so, we understand that we have to be part of this whole process.' That participation should be comprehensive or else the energy transition will not be fair, she said.\nAlipaz Cuqui cited conflicts in the arid region of Uyuni, Bolivia, where local communities oppose the intense use of water to produce lithium. The project, still in its beginnings, is a joint venture between Bolivia and China. The Bolivian Ministry of Energy did not respond to a request for comment.\nAdvertisement\nThe lead organizer for the conference was the Indigenous Peoples Rights International, a nonprofit registered in the Philippines and the U.S., with financial support from Nia Tero, a nonprofit that supports Indigenous rights, The Christensen Fund, the Henry Luce Foundation, the Waverley ST Foundation, and the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment, according to the event website.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n___",

            "excerpt": "The Biden administration is moving to let conservationists lease government land for restoration",
            "summary": "BILLINGS, Mont. — The Biden administration on Thursday finalized a new rule for public land management that's meant to put conservation on more equal footing with oil drilling, grazing and other extractive industries on vast government-owned properties.\nOfficials pushed past strong opposition from private industry and Republican governors to adopt the proposal.\nThe rule from the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management — which oversees more than 380,000 square miles (990,000 square kilometers) of land, primarily in the U.S. West — will allow public property to be leased for restoration in the same way that oil companies lease land for drilling.\nThe rule also promotes the designation of more 'areas of critical environmental concern' — a special status that can restrict development. It's given to land with historic or cultural significance or that's important for wildlife conservation.\nAdvertisement\nThe land bureau has a history of industry-friendly policies and for more than a century has sold grazing permits and oil and gas leases. In addition to its surface land holdings, the bureau regulates publicly-owned underground mineral reserves — such as coal for power plants and lithium for renewable energy — across more than 1 million square miles (2.5 million square kilometers).\nInterior Secretary Deb Haaland said the changes would 'restore balance' to how the U.S. government manages its public lands. The new rule continues the administration's efforts to use science to restore habitats and guide 'strategic and responsible development,' Haaland said in a statement.\nBut Republican lawmakers and agriculture industry representatives have blasted the move as a backdoor way to exclude mining, energy development and agriculture. They assert the administration is violating the 'multiple use' mandate for Interior Department lands, by catapulting the 'non-use' of federal lands — meaning restoration leases — to a position of prominence.\nAdvertisement\nAbout 10% of all land in the U.S. falls under the Bureau of Land Management's jurisdiction, putting the agency at the center of arguments over how much development should be allowed on public property.\nEnvironmentalists largely embraced the changes, characterizing them as long overdue.\nTrout Unlimited President Chris Wood said conservation already was part of the bureau's mission under the 1976 Federal Lands Policy Management Act. The new rule, he said, was 'a re-statement of the obvious.'\n'We are pleased to see the agency recognizing what the law already states — conservation is a vital use of our public lands,' he said.\nRestoration leases will not be issued if they would conflict with activity already underway on a parcel of land, officials said. They also said private industry could benefit from the program, since companies could buy leases and restore that acreage to offset damage they might do to other government-owned properties.\nAdvertisement\nThose leases were referred to as 'conservation leases' in the agency's original proposal last year. That was changed to 'restoration leases' and 'mitigation leases' in the final rule, but their purpose appears largely the same.\nWhile the bureau previously issued leases for conservation purposes in limited cases, it has never had a dedicated program for it.\nBureau Director Tracy Stone-Manning has said the changes address the rising challenges of climate change and development. She told The Associated Press when the changes were announced last year that making conservation an 'equal' to other uses would not interfere with grazing, drilling and other activities.",

            "summary": "Carpets of yellow, orange and gold flowers are beginning to cover Southern California's vast deserts, the Bay Area's dramatic bluffs and even near Los Angeles International Airport.\nBut do they add up to a 'superbloom'? There is no single definition of the event, but so far this year's blooms haven't been as vibrant or abundant as those that took over swaths of California last spring following drought-busting rains. This year, too, the state received ample winter rains.\nAfter especially wet winters, bursts of color may appear in the spring, drawing droves of visitors to California and other parts of the Southwest to glimpse the flowering fields and pose for pictures.\nHere are some key facts about the natural spectacle:\nWHAT'S A SUPERBLOOM?\nScientists don't agree on any one definition. Across California and Arizona, there are stretches of desert that can quickly transform into dense fields of wildflowers, since seeds lie dormant in the soil and then germinate and blossom at around the same time.\nAdvertisement\nA recent study found that such widespread blooms, which have been visible by satellite imagery in some years, take place after seasons with greater than 30% average precipitation, said Naomi Fraga, director of conservation programs at the California Botanic Garden, east of Los Angeles.\nDOES THIS YEAR COUNT?\nNo, according to Fraga. That's because there isn't a huge diversity in the flowers that have blossomed in places like California's Death Valley.\nThis year's blooms aren't as large or as dense as wildflowers in past years, she said.\n'When I think of superblooms, I think of a bloom that is so extraordinary, that's a once in a lifetime event,' Fraga said, adding that the wildflower display this year 'still makes a beautiful show.'\nLast spring, early April visitors to Southern California's Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve were treated to dazzling orange displays of the state flower. But around the same time this year, the fields were absent of the orange blooms, with the reserve's officials posting that the window for an impressive show was becoming 'increasingly narrow.'\nAdvertisement\nIn Death Valley, one of the driest places on earth, stretches of desert are dotted with gold thanks to sunflowers that emerged after an especially wet winter and spring.\nWhether that constitutes a superbloom is 'really in the eye of the beholder,' said Evan Meyer, executive director of the California-based nonprofit Theodore Payne Foundation, which works to preserve California's native plants.\nWHEN DOES IT HAPPEN?\nApril is typically the peak month for spring wildflowers, but in high-elevation places they can continue to blossom later into the spring.\nSuperblooms generally refer to low-elevation desert regions, Fraga said.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'It's much more geographic than seasonal,' Meyer said. 'Spring in the mountains hasn't started, and in the low desert, it's past its peak.'\nWhen temperatures rise in the desert, the flowers can quickly dry out.\nHOW DOES CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECT THE SUPERBLOOM?\nExperts say it might be too soon to tell.\nAdvertisement\nClimate change is making precipitation patterns more erratic, but the effects on wildflowers could play out over decades or even centuries, Fraga said, since seeds stay dormant in the soil for long periods of time.\nSouthern California received heavy rain last summer, unlike its usually dry summers, which she said probably stimulated flowers to germinate out of season. Winter temperatures also were higher than average, so many of them were able to stay in bloom through the spring season.\n'That made for a very unusual bloom,' Fraga said.\n___",

As campaigning for the June 6-9 event heats up, mainstream parties fear that disenchanted voters might turn to the people at NatCon 2024.\n'This is what we're up against. We're up against a new form of evil ideology,' Nigel Farage, the man credited with taking Britain out of the European Union, told the gathering of a few hundred stridently nationalist and fundamentalist Christian politicians and think-tankers.\nAnti-migrant sentiment featured in a number of speeches. Some targeted what they saw as the follies of climate policy, 'narco-socialism' or 'woke indoctrination,' often with sharp opposition to multinational organizations like the EU.\nAdvertisement\nLashing out at the bloc's treaties, and the pledge in the preamble of the founding EU texts to an 'ever-closer Union' among the 27 member countries, Polish lawmaker Ryszard Legutko said it all makes 'medieval monks look almost like intellectual anarchists.'\nSurveys suggest that mainstream political parties are likely to retain power after the June elections, but quite possibly with a reduced majority.\nBelgian police quietly shut down the conference by barring attendees from re-entering the venue if they dared to leave. A dozen or so officers blocked the main entrance. It was the third venue for the gathering after the owners of two other locations shied away when anti-fascist protesters vowed to disrupt proceedings.\nThis year's NatCon, organized by the conservative U.S. think tank the Edmund Burke Foundation, was held under the banner of 'National Conservatism, Preserving the Nation-State in Europe.'\nAdvertisement\nFrench far-right figurehead Eric Zemmour was scheduled to criticize the EU's new migrant and asylum rules but was turned away by police.

Modern liberal democracy was likened to a form of 'neo-Marxist authoritarianism.'\nAdvertisement\nMostly though, those who could speak before the gathering was shut down for the day focused on their 'enemies' among the mainstream political parties.\n'We have to know our enemies are in panic and they show it every day,' said EU lawmaker Hermann Tertsch, from Spain's far-right Vox party. 'The enemy knows their time is running out.'\nAs Brussels police warned that the conference's time was limited, too, Edmund Burke Foundation Chairman Yoram Hazony invited participants to stay as long as they dared.",

            "excerpt": "A pioneering program in Malawi lets recipients decide how best to use the lump sum payments",
            "summary": "CHAMBA, Malawi — The cyclone tore through Magret Frank's village two years ago, ripping apart the thatched mud huts. She dragged her four children from their beds just before the roof beams collapsed, and their chickens and clothes were swept away into the howling night.\n'I cried inside. But I am the mother — I have to be strong,' said Frank, who has had three homes that were destroyed by cyclones. 'So I told them, as long as we have life, there is a new dawn.'\nBut now, like her neighbors, she is sleeping through storms in a new brick house with an iron roof. The constellation of new homes is the product of a pioneering program that is Africa's largest cash giveaway as measured by amount per person. It is part of a project that aims to revolutionize the way that aid is given to the poor: in a lump sum of cash with no strings attached.\nAdvertisement\nThe program is run by GiveDirectly, an organization founded by graduates of MIT and Harvard who work with prominent economists to identify the most efficient ways to reduce poverty. Donors include Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes and the founders of the graphic design tool Canva.\nLump sums are the most efficient way to give cash, according to a study of GiveDirectly programs released in December that compared the impact of three methods: in small transfers over 12 years; in small transfers over two years; or in a lump sum. Two years in, recipients of the lump sum have spent more money on health care, and more of their children have scored better on school exams, according to the study by MIT economics professor Abhijit Banerjee and others, including two GiveDirectly directors. The lump-sum recipients were also more likely to start a business and to make more money from their business.\nThe implications are far-reaching for families like Frank's.\nAfter the 2022 cyclone destroyed her home, her family slept in a six-foot-square thatched kitchen largely open to the elements. She wove grass mats to sell for 50 cents each, trying to save enough to rebuild. She said she couldn't even dream of a brick home. It took her weeks of saving to replace her plastic bucket, the lost item she most mourned.\nAdvertisement\nThen a stranger arrived with a wild proposition. Each household, including Frank's, would be given $800 — more than she would usually earn in two years. Like most of her neighbors, she used the money to build a new house.\nNow cyclones can't wreck Frank's food stores, kill her chickens or ruin her clothes and utensils. Village chief Edna Nikisi said the 2022 cyclone flattened 26 houses. This season, cyclones were strong but they blew down only four homes, all the old-style mud huts.\nGlobal shift to cash\nFrank benefited from a global push to distribute more aid in cash. Two decades ago, microfinance was the darling of the aid world. But it attracted predatory lenders and locked recipients into cycles of debt, and recent research has cast doubt over its long-term impact.\nTraditionally, aid agencies distributed items such as food, livestock and laptops, but a frequent mismatch between donations and need meant items were often sold, stolen, broken or wasted, various studies found. So donors are increasingly moving to cash. Studies have repeatedly shown that cash is the most efficient form of aid when markets are functioning. New technology like mobile money makes it easy to send cash directly to the world's poorest. Governments in Togo, Brazil, South Africa and Mexico have all introduced small cash payments for poor families.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough cash and voucher programs are increasingly popular, growing from $6.6 billion in 2020 to $10 billion in 2022, they still account globally for only about 5 percent of development aid and just under 20 percent of humanitarian aid, according to a 2023 report by the CALP Network, a consortium of 90 aid groups. Such programs typically give out tiny monthly sums. They also sometimes carry conditions — such as school enrollment or vaccinations — and often suffer from 'ineffective targeting, unsustainable funding, and irregular payment cycles,' economists Adam Salifu and Kennedy Makafui Kufoalor said in a 2024 study.\naccording to a 2023 report by the CALP Network, a consortium of 90 aid groups.

Poor people usually know their needs better than a bureaucrat or aid worker, he said, and lump sums offer opportunities that stipends don't. Tiny sums, he said, can stave off starvation but not transform a life.\nThe debate on how to lift people out of poverty is most urgent in Africa. Overall, global wealth has quadrupled in the past 30 years, but a third of the people in Africa still live in extreme poverty — about 100 million more than in 1990, according to the World Bank. That is due partly to rising populations and partly to factors such as war, poor governance and climate change. The ranks of the poor have increased even as money has poured in: Aid to African countries totaled $53.5 billion in 2022 — slightly more than half the $100 billion that the Brookings Institution last year estimated would be needed for direct cash transfers to eradicate extreme poverty globally.\nAdvertisement\nMalawi, where fog-cloaked hills encircle verdant fields, is often called a development puzzle. It is fertile and has never fought a war. Since 2005, wealthy countries have spent $16.5 billion on development assistance to Malawi. But poverty has not decreased, the World Bank says, noting that for every three Malawians who moved out of poverty be­tween 2010 and 2019, four were pushed back in by climate shocks.\nMany families remain too poor to take advantage of newly built schools and clinics. Save the Children supports the school that serves Frank's village, where shrieks of laughter drift among the neem trees. But when cyclones ruined books and uniforms, her children had to drop out because the items were too expensive for Frank to replace. Neither could she afford the bumpy motorbike ride down a long sandy track to a U.N.-supported clinic if her children contracted malaria or pneumonia sleeping outside.\nNow, she can use both the school and the clinic.\nPhysician Alinafe Kachigwali said deaths at Mwima Health Center in Khongoni have fallen significantly since the GiveDirectly disbursement began. Now, women can pay for transportation to the clinic or even to a referral hospital if needed, she said. More women are coming in for five-month prenatal checkups, she said, meaning complications are being detected sooner.\nLessons learned\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nGiveDirectly calculates that, including operating costs, it would need nearly $4 billion to give $550 to every adult in Malawi living in extreme poverty. So far, the program has given out $50 million to 160,000 adults there.\nAdvertisement\nAt first, GiveDirectly tried to target the poorest villagers by disbursing money only to those living in thatched-roof homes. But now even those with brick houses get cash. That helps reduce potential conflicts or cheating.\nAnd those with stable living situations are more likely to use the cash to create jobs. A lanky, nearsighted tailor bought glasses and a sewing machine that tripled his income. A shop owner converted a cement room into a raucous nursery for 56 children and now employs three teachers. A farmer bought a solar fridge to sell cold drinks and a solar phone charger that he now rents out.\nSometimes, there are problems, including incidents of fraud and theft by staffers in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda. In each case, GiveDirectly said it hired external investigators and changed its systems. Outsiders also try to game the system by moving into qualifying villages, but GiveDirectly says a census conducted beforehand weeds them out.",

            "summary": "Indonesia's Mount Ruang has erupted at least three times this week, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of people. On Wednesday evening local time, the volcano's explosive eruption shot ash nearly 70,000 feet high, possibly spewing aerosols into the stratosphere, the atmosphere's second layer.\nThe volcano is part of the Indonesia's North Sulawesi province, in the Sangihe Island archipelago. That puts it about 60 miles north-northeast of Manado, the province's capital city.\nIndonesia's National Disaster Management Agency posted on X that the situation corresponded to a level 3 on a 1 through 4 scale, with 4 being the most severe.\nIn Laingpatehi Village, there were reports of ashfall and communication issues. Indonesian authorities urged residents and tourists to remain at least 2.5 miles away from the volcano.\nSatellite imagery depicted a massive eruption around 8 p.m. Wednesday local time, which shot ash about 65,000 to 70,000 feet high. That's roughly twice the altitude at which commercial aircraft fly.\nThere are nine formal centers worldwide that monitor the location and movement of volcanic ash clouds, since they can pose major dangers to aviation and can't be tracked on radar. The Volcanic Ash Advisory Center based in Darwin, Australia, and overseen by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, wrote that there were 'two volcanic ash layers discernible on satellite [at the surface and 47,000 feet] moving west-southwest and expected to dissipate within 12 to 18 hours.'\nAdvertisement\nAt the surface, ash was moving northwest, but at the upper altitudes, it was moving east.\nThe eruption produced prolific lightning, as is often the case with volcanic explosions. Friction between ash particulates results in charge separation, yielding static discharges in the form of lightning.\nChris Vagasky, a former lightning solutions manager at Visalia and current manager of the Wisconsin Mesonet, reported that nearly 4,000 lightning strikes had been detected associated with the Ruang eruption as of 8 a.m. Eastern time.\nThere have been nearly 4,000 #lightning events detected in the eruption plume of Gunung Ruang since 17 UTC yesterday. https://t.co/nQ5hYHUjw9 pic.twitter.com/wAwmqt3S4R\n— Chris Vagasky ⚡️ (@COweatherman) April 17, 2024\nThe plot image he shared on X may resemble a bull's eye of sorts, with an apparent ring of slightly lesser activity observed between a central dense spattering of strikes and a dense outer ring of observed strikes. Why the drop-off in between? This was likely a region of subsidence, or sinking air. As the volcanic plume ascended rapidly, pockets of heated air and ash collided with the tropopause, or the 'ceiling' of the lower atmosphere; while some of the momentum probably continued upward, potentially injecting aerosols into the stratosphere, some of the momentum was reflected back downward. That created a local minimum in lightning activity. (Farther outward radially, it appears that the sinking air then heated up and began rising again.)\nAdvertisement\nThat was observed during the January 2022 eruption of the Tonga volcano Hunga Tonga, which by some reports sparked more than 400,000 lightning strikes.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nRuang's massive plume can be seen on infrared satellite; after the initial blast, notice the slightly lither colors, corresponding to warmer and lower cloud tops, on the west side of the plume. That's from subsidence, or sinking.\nThe summit of Raung stands 10,932 feet above sea level, with a caldera that's about 2 miles wide. Eruptions are relatively common, though explosions this high are rare.\nWhen volcanic aerosols make it into the stratosphere, they can have minute effects on Earth's climate. The stratosphere begins around 20,000 feet above the ground at the poles, but 60,000 feet or so in the tropics. Subsequently, it's too early to know how much material, if any, made it into the stratosphere, which is above the troposphere, or the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere.

            "summary": "This spring and summer, people in parts of the American Midwest and South will get to experience a numerically magnificent wildlife event: a rare double emergence of periodical cicadas. With the arrival of Brood XIX and Brood XIII, trillions of harmless, baby-carrot-size insects will be singing their hearts out from Wisconsin to Louisiana, Maryland to Georgia, and many places in between.\nThe last time these broods co-emerged, the year was 1803, Thomas Jefferson was president, and the Louisiana Purchase had just been completed — which means many of the states where cicada love songs will soon fill the air were not even officially part of the nation yet.\nAs impressive as that is, this year's entomological phenomenon will be extra-special for researchers hoping to unravel the evolutionary mysteries of bugs that only crawl out of the ground in roughly 13-year and 17-year intervals.\nAdvertisement\nBroods are not the same thing as species, and each brood can contain multiple cicada species that can emerge in different places. In 2024, all seven cicada species will be represented, a coincidence that won't happen again until 2037.\nThat means this year's emergence will be a data-collecting gold mine.\nOne of the more unusual mysteries scientists hope to investigate involves a parasitic fungus that attacks adult cicadas, turning them into what one expert calls 'flying saltshakers of death.'\n'So it's pretty spectacular, from the standpoint of a scientist that's interested in cicadas,' said Matt Kasson, a mycologist at West Virginia University.\nA life spent underground\nCicadas are true bugs in the insect family Hemiptera. Famous for their repetitive courtship calls, cicada adults are large, loud and highly conspicuous. But most of a cicada's life is spent below ground as a nymph.\nAdvertisement\nCicada nymphs are probably among the most underappreciated forest herbivores, since most of the time they're out of sight, making a living by sucking juices out of the roots of trees and other plants. They emerge in the spring or summer, when the soil about a foot below ground reaches 64 degrees. Nymphs then climb up the nearest vertical object and molt into their adult form. Those winged adults spend their brief but riotous lives mating and, for the females, laying eggs.\nCicadas can be broken into two general types: annual cicadas, which tend to have black or green eyes and can be heard every year, and periodical cicadas, which usually have red eyes and only emerge in 13-year or 17-year intervals.\nWhile they are nymphs, these long-lived insects must escape the cold by burrowing down below the frost line. In some parts of their range, such as Wisconsin, that can mean living at depths of more than five feet beneath the surface.\nAdvertisement\nThis makes every emergence important for scientists. If a researcher studying a species of zebra or puffin wants to take genetic samples, they may have to endure hostile environments or treacherous journeys, but at least those animals are almost guaranteed to be present in any given year. The same is not true for a given cicada species. They may technically be there, but they are too deep underground to find easily and to access without causing significant harm to the animals. (Kasson said he has tried, and he came up empty.)\nIn addition, cicada broods don't usually sync up; it's been nine years since such a thing last took place. And when they do overlap in time, they tend to be spread out in space, with emergences happening several states away from each other.\nThis means some questions can only be investigated in certain places at certain times, depending on which broods are on deck that year and which species they contain.\nAdvertisement\nThis year, though, cicadas from Brood XIX and Brood XIII will butt right up against each other, mostly in Illinois. And this is where things get scientifically exciting.\nA sprinkling of spores\nKasson hopes to study a cicada-afflicting parasite known as Massospora. When this fascinating fungus infects an adult cicada, it floods the insect with amphetamine and psilocybin, each of which appear to influence its behavior.\nhopes to study a cicada-afflicting parasite known as Massospora. When this fascinating fungus infects an adult cicada, it floods the insect with amphetamine and psilocybin, each of which appear to influence its behavior.\nFor instance, although the fungus has taken over the lower-third of its body, replacing its abdomen and genitals with fungal tissue, the cicada appears to feel no pain. Instead, infected cicadas seem to want to party.\n'There are some hypersexual behaviors,' Kasson said. 'The males pretend to be females to get other healthy males to come and attempt to mate with them. And that's probably a strategy by the fungus to increase the number of individuals that the fungus is able to infect.'\nAdvertisement\nThe parasite typically affects less than 5 percent of a given cicada population. But once infected, those chalky white abdomens sprinkle spores everywhere they go.\nKasson is trying to conduct genetic work to learn more about how the fungus persists in animals with such unusual and disjointed life cycles. This year he will be able collect contemporary samples from a 13-year brood for the first time — old, archived specimens have been used in the past — which could yield some interesting results.\n'Although we have limited data, some of the DNA sequence data from the 13-year broods are somewhat different from the 17-year broods, and it makes me wonder if there's actually some genetic differences in the strains,' he said.\nResearchers are also interested in the fungus as a source of new medicines, Kasson added. It has been used as a traditional form of medicine for inflammation among cultures in China and New Zealand's Maori.\nTime-shifted cicadas\nBecause Brood XIX and Brood XIII overlap in very few areas, it's unlikely that any locale will experience twice as many cicadas as usual. (With several million cicadas emerging per square acre, a doubling of that would be, well, intense.) It's also unlikely most people will notice a difference between broods in areas where the two are adjacent.\nAdvertisement\n'They look identical. They sound identical. And genetically, they're pretty much identical,' said Chris Simon, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Connecticut.\nThis is not always the case. For instance, Magicicada neotredecim is a 13-year cicada that will emerge this year as part of Brood XIX in Illinois. That species is nearly twice as large as Magicicada septendecula , which will also emerge as part of Brood XIII, appearing a little to the north in Illinois, as well as in Iowa and Wisconsin.\nMagicicada neotredecim is a 13-year cicada that will emerge this year as part of Brood XIX in Illinois. That species is nearly twice as large as Magicicada septendecula, which will also emerge as part of Brood XIII, appearing a little to the north in Illinois, as well as in Iowa and Wisconsin.\nFor scientists like Simon, the real opportunity is in much less obvious distinctions. She wants to learn more about how cicada broods count the years, something she's trying to understand by sequencing whole genomes and looking for genes or groups of genes that control whether a cicada follows the 13- or 17-year cycle.\nAdvertisement\n'One of the most interesting things is we thought that the year classes, or broods, were reproductively isolated, because we thought they had an exact life cycle, and the adults would never see each other,' Simon said. 'But it turns out, it's not exact, and sometimes they come out four years early, or four years late.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThis means that the different broods can still exchange genes with each other, likely to be driving further evolution of the species.\n'When 13- and 17-year cicadas come out in the same year, you can actually do hybridization experiments,' Simon said. The last time she had a chance to do such work was in 2015, and 1998 before that.\nSimon added that inexactitude in cicada timing is thought to be on the rise due to climate change, which is elongating the nymphs' growing season underground. Similarly, climate change can affect their distribution, as evidenced by Brood VI becoming more established in the Washington area in recent years, she said.\nAdvertisement\nSometimes, over the course of hundreds of thousands of years, 17-year cicada broods turn into 13-year cicada broods.\nOther scientists want to better understand how cicadas affect the plants they prey upon, as well as how trees defend themselves against the herbivores. Some studies show reduced growth in tree rings, for example, as well as lower yields in orchards, where cicadas are present.\nHowever, cicada emergences have ecological benefits, too, providing a smorgasbord of protein for predators, as well as boosts in phosphorus and nitrogen for plant life, thanks to trillions of decaying insect bodies. According to a study from 2005, cuckoos have more offspring in years following cicada emergences, while other bird species, such as crows, seem to fly away from the emergences, presenting yet another ecological enigma.\nIf you're out during this year's emergence and your dog or toddler happens to gulp down a cicada or three, don't worry about it, said Maureen Turcatel, collections manager of insects at the Field Museum in Chicago. Cicadas can't bite or sting, and they are perfectly edible.",

            "excerpt": "Regulators around the world want large banks — the 'too big to fail' banks — to hold more capital.",
            "summary": "It's a truth universally acknowledged that big banks resist when the government proposes more financial regulation. This familiar story is playing out once again as regulators around the world seek to impose higher capital requirements on systemically important banks — those deemed 'too big to fail.' This is a fancy way of saying they want banks to set aside larger rainy day funds so they won't need taxpayer bailouts in the next crisis. Prominent bankers argue there's no need for the proposed rules, known, arcanely, as Basel III endgame. JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon has called Basel III 'flawed and poorly calibrated.' Industry lobbyists claim banks will have less money to lend if they have to use it for their capital cushions.\nBig banks have made similar warnings every time regulators have called for higher capital requirements since the calamitous 2008 financial crisis. Yet the financial system is still flourishing. Loans remained widely accessible after past capital increases, economic research has found (though lately borrowers are struggling with high interest rates). Ratcheting up capital levels a bit now is wise given the uncertain geopolitical and economic climate. But it would probably be safe to increase them less than regulatory agencies — the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency — proposed last summer. The agencies' plan received a deluge of overwhelmingly negative public comments. In their final rule, U.S. regulators can come up with a compromise; and the ideal time to release it would be before the November elections.\nBankers do make one compelling argument: The financial world has changed dramatically in the past 15 years, but the Basil III endgame looks backward to problems like those that precipitated the 2008 crisis instead of focusing forward to new sources of risk.\nAdvertisement\nConsider Silicon Valley Bank's collapse a year ago. On paper, the bank had sufficient capital in the form of government bonds purchased before the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates. But it faced a run on deposits when it became apparent that those assets lost value as interest rates stayed high — which the bank had failed to anticipate. The Basel III endgame proposal rightly lowers the threshold for heightened scrutiny to $100 billion in assets as opposed to the previous standard of $250 billion in assets. (Silicon Valley Bank had about $209 billion just before its demise.) But the new rules emphasize operational risk at banks — the risk of losses from flaws in an institution's internal controls — not interest rate risk.\nFollow this author Editorial Board 's opinions\nFollow this author\nEditorial Board\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nAnother problem is that regulators are still not paying enough attention to the big players in the financial system that are not banks. Roughly half of global assets are now held in mutual funds, insurers, hedge funds and microfinance entities, up from 43 percent in 2008, according to the Financial Stability Board. Whereas regulators meet frequently with bank leaders and perform annual stress tests on large banks, which gives regulators a pretty good understanding of where the pitfalls and risks are, there's far less transparency in the non-bank sector. Hence its nickname: 'shadow banking.' This month, the International Monetary Fund warned that shadow banks could see 'large, unexpected losses in a downturn.' The Basel III endgame does essentially nothing to address that risk.\nAnd yet the heated debate over Basel III has diverted energy and attention from the issues around non-banks. In March, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell testified before Congress. Lawmakers from both parties asked repeatedly about his position on Basel III. Mr. Powell said he expected 'there will be broad and material changes to the proposal' and that he was 'confident' the final proposal would have broad support 'both at the Fed — and in the broader world.' In contrast, there were few questions about the growth of the non-bank sector and the novel risks it might pose. And in response to those queries, Mr. Powell played it safe, opining that regulators have to be smart about potential problems, without offering concrete ideas.\nAdvertisement",

            "summary": "Australia's Great Barrier Reef is experiencing one of its worst bleaching events since monitoring began nearly four decades ago, authorities say, with much of the famed reef showing signs of damage as warming ocean temperatures blight reefs worldwide.\nBleaching occurs when heat-stressed coral turn white after expelling symbiotic algae that provide food and color. It's a result of abnormal ocean temperatures in the past year that scientists worry could represent a major change to Earth systems.\nIn the Great Barrier Reef marine park, 73 percent of the reefs surveyed have prevalent bleaching — which means that more than 10 percent of the coral cover is bleached, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which manages the area, said Wednesday. Very high and extreme bleaching was observed across nearly 40 percent of the reef system.\nmarine park, 73 percent of the reefs surveyed have prevalent bleaching — which means that more than 10 percent of the coral cover is bleached, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which manages the area, said Wednesday. Very high and extreme bleaching was observed across nearly 40 percent of the reef system.\n'Climate change is the greatest threat to the Great Barrier Reef, and coral reefs globally,' said Roger Beeden, the authority's chief scientist. 'The Great Barrier Reef is an incredible ecosystem, and while it has shown its resilience time and time again, this summer has been particularly challenging.'\nThe dire update on Earth's largest reef system comes just days after scientists with the U.S.-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the International Coral Reef Initiative said anomalous ocean temperatures are afflicting reefs worldwide.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to NOAA scientists, the world is experiencing its fourth global bleaching event, and the second in the last decade. At least 53 countries and local regions have experienced mass bleaching across the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans, they said.\nOcean temperatures began building in the Great Barrier Reef area in late December and continued to rise throughout the Southern Hemisphere summer, causing 'the highest levels of thermal stress on record,' the marine park authority said.\nThe most intense and prolonged heat stress occurred at inshore reefs in the southern part of the marine park, with sea surface temperatures peaking at 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) above average.\nThis is the Great Barrier Reef's fifth major bleaching event in nine years. Scientists say it could be the biggest test yet of the 1,400-mile-long world wonder's ability to recover. For the first time, extreme bleaching — where more than 90 percent of coral cover on a reef is bleached — was observed in all three regions of the marine park.\n'Southernmost parts of the reef, which had been largely spared previously, have been hit particularly hard this time, with bleaching affecting many more species, extending to greater depths, and affecting some of the oldest and most resilient corals,' said Simon Bradshaw, a research director with the nonprofit Climate Council. 'This is a disaster at our doorstep.'\nThe giant reef system — which is so large it can easily be spotted from space — has bounced back from disturbances in the past, including underwater heat waves in 2016 and 2017 that triggered coral bleaching events so severe that scientists worried the reef would never look the same again.\nAdvertisement\nScientists say the recovery from those events was driven by fast-growing Acropora corals, which are more vulnerable to thermal stress and coral bleaching.\nAcropora corals, which are more vulnerable to thermal stress and coral bleaching.\n'The Great Barrier Reef has seen increases in coral cover to high levels in recent years, indicating it is still a resilient system. But this resilience has its limits,' said David Wachenfeld, research program director at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, a government agency.\nWachenfeld said the level of heat stress, and the results of the aerial surveys, indicate that the latest bleaching event is 'one of the most extensive' the reef has experienced since the agency began monitoring the reef nearly 40 years ago.",

They are alleged to have approached members of the European Parliament and offered them money to promote Russian propaganda.\nU.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a hidden campaign to influence the 2016 race in favor of Donald Trump over Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton, with Russian operatives hacking Democratic emails and facilitating their release in the run-up to the election.\nMore recently, they concluded that Putin had authorized influence operations in the 2020 election aimed at denigrating Joe Biden, boosting Trump, undermining confidence in the vote and exacerbating social divisions in the U.S. Trump and Putin have dismissed such findings.\nAdvertisement\nAsked which politicians might have been bribed in Europe, De Croo said: 'I don't want to be in a position where I have information about political opponents. If that were the case, it would not be a good thing. That could undermine the credibility of everything our security services are doing.\n'There is someone who is trying to influence, and there are people who allow themselves to be influenced, and when there is money involved, we must be able to take action,' he said at the summit, which is the last such meeting planned before the elections.\nDe Croo said that while the money had changed hands outside of Belgium, the political influence was happening in his country. Belgium currently holds the EU's rotating presidency and is home to the bloc's institutions as well as the headquarters of NATO.\nAdvertisement\nHe and Fiala want their partners to beef up the mandate of Europe's anti-fraud agency and the EU public prosecutors' office. De Croo warned that this could take time and pointed out that not all the bloc's member countries have signed up to the prosecutors' office.\n'We can't wait until after the elections to take action when we know that the results might be influenced,' De Croo said.\nDuring the summit, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola warned that 'Russia's attempts to skew narratives and strengthen pro-Kremlin sentiments … through disinformation are not anymore just a threat, but a possibility that we must be ready to counter.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nElections to the EU's assembly are held across the 27 member countries every five years.

            "summary": "The Smithsonian Institution has canceled events featuring a drag performer and conducted an 'audit' of past drag programming, following a December congressional hearing in which Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie G. Bunch III told representatives that he didn't think it was appropriate to 'expose children to drag shows.'\nProposed collaborations between the Smithsonian and environmentalist and drag artist Pattie Gonia were canceled or postponed three times, in December, January and March, according to Gonia and emails reviewed by The Washington Post. A Smithsonian spokesperson said that this was a result of 'budgetary constraints and other resource issues.'\nThe Smithsonian had three events involving drag in 2023, the institution said, and museums are still developing programming for this year's National Pride Month in June. Drag artists have routinely been involved in the institution's Pride programs since Bunch assumed the role of secretary in 2019.\nAdvertisement\nSkip to end of carousel\nThe Style section\nThe Style section Style is where The Washington Post covers happenings on the front lines of culture and what it all means, including the arts, media, social trends, politics and yes, fashion, all told with personality and deep reporting. For more Style stories, click here\nEnd of carousel\nInternal emails obtained by The Post show some employees concerned over potential censorship, and an institution sometimes drawn into public controversies despite its best efforts to avoid them. Some Smithsonian staff said Bunch's comments, responding to questions from Rep. Stephanie Bice (R-Okla.), left them fearful of future removal of LGBTQ+ voices and programming at the organization, according to the emails and interviews with current employees.\n'I, along with all senior leaders, take seriously the concerns expressed by staff and will continue to do so,' said Bunch in a statement. 'As we have reiterated, LGBTQ+ content is welcome at the Smithsonian.'\nSince Bunch's congressional appearance, two employee groups have emailed him expressing fears about the future of such programming. Bunch said he planned to meet with leaders of one of the groups, the Smithsonian Pride Alliance, in an email to them on Friday.\nAdvertisement\nOn Jan. 2, Bunch told the Pride Alliance leadership team that Bice's line of questioning in the hearing was 'asked in a suggestive way,' and his response was 'to immediately stress that the Smithsonian does not expose children to inappropriate content.' He added that he was 'committed to coming together to find understanding and bring hope through our work.'\nBunch commended the team's 'courageous outreach' and wrote that he has 'always stood as an ally to the LGBTQIA+ communities.'\n'Unfortunately, as you can imagine, a hearing setting does not give you ample time to expand,' Bunch wrote. 'If so, it would have given me the opportunity to speak more broadly about the merits and goals of our programming and content development and how we equip parents to make choices about what content their children experience.'\nAdvertisement\n'Above all, the comments hurt staff,' the four-person team wrote back on Jan. 5. 'It hurt the staff who work hard on these programs and the staff who feel as though our bit of culture is being left out of the American story, despite contributing so very much to it.'\nThe group said that attacks on drag often feel like a 'thinly veiled' attack on the larger LGBTQ+ community.\nThe Smithsonian Institution is staffed by federal employees, has congressional oversight and receives more than $1 billion in federal money annually, but is not a government agency. The nonprofit institution spans 21 museums, research facilities and the National Zoo, and describes itself as the world's largest 'museum, education, and research complex.'\nThe cancellation of drag events after the hearing was first reported by the New Republic. Despite its mission to be bipartisan, the Smithsonian Institution is sometimes pulled into political debate — and occasionally has changed course amid external pressure.\nAdvertisement\nPerhaps most controversially, then–Smithsonian Secretary G. Wayne Clough in 2010 removed a video by artist David Wojnarowicz — which contained a scene of ants crawling over a crucifix — from an art exhibition after Republican politicians threatened to cut the institution's budget. More recently, in March, the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Latino settled a lawsuit from a conservative activist over its internship program.\nLast year, shortly before the Smithsonian's Asian American Literature Festival was unexpectedly canceled, staff had flagged four programs that might be controversial, including two with LGBTQ+ themes (the Smithsonian said the content review was not related to the festival's cancellation).\nNow, the institution has been drawn into a raging partisan debate on drag events.\nAdvertisement\nAt the hearing on Dec. 12, Bice asked Bunch about the institution's events that included performers in drag.\nBice told Bunch that the Smithsonian hosted six drag events over the past three years — citing Pride Month events including a virtual storytelling and a virtual art bingo night as open to children — before asking him, in 'what culture is exposing children to overly sexual material appropriate?'\n'I think it's not appropriate to expose children to drag shows,' Bunch said. 'I'm surprised and I will look into that.'\nShe shifted her focus to a June 2023 event for New York Pride that featured four Indigenous drag artists. Bunch said the event was not geared toward children. 'Even if it's not to children,' she said, 'why are we talking about that issue?'\n'That is a small part of whatever we do, and the reality is that the Smithsonian is trying to make sure that it embraces the totality of who we are as Americans,' Bunch said, 'but this is not a major part of what we do at all.'\nIn 2023, the country saw a wave of legislation targeting LGBTQ+ Americans, including more anti-trans bills introduced in a four-month period than in the past four years combined. The ACLU has tracked 21 bills in the 2024 state legislative session that it says are aimed at drag performance.\nAdvertisement\nGonia was initially invited to be featured in an Orchid Festival at the National Portrait Gallery and a complimentary environmental study day. On Dec. 21, she was told by staff that the Orchid Festival had been canceled after a major partner dropped out.\nIn a January email, Smithsonian staff wrote they had canceled the study day because staff 'didn't have the time or resources to put together a program that met our standards.'\nIn March, Gonia was told a proposed social media collaboration with the institution was being put on hold.\nGonia, known offstage as Wyn Wiley, is a climate activist and one of the founders of the Outdoorist Oath, an educational climate nonprofit, and in 2021 was a guest at the Smithsonian's 'Futures Remixed' festival, appearing onstage next to Bunch, actor Kal Penn and ballroom pioneer Jack Mizrahi.\nAdvertisement\n'Bunch's testimony does wrong by all of Smithsonian's queer employees, current and future queer partners,' Gonia told The Post. 'People dream of working for the Smithsonian and it's been a safe space and place for joy for so many queer employees.'\nRuth Allen Ginsburg, a drag performer from Southern Maryland, partnered with the Smithsonian for storytelling events between 2020 and 2022. She wasn't surprised to hear that Smithsonian drag events had been called into question, but she was surprised to hear her name mentioned by Bice.\n'Congratulations, you are officially in the congressional record,' a friend texted her.\nGinsburg, 28, said that she had always loved working with the Smithsonian but that the testimony was 'disheartening.'\nOverall, she urged 'grace' for Bunch, the Smithsonian and anyone trying to have a 'real conversation.' Ginsburg said she doesn't 'harbor hate' for any of drag's critics, and hopes 'no one else does either.'\n'All I want to give them is an open door to say like, welcome to our world,' she said.\nA ‘drag audit'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nOn Jan. 22, Undersecretary Kevin Gover's executive assistant emailed museum directors asking for information on their drag show programming over the past three years.\nAdvertisement\nFollowing the 'recent visit to the hill' by the secretary, the Smithsonian had been asked follow-up questions, known as questions for the record, and to provide context to the institution's Office of Government Relations, his assistant wrote.

Gover was posing the same questions the institution received to Smithsonian leaders, in order to provide a complete response.\nSome employees began calling Gover's request a 'drag audit,' and again sent concerned emails to Smithsonian leadership. Leading the discussion was the Smithsonian Pride Alliance, which describes itself as the oldest LGBTQ+ resource group in the federal government, having formed in 1988 during the AIDS epidemic.

It's exciting to watch them jump between characters, molding their limbs, pitching or deepening their voices, taking on slouches and scowls and sighs, with such dexterity, often between lyrics.\n'Islander' was conceived by Amy Draper around 2017 and made a splash at the 2019 Edinburgh Fringe Festival before moving to an off-Broadway run and eventually embarking on its current North American and European tour. Its most visible theme — the grim fight to hold on to a thin slice of home on a planet threatened by a changing climate — speaks more forcefully now, perhaps, than when the musical was initially developed. But in a smaller, more specific way, 'Islander' is also about the little acts of care and kindness we show each other and a wholehearted belief in the power of community.\nThat's why, when Eilidh and Arran part, their bittersweet vow to reunite rings oddly hopeful. 'If the whales are still swimming,' Arran says.\n'If we're still here,' Eilidh replies.",

The independent study — led by physician Hilary Cass, the former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health — incorporates multiple systematic reviews 'to provide the best available collation of published evidence,' as well as interviews with clinicians, parents and young people, in reaching its conclusions.\nReferring to young people who have already been treated under these dubious circumstances, such as those at the Tavistock Centre's now-closed Gender Identity Development Service, Cass wrote, 'They deserve very much better.'\nAdvertisement\nIn the wake of the Cass Review's release — which has rocked the British medical and media establishment, and might soon reverberate in the United States — many are asking how we got here. How did clinicians come to recommend the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to thousands of children and adolescents when there was insufficient evidence that these treatments were safe and effective?\nPart of the reason is that 'the toxicity of the debate is exceptional,' as Cass notes in her foreword: 'There are few other areas of healthcare where professionals are so afraid to openly discuss their views, where people are vilified on social media, and where name-calling echoes the worst bullying behaviour. This must stop.'\nI know all too well how the absence of good-faith, healthy debate on this subject can affect clinicians and patients. When I was 15, a therapist affirmed my conviction that I was born in the wrong body. After more than a decade of hormonal and surgical interventions, I detransitioned at age 30. I had come to realize that my transition was motivated by my difficulty reconciling with being gay. Today, I am a licensed clinical social worker and board president of Therapy First, formerly the Gender Exploratory Therapy Association, a nonprofit organization that advocates psychotherapy as a first-line treatment for youth gender dysphoria.\nAdvertisement\nUsually in psychotherapy, treatment approaches are refined and improved by vigorous discussion, research and dissemination of new information. When it comes to youth gender treatments, though, professionals who raise concerns have been censored and subjected to reputational damage, threats to their license and doxing. As a result, countless gender nonconforming young people have been badly served.\nTherapy First has been the target of silencing and intimidation efforts. Now with a professional membership of more than 300 clinicians based in 36 states and 14 countries, we are joined in our concern regarding the quality of mental health care provided to gender dysphoric youth. Even though the organization is apolitical and non-religious, with many of our members being LGBT, we have been falsely linked to the religious right. Despite being strongly opposed to conversion therapy, or trying to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity, we have been accused of practicing it.\nWhat I've learned is that therapists who cite the poor quality of evidence in support of medical interventions for youth gender dysphoria, or who advocate traditional principles of psychotherapy in this area, are likely to be vilified — sometimes by fellow clinicians. Last week alone, eight complaints were filed against one of our members' licenses by other therapists for simply posting, on a professional Listserv, the link to one of our organization's webinars, on trauma-informed mind-body practices.\nAdvertisement\nAn activist website has labeled our therapists as part of the 'global anti-transgender movement' and listed details from their personal lives, including the names of their children and other family members. Last month in London, the Telegraph reported, a medical conference that explored evidence and heard from seasoned therapists and doctors regarding the treatment of gender dysphoria was interrupted by masked protesters who set off a smoke bomb and attempted to force their way into the building.\nIn addition to worrying about activists outside the consulting room, therapists apparently must now also be concerned about whether their patients are wielding hidden cameras. This month, an undercover video recording of a therapy session was posted online, presenting the clinician as a practitioner of conversion therapy, yet the would-be video sting merely revealed a clinician engaged in normal therapeutic exploration. In the current climate, any therapeutic response other than immediate affirmation is considered transphobic.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nIt isn't right that professionals must risk their livelihood and reputation to help young people struggling with gender dysphoria. If the culture of bullying persists, I fear that fewer clinicians with a developmental approach will be inclined to keep working with this population. These young people will be left with clinicians who aren't following the science, many with good intentions, but others who might behave more like activists than mental health professionals.",

            "summary": "QUITO, Ecuador — Ecuador on Tuesday began to ration electricity in the country's main cities as a drought linked to the El Niño weather pattern depletes reservoirs and limits output at hydroelectric plants that produce about 75% of the nation's power.\nThe power cuts were announced on Monday night by the ministry of energy, which said in a statement that it would review its decision on Wednesday night.\n'We urge Ecuadorians to cut their electricity consumption in this critical week,' the statement read. 'And consider that each kilowatt and each drop of water that are not consumed will help us face this reality.'\nThe power cuts in Ecuador come days after dry weather forced Colombia's capital city of Bogotá to ration water as its reservoirs reached record lows, threatening local supplies of tap water.\nAdvertisement\nIn the town of La Calera, on the outskirts of Bogotá, water trucks visited neighborhoods where water has been scarce recently because a local stream that supplies the town with water is drying up. Local residents lined up outside the water trucks with buckets to collect as much as they could carry.\n'I'm worried about what's happening,' said Carlos Arturo Rueda, a 72-year-old who was gathering water from the truck. 'We need to do more to preserve this precious liquid.'\nPrecipitation has diminished in Ecuador and Colombia this year due to warming temperatures in the south Pacific Ocean, which can cause floods along South America's west coast but can also generate intense droughts in the Andean valleys, where many of Ecuador's and Colombia's main cities are located.\nIn Colombia, where hydroelectric plants are also struggling, officials said on Tuesday that they are considering awarding tax credits to companies that reduce their electricity consumption.\nAdvertisement\nDuring the first week of April Colombia suspended electricity exports to Ecuador in an attempt to save energy for domestic needs. Colombia gets around 70% of its electricity from hydroelectric plants.\nCamilo Prieto, a climate change professor at Bogotá's Javeriana University, said that the current spell of dry weather is not as extreme as previous droughts related to El Niño, such as a drought that caused power cuts in Colombia in the early 1990s. But he added that demand for electricity has grown over the years in Colombia and Ecuador, while these countries have made the 'mistake' of continuing to rely on hydroelectric power.\n'The world has learned that an energy mix that is diverse and combines different kinds of low-emission sources is safer and more reliable,' Prieto said. 'If demand continues to grow and the energy mix in these countries is not diversified, they will continue to be vulnerable.'\nAdvertisement\nOn Tuesday newspapers around Ecuador published schedules for power cuts in cities that included Quito, Cuenca and Guayaquil, where most homes and many businesses were left without power for three hours.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nEcuador had also experienced power cuts, related to droughts in October, January and February.\nKaren Verduga, the owner of a restaurant with six employees in Quito, said that she was afraid some of her frozen meats and vegetables would decompose if the current round of power cuts continues.\nShe said that her workers could not use blenders to make soups and sauces. Instead they were preparing food manually for several hours. 'We've been forced to do things the old fashioned way,' Verduga said.\nSome merchants said the power cuts provided them with opportunities.\nOriannis Arcano, a saleswoman at a small candle shop, said that the blackouts have helped to boost her sales. Yet, she said the blackouts presented problems for her business because 'most people want to pay with cards' that don't work when there's no electricity.\nAdvertisement\nDuring an event in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, President Daniel Noboa said that some power plants in the country had been 'sabotaged' by his political rivals. Ecuador is set to hold a referendum Sunday where some of Noboa's security policies will be voted on, including a proposal to legalize the extradition of drug traffickers and other dangerous criminals.\nNoboa did not provide any evidence of the alleged acts of sabotage, but said investigations will be launched. He also wrote a message on X, formerly Twitter, asking Ecuador's energy minister to resign.\n'Threats to our country require strong decisions,' Noboa wrote in the message where he also said that the nation's government will subsidize electricity bills in April. 'The people of Ecuador cannot pay for the corruption and inefficiency of a few miserable' officials.\n___\nRueda reported from Bogotá\n___",

            "summary": "BEIJING — Europe wants two things from China: First, a shift in its relatively pro-Russia position on the war in Ukraine. Second, a reduction in the trade imbalance — Chinese goods exports to the EU exceeded its imports from the 27-nation bloc by 291 billion euros ($310 billion) last year.\nIt's not clear if it will get very far on either front.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz became the latest European leader to leave China with promises to talk but little more. The Chinese statements on his meetings in Beijing this week didn't appear to give ground on the issues that divide the EU and China.\nThere is some reason for hope in Europe. China badly wants foreign investment to boost its sluggish economy. And China has made efforts to mend its relationships from Europe to the United States and Australia, despite its differences with them.\nAdvertisement\nBut those considerations may not outweigh the larger strategic reasons China has for aligning itself with Russia as it seeks an alternative to the U.S.-led global order and for promoting its green energy companies as it tries to build the nation into a technology leader.\nA EUROPEAN DIVIDE ON TARIFFS\nBoth the EU and the U.S. are complaining that Chinese policies to promote green energy have incentivized companies to build too much manufacturing capacity for electric cars, solar panels and other related products.\nLow-priced exports have taken a toll on solar companies in Europe and America and pose a potential threat to other industries. The EU launched an investigation last fall into Chinese subsidies and could impose tariffs on electric vehicles exported from China.\nChina has agreed to talks on production capacity with the U.S. but remained steadfast in defending its exports of green energy products. They have 'not only enriched global supply and eased global inflationary pressure, but also made an important contribution to the global response to climate change and the green and low-carbon transition,' Chinese leader Xi Jinping told Scholz.\nAdvertisement\nOvercapacity is also a problem for China. Experts have called for better policy coordination. so that not every province promotes the same industries. While that may avoid future problems, it won't reduce existing overcapacity.\nNot everyone in Europe agrees that tariffs would be a good thing. China is a major market for many European companies, and some fear tariffs could trigger a trade war.\nThe German Chamber of Commerce said it would like the focus to be on further opening Chinese markets to German companies. In line with that thinking, Scholz called for a reliable legal system, the protection of intellectual property and equal market access for foreign firms in China.\nThese issues have taken on increased importance as Chinese companies emerge as innovation leaders in key technologies. A recent Chamber survey of German companies found that 5% viewed Chinese competitors as innovation leaders, with 11% doing so in the auto sector.\nAdvertisement\n'This is really a new topic,' said Maximilian Butek, executive director of the German Chamber of Commerce in East China. 'And if those highly competitive companies are still protected by the government, then we have actually global challenges resulting from that.'\nA FUNDAMENTAL DIVIDE ON UKRAINE\nIf there is one issue most of Europe can agree on, it is the hope that China would lean on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the invasion of Ukraine, now in its third year with no sign of letting up.\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said three weeks ago in Beijing that he had asked Chinese leaders 'to put their considerable weight ... on Russia to influence the course of events.' Five days later, French Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourné said after meeting his Chinese counterpart that France expects China to pass on clear messages to Russia on Ukraine.\nAdvertisement\nThis week it was Scholz's turn. 'China's word carries weight in Russia,' he said. 'So I asked President Xi to bear upon Russia so that Putin finally breaks off his insane campaign, withdraws his troops and ends this terrible war.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe problem is that Europe and China have fundamentally different starting points. Europe, together with the United States, says Russia is in the wrong and should pull its forces back and leave Ukraine. China doesn't blame Russia, and says any peace settlement would need to address Russia's concerns as well as those of Ukraine and the West.\nChina has undercut Western sanctions by continuing to trade with Russia, and Scholz and others have expressed concern about reports that Chinese companies are selling 'dual-use' items that help Russia build military hardware. China has blamed the U.S. and others for prolonging the fighting by supplying armaments to Ukraine.\nAdvertisement\n'China has not provided weapons to either side, and it is China's right to maintain normal economic and trade relations with Russia,' said Ding Chun, the director of the Center for European Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.\nThe Chinese government shares the desire of others to see an end to the fighting but seems unlikely to pressure Russia to pull out. The Chinese statement on the Xi-Scholz talks did not address the German leader's request.\n___",

The Rock Creek course renovation is expected to cost $25 million to $35 million, said Will Smith, a co-founder of the trust.\nRepresentatives of 20 environmental groups, including Casey Trees and the Sierra Club's D.C. chapter, signed a letter to the Park Service last fall calling the plans for the renovation a 'cause for alarm.' and noting that stakeholders, including neighbors and community organizations, had not been notified when the Park Service first posted the proposal on its website.\nincluding neighbors and community organizations, had not been notified when the Park Service first posted the proposal on its website.\n'At a time when the District is losing tree canopy while simultaneously feeling the ever-growing impacts of a changing climate, we should be prioritizing retention of our city's mature forests and natural ecosystems,' the letter stated.\nAdvertisement\nMark Buscaino, executive director of Casey Trees, a nonprofit created to protect and enhance the tree canopy in the District, said Wednesday in a statement that the organization was discouraged that the plan was going forward unchanged despite being 'widely opposed by DC residents and over 20 local community organizations.'\n'We're pleased that the golf course is getting some much-needed attention; however, we're saddened that the plans require the removal of hundreds of arboreal giants that have graced the park for a hundred years or more,' Buscaino said. 'We encourage NPS and NLT to prioritize Rock Creek's natural resources for the long-term benefit of the golf course, its patrons, and the community.'\nIn its statement announcing the approval, the Park Service said it 'understands the concerns about the number of trees to be removed and carefully reviewed all comments received during the extended public comment period.

It is the least-played of Washington's public courses and fell into disrepair over the last 20 years. A number of holes became unplayable, and the greens and fairways were often in poor condition.\nIn an interview Wednesday, Smith said that when completed, the new course layout 'is going to be playable and fun. It's going to require good players to think their way around the golf course while allowing beginner and novice players an opportunity to advance the ball, find their ball, and really play the golf course.'\nHe said efforts would be made to keep the course open and operating after the construction project begins in November but said there would be periods it may need to be closed.

'But it is what is necessary in order to have a viable, sustainable golf course and golf course facility that will be economically viable, that will allow us to be able to manage the forest and, over the long term, actually increase tree canopy on the site.'",

            "summary": "DALLAS — The United Auto Workers' overwhelming election victory at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee is giving the union hope that it can make broader inroads in the South, the least unionized part of the country.\nThe UAW won a stunning 73% of the vote at VW after losing elections in 2014 and 2019. It was the union's first win in a Southern assembly plant owned by a foreign automaker.\nUnion President Shawn Fain said the pundits all told him that the UAW couldn't win in the South.\n'But you all said, ‘Watch this,' ' he told a cheering group of VW organizers at a union hall in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on Friday night, when the UAW victory was clear. 'You guys are leading the way. We're going to carry this fight on to Mercedes and everywhere else.'\nHowever, the UAW is likely to face a tougher test as it tries to represent workers at two Mercedes-Benz plants in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. A five-day election is scheduled to start May 13, where the union's campaign has already become heated.\nAdvertisement\nThe UAW has accused the German carmaker of violating U.S. and German labor laws with aggressive anti-union tactics, which the company denies.\n'They are going to have a much harder road in work sites where they are going to face aggressive management resistance and even community resistance than they faced in Chattanooga,' said Harry Katz, a labor-relations professor at Cornell University. 'VW management did not aggressively seek to avoid unionization. Mercedes is going to be a good test. It's the deeper South.'\nLate last year, the UAW announced a drive to represent nearly 150,000 workers at non-union factories largely in the South. The union is targeting U.S. plants run by Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, Subaru, Mazda, Volkswagen, Mercedes, BMW and Volvo, along with factories operated by electric-vehicle makers Tesla, Rivian and Lucid.\nAdvertisement\nMany of those companies raised pay after the UAW negotiated rich new contracts with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis after strikes at strategically chosen factories last year.\nBrooke Benoit, a VW worker who had seen the union voted down in Chattanooga twice before, said workers took notice.\n'I think what changed the most is everybody started seeing what we could get when the Big Three went on strike,' she said. 'They said, ‘Wait, hold on. If they can get all this, we should too.' We do the same job, just in a different location.'\nThe union's last defeat at VW in Chattanooga came at a low-water mark — in the middle of a federal investigation into bribery and embezzlement under a previous president.\nMarick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University in Detroit who studies the UAW, said the union flipped the script by installing new leadership, touting the rich contracts it won last year from Detroit automakers after strikes at targeted factories, and exploiting a climate that is now more favorable to unions. He said the union was also adept at translating signed pro-union authorization cards into votes — partly by pushing for a quick election.\nAdvertisement\n'Now the public and media eyes are going to be on Chattanooga and how quickly the UAW can translate this into a contract,' he said. If the union can't quickly get a good contract, it risks losing some of the momentum it gained with Friday's election win, he said.\nUnions in other industries are already moving ahead with organizing campaigns in the South and trying to learn from the UAW's playbook.\nThe Association of Flight Attendants, which has tried and failed to win over cabin crews at Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, hopes to collect enough signatures to force another election at Delta by year end. The union's president, Sara Nelson, said she was not surprised at the UAW win after strikes that led to record contracts last year.\n'I've been talking about this for a long time — that strikes and taking on the boss is going to spur organizing, and that's exactly what we saw here,' Nelson said.\nAdvertisement\nNelson is trying to secure an industry-leading contract at United Airlines that she can use to court Delta crews. In the meantime, crews at startup Breeze Airways, many of whom live in the South, will vote next month whether to join her union.\nThe White House issued a statement from President Joe Biden congratulating the UAW. Biden — who joined a UAW picket line in Michigan during the union's strike against Ford, GM and Stellantis plants last year — praised the success of unions representing autoworkers, Hollywood actors and writers, health care workers and others in gaining better contracts.\n'Together, these union wins have helped raise wages and demonstrate once again that the middle-class built America and that unions are still building and expanding the middle class for all workers,' Biden said.\nAdvertisement\nBiden criticized six Southern Republican governors, including Bill Lee of Tennessee, who told autoworkers this week that voting for union representation would jeopardize jobs.\nSharon Block, a law professor at Harvard University who worked in the Biden Labor Department, said the governors' warning rang hollow after nonunion Tesla revealed that it plans to lay off 10% of its workers after disappointing sales results. She said VW workers saw the governors' open letter as 'an empty threat and a cynical ploy,' and they ignored it.\n'Workers for a long time have been told that you can't organize in the South. And many workers, even not in the South, may work in industries where they've been told for a long time you can't organize,' Block said. 'What the UAW showed last night is that we need to go and rethink all those negative statements.'\n___",

            "summary": "The Biden administration on Monday announced new rules intended to protect the privacy of patients seeking abortions, and the health workers who may have provided them, from Republican prosecutors who have threatened to crack down on the procedure.\nThe rules strengthen a nearly 30-year-old health privacy law — known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA — to offer more robust legal protections to those who obtain or provide reproductive health care in a state where it is legal to do so. The final policy prohibits physicians, insurers and other health-care organizations from disclosing health information to state officials for the purposes of conducting an investigation, filing a lawsuit or prosecuting a patient or provider. It covers women who cross state lines to legally terminate a pregnancy and those who qualify for an exception to their state's abortion ban, such as in cases of rape, incest or a medical emergency.\nUnder previous rules, organizations were allowed to disclose private medical information to law enforcement in certain cases, such as a criminal investigation. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services said they had heard from patients and providers who were confused about their legal risks or had even deferred care amid GOP threats in the nearly two dozen states with abortion restrictions.\nAdvertisement\n'People feel scared to confide in their providers. People are worried in this new climate about how their medical information might be used,' said Melanie Fontes Rainer, director of the civil rights office at HHS, which revamped the rules. 'The goal here is to reinstate trust into the provider medical relationship. … The goal here is that people don't stay home if they're too scared to get care.'\nMonday's announcement is the latest effort by the Biden administration intended to safeguard reproductive health care, a central element of President Biden's reelection bid. However, the swell of criminal prosecutions that many abortion rights advocates and Democrats feared hasn't materialized since the Supreme Court's ruling nearly two years ago in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , which overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated the constitutional right to abortion. State abortion bans explicitly exempt those seeking abortions from prosecution.\nDobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated the constitutional right to abortion. State abortion bans explicitly exempt those seeking abortions from prosecution.\nBut doctors can face steep fines and jail time, and many health workers have said they are confused about the current legal landscape governing abortion access, such as whether a federal emergency care law takes priority over state abortion bans, as the Biden administration has argued. HHS and reproductive rights advocates have also cited cases such as the arrest of Brittany Watts as examples of the need for stronger privacy protections. Watts, an Ohio medical receptionist, has said she miscarried at home last year and told a nurse, who then reported the situation to police.\nAdvertisement\nSome GOP leaders have insisted they need access to patients' reproductive health information to ensure that their states' abortion restrictions are effective. Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita (R) this month said his state's terminated pregnancy reports, which offer some identifying information about individual abortions, should be released as public records.\nNineteen Republican attorneys general last year bashed the Biden administration's efforts to overhaul HIPAA as unnecessary and unconstitutional.\nBiden officials have 'pushed a false narrative that States are seeking to treat pregnant women as criminals or punish medical personnel who provide lifesaving care,' the attorneys general wrote in a June 2023 letter to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. 'Based on this lie, the Administration has sought to wrest control over abortion back from the people in defiance of the Constitution and Dobbs .'\nDobbs.'\nAdvertisement\nThe White House has countered that federal privacy laws were insufficient for a post- Roe world.\nRoe world.\nUnder new state abortion restrictions, 'it's going to be a crime, which means that it is very likely if law enforcement requests your personal and private medical records, they may be entitled to receive them,' Vice President Harris said at an administration meeting on reproductive health care last year. 'Part of the conversation that we are having today is what we can do … to reinforce protections for patients' privacy.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nFontes Rainer said the effort is personal to her. The HHS civil rights official said she was pregnant last year with twins before miscarrying and needing an abortion.\n'It is my absolute duty to share my story, and to do everything I can to [help] the millions of women across the country who don't have a voice,' Fontes Rainer said in an interview Sunday, adding that her office worked 'pretty quickly' to overhaul the federal health privacy rules.",

            "summary": "BAGHDAD — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was set to make his first official visit to Iraq in more than a decade on Monday as his country seeks greater cooperation from Baghdad in its fight against a Kurdish militant group that has a foothold in northern Iraq.\nOther issues also loom large between the two countries, including water supply issues and exports of oil and gas from northern Iraq to Turkey, which have been halted for more than a year.\nErdogan's last visit to Iraq was in 2011, when he was Turkey's prime minister.\nIraqi government spokesperson Bassem al-Awadi said in a statement that Erdogan's visit will be a 'major starting point in Iraqi-Turkish relations' and will include the signing of a deal on a 'joint approach to security challenges' and a 'strategic agreement on the water file,' among other issues.\nAdvertisement\nErdogan has said his country plans to launch a major operation against the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, a Kurdish separatist movement banned in Turkey and with operations in Iraq, during the summer, with the aim of 'permanently' eradicating the threat it poses.\nTurkey has carried out numerous ground offensives against the group in northern Iraq in the past while Turkish jets frequently target suspected PKK targets in the region.\nAnkara now aims to create a 30- to 40-kilometer (19 to 25-mile) deep security corridor along the joint border with Iraq, Turkish Defense Minister Yasar Guler told journalists last month.\nThe group, whose fight for an autonomous Kurdish state in southeast Turkey has claimed tens of thousands of lives since the 1980s, is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies.\nAdvertisement\nBaghdad has complained in the past that Turkish operations against the PKK violate its sovereignty, but appears to be coming closer to Ankara's stance.\nIn March, after a meeting between the Iraqi and Turkish foreign ministers, Baghdad announced that the Iraqi National Security Council had issued a ban on the PKK, although it stopped short of designating it as a terrorist organization.\nThe two countries issued a joint statement in which they said the group represents a 'security threat to both Turkey and Iraq' and that its presence on Iraqi territory was a 'violation of the Iraqi Constitution.'\nIraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani told journalists during a visit to Washington last week that Iraq and Turkey have 'true interests with one another and common projects.' He noted that the PKK has long had a presence in northern Iraq, 'but we are not allowing any armed group to be on Iraqi territory and using it as a launch pad for attacks.'\nAdvertisement\nAnkara has argued that the presence of PKK bases poses a threat to the planned construction of a major trade route, the Iraq Development Road, that would connect the port of Grand Faw in Basra, southern Iraq, to Turkey and Europe through a network of rail lines and highways.\nBaghdad might take a similar approach to the PKK as it has taken to Iranian Kurdish dissident groups based in northern Iraq.\nThe presence of the Iranian dissidents had become a point of tension with Tehran, which periodically launched airstrikes on their bases in Iraq. Last summer, Iran and Iraq reached an agreement to disarm the dissident groups and relocate their members from military bases to displacement camps.\nTalks between Erdogan and Iraqi officials are also expected to focus on energy cooperation as well as the possible resumption of oil flow through a pipeline to Turkey.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAdvertisement\nA pipeline running from the semiautonomous Kurdish region to Turkey has been shut down since March 2023, after an arbitration court ruling ordered Ankara to pay Iraq $1.5 billion for oil exports that bypassed the Iraqi central government. The sharing of oil and gas revenues has long been a contentious issue between Baghdad and Kurdish authorities in Irbil.\nWater rights are also likely to be a key issue on the table.\nThe Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which provide most of Iraq's fresh water, originate in Turkey. In recent years, Iraqi officials have complained that dams installed by Turkey are reducing Iraq's water supply. Experts fear that climate change is likely to exacerbate existing water shortages in Iraq, with potentially devastating consequences.\nMustafa Hassan, a resident of Baghdad said that he hopes that Erdogan's visit 'will help to solve problems related to water, because Iraq is suffering from a water scarcity crisis, and this affects agriculture.'\n___",

            "summary": "To cut costs and carbon emissions, cargo ships are putting a new spin on an ancient technology: the sail.\nThese aren't the sailboats of yore. Modern sails look more like airplane wings, smokestacks or balloons, and they use artificial intelligence to catch the wind with little help from mariners who long ago forgot the art of hoisting a mainsail.\nSails can reduce an existing ship's fuel consumption — and greenhouse emissions — by something like 10 or 20 percent, according to maritime experts, making them an attractive option for ship owners looking to cut costs or comply with environmental regulations.\nShips burn some of the world's dirtiest fuels and generate roughly 3 percent of global emissions, a share that's only expected to rise over time, according to the United Nations. The European Union created a cap-and-trade system for shipping emissions earlier this year, and the U.N. International Maritime Organization is finalizing its own emissions rules now that would penalize the owners of dirty vessels.\nAdvertisement\nRather than sending those dirty vessels to the scrapyard, companies can install sails to clean up some of their emissions and extend their ships' lives. And as the industry eventually moves toward alternative fuels that are low-carbon but high-cost, saving money on fuel will become even more important.\nThere are now 39 large commercial ships with sails, according to the International Windship Association, an industry group that represents sailmakers, ship owners and ship designers. That's a drop in the bucket compared to the roughly 100,000 cargo ships plying the seas, but the technology seems poised to take off as sails move from test projects to real-world use. Sailmakers are building new factories to meet the expected demand.\n'We're at an inflection point,' said Matthew Collette, a professor of naval architecture and marine engineering at the University of Michigan. 'We're going to see this coming very quickly to a larger number of ships.'\nAdvertisement\nHere are some of the strange sails that may one day push your online orders across the seas.\nShips with wings\nOne of the most versatile sail designs looks and works a lot like an airplane wing.\n'All we've done is taken that wing and put it vertically,' said John Cooper, CEO of BAR Technologies, a company that manufactures this type of sail, 'so instead of creating lift, we're creating thrust.'\nOn an airplane, wind flows over the wings and creates air pressure differences that push the plane up. On a ship, the wings works the same way — except they're angled to push the ship forward.\nThe wings come with sensors that measure weather conditions, and they automatically change their angle and shape to catch the wind. These sails can typically be used for most of a voyage, but they fold down to the deck if the wind blows faster than 30 knots, or when the ship is docking or loading cargo.\nAdvertisement\nLast year, BAR Technologies installed two of its wings on a 43,000-ton ship designed to carry dry bulk cargo such as grains, coal or minerals. Over its first six months, the ship saved 14 percent on fuel as it crisscrossed the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans, according to the ship's owner.\nThe return of the rotor sail\nAt first glance, rotor sails may look like smokestacks rising from the deck, but they're actually tall, rotating cylinders that use wind to push a ship forward.\nWhen the wind is blowing at the right angle, an electrical motor spins the rotor sails, speeding up the air flow on one side of the sail and slowing it down on the other. That creates an air pressure difference that pushes the ship forward.\nNorsepower, the biggest rotor sail manufacturer, says they typically help ships save 8 to 10 percent on fuel.\nAdvertisement\nRotor sails are more than a century old; German inventor Anton Flettner patented the idea in 1922 and an experimental cargo ship fitted with rotor sails crossed the Atlantic in 1926. But Norsepower, which is based in Finland, says the sails have come a long way since then, thanks to lightweight composite materials and AI systems that adjust to the wind to make the sails more efficient.\n'We can make a much better sail than Mr. Flettner did in the 1920s,' said Tuomas Riski, Norsepower's CEO.\nThe Michelin Man sail\nMichelin is developing a more experimental inflatable sail which, appropriately, looks a lot like the company's mascot.\nMichelin's design works similarly to a classic sail, made to catch the wind and redirect its power forward. The main difference is that its sail is made of inflatable fabric instead of a canvas sheet, and its mast can retract down to the deck. The sail can change its size depending on wind conditions.",

            "summary": "MADISON, Wis. — Lake sturgeon don't need Endangered Species Act protections, federal wildlife officials announced Monday, saying that stocking programs have helped the prehistoric fish return to areas where they had vanished.\nThe decision ends the Arizona-based Center of Biological Diversity's petition filed in May 2018 asking the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list lake sturgeon as endangered or threatened. Such listings would make harvesting the fish illegal, but without them, popular sturgeon harvest seasons in states such as Wisconsin and Michigan can continue.\nThe center argued that overharvesting and deteriorating habitat have 'severely depleted' the species. Dams block access to spawning and rearing habitat and water pollution and diversions have done 'irreparable harm,' the center said.\nAdvertisement\n'This is a disappointing decision because though some populations are well managed, overall the lake sturgeon has suffered a drastic decline,' said Tierra Curry, a senior scientist at the center. 'Endangered Species Act protection would bring a comprehensive recovery plan and ongoing funding to restore these iconic fish across their former range.'\nChuck Traxler, the wildlife service's Midwest deputy regional director, said stocking has helped grow adult lake sturgeon populations and increase spawning, agency officials said. Putting the creatures on the list would be like going to the emergency room, and the rebounding species doesn't need that level of protection, said\n'It doesn't mean everything is good right now,' he said. 'It means keep up the good work.'\nPopulations aren't at historical highs, the agency acknowledged in a December assessment, but stocking returned them to the Red River of the North between Minnesota and North Dakota, the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers, portions of the Mississippi River and the Coosa River.\nAdvertisement\nDam removals and habitat restoration efforts also have helped, the agency has said, citing work in 2015 to retrofit a dam on Wisconsin's Menominee River to allow spawning sturgeon to travel upstream and the removal of the Brecksville Dam on Ohio's Cuyahoga River in 2020.\nThe agency also pointed to reef restoration work in the corridor connecting Lake Huron and Lake Erie that has created a place for sturgeon to lay eggs and noted that nine of 43 toxic spots along Great Lakes shorelines have been cleaned up.\nThe assessment also noted the adaptable species should be able to withstand warmer water due to climate change.\nLake sturgeon are ancient North American freshwater fish. They're essentially living fossils, first appearing about 136 million years ago when dinosaurs ruled the planet. They resemble torpedoes, with dorsal ridges and snouts. They can grow up to 7 feet (2 meters) long and weigh up to 300 pounds (136 kilograms). Males typically live about 50 years. Females can live anywhere between 80 and 150 years.\nAdvertisement\nThey're found in the upper and lower Mississippi River basin as well as the Great Lakes. Commercial anglers considered lake sturgeon a nuisance because they tore their nets, leading to widespread over-harvesting in the 1800s that continued into the 20th century.\nLake sturgeon can't reproduce fast enough to replace the losses. It takes up to three decades before they reach spawning age, and even then they don't spawn annually. And many don't survive the trip back to their birth waters to spawn. The wildlife service has compared lake sturgeon losses to the mass destruction of the American buffalo.\nTwenty states have outlawed sturgeon harvesting. Fourteen of those states have listed lake sturgeon as threatened or endangered. Volunteers and Wisconsin natural resources officials have been guarding spawning sturgeon from poachers on the Wolf River for 30 years.\nAdvertisement\nMichigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin still hold hook-and-line lake sturgeon fishing seasons. Michigan and Wisconsin hold sturgeon spearing seasons each winter as well where anglers drill holes through lake ice and impale sturgeon as they swim past.\nThe Wisconsin natural resources department reported 432 sturgeon were taken in February, down from 1,405 in 2023. Warm weather and poor ice conditions led to the diminished return, according to the department. Michigan officials set the total harvest limit at just six sturgeon but ended up canceling due to warm weather and unsafe ice conditions.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThose states' seasons are so tightly regulated that the harvests don't impact the species overall, said Lori Nordstrom, the wildlife service's Midwest assistant regional director of ecological services.\nMichigan and Wisconsin, for example, allow an angler to take only one sturgeon per year. Minnesota anglers must release any sturgeon they catch in inland waters. Wisconsin regulations are designed to keep the harvest rate below 5%, with all tag fees going to the state's sturgeon conservation program, according to the wildlife service.\nAdvertisement\nLeaders of Sturgeon for Tomorrow, a nonprofit organization that works to rehabilitate sturgeon in Wisconsin and Michigan and supports harvesting the fish, praised the wildlife service's decision Monday. They said the ruling enables the states to continue managing sturgeon and allows harvesting to continue, which in turn helps researchers learn more about the ancient creatures.",

It will be dismantled after the Games and trucked from the Olympic race venue in Paris' high-rise business district to Sevran, a Paris-area town with less glitter and wealth. There, the pieces will be bolted back together and — voila ! — Kebbi and her swim team will have a new Olympic-sized pool to splash around in.\n'It's incredible !' she says. 'I hope it's going to bring us luck,' adds her mother, Nora.\nIn 100 days as of Wednesday, the Paris Olympics will kick off with a wildly ambitious waterborne opening ceremony. But the first Games in a century in France's capital won't be judged for spectacle alone. Another yardstick will be their impact on disadvantaged Paris suburbs, away from the city-center landmarks that are hosting much of the action.\nAdvertisement\nBy promising socially positive and also less polluting and less wasteful Olympics, the city synonymous with romance is also setting itself the high bar of making future Games generally more desirable.\nCritics question their value for a world grappling with climate warming and other emergencies. Potential host cities became so Games-averse that Paris and Los Angeles were the only remaining candidates in 2017 when the International Olympic Committee selected them for 2024 and 2028, respectively.\nAdvertisement\nVirtuous Summer Games in Paris could help the long-term survival of the IOC's mega-event.\nSPREADING BENEFITS BEYOND CENTRAL PARIS\nThe idea that the July 26-Aug. 11 Games and Aug. 28-Sept. 8 Paralympics should benefit disadvantaged communities in the Seine-Saint-Denis region northeast of Paris was built from the outset into the city's plans.\nSeine-Saint-Denis is mainland France's poorest region. Thanks to generations of immigration, it also is vibrantly diverse, counting 130 nationalities and more than 170 languages spoken by its 1.6 million inhabitants. For Seine-Saint-Denis kids facing racial discrimination and other barriers, sports are sometimes a route out. World Cup winner Kylian Mbappé honed his silky soccer skills as a boy in the Seine-Saint-Denis town of Bondy.\nOnce heavily industrialized, Seine-Saint-Denis became grim and scary in parts after many jobs were lost. Rioting rocked its streets in 2005 and again last year. Members of an Islamic extremist cell that killed 130 people in the French capital in 2015 hid after the carnage in an apartment in the town of Saint-Denis and were killed in a shootout with heavily armed SWAT teams. That drama unfolded just a 15-minute walk from the Olympic stadium that will host track and field and rugby and the closing ceremonies.\nAdvertisement\nConcretely, the Games will leave a legacy of new and refurbished sports infrastructure in Seine-Saint-Denis, although critics say the investment still isn't enough to catch it up with better equipped, more prosperous regions.\nMamitiana Rabarijaona grew up close to the Olympic stadium, built originally for the 1998 soccer World Cup. He says it didn't provide much of a boost for Seine-Saint-Denis residents. He believes the Olympics will be 'a big party' and he will be among 45,000 volunteers who'll be helping. But he is not expecting Olympic-related investments to magically erase Seine-Saint-Denis' many difficulties.\n'It's like lifting the carpet and brushing the dust underneath,' he said.

It also is home to the Games' only purpose-built competition venue, an aquatics center for diving, water polo and artistic swimming events. Other competition venues already existed, were previously planned or will be temporary.\nAdvertisement\n'We really were driven by the ambition of sobriety and above all not to build sports facilities that aren't needed and which will have no reason to exist after the Games,' Marie Barsacq, the organizing committee's legacy director, said in an interview.\nThe hand-me-down 50-meter pool for Sevran will be a significant upgrade. The Seine-Saint-Denis town of 51,000 people was whacked by factory closures in the 1990s. Its existing 25-meter pool is nearly 50 years old.\nOther Seine-Saint-Denis towns are also getting new or renovated pools — particularly welcome for the region's children, because only half of them can swim.\n'The ambition for these Olympic Games ... is that they benefit everyone and for the longest time possible,' said Sevran Mayor Stéphane Blanchet. The Olympics, Blanchet said, can't 'carry on just passing though and then moving on without thinking about tomorrow.'\nPARIS' COSTS COMPARE FAVORABLY\nAt close to 9 billion euros ($9.7 billion), more than half from sponsors, ticket sales and other non-public funding, Paris' expenses so far are less than for the last three Summer Games in Tokyo, Rio and London in 2012.\nAdvertisement\nIncluding policing and transport costs, the portion of the bill for French taxpayers is likely to be around 3 billion euros ($3.25 billon), France's body for auditing public funds said in its most recent study in July.\nSecurity remains a challenge for the city repeatedly hit by deadly extremist violence. The government downsized ambitions to have 600,000 people lining the River Seine for the opening ceremony. Citing the risk of attacks, it shelved a promise that anyone could apply for hundreds of thousands of free tickets. Instead, the 326,000 spectators will either be paying ticket-holders or have been invited.\nPrivacy advocates are critical of video surveillance technology being deployed to spot security threats. Campaigners for the homeless are concerned that they will be swept off streets. Many Parisians plan to leave, to avoid the disruptions or to rent their homes to the expected 15 million visitors. With trade unions pushing for Olympic bonuses, strikes are also possible.\nAdvertisement\nAnd all this against an inflammable backdrop of geopolitical crises including but not limited to the Israel-Hamas war and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As a consequence, the IOC isn't allowing athletes from Russia and ally Belarus to parade with other Olympians at the opening ceremony.\nStill, Olympics fans expect big things of Paris. They include Ayaovi Atindehou, a 32-year-old trainee doctor from Togo studying in France. The Olympic volunteer believes the Games can bridge divisions, even if just temporarily.\n'The whole world without racial differences, ethnic differences, religious differences. We will be all together, shouting, celebrating,' he said. 'We need the Olympic Games.'\n___",

            "summary": "MADRID — Spain's baby bust began more than 30 years ago and has lately accelerated, prompting a question that confronts most rich countries and nearly all in Europe: How does society cope, let alone maintain its dynamism, with free-falling fertility driven by a soaring share of women who have no children at all?\nOne thing seems certain: In modern democracies, government policy is largely useless in persuading people to have more children. Births are dwindling even in northern European countries that offer parents lavish tax breaks, parental leave, child care and cash handouts.\nAs smaller families become the new normal, Spain is a case study on how to manage that transition successfully. Success, however, does not come without cost or risk, and Spain is also an example of that.\nA plummeting birthrate leaves countries with unpalatable alternatives to sustain economic growth and public finances: more immigration, higher taxes, pared-down public services and pensions, delayed retirement. Or all of the above.\nAdvertisement\nSpain, roughly tied with Italy as the fertility laggards among major Western countries, has opted for more immigrants. In the late 1990s, scarcely 3 percent of residents in Spain were immigrants; today they account for more than 17 percent of population — one of the highest shares in Europe, and more than in the United States.\nThat has provided workers and juiced growth for the country even as it registered record-low fertility last year — just under 1.2 children born per woman, far below the so-called replacement level of 2.1 required to maintain population equilibrium over time.\nThe reasons for declining births are well known — not least broader options available to women as their numbers climb in the workforce — and more or less common across developed nations.\nIn Spain, younger workers earn modest salaries — ordinarily around $20,000 a year — in jobs that are often term-limited. That isn't enough to pay rent driven higher by gentrification, inflation and Airbnb, so college graduates typically live with their parents, sometimes for years, while embarking on careers. That can postpone many things, including couple formation and babies.\nAdvertisement\nWhile visiting Madrid, I spotted babies and toddlers in restaurants, along broad boulevards and in El Retiro, the city's handsomest park. But the children are often in carriages or strollers pushed by middle-aged moms or gray-haired dads; older siblings were seldom in evidence.\nFollow this author Lee Hockstader 's opinions\nFollow this author\nLee Hockstader\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nFor some young Spaniards and others in Europe, parenthood just isn't considered very cool — certainly less so than traveling, hanging with friends and pursuing careers. About a quarter of Spanish women born in the mid-1970s have no children; among younger women that number is soaring — even in the United States, where the fertility rate is higher.\nWhen I interviewed a group of graduate students at Carlos III University in Madrid, none was remotely interested in becoming a parent in the foreseeable future.\n'My mom had me when she was 39, so I've never worried about this,' said Muria Errasti, 23, a master's candidate in data science. 'I'd rather enjoy life and travel while I'm young.'\nAdvertisement\nSpanish demographers say the birth dearth is compounded by the cost of raising children, roughly $700 a month in Spain, and the time suck of helicopter parenting. For some contemplating having children, pervasive anxiety intensifies the reluctance: Why bring babies into a world beset in recent years with recession, pandemic, war and climate change?\nIn Spain, there's little catastrophic rhetoric but plenty of private pain. Demographers cite polls showing people want more babies than they're having. Spanish fertility clinics do a booming business with women in their late 30s and 40s who waited to get pregnant only to encounter the biological fact that time is against them.\nAdvertisement\nAt Ginefiv, a group of sleek fertility clinics in Madrid, staff psychologists help patients with long-term treatments whose emotional toll is exceeded only by cancer therapy, said Joaquín Llácer, the medical director. 'Nobody is worried about fertility,' he told me, 'because nobody is aware of the suffering of fertility patients.'\nYet surging immigration has bolstered Spain's robust economic growth, which is outstripping most of Europe's. Spanish law has smoothed the way for migrants, especially Latin Americans sharing language and cultural affinity with Spain. They gain easy access to working legally and, after just two years, eligibility for citizenship.\nThe Spanish model may be hard to replicate elsewhere in Europe, where radical-right, anti-immigrant parties are ascendant. Spain's own migrant-bashing party, known as Vox, faded in last year's elections after a flash of success five years ago.\nAdvertisement\nRisks remain. Spain probably can't raise fertility rates, but the jury is out on whether it might be able to at least stabilize them with smarter policies. Promoting more stable jobs for young workers could help, along with boosting Spain's spending on families with children, which, as a percentage of economic output, is half the outlay in many northern European nations.",

            "summary": "NEW YORK — Sometime in the next few days or even hours, the 'miners' who chisel bitcoins out of complex mathematics are going to take a 50% pay cut — effectively slicing new production of the world's largest cryptocurrency in half.\nThat could have a lot of implications, from the price of the asset to the bitcoin miners themselves. And, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is hard to predict.\nHere's what you need to know.\nWHAT IS BITCOIN HALVING AND WHY DOES IT MATTER?\nBitcoin 'halving,' a preprogrammed event that occurs roughly every four years, impacts the production of bitcoin. Miners use farms of noisy, specialized computers to solve convoluted math puzzles; and when they complete one, they get a fixed number of bitcoins as a reward.\nHalving does exactly what it sounds like — it cuts that fixed income in half. And when the mining reward falls, so does the number of new bitcoins entering the market. That means the supply of coins available to satisfy demand grows more slowly.\nAdvertisement\nLimited supply is one of bitcoin's key features. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist, and more than 19.5 million of them have already been mined, leaving fewer than 1.5 million left to pull from.\nSo long as demand remains the same or climbs faster than supply, bitcoin prices should rise as halving limits output. Because of this, some argue that bitcoin can counteract inflation — still, experts stress that future gains are never guaranteed.\nHOW OFTEN DOES HALVING OCCUR?\nPer bitcoin's code, halving occurs after the creation of every 210,000 'blocks' — where transactions are recorded — during the mining process.\nNo calendar dates are set in stone, but that divvies out to roughly once every four years. The latest estimates expect the next halving to occur sometime late Friday or early Saturday.\nWILL HALVING IMPACT BITCOIN'S PRICE?\nOnly time will tell. Following each of the three previous halvings, the price of bitcoin was mixed in the first few months and wound up significantly higher one year later. But as investors well know, past performance is not an indicator of future results.\nAdvertisement\n'I don't know how significant we can say halving is just yet,' said Adam Morgan McCarthy, a research analyst at Kaiko. 'The sample size of three (previous halvings) isn't big enough to say ‘It's going to go up 500% again,' or something.'\nAt the time of the last halving in May 2020, for example, bitcoin's price stood at around $8,602, according to CoinMarketCap — and climbed almost seven-fold to nearly $56,705 by May 2021. Bitcoin prices nearly quadrupled a year after July 2016's halving and shot up by almost 80 times one year out from bitcoin's first halving in November 2012. Experts like McCarthy stress that other bullish market conditions contributed to those returns.\nThis next halving also arrives after a year of steep increases for bitcoin. As of Thursday afternoon, bitcoin stood at just over $63,500 per CoinMarketCap. That's down from the all-time-high of about $73,750 hit last month, but still double the asset's price from a year ago.\nAdvertisement\nMuch of the credit for bitcoin's recent rally is given to the early success of a new way to invest in the asset — spot bitcoin ETFs, which were only approved by U.S. regulators in January. A research report from crypto fund manager Bitwise found that these spot ETFs saw $12.1 billion in inflows during the first quarter.\nBitwise senior crypto research analyst Ryan Rasmussen said persistent or growing ETF demand, when paired with the 'supply shock' resulting from the coming halving, could help propel bitcoin's price further.\n'We would expect the price of Bitcoin to have a strong performance over the next 12 months,' he said. Rasmussen notes that he's seen some predict gains reaching as high as $400,000, but the more 'consensus estimate' is closer to the $100,000-$175,000 range.\nOther experts stress caution, pointing to the possibility the gains have already been realized.\nAdvertisement\nIn a Wednesday research note, JPMorgan analysts maintained that they don't expect to see post-halving price increases because the event 'has already been already priced in' — noting that the market is still in overbought conditions per their analysis of bitcoin futures.\nWHAT ABOUT MINERS?\nMiners, meanwhile, will be challenged with compensating for the reduction in rewards while also keeping operating costs down.\n'Even if there's a slight increase in bitcoin price, (halving) can really impact a miner's ability to pay bills,' Andrew W. Balthazor, a Miami-based attorney who specializes in digital assets at Holland & Knight, said. 'You can't assume that bitcoin is just going to go to the moon. As your business model, you have to plan for extreme volatility.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBetter-prepared miners have likely laid the groundwork ahead of time, perhaps by increasing energy efficiency or raising new capital. But cracks may arise for less-efficient, struggling firms.\nAdvertisement\nOne likely outcome: Consolidation. That's become increasingly common in the bitcoin mining industry, particularly following a major crypto crash in 2022.\nIn its recent research report, Bitwise found that total miner revenue slumped one month after each of the three previous halvings. But those figures had rebounded significantly after a full year — thanks to spikes in the price of bitcoin as well as larger miners expanding their operations.\nTime will tell how mining companies fare following this next looming halving. But Rasmussen is betting that big players will continue to expand and utilize the industry's technology advances to make operations more efficient.\nWHAT ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT?\nPinpointing definitive data on the environmental impacts directly tied to bitcoin halving is still a bit of a question mark. But it's no secret that crypto mining consumes a lot of energy — and operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.\nAdvertisement\nRecent research published by the United Nations University and Earth's Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to emissions of burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin's electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).\nEnvironmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that pushes towards the use of more clean energy have increased in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections from regulators around the world.",

            "summary": "When I read a recent news article by my Post colleagues headlined 'Inside Donald Trump's secret, long-shot plan to end the war in Ukraine,' my thoughts naturally turned to another election in which another Republican presidential candidate was widely reported to have a 'secret plan' to end another war. Richard M. Nixon did not actually make that claim himself about the Vietnam War during the 1968 campaign. Instead, he made a vague promise to 'end the war and win the peace in the Pacific' and let voters imagine he knew how do that.\nNixon's strategy, as it turned out, consisted of going to Moscow and Beijing to win over North Vietnam's principal allies, while dropping hints that he was a 'madman' who was willing to use nuclear weapons if Hanoi did not stop fighting. To further increase the pressure on Hanoi, he stepped up bombing of North Vietnam and invaded Cambodia to clear out communist sanctuaries.\nNone of Nixon's machinations produced what he promised: 'peace with honor.' In 1973, he signed a peace treaty that pulled all remaining U.S. forces out of South Vietnam but allowed North Vietnam to keep between 140,000 and 300,000 of its own troops in the south. A little more than two years later, North Vietnam conquered South Vietnam. The south's fall demonstrated, for neither the first nor the last time, that the surest way to end any war is for one side to win and the other to lose.\nAdvertisement\nThat brings us to the 'very stable genius' and his current plans to end the war in Ukraine. If elected again, Trump claims he would end the war in 24 hours, but he has been cagey about how he would pull off this miraculous feat, supposedly so that he could maintain his flexibility to negotiate.\nFollow this author Max Boot 's opinions\nFollow this author\nMax Boot\n's opinions Follow\nFollow\nHungary's authoritarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, proclaimed after meeting with Trump last month that the former president's formula was simple and cynical: 'He will not give a penny in the Ukraine-Russia war. Therefore, the war will end, because it is obvious that Ukraine cannot stand on its own feet.'\nTrump aides told The Post that Orban's statement, which sounded entirely plausible to me, was 'false,' even though Trump has not publicly contradicted it. The aides explained that the presumptive GOP nominee's actual plan is to push for 'Ukraine to cede Crimea and Donbas border region to Russia' in return for an end to the Russian invasion.\nAdvertisement\nIf that is Trump's plan, it is more preposterous than anything Nixon ever contemplated during the Vietnam War. It displays a witches' brew of arrogance, ignorance and defeatism.\nStart with the arrogance: Trump regards himself as the world's greatest dealmaker despite a long track record, going back at least to 1990 and his first casino bankruptcy, indicating the opposite. As president, he was very good at abrogating treaties — including the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal — but not very successful at negotiating new ones. He announced the Abraham Accords but did not personally negotiate them, as Jimmy Carter did with the Camp David Accords, and he renamed the North American Free Trade Agreement rather than truly renegotiating it. His summits with Kim Jong Un did not produce North Korean denuclearization; Pyongyang's weapons of mass destruction program is considerably more advanced now than it was when Trump and Kim met in Singapore in 2018.\nOf greatest relevance to the conflict in Ukraine was Trump's ill-fated attempt to negotiate an end to the war in Afghanistan. His 2020 deal with the Taliban was as one-sided as Nixon's Paris peace accords with the North Vietnamese: Trump's negotiators agreed to withdraw all U.S. troops within 14 months and free 5,000 Taliban prisoners. In return, the Taliban promised not to allow Afghanistan to become a haven for international terrorists. The Taliban was not required to stop fighting or reconcile with the Afghan government.\nAdvertisement\nOnce President Biden had finished pulling all U.S. forces out, the Taliban launched an offensive that led to its swift takeover of the entire country. Trump now calls the exit from Afghanistan the most 'embarrassing moment in the history of our country' and tries to blame it all on Biden, but he set the retreat in motion.\nThere is no reason to suppose Trump would have any greater success in ending the war in Ukraine without betraying U.S. allies. He seems to have fallen for Russian propaganda — which is prevalent on the MAGA right — suggesting that the war in Ukraine is a minor border dispute that can be easily resolved by handing over to Moscow the Russian-speaking regions it covets: Crimea and Donbas. But, even leaving aside the morality of sacrificing another country's territory to a brutal aggressor, there is no indication that Russian tyrant Vladimir Putin would be satisfied for long with only a small piece of Ukraine.\nThe current conflict began, after all, with a Russian blitzkrieg aimed at taking Kyiv. That war plan strongly suggests that Putin, who has repeatedly denied that Ukraine is a sovereign nation, wants to control all of Ukraine. Then, in September 2022, Putin annexed four provinces of Ukraine: Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Though Russian forces now control almost all of Luhansk, they occupy only parts of the other provinces. (I recently visited Kherson and met with its Ukrainian governor.) Donetsk is part of Donbas region along with Luhansk, so if Trump were to try to turn over Donbas to Putin, he would be ceding territory that Russia hasn't actually conquered. Is he even aware of these important details? Doubtful.\nAdvertisement\nYet even sacrificing Crimea and Donbas would be extremely unlikely to satisfy Putin's imperial ambitions. Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president who is now the deputy chairman of its Security Council, last month unveiled Moscow's own 'peace plan,' which calls for the unconditional surrender of Ukraine and its absorption into Russia. The Russian Orthodox Church, which is a handmaiden of the Putin regime, has declared the conflict in Ukraine a 'holy war.'\nEven if Putin promises to respect Ukrainian sovereignty as part of a peace deal, there is no reason to accept his assurances at face value. He has a long record of breaking promises and violating treaties, such as the 1994 Budapest Memorandum in which Russia joined with the United States and Britain to guarantee Ukraine's territorial integrity in return for Kyiv giving up its nuclear weapons. Putin likely would use any cease-fire to ready his forces for another major push on the Ukrainian capital.\nIt is possible, admittedly, that Putin might eventually abandon his maximalist objectives if he were convinced that his military forces were headed toward defeat. But Ukraine's counteroffensive last year failed, and Russia is now reportedly readying a major offensive that has the potential to break through Ukrainian lines. The defenders are running critically low on ammunition because Trump's allies in the House have been blocking the passage of aid to Ukraine. The top U.S. general in Europe warned last week that Russia's 5-to-1 advantage in artillery shells could soon become 10 to 1 if U.S. aid isn't forthcoming.\nAdvertisement",

While Brazilian eucalyptus is a fast-growing tree and generally considered to be a more sustainable source of virgin fiber, soft toilet paper typically also includes fiber from older trees that store large amounts of carbon.\nAdvertisement\nAll of the toilet paper products that got an F in sustainability from the NRDC were made of mostly, if not entirely, forest fiber. Toilet paper made with 100 percent recycled content received high grades from the group. Simple Truth, for instance, got an A.\n'Making sure post-consumer waste is recycled and reused as many times as possible is imperative to decrease the demand for natural resources and prevent pollution of water, air and waste going to landfills,' said Linda Walker, senior director for corporate engagement for forests at World Wildlife Fund.\nWhich one was strongest?\nQuarters were added to wet toilet paper sheets until they tore. (Video: Sarah Hashemi, John Farrell/The Washington Post)\nWinner : Reel Paper (100 percent bamboo)\nWinner: Reel Paper (100 percent bamboo)\nA wet sheet of three-ply Reel toilet paper was able to hold an average of about eight quarters — two more than Whole Foods' 365 toilet paper (two-ply), which came in second.\nLike virgin hardwoods, bamboo tends to have long fibers, which bond more easily to create a stronger sheet, said Richard Venditti, a professor of paper science and engineering at North Carolina State University.\nBut bamboo can be less environmentally friendly than U.S. recycled paper. Much bamboo is sourced from China, which is still fueled heavily by coal, Venditti said. 'A lot of people think, ‘Oh, it's bamboo. We didn't have to cut down a tree,' and so it's good environmentally, but that's not the whole story,' he said.\nOur strength test winner received a B grade from the NRDC, lower than many toilet paper rolls made from recycled material. Still, some experts said a bamboo-based product — provided that it is mostly, if not all, made from responsibly sourced bamboo — can be a better alternative to virgin fiber from mature or old trees.\nWhile not as low-impact as post-consumer recycled products or alternative fibers from agricultural residue, such as hemp, jute, and rice and wheat straw, bamboo — a type of grass — grows much more quickly than most trees.\nWhich one was more absorbent?\n0.5mL of liquid was added to folded-up toilet paper sheets to test their absorbency.

The group said it gave higher grades to products with larger amounts of post-consumer recycled content. Other recycled toilet paper can contain manufacturing waste that doesn't make it to a store shelf.\nThe champion\nReel, the bamboo-based toilet paper, emerged victorious. It scored highest on strength and most of our testers gave it middle-of-the-road softness marks. Though, as we mentioned above, it doesn't rank as high as some of our other papers on sustainability, per the NRDC's scorecard.\nIf you choose bamboo-based toilet paper, experts say to make sure your products are Forest Stewardship Council, or FSC, certified.\nAdvertisement\nRegardless of what toilet paper you choose, there will likely be sustainability trade-offs. For example, with the exception of Reel, which is packaged in recyclable paper and comes in a cardboard box, all the other brands we tested were wrapped in plastic. What's more, producing some types of toilet paper can release fewer carbon emissions, but could hurt the environment in other ways, such as if the fertilizer that's used to grow crops ends up polluting nearby waterways.\nOf course, there are other things to consider when choosing toilet paper, like cost. Our winner was not the cheapest, at $27.99 for 12 'mega' rolls (or about $2.30 per roll), according to Reel's website. The bamboo toilet paper can be purchased for less at some stores, such as Target. The lowest price was Trader Joe's at about 40 cents per roll (or $4.99 for 12 rolls).",

            "summary": "Kirk Johnsen unzipped his khaki tent and popped just his head out first.\nThe weather would be good today, he noted. The political climate, not so much.\n'They want to criminalize us,' said the 38-year-old who's been living in an encampment about two miles from the Supreme Court, which on Monday heard arguments on anti-camping laws in Oregon, a case that could have sweeping implications for homeless encampments across the United States. 'That's what I hear is happening there today.'\nThe encampment where Johnsen lives is a small community in the middle of federal D.C., a leafy, green triangle between the massive U.S. State Department and the Department of the Interior.\nThere is a hodgepodge of multicolored porch chairs at most tent openings, bric-a-brac lawn ornaments, picnic tables and shopping carts parked in neat rows under tarp carports.\nAdvertisement\nOne squat tent is cramped under a wild, cat's cradle web of rope and string. Another sits at the end of a long runner with a bold, floral pattern and a yard fenced off with scavenged ropes and poles.\nThe setups are as varied as the reasons the dwellers found themselves there.\n'How ya' doing today?' neighbors greet each other after the 'zzzzzzziiip' open of their front doors.\nThis scene is a growing reality in cities across the United States, big and small, red and blue.\nIn D.C., the encampments grow and shrink, the people and their tents get pushed around, sometimes violently, like the time a bulldozer scooped up a tent with a man inside.\nThe encampments used to be thick on the green pocket parks of Capitol Hill, all around the Supreme Court.\nDuring their high school years, my kids were greeted, blessed, congratulated, fist-bumped, thanked and shown a knife by some of the folks living in these parks.\nOne of our visitors came out of the grandeur of Union Station and walked through a blossoming tent city outside the train station a couple of years ago and remarked: 'Oh wow! They have a campground right here? Neato!'\nThis has long been the case in D.C. — where encampments today are mostly near the Kennedy Center and Foggy Bottom — and other big cities in the United States. But as housing prices soar, wages stagnate and tents mushroom in the decay of America's dying promise of opportunity, local governments with inadequate, unaffordable housing and temporary shelter for all their residents are struggling with what to do about the growing crisis.\nAdvertisement\nIt seems housing would be the answer to homelessness.\nBut in Grants Pass, Ore., city leaders decided to fine and jail the people — from veterans to housekeepers — who drop through the social safety net and end up sleeping outside.\n'Sleeping is a biological necessity. It's sort of like breathing,' said U.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, in hearing the case on Monday. 'You can say breathing is conduct, too, but presumably you would not think that it's okay to criminalize breathing in public. And for a homeless person who has no place to go, sleeping in public is kind of like breathing in public.'\nThe case focuses on whether treating tent-sleeping as criminal conduct constitutes the 'cruel and unusual punishment' that our Eight Amendment bans.\n'God made the outdoors! People have been sleeping outdoors for centuries,' said Shelley Byars, 46, one of the most vocal residents of the Virginia Avenue encampment.\nAdvertisement\n'This isn't camping,' she explained, pulling out the padlock that she puts on her tent whenever she leaves. 'I camped as a kid. I camped with my son. What I'm doing here is surviving. Living.'\nIt's not an easy street. Rocks the size of cantaloupes were once hurled at her tent when she pitched it on a median in Northeast Washington. Another time, her tent was slashed.\n'Oxon Run. McPherson Square. Brookland. Edgewood.' Byars, who is originally from Texas, but came to D.C. to seek legal help from the federal government, has a list of places she's pitched her tent, then been told to move.\nOn Sunday night, hours before the nation's highest court was scheduled to hear arguments in the Oregon case, firefighters arrived when the tent next to Byars went up in flames. On Monday morning, they passed out fliers explaining the danger of outdoor propane use.\nAdvertisement\n'That wasn't an accident,' Byars said. 'Someone meant to do that.'\nVito Maggiolo, spokesman for the D.C. fire department, said investigators couldn't find the cause and it's listed as 'undetermined.'\nThe Supreme Court case arguments will belabor why people like Byars and Johnsen are living outside, as though it's a choice or luxury someone aspired to.\nAnd no matter where you go — from Grants Pass to D.C. — the answers are varied, but the pattern is the same.\nA job was lost. An eviction notice came. A mental illness was diagnosed. An addiction was voracious and unrelenting.\nIn many cases, death gashed the biggest hole in a safety net that had held a vulnerable person for so long. On Monday morning, I heard about the deaths of a father who supported a struggling offspring; a spouse who was the breadwinner.\nAdvertisement\n'My sister. She was my backbone,' said Frederick, 56.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nBorn and raised in D.C., Frederick, who preferred that I didn't use his last name, worked on and off in construction most of his life. Since his sister died a year ago, he's been living in a tent pitched in a freeway underpass on Capitol Hill, just five blocks from the Supreme Court.\n'My sister helped me with everything. She was like my mother,' he said, through the bug screen of his tent window. 'Now I'm trying to get a housing voucher without her help.'\nNext to him is Jose Lopez, 42.\nHe's got a voucher and just did an intake interview a couple of weeks ago.\nOriginally from Puerto Rico and Florida, Lopez said he came to D.C. for a court case, then didn't have the money to return south after it was over. He wants to work, but living in a tent doesn't make it easy.\nAdvertisement\nLopez, Byars, Johnsen; none of them dreamed of living in a tent. This wasn't what they wanted.\nThat was the message from a lineup of speakers outside the Supreme Court on Monday. Occasionally, they'd get live updates from inside.\n'People do not choose to be homeless,' said Donald Whitehead, who heads the National Coalition for the Homeless, outside the Supreme Court. 'They are forced into homelessness by a safety net riddled with holes.'\nA few blocks away, the man who is lost without his sister's help wondered why any court would punish his struggle.",

            "summary": "Birds make nests over front doors, on porches and patios, even on cars. Here's how to keep one safe.\nWhat to do if you find a bird nest near your home\nIf you live in a city or suburb, it can be hard to feel surrounded by nature. But next time you step outside, pause, look and listen — even in the most densely populated areas, birds are almost omnipresent. And no matter where you live, that can be a kind of magic, especially during nesting season.\n'Rarely do we get this opportunity to get a front-row seat to a wild organism starting its life,' says Brian Evans, a migratory bird ecologist and project lead at the bird observatory at the Smithsonian National Zoo. 'All we have to do is start noticing.'\nBut having an avian neighbor can raise a host of questions, including how best to monitor a nest, how to keep it safe and what to do in case of nest abandonment.\nAccording to Chad Witko, a senior coordinator of avian biology at the National Audubon Society, the answer to most questions is usually to leave the nest alone. If you feel you must intervene, call a licensed wildlife rehabilitator in your area. '[Birds] have enough problems as it is,' he says. 'It's good to not let our good intentions do more harm.'\nHere's what else to know.\nHow do I spot a nest?\nDespite the fact that birds are all around us, there's a reason we don't see nests everywhere: Parents try to build nests in secret. These hidden homes offer the best chance of survival for their eggs and young during nesting season, which, for many species, begins around April. 'It's a very dangerous time of year for birds,' Witko says. 'Parents are doing everything they can to protect their young.'\nAdvertisement\nBut there are a few signs that a bird might be nesting nearby. Look out for agitated adults, who may start vocalizing more aggressively if you're standing near their nest. Adult birds making frequent trips to and from a specific location, especially with food in their bills, is also a telltale sign that they're feeding young, Witko says.\nIf you spot a nest from afar, try to leave it alone. Checking in too frequently or obviously can call the attention of predators (more on this below). Consider instead watching from a distance through a pair of binoculars.\nWhat if the nest is in an unsafe spot?\nSometimes, nests are too easy to spot — like when a bird has made one over your garage or front door, or even in a nook of your car (like between the door and mirror). First, consider ways to avoid the nest: Does your house have another point of entry? Can you park on the street for a while? If there's a nest in your flowerpot, it's time to accept that your geraniums may need to go about four weeks without watering — roughly the time it takes for eggs to incubate and for young to fledge, according Witko.\nDepending on the time of the nesting cycle, mom and dad birds can abandon their nests if they are disturbed by nearby humans. Besides, with just a few exceptions for nonnative species, moving a nest is illegal in the United States under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.\nIf avoiding a nest isn't an option (there's no alternate entrance to your home, or the nest is in your mailbox, for example), call a licensed wildlife rehabilitator. They probably won't move the nest far — just a few feet, which will help keep the adults from abandoning it.\nHow can I protect a nest from predators?\nThe most common nest predators include snakes, rodents and other birds. But just like nesting birds, many predators are protected, so do not harm them in an effort to protect the babies.\nBirds such as jays and crows know that watching human activity can lead them to their next meal. That's why, Witko says, he's been instructed during field research to pretend to search for nests in the wrong places, and to cover his tracks after locating an actual nest. If you have a nest near your home, you should also avoid walking directly to it and inadvertently tipping off nearby predators.\nAdvertisement\nAnother big challenge for nesting birds, hatchlings and fledglings: pets. Keep cats inside and monitor dogs outside if a known nest is nearby. To avoid attracting predators such as chipmunks, raccoons and other rodents, bring food and food scraps inside.\nIf you have a nest box, adding a baffle can prevent predators from entering (if you don't have a nest box, read on!). Make sure your nest box does not have a perch, or a peg right below the entrance — birds don't use them, but they're a perfect place for predators to hang on as they eat eggs.\nWhat else can I do to keep a nest safe?\nIf you know you have a nest, the easiest way you can help is to simply be considerate. Use caution while leaf blowing, for instance, or doing other yard work that could harm nests or dislocate young birds.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\n'I've got a robin nest in the front of my house in a shrub that's completely unruly,' Evans says. 'I totally procrastinated too long in cutting my shrub, and it's a bummer. But now I'm going to have to wait until probably July to cut it, because it's really easy to destroy a nest that way.'\nHe recommends avoiding pesticides or cutting down on pesticide usage during nesting season, too. 'A healthy bird community really starts with a healthy insect community,' Evans says.\nWhat if I see a baby bird outside its nest?\nFirst, identify whether the bird is a fledgling or a nestling. Nestlings are about the size of their eggs, usually featherless and often pink, and they sometimes have closed eyes (they may resemble 'little aliens,' according to Witko). Fledglings usually have some feathers and can hop around on their own. 'It's the difference between a newborn baby that's very helpless and a young toddler that can move around but still needs Mom and Dad,' Witko says.\nIf you've identified the latter, don't move the fledgling — its parent is probably nearby, feeding it and watching from a distance as it learns to navigate its world. If the fledgling is injured (its feathers look wet and matted, there's an open wound, or there are flies present), contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator.\nBut if it's a hatchling, try to locate the nest and gently place the young bird back; it may have been accidentally thrown out by an adult bird or blown out by a strong wind. And don't worry that your 'scent will ward off the parents.' According to Witko, that's a common misconception. If you can't find the nest, fashion a makeshift one from a discarded box or container, monitor the bird for about an hour, and call a licensed wildlife rehabilitator if its parent doesn't return.\nWhat if the nest is abandoned?\nEven for experts, it can sometimes be challenging to tell whether a nest is actually abandoned. In the early spring, birds may start building a nest on a warm day, stop during a cold front, then return to building a few days later, according to Robyn Bailey, NestWatch project leader at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Then there are songbirds, which don't begin incubating eggs until they've laid them all, leading to a few days where eggs are present but adults aren't. Also a possibility: The adults are away when you check the nest, but they are still attending to their eggs or young.\nAdvertisement\nTo determine whether a nest is actually abandoned, call a licensed wildlife rehabilitator. Never try to handle the eggs yourself, take young birds into your home or try to feed them — different species have different diets, and feeding a bird the wrong one could kill it.\nHow can I encourage birds to nest near me?\nFirst, if you or a neighbor has outdoor cats, or if there are strays in your area, do not try to attract birds. Otherwise, consider growing native trees, shrubs and wildflowers that offer birds food and shelter (the National Audubon Society has a database to help you choose bird-friendly plants for your region).\nYou can also use feeders, but take care to place them less than three feet from your house so birds don't have enough space to gain the dangerous speeds that lead to window strikes.\nLess yardwork might make neighbors mad, but birds benefit from un-raked leaves and fallen branches, which can enrich soil and provide foraging spots and nesting materials.\nHow can I discourage nesting in a high-traffic area?\nOnce a nest is built, it's illegal to remove it. But if you catch a bird starting to nest, say, over your front door and it's your house's only entrance, you can remove nest material as soon as you notice it.\nYou can also avoid encouraging nests in unwanted spots by providing better alternatives. If you see birds nesting annually between ledges, columns or crevices of your home, hang a nest box nearby, Bailey says.\n'If you make an artificial platform or even an L-shaped piece of wood, and put it a little further away from the front door, they'll oftentimes be attracted to that and move over,' she says.\nCan watching a nest in my yard be … science?\nYes! Ornithologists increasingly rely on data collection from amateurs to track trends in migration, breeding and the impacts of climate change. Top programs include Cornell's NestWatch, spearheaded by Bailey. Participants can sign up, receive a quick virtual training, then monitor nearby nests and record data on the reproductive cycle. The program, now available online and with a mobile app, has been in place for over 50 years, receiving about 3,000 participants per year.",

            "summary": "WESTON, Fla. — 'There's one up there,' yells my guide, Captain Bud, pointing to a green iguana in the boughs of a pine tree. Through the scope of my air rifle, I can see the distant silhouette of a reptile skittering between tree branches.\nI soon lose track of it. Waves are rocking our small fishing boat on one of the drainage canals that helped make South Florida's suburbs possible, a patchwork of condominiums, backyard pools and strip malls.\nSouth Florida's suburbs possible, a patchwork of condominiums, backyard pools and strip malls.\nIt's a surreal place to be hunting.\nI'm here at the behest of the state of Florida, ostensibly to help solve one of its intractable invasive species problems. About 22 miles outside of Fort Lauderdale, among the golf courses and retirement communities, green iguanas are everywhere.\nSince arriving in Florida from Central and South America in the 1960s, as part of the exotic pet trade, green iguanas have colonized suburbia. Residents and government officials accuse them of tearing up backyard gardens, collapsing canals and displacing native wildlife.\nAdvertisement\nFlorida's response has been to declare open season on the species. 'Every iguana removed is one less iguana causing negative impacts across Florida's landscapes,' McKayla Spencer, who helps manage nonnative species for Florida's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, said in an email. Since 2023, anyone can trap or hunt as many as they want on designated public lands, provided they don't violate anti-cruelty laws.\nWith this in mind, I headed back to my home state to hunt iguanas — and it's why I find myself raising my air rifle and slowly squeezing the trigger. An iguana high up in the trees scuttles off to the other, safer side of the trunk, untouched, my pellet having veered wildly off course.\nI'm not a hunter. Growing up, my shooting was exclusively at targets. But I am among the ranks of people that Florida, and many other states, are hoping to enlist in managing species originating from beyond their borders. From wild hogs to lionfish, nonnative species now inhabit an area the size of California across the United States, costing an estimated $120 billion annually in damage — and hunters are being asked to curb their populations.\nAdvertisement\nFlorida is their wild west. 'We have more nonnative reptiles and amphibians than any place in the entire world,' says Christopher Searcy, a biology professor at the University of Miami, who estimates 26 percent of all species in the state are nonnative. 'If you value native diversity, I think it's pretty bad.'\nSo my plan was simple: Go deep into Florida's suburbs and see how hunting iguanas can help restore Florida's ecosystems, easing the burden of invasive species.\nNot much went according to plan.\nInvasive capital\nOn a spring morning, our guide, Bud Randall, is picking us up just past dawn on a boat ramp along the New River Canal at the edge of the Everglades.\nRandall, 79, has spent the last few decades taking anglers out into the Gulf Stream to catch marlin and mahi-mahi. Today, he is among the growing number of professional outfitters at Hunting Iguanas Florida, and places like it, guiding people from around the world to hunt iguanas along the canals of Florida's densely populated neighborhoods.\nAfter loading the bass boat with two black .25 caliber air rifles — weapons Florida allows to hunt iguanas in residential areas — a net and some ammunition, we pull away from shore. 'This is the first thing I've done in the world that doesn't get old for me,' says Randall, who goes by Captain Bud, regaling us about stories of past hunts.\nAdvertisement\nThe boat glides across the dark surface of the canal, polished as obsidian glass. Only a dike separates us from the Everglades, a river of grass that forms one of Florida's last great wildernesses.\nBut that's not where we're headed. Randall turns the wheel, heading east, motoring into the heart of Miami-Dade suburbia. We snake past stucco neighborhoods, backyard pools and low-slung bridges with mere inches of clearance above our heads.\nsuburbia. We snake past stucco neighborhoods, backyard pools and low-slung bridges with mere inches of clearance above our heads.\nWe're in prime territory for iguanas (there are three nonnative varieties in Florida) — and dozens of other introduced species. Florida, blessed with a warm, subtropical climate and at the crossroads of a global pet and food trade, is home to species from almost every continent. At least 139 nonnative species have settled in the state since 1924, say state wildlife officials.\nAdvertisement\nTheir spread has followed the same pattern ecologists began noticing in the 20th century as species introduced by humans began spreading unchecked. At first, reports of a few exotic individuals might be treated as curiosities. But by the time biologists sounded the alarm, the invaders were usually impossible to contain. Most species became permanent members of the landscape, sometimes damaging ecosystems and property or spreading disease.\nIguanas are hard to miss, growing over five feet long and up to 17 pounds. The herbivorous reptile's love of suburban plantings and digging — their burrows can stretch more than 80 feet — tests locals' patience and creates expensive repairs by collapsing sidewalks, foundations, sea walls and patios.\nSuburban hunt\nOn the boat for the hunt is Zack Parisa, a close friend who first started hunting with his mother at age 13 in his native Alabama.\nZack and I, who studied forestry together at the Yale School of the Environment, have talked a lot about hunting over the years. I've witnessed many weekends he spent trekking into California's Sierra Nevadas after deer or wild pig, often coming back empty-handed rather than with meat for the freezer.\nat the Yale School of the Environment, have talked a lot about hunting over the years. I've witnessed many weekends he spent trekking into California's Sierra Nevadas after deer or wild pig, often coming back empty-handed rather than with meat for the freezer.\nWhy do it?\nAdvertisement\n'It's being part of place,' he tells me. 'Reading the land and understanding not just what's on it and why, but how it fits in. It's being part of that ecosystem, at least for a time.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nAs Captain Bud brought us deeper into the canals, however, I couldn't help but wonder what ecosystem we were a part of. I watched from the boat as Egyptian geese and Muscovy ducks waddled across thick carpets of Bermuda grass. Strands of Australian pines lined the canal banks.\nHumans have created a novel environment, redistributing species from around the globe, and green iguanas are thriving in this place where almost all the plants and animals come from somewhere else. I wondered if hunting iguanas could claim to be part of this new ecosystem — even if that place is called the suburbs.\nBut, so far, the iguanas were determined to lay low. Most were camouflaged in trees, waiting for the afternoon to sun themselves on the canal's grassy banks. Then Captain Bud steered us toward his 'trophy spot,' a secret location along one of the many canals' public lands legally open to hunting.\nAdvertisement\nAfter idling the engine, we only see swaying leaves and branches of the banyan trees. 'Look up at the tops of the trees,' he says, impatient. Eventually, we see one iguana move. Then another. Soon, the entire tree comes alive with reptilian shapes, long tails and spiked crowns, the prehistoric creatures step along branches overhanging the water.\nFor the next hour, Zack and I track iguanas high up in the trees from the boat. While some escape, there are so many, we hit a few on the outer branches, retrieving them once they fall to the ground, or climbing up branches and wading into the water to pull them out.\nUp close, the iguanas look dignified, even beautiful, their skin a mix of green rusty orange, the final montage of millions of years of evolution. We lay out five of the animals on the banks. We surely could have shot more — there are no size or bag limits — but only took enough to eat. Captain Bud quarters our prey before we put them on ice to cook once we're back to the hotel.\nAdvertisement\nAfter the hunt, I felt conflicted. Green iguanas were declared invasive, but I suspected their capital crime was thriving in an ecosystem we created for them. Had I just helped restore Florida's ecology? Or was I, as one wildlife biologist put it to me, just 'adding to the body count?'\nThe point of the hunt\nWhen I ask Searcy, who studies reptiles and amphibians in the Everglades, whether I helped or hurt Florida's battered environment, he tells me it's not iguanas he's worried about.\nSo far, iguanas primarily settle near people, not largely undisturbed ecosystems where they could do the most damage. When it comes to wildlife, research often cites iguanas' impacts — consuming plants eaten by endangered butterflies, or potentially displacing owls and gopher tortoises from burrows.\nBut that's probably localized. Searcy collects lizards and amphibians at his study sites deep in the Everglades. Only about 15 percent of them are nonnative. Iguanas are virtually absent.\nAdvertisement\n'I totally understand people not liking them, but that's not the same as an ecological problem,' says Searcy. 'There's no clear indication they're having a large negative impact on native communities.' Even if the state tried to control their numbers in earnest, he doubted hunters could have much effect either way. Each female can lay 70 eggs per year, and new populations rapidly recolonize after attempts to remove them.\nHe's most worried about Asian swamp eels. The species is now spreading through parts of the Everglades. In study areas, it has already eradicated more than 90 percent of several small fish and crustacean species, eroding the base of the food chain for other animals.\n'If people want to hunt iguanas and eat them, that seems fine,' he says. 'But I don't think it's going to have a meaningful impact on the population.'\nThat left Zack and me with only one option: Iguana tacos.\nJason Quenguan, a chef at our hotel on Key Biscayne, was enthusiastic about helping us prepare our quarry, describing a recipe for iguana tacos that called for simmering them with guajillo and ancho chiles, oregano and cinnamon before folding them into soft corn tortillas.\nSo on a Monday afternoon, a few hours before departing, we delivered our catch to the chef, who disappeared into the kitchen with an iced bag full of iguana legs and tails.\nWe grabbed a table by the beach, ordered beers and waited for the meal. If there was a satisfying coda to the hunt, it might be finding a source of homegrown protein in people's backyards, rather than feedlots or fisheries.\nAn honest reckoning with our environment might recognize their place in it — and ours. Applying 'invasive' to green iguanas reveals more about our concern for property damage to canals, patios and shrubs, than the invasion of pristine ecosystems.\nIguanas are everywhere in the cities and suburbs of South Florida because of us. We're going to need to learn to live with them. Perhaps hunting merely reflects our role at the top of an ecosystem we created. After all, nonnative Florida species are already appearing on plates. Why not iguanas?\nBut a few minutes before the food was to arrive, we received a text from the galley: 'Gentlemen I'm sorry to inform you,' wrote Quenguan, 'but my chef has just told me that we cannot cook the iguana.'\nThe kitchen's head chef had decided iguana was off the menu.",

An unknown future pathogen could have far more devastating consequences than SARS-CoV-2, which cost some 7 million lives and trillions of dollars in economic losses.\nBut even as negotiators pack in extra hours, the goal of clinching a legally binding pact by next month is far from certain — despite a new draft document being delivered in recent days. The main sticking point involves access to vital information about new threats that may emerge — and to the vaccines and medicines that could contain that threat.\nAdvertisement\n'It's the most momentous time in global health security since 1948,' when the World Health Organization was established, said Lawrence O. Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.\nThe backdrop to today's negotiations is starkly different from the years after World War II when countries united around principles guaranteeing universal human rights and protecting public health. The unifying fear of covid has been replaced by worries about repeating the injustices that tainted the response to the pandemic, deepening rifts between the Global North and the Global South.\nthe years after World War II when countries united around principles guaranteeing universal human rights and protecting public health. The unifying fear of covid has been replaced by worries about repeating the injustices that tainted the response to the pandemic, deepening rifts between the Global North and the Global South.\n'The trauma of the covid-19 pandemic has seeped into the negotiations,' said Ellen 't Hoen, a lawyer and public health advocate who specializes in intellectual property policies. Representatives of the WHO's 194 member countries, she said, are looking backward rather than forward.\nAdvertisement\nThe reasons are clear. A paper published in October 2022 in the journal Nature showed that by the end of 2021, nearly 50 percent of the global population had received two doses of coronavirus vaccine but that huge disparities existed between high-income countries, where coverage was close to 75 percent, and many low-income countries, where less than 2 percent of the population had received two doses. At the same time, South Africa, where the omicron variant was identified, felt punished by travel bans instead of being praised for its scientists' epidemiological acumen and openness.\nvaccine but that huge disparities existed between high-income countries, where coverage was close to 75 percent, and many low-income countries, where less than 2 percent of the population had received two doses. At the same time, South Africa, where the omicron variant was identified, felt punished by travel bans instead of being praised for its scientists' epidemiological acumen and openness.\n'We felt like we were beggars when it came to vaccine availability,' South African President Cyril Ramaphosa recalled at a global financial summit in 2023. 'We felt like life in the Northern Hemisphere is much more important than life in the Global South.'\nThe United States has signaled its support for a legally binding agreement, including leveraging its purchasing power to expand access to medicines around the world. But the United States, like many European Union countries, is the object of mistrust because it is the seat of the powerful pharmaceutical industry, which is reluctant to relax control over manufacturing know-how.\nAdvertisement\nThe chief point of contention involves pathogen access and benefit sharing. In many ways, the story of the fraught pandemic accord negotiations is the story of Henrietta Lacks — the African American patient whose cancer cells were used in research for years without her family's knowledge — retold on a global stage. Who gets to use — and profit from — samples and scientific information, which often come from disadvantaged groups?\nHigh-income countries want guarantees that samples and genetic data about any new pathogen will be quickly shared to allow for the development of tests, vaccines and treatments. Developing nations, where pathogens such as AIDS, Ebola and MERS emerged in recent decades, want guarantees of benefits, such as equal access to vaccines and collaboration with local scientists.\ncountries want guarantees that samples and genetic data about any new pathogen will be quickly shared to allow for the development of tests, vaccines and treatments. Developing nations, where pathogens such as AIDS, Ebola and MERS emerged in recent decades, want guarantees of benefits, such as equal access to vaccines and collaboration with local scientists.\nAlmost 20 years ago, the Indonesian government forced those contrasting priorities to the forefront by refusing to share bird flu samples. WHO member states responded by creating the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework, or PIP, under which key manufacturers agree to supply 10 percent of flu vaccines they make to the WHO for distribution.\nAdvertisement\nNo such agreement exists for other pathogens with pandemic potential.\n'The PIP Framework provides us with good guidance for what an access and benefits sharing instrument could look like, but there are areas where the pandemic agreement could improve,' said Alexandra L. Phelan, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, who co-authored a piece in the journal Nature in February calling for a 'science-for-science mechanism' to ensure vaccine equity in the next pandemic.\nA new agreement, Phelan said, could include an obligation to share genetic sequence data and factor in public health risks when determining how medical products are shared during an emergency. Unlike in earlier outbreaks, no need exists today to wait for a pathogen sample to arrive by mail in a test tube; work on vaccines and treatments can begin based on genetic sequencing attached to an email.\nEven as negotiators wrestle over those points, the venture is being roiled by misinformation on social media, including hostility toward the WHO and assertions that any international agreement would threaten the sovereignty of nations — claims that WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has condemned as 'utterly, completely, categorically false.' The final agreement, Tedros said in early April, won't give the WHO power to impose lockdowns or mask mandates in individual countries.\nAdvertisement\nUnderlying it all is 'a lack of trust,' said 't Hoen, who, like Phelan, is one of the outside experts approved by member states to provide input to the negotiations although they do not take part in the closed-door talks. Some describe lingering in the cafeteria, waiting for the opportunity to glean information or offer counsel to country representatives when they emerge in need of refreshment.\n'This is a pretty nontransparent process,' said Phelan, with 'a lot of grumpy and unhappy people.'\nThe stymied talks prompted former British prime minister Gordon Brown, who serves as WHO ambassador for global health financing, to write a letter in March to the 194 WHO member states urging them to collaborate for the common good. The letter was signed by many former presidents and prime ministers, along with experts in global health and finance.\nAdvertisement\nBut signing on is less politically palatable for current political leaders now that so many people have moved on from the pandemic, choosing to ignore the not-if-but-when warnings that public health officials are airing again today, just as they did before the novel coronavirus was identified more than four years ago in China.\n'The global leadership is absent,' said Nina Schwalbe, principal of the global health think tank Spark Street Advisors, another expert approved to provide input to the negotiations.\nAnd in many ways, the coronavirus has left the world more vulnerable, Schwalbe and others argue, amid increased resistance to vaccination and other preventive measures and the weariness of public health officials. In some U.S. states, officials' powers have been curtailed by legislatures.\nMeanwhile, climate change and increased interactions between human and animal populations are increasing the possibility of spillover events spawning zoonotic diseases that are all but impossible to contain given the speed of modern travel.\nAdvertisement\nEfforts to study pathogens present their own risk, with laboratories around the world engaged in medical and military research aimed at increasing the virulence of existing bacteria and viruses through 'gain-of-function' research, posing a threat of accidental or deliberate release.\nof accidental or deliberate release.\nAnd in March, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a paper outlining a new peril: Advances in gene editing and synthetic biology make it possible to revive pathogens including the virus that causes deadly and disfiguring smallpox — the only human disease declared to have been eradicated following a vaccine campaign by epidemiologists nearly half a century ago.\n'New technologies could enable nefarious actors to genetically engineer the smallpox virus from scratch or make it even more lethal,' said Gostin, who chaired the committee that produced the National Academies report.

It maintains support for equity, while leaving key details to be hashed out during the next two years, by which time the leadership of many instrumental countries, including the United States, may have changed. Meetings are set to resume April 29.\nSome experts have speculated that the original timeline was too short to unite 194 countries around such a divisive and complex topic, pointing out that many treaties take years to finalize and that this process has been complicated by concurrent negotiations over the International Health Regulations, which aim to prevent the spread of disease. The Biden administration also just announced its own Global Health Security Strategy, with a goal of combating health emergencies by using U.S. leadership to drive investment in prevention and response among partner countries.\nBut past crises have shown that complex global negotiations can move quickly.",

Much of the credit goes to Adriano Pedrosa, the Brazilian curator of the two main exhibitions that anchor the seven-month biennale, one held in the central pavilion of the parklike Giardini, and the other in the cavernous industrial spaces of the Arsenale, where Venice once built the ships with which it bestrode the world.\nPedrosa, artistic director of the São Paulo Museum of Art, is the first South American and the first openly queer person to curate the biennale. And it shows. South America is represented not just by a phalanx of its top contemporary talent, but historic figures, Indigenous artists from the Amazon, folk painters, self-taught artists and outsider figures from across the continent. Queer artists, living and dead, reinvigorate old media, including painting, that are sometimes declared, airily and with disdain, to be passé or dead. The number of artists invited, many of them participating for the first time, has ballooned to 331. Two years ago, there were 213, and when I last visited in 2019, the number was just 79.\nAdvertisement\nSkip to end of carousel\nThe Style section\nThe Style section Style is where The Washington Post covers happenings on the front lines of culture and what it all means, including the arts, media, social trends, politics and yes, fashion, all told with personality and deep reporting. For more Style stories, click here\nEnd of carousel\nAnd for the first time in a long time, the biennale's theme — 'Foreigners Everywhere' — offers a real catalyst for processing the art. Pedrosa says it has at least a double sense: The world is full of people who are considered outsiders or foreign, including minorities, migrants and exiles; but we are all strangers, alien even to ourselves. Not every work expresses these ideas, but it is a theme large enough to be inclusive and specific enough to be meaningful.\nYinka Shonibare, a name-brand artist in a show that celebrates newcomers, captures the theme with a work that greets visitors at the Arsenale: 'Refugee Astronaut VIII,' a life-size human figure dressed as an astronaut, lugging a large mesh sack of his or her worldly possessions, a playful but disorienting suggestion that Earth has become uninhabitable, and space is our last asylum.\nShonibare's sculpture is a nice icon, but it also represents what suddenly feels like a moment that may be passing: the perfectly on-brand, well-executed, slightly conceptual, polished and infinitely reproducible art of the past 30 years. More shocking, and exciting, is Pedrosa's focus on works that operate on a more basic but visceral level of expression. In the Giardini pavilion he has included large galleries of portraiture, gathered from around the world, including works that are decades old.\nAdvertisement\nHuman faces stare out from packed walls, among them 'Johnny Cool,' a 1967 portrait by the Jamaican artist Osmond Watson (who died in 2005). The young man, dressed in jeans and an oversized blue shirt, has a factual presence that is more interesting and more intense than the details of the artist who made him, or the postcolonial discourse that explains his presence in the biennale.\nAn even older self-portrait, made in 1941 by the prominent Argentine artist Raquel Forner, is loaded with symbolism: a bloody newspaper clings to a globe in the foreground, a disembodied hand holds a dead dove behind. Standing amid signs of war, Forner holds her right forearm to her stomach, as if to settle her own fears and anguish. I made the same gesture last night, watching a CNN report on children killed while playing foosball at the Maghazi refugee camp in Gaza.\nThis, obviously, isn't joy, and it speaks to the inhuman rather than the human. And the vast majority of the artists in this exhibition aren't speaking directly of happy things. There are no signs of complacency. But there is an overwhelming and deeply moving sense throughout the biennale that art is at work again, picking up the pieces, sweeping away the dust and rubble. This isn't intellectual play, sudoku for the eyes. The vast majority of the artists chosen by Pedrosa have something to say and the urgency to say it clearly. And the inclusion of so many new artists makes the event feel truly international, rather than a parochial display of what obsesses the insular professional art world.\nThe highlights are too many, but don't miss: River Claure's photographs re-creating Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's 'Le Petit Prince' in contemporary Bolivian terms; a room full of Haitian art by the brothers Sénèque and Philomé Obin; utterly mysterious and deeply disturbing narrative works by the contemporary New York-based Pakistani artist Salman Toor; modern mosaics from the Lebanese artist Omar Mismar that take on subversive themes; landscapes by the Native American Kay WalkingStick; pastel abstractions mashed up with figurative asides by the Chinese artist Evelyn Taocheng Wang; paper cutouts with overtly queer subjects by the Chinese artist Xiyadie; and Rosa Elena Curruchich's tiny, but evocative folk paintings from the 1980s, hand-sized works that capture daily life among the Maya Kaqchikel of Guatemala.\nthe Lebanese artist Omar Mismar that take on subversive themes; landscapes by the Native American Kay WalkingStick; pastel abstractions mashed up with figurative asides by the Chinese artist Evelyn Taocheng Wang; paper cutouts with overtly queer subjects by the Chinese artist Xiyadie; and Rosa Elena Curruchich's tiny, but evocative folk paintings from the 1980s, hand-sized works that capture daily life among the Maya Kaqchikel of Guatemala.\nThe main exhibition curated by Pedrosa is the center of a constellation of other shows, including the national pavilions clustered in the Giardini and filling yet more warehouselike galleries in the Arsenale. The United States is represented by Jeffrey Gibson, a queer artist of Cherokee descent. Gibson has covered just about every inch of the neoclassical building, which ordinarily looks like a modest branch of a regional bank, with colors, a rainbow riot of geometric patterning from the base of the structure to the entablature. In wall-sized paintings, a stylized script spells out familiar political phrases ('We hold these truths to be self-evident') and more pointed references to Native American history ('The returned male student far too often goes back to the reservation and falls into the old custom of letting his hair grow long'). Inside, video and sculpture, including captivating birdlike forms with wildly colored dreadlocks, round out what the curators call a response to 'chromophobia,' the fear of color.\na stylized script spells out familiar political phrases ('We hold these truths to be self-evident') and more pointed references to Native American history ('The returned male student far too often goes back to the reservation and falls into the old custom of letting his hair grow long').

A sign in the window read: 'The artists and curators of the Israeli pavilion will open the exhibition when a ceasefire and hostage release agreement is reached.' Through the windows, you can see a video of what appears to be ancient stone sculptures of women, animated and keening with grief. Outside, armed guards were on patrol. And throughout Venice, in graffiti on walls and in spontaneous protests, was manifold evidence of world outrage at the brutal toll of Israel's response to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.\nAnd throughout Venice, in graffiti on walls and in spontaneous protests, was manifold evidence of world outrage at the brutal toll of Israel's response to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.\nHighlights of the national pavilions include Wael Shawky's mesmerizing opera video, 'Drama 1882,' using human figures in a hybrid puppet show that retells the history of a 1879-1882 rebellion against colonial rule. Shawky's extraordinarily evocative work is also on view off-site at the spectacular Palazzo Cavalli-Franchetti, on the Grand Canal, where the Doha Film Institute and Mathaf, the Arab Museum of Modern Art, have organized a high-tech, wide-ranging survey of contemporary art film called 'Your Ghosts Are Mine.' Based on the number of 'Ghosts' tote bags seen in Venice, this show has a huge promotional budget. But it's also a compelling sampler of serious contemporary cinema.\nAdvertisement\nThere are also 'collateral' events, 30 independent exhibitions or installations that come with the official imprimatur of the biennale. I saw a fraction of these but was moved by Berlinde de Bruyckere's installations at the basilica of San Giorgio Maggiore, one of Venice's most impressive churches, designed by Palladio. De Bruyckere, a Belgian artist, fills the sacristy of the church with wax casts of tree trunks, laid out on rusting metal furniture like patients etherized upon a table. In the nave, giant clothes draped from frameworks and huge mirrors suggest archangels, or the echoes of angels departed. The basilica, on an island separated from the main bustle of Venice, is a refuge for people who need a pause. De Bruyckere's spiritual art fills it with silence.\nOther exhibitions include a show at the historic Accademia devoted to the Dutch-born American artist Willem de Kooning, focused on work made during and in response to his trips to Italy. It offers a view of the artist completely detached from the darker side of his reputation, as a husband emotionally abusive to his wife Elaine de Kooning, and an artist who tortured the female form into parodies of hysteria. Italy refreshed him, inspired him to create sculpture and elicited drawings of remarkable, expressive power and playfulness. The exhibition ends with his late work, including a giant, luminous, spare 1987 painting called 'The Cat's Meow,' a docile tangle of red lines and yellow forms, that seems to replicate itself in a reflection on the polished dark floor.\nAn independent exhibition of work by Jean Cocteau at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection is a small delight that reinforces a theme of the biennale: Cocteau, a gay artist, was preternaturally talented, but his sexuality and his promiscuous crossing of formal boundaries left him both an insider and a suspect outsider, or stranger, to the orthodox art world. This show amends that unfair verdict. Another independent show at the Palazzo Donà dalle Rose, of work by the contemporary Italian artist Federico Solmi, is a wild affair, and another frontal assault on chromophobia. Solmi creates carnivalesque satires of contemporary politics and culture, full of grotesquerie and preening figures who ape the mad dance of power and narcissism that define the people we foolishly but reflexively call our leaders.\nAdvertisement\nWhen you visit someplace as saturated with history and beauty as Venice, you inevitably wonder when you leave: What will I remember? You may try to stuff your mind — or your cellphone camera — with impressions, to make the experience more real and lasting. This biennale inspires the same response. You want to distill it, and take away something larger than a long list of interesting things.\nPerhaps that helps explain the difference between this one, and other, lesser iterations. If there is some brighter sense of humanity on display, it may be because Venice has gathered artists who are grappling with that leave-taking need to preserve, retain and hold on to something significant. The world is worse than it ever was, but the artists aren't leaving without a fight.",

            "excerpt": "Dozens of the children of Flint, Michigan's lead-contaminated water crisis have turned their trauma into advocacy 10 years after it began",
            "summary": "FLINT, Mich. — Their childhood memories are still vivid: warnings against drinking or cooking with tap water, enduring long lines for cases of water, washing from buckets filled with heated, bottled water. And for some, stomach aches, skin rashes and hair loss.\nTen years ago in Flint — April 25, 2014 — city and state environmental officials raised celebratory glasses as the mayor pressed a button to stop the flow of Lake Huron water supplied by Detroit for almost half a century. That set in motion a lead and bacteria public health crisis from which the city has not fully recovered.\nBut dozens of children of the water crisis — now teenagers and young adults — have turned their trauma into advocacy. They provide input on public health initiatives, participate in social issue campaigns, distribute filters and provide free water testing for homeowners.\nAdvertisement\nThey know that Flint is a place that still struggles. The population has fallen by some 20,000 in the past decade, leaving abandoned houses as targets for arsonists. Almost 70% of children live in poverty, and many struggle in school. Although the water has been declared safe to drink, distrust runs deep, and hundreds of lead water pipes remain in the ground because homeowners were allowed to opt out of replacing them.\nBut the young activists say they want to help make a difference and change how their city is perceived by outsiders. And they want to defy expectations.\n'One of the biggest issues about growing up in Flint is that people had already decided and predetermined who we were,' said 22-year-old Cruz Duhart, a member of the Flint Public Health Youth Academy.\n'They had ideas about our IQ, about behavioral things, but they never really stopped to speak to us and how we thought about it and the type of traumas that we were going through.'\nAdvertisement\n___\nIt's always been easiest for 16-year-old Sima Gutierrez to express herself through art. Drawings, paintings and wire sculptures decorate her family's tidy bungalow.\nNow the self-described 'very shy' teen who rarely spoke up for fear nobody wanted to hear what she had to say collects water samples in people's homes and takes them to the Flint Community Water Lab, where more than 60 high school and college interns have provided free testing for thousands of residents since 2020.\nShe helped plan public awareness campaigns about topics like gun violence and how racism affects public health as a member of the Flint Public Health Youth Academy.\n'I wanted to be surrounded by people who weren't going to cover up the whole fact that people are still having problems,' said Sima. 'I was able to ... share my life (with) anybody else who's going through what I'm going through.'\nAdvertisement\nIt was a decade ago that she complained her stomach hurt when she drank water. Her mom insisted it would help Sima's body flush out medication she took for an autoimmune disorder that was causing her hair to fall out in patches and leaving her skin with light splotches.\nResidents had begun reporting skin rashes and complaining about discolored, smelly and foul-tasting water soon after the city began drawing from the Flint River to save money, until it could hook into a new Lake Huron pipeline. But they were assured everything was fine.\nSima said she wasn't aware of problems until one of her elementary school classmates, Mari Copeny — then a 7-year-old beauty pageant winner known as Little Miss Flint — began protesting. Mari became the face of the crisis, and continues to highlight environmental justice issues to almost 200,000 Instagram followers and to raise money, including for water filters that she gives out in communities across the U.S.\nAdvertisement\n'I want to keep on using my voice to spread awareness about the Flint water crisis because it's not just Flint that has a water crisis,' Mari said. 'America has a water crisis.'\n___\nAlmost a year and a half after Flint made its switch, residents frustrated with the water quality reached out to an expert who then found high lead levels caused by the city's failure to add chemicals that prevent pipe corrosion. State officials had said these were unnecessary. Around that same time, a pediatrician discovered that levels in kids' blood had doubled after the switch.\nOutbreaks of Legionnaire's disease, including a dozen deaths, ultimately were also linked, in part, to the city's water supply.\nFlint reconnected to its old water line shortly afterward, but because pipes continued to release lead. The state provided residents filters and bottled water.\nAdvertisement\nLead is a potent neurotoxin that can damage children's brains and nervous systems and affect learning, behavior, hearing and speech. There is no safe childhood exposure level and problems can manifest years later.\nData collected over a decade now show that children in Flint have higher rates of ADHD, behavioral and mental health problems and more difficulty learning than children assessed before the water crisis, said Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, the pediatrician who first flagged rising lead levels in Flint kids' blood. She said other issues, including nutrition, poverty, unemployment and systemic inequalities also could be factors.\nSima and three of her sisters were found to have elevated lead levels and have since been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; Sima also has a learning difficulty.\nAdvertisement\n'I felt responsible for forcing my child to drink something that was hurting her so bad, and I didn't believe her,' said her mother, Jessica Gutierrez, who works as a public health advocate for hospitals and nonprofits and fears for her daughters' long-term health.\nGuilt and anxiety are 'part of the trauma of the crisis,' Hanna-Attisha said.\nThat's why it's important for kids from Flint to feel they're being heard, to be part of the solutions, she said. For example, the Flint Youth Justice League, an advisory board to her Pediatric Public Health Initiative, has offered suggestions on programs that include prescribing fresh fruits and vegetables, reducing poverty and connecting residents to public services.\n'Our young people are amazing,' said Hanna-Attisha. 'They are not okay with the status quo and they are demanding that we do better for them and for generations to come.'\nAdvertisement\n___\nAsia Donald remembers feeling helpless and bewildered when her little sister developed rashes and her mom boiled pot after pot of bottled water for baths.\nBut just a couple years later, she was talking to kids from Newark, New Jersey, guiding them through their own lead-in-water crisis. Over Zoom meetings, the kids from Flint explained parts per billion, how to test water for lead and how they had coped with fear.\n'They felt the exact same way that I felt when I was ... going through it,' said Asia, 20, now an aspiring accountant and one of 18 interns at the Flint Public Health Youth Academy.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThey're paid a monthly stipend to run the academy — writing grants, creating budgets, analyzing data, conducting focus groups and creating public awareness campaigns. They have a biweekly talk show on YouTube, where they've discussed everything from mental health to COVID.\nAdvertisement\nLast summer, they planned and hosted a summer camp for dozens of kids that focused on gun violence and school shootings. This year, together with the Community Foundation of Greater Flint, they're coordinating a youth summit on community violence.\nDr. Kent Key, a public health researcher with the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine in Flint, started the academy after studying health disparities in the Black community as part of his doctoral dissertation.\nHe wanted to introduce Black kids to potential health careers, but also felt like 'everyone had written Flint youth off because of the impacts of lead.' So he gave them more than a voice, he said. He gave them control.\n'I did not want (the water crisis) to be a sentence of doom and gloom for youth,' he said. ' I wanted it to be a catapult ... to launch the next generation of public health professionals.'\n___\nDionna Brown, who was 14 when the water crisis began, became interested in advocacy after taking a class on environmental inequality at Howard University. Now she's planning her life around it — completing a master's degree in sociology from Wayne State University with plans to become an environmental justice attorney.\nShe's also national director of the youth environmental justice program at Young, Gifted & Green, formerly called Black Millennials for Flint and founded by advocates from Washington to support Flint after the crisis.\nBrown holds a two-week summer environmental justice camp in Flint every year to teach teens about issues such as policy, climate justice, sustainability and housing disparities. She also works with kids in Baltimore and Memphis.\nShe said the water crisis made Flint kids resilient.\n'I tell people all the time: I'm a child of the Flint water crisis,' said Brown. 'I love my city. And we put the world on notice that you cannot just poison a city and we'll forget about it.'\n___\nAssociated Press video journalist Mike Householder contributed to this story.\n___",

Solutions must include the home.':\nMr. King has done D.C. a service on this vexing and chronic issue once again. He very correctly points out the shortcomings of the D.C. government's policies in this problem area. Clearly, the deputy mayor for education and the schools need to play a crucial role in dealing with this. But, as Mr. King points out, unless and until the parents are required (and helped) to meet their responsibilities, major improvements are unlikely to happen. Two issues remain unaddressed, however: First, does the deputy mayor have the will and capacity to take the needed actions? And second, to what degree are poverty and, say, single-mother households behind the problem, and if so what problem-solving options do we have?\nRichard Moore , Washington\nRichard Moore, Washington\nFocusing on children's health\nThe April 11 news article 'Ohio GOP governor sells public health by focusing on kids' has an important undertone. Investing in children's health is our most powerful lever to create a healthier society and stronger economy. Gov. Mike DeWine (R) says, 'It's hard to sell stuff on the basis of public health.' I know the feeling. As a pediatric surgeon and CEO of a children's health system, I fight the uphill battle of selling public health every day.\nAdvertisement\nI believe Mr. DeWine has got it right. In this country, we mistakenly equate health with medical care. Medical care is an important but relatively small part of health. The governor's health agenda is built around children, as it should be. It includes safety, good nutrition, freedom from violence, early education and more. All these factors are major determinants of health, and all can be markedly affected by small investments during childhood.\nBeyond improving our population's health, this agenda's economic benefits are enough to appeal to both sides of the aisle. Studies show that spending a dollar now to set a child up for lifelong health yields shockingly high returns to taxpayers and the broader economy for years, decades and even generations to come. Mr. DeWine is correct in saying, 'Everyone wants to see kids do better.' I couldn't agree more. It is time to prioritize public health by investing in our children.\nR.

We saw this vividly during the pandemic beginning in 2020, when urban dwellers relied on green spaces as a rare source of beautiful and socially distanced outdoor respite.\nClimate change gives us the clear imperative — and opportunity — to prioritize nature in the urban planning of U.S. cities. What does this look like? A study from the Global Center for Clean Air Research finds that the unique infrastructure of botanical gardens has a measurable cooling effect on city air temperatures. This emphasizes the importance of plants, including trees, in greening our cities. By restoring and conserving a diverse array of plant life, especially in dense urban environments, we create much more livable cities for people, wildlife and future generations.\nAdvertisement\nNo less valuable are the communities that green spaces cultivate. Urban farms and community gardens are a powerful way to plant social connections, while also spreading nature within cities.\nWe urge all city leaders and urban planners to support well-managed urban conservation projects and green spaces. As the percentage of Americans living in cities rises sharply, doing so has the potential to be transformational.\nJennifer Bernstein , New York\nJennifer Bernstein, New York\nThe writer is president and CEO of the New York Botanical Garden.\nThe writer is president and CEO of the New York Botanical Garden.\nNot all experiences are the same\nRegarding Ariel Dorfman's April 11 Thursday Opinion commentary, 'Ecuador takes a page from Pinochet with embassy assault':\nBefore we condemn Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa to purgatory for violating Mexico's sovereignty by storming its embassy in Quito to arrest former vice president Jorge Glas, let's look at what Mr. Dorfman did not say in his piece. Mr. Dorfman compares this action with his own experience of escaping a certain death at the hands of oppressive military dictator Augusto Pinochet by finding refuge in the Argentine Embassy in Santiago, Chile, in 1973.\nAdvertisement\nBut Mr. Dorfman was truly vulnerable, and his refugee status saved his life. Mr. Glas, on the other hand, was convicted twice for corruption, receiving prison sentences of six and eight years. In one case, he was convicted of taking millions of dollars from a Brazilian construction company and, in the other, he was found guilty for his role in a scheme that collected bribes for public procurement.\nTo further question whether Mr. Glas was even worthy of asylum, he was released from prison early in a controversial ruling by Judge Emerson Curipallo. Judge Curipallo is now in custody pending an investigation into his alleged role in a bribery scheme involving favorable rulings for a drug lord and others.\nMr. Dorfman cites the importance of respecting the 20th-century refugee protections that are included in a series of agreements and laws. Are these protections designed for convicted criminals? If so, where then does the search for asylum by bad people end?\nAdvertisement\nMaybe it's time to revisit these agreements and laws to ensure that those most vulnerable are protected in their time of need while not giving protection to convicted criminals such as Mr. Glas.\nCurtis Schaeffer , Falls Church\nCurtis Schaeffer, Falls Church\nThe need for Ukraine aid\nRegarding the April 15 news article 'Iran attacks add urgency to stalled aid efforts for Israel':\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nWithout reservation, I support Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. I agree entirely that Israel is of central political and historical importance to the United States. This said, I take issue with Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) when he states that 'Israel's a much closer ally, is a much more core American national security interest' than Ukraine.\nMr. Vance is dead wrong. When Israel is attacked, we must surely support it with the weapons and materiel needed to secure their self-defense. To my knowledge, however, we are not bound by treaty to place troops in Israel, nor to make war directly against another nation on Israel's behalf. The same cannot be said of Europe.\nAdvertisement\nRussia has made clear that it aspires eventually to reconquer those European countries once comprising the Soviet empire. Ukraine stands in the way of that aspiration. Some countries of the old U.S.S.R. are now our NATO allies, whom we are formally required to defend in the event of attack. Should Ukraine fall, and history be a guide, Russia would gain borders with its former vassal states and then could pick its spots to begin snatching territory from NATO's easternmost members. In this case, more U.S. troops would have to be deployed to Europe at incalculable risk to us and the entire world.\nIn a real sense, the United States is already fighting its war with Russia. Ukrainian citizens, however, are doing the fighting for us; their lives and their blood, not ours, are lost. What do we gain for the money and equipment supplied to NATO or to Ukraine? We gain the privilege of watching a war fought on European ground, at massive cost to its people and not so much to ours — in my view, a pretty good bargain.\nMr. Vance and his some of his Republican colleagues in Congress seem to be advocating for Russia, in effect making arguments for the Russian cause. My response: It is neither fair nor accurate to compare the gravity and enormity of our obligation to NATO (or Ukraine) with our close ties to Israel or, please, to connect any of this with our problems at the border with Mexico.\nAdvertisement\nBill Coe , Washington\nBill Coe, Washington\nThree parties aren't a crowd\nIn the April 9 Prompt 2024 newsletter, 'Why is it so hard to find a winning third-party candidate?,' Alexi McCammond and her colleagues made several meritorious points. However, it is important to note that third-party and independent candidates must contend with various built-in roadblocks from state sore-loser and disaffiliation laws to debate rules controlled by the two-party duopoly and designed to stifle competition.\nAdditionally, in the case of No Labels' recent attempt to recruit a 'unity ticket,' potential candidates were fearful of playing the role of spoiler and tipping the election to Donald Trump. Enactment by each state of a unified, nonpartisan/open primary system in conjunction with ranked-choice voting (RCV) as practiced in Alaska would render moot that major criticism of the No Labels ballot access effort. RCV shuts down the spoiler argument by eliminating the candidate with the least number of votes round by round until a majority of votes is obtained by one candidate. Such a reform offers a long-term solution to reduce polarization in our politics, and serves fairness as opposed to disenfranchisement by allowing independent/unaffiliated voters to participate in state-funded primaries. No Labels and other like-minded groups can work together to advocate such reforms and need not win an election to win the day.\nKenneth F. Cerullo , Mahwah, N.J.\nKenneth F. Cerullo, Mahwah, N.J.",

            "summary": "MR. LYNCH: Hello, and welcome to Washington Post Live. I'm David J. Lynch, global economics correspondent here at The Post.\nToday we have two segments on American manufacturing and the emerging workforce. Later we'll hear from the president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Valerie Sheares Ashby. But first, I'm joined by Jay Timmons, the president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers.\nJay, welcome to Washington Post Live.\nMR. TIMMONS: Great to be here, David. Thanks for having me.\nMR. LYNCH: Well, we're glad you could join us.\nSo let's set the stage for how things look in manufacturing. The number of factory jobs is up almost 800,000 since President Biden took office. As a percentage of total employment, however, it's about flat. But spending on new factories has shot through the roof. It's roughly double what it was three years ago. So what's your assessment of the overall health of the American manufacturing sector right now?\nAdvertisement\nMR. TIMMONS: So David, I would say we're--you know, look, we're very strong right now. There's no question about it.\nI think it's important to put this into a historic perspective, if you will. I think back to the work that President Bush 43, and even before him, Clinton and Bush 41 and Reagan and then President Obama, the work that they did to expand our trade agreements so that we could sell more products overseas. I think of the investments that were made during the Trump administration because of those just record tax reforms that were put in place as well as the regulatory certainty. And then, of course, you fast forward to this administration, and you look at the investments that were made through the President's manufacturing strategy in terms of infrastructure investment, the CHIPS and Science Act, and many provisions of the IRA. All of that has led to a place today where manufacturing is stronger than we've seen it in more than a generation.\nAnd, in fact, you referenced the number of manufacturing workers that are out there today. It's the highest number since 2008. The sector is seeing record investment in new plants and equipment, and you've also seen record wage growth. That's all because of these policies that were put in place by administrations of different political stripes. Now our challenge is to maintain this momentum that we have and ensure that America continues to lead the world economically and certainly leads the world through manufacturing prowess.\nAdvertisement\nMR. LYNCH: Well, that's a perfect segue into a question from one of our viewers. Anthony Vance from Washington, D.C., asks, 'Is the surge in manufacturing a temporary phenomenon largely stimulated by government policies instituted in the last three years, or is it likely to remain with us for a decade or so?'\nMR. TIMMONS: Well, I guess the answer to that is yes to both of those questions, Anthony, depending on what public policies are put into place.\nI mentioned this continuum that we've seen, this focus by both political parties, which is great, on growing the manufacturing economy here in the United States and making manufacturing even stronger. But we have some choices to make. We're at a crossroads. There's no question about that, and those choices, they all relate back to all of those issues that I've mentioned. And I would add one other, which I'll get to in a second.\nAdvertisement\nBut you have tax policy that has expired in terms of our ability to really prioritize innovation through the research and development tax deduction, interest deductibility, and immediate expensing. Those three things alone contribute to a significant amount of manufacturing investment here in the United States, and the fact that that has ceased to exist in the last couple of years and we're waiting for Congress to renew those incentives, it's chilling future manufacturing investment--or current and future manufacturing investment.\nThen you have the tax reforms of 2017 that are up for discussion and action in 2025, and those are specifically the rates for small- and medium-sized manufacturers who file as S-corporations. Those rates expire at the end of 2025. And what I fear is that there will be politicians, probably of both political stripes, who are trying to appease a very important part of their constituency and a very important part of the manufacturing economy, small businesses, by saying, well, why don't we just capitulate on the C-corp rate and raise that a few percentage points so that we can keep the rate low for small and medium manufacturers? And I say that is a losing strategy. You've got to have competitive rates across the board, and right now we're at 21 percent at the C-corp level. We need to maintain that. We also have to get--and in the promo video, the initial video, David, that you ran, it said that I argued against--I'm arguing against additional regulation. That's not quite accurate.\nI'm arguing actually for smart regulation, and that means business and government sitting down together to talk about what the possibilities are. We all agree on what the issues are before us, whether it's lowering carbon intensity or making sure that our drinking water is safe and our air is cleaner and our communities are healthier for our children and our grandchildren, but you can't just be aspirational about what your objectives are. You have to be very pragmatic and level-headed, and you have to understand what is possible in the world today as well as what will be possible in the world tomorrow. And then that goes right back to those incentives like the research and development tax deduction. If you want to innovate here in America, you've got to have all of those tools.\nAdvertisement\nI would also add that it's important to have trade agreements. We haven't negotiated one for over 10 years.\nAnd then, lastly, I would say it's extraordinarily important, Anthony, that we have the workforce that we need to fill the jobs that are open. We have almost 600,000 open jobs in manufacturing today. We're doing really well. But by the year 2033, we're going to need to fill 3.8 million jobs in our sector because of retirements or growth in our sector, and if things keep going the way they are, it's going to be about 1.9 million of those jobs that we can't fill. That's not sustainable. That doesn't allow us to be the leader in the world.\nMR. LYNCH: Let's--I want to--I want to talk about the administration's industrial policies, which are, at least in part, in good part, probably, responsible for some of this manufacturing uptick, which is the good news.\nAdvertisement\nMR. TIMMONS: No question.\nMR. LYNCH: But this sort of government-directed steering of the economy or steering of capital represents a big change from the market-oriented policies that we've seen in recent decades. Are you uncomfortable at all with the notion of government getting bigger and more involved in the economy?\nMR. TIMMONS: So I don't think there's any pure system when it comes to a free market economy, David. I think--you know, I think you have to be, again, pragmatic.\nThe fact is that China, sure, they're an economic competitor, and, you know, we can--we can deal with that if we were dealing with a level playing field and they were truly a free market economy, but they're not. They're a command economy. They manipulate. They manipulate markets. They manipulate how products are made.\nAdvertisement\nBut even more important than that is our national security interests. So, for instance, CHIPS and Science, that legislation that passed that provided billions of dollars of grants to incentivize chip fab facilities being built here in the United States, that was absolutely critical for our national security. We could not allow these devices to be made in the country where we may not always have the ability to have decent relations.\nSo I was pleased from a national security perspective that we invested there, but it also adds to our economic security, because everything today, as we all know, has some sort of an electronic component or a chip in its manufacture, in its body. So we have to have that capability here as well as some of the other investments, I think, that have been really important for ensuring our worldwide mantle of leadership.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, many of these industrial policy projects that the administration is promoting are in the clean energy space aimed at addressing climate change. Many of them are located, as you know, in so-called \"red states,\" where Republican lawmakers often have voted against the legislation that has created the projects in the first place. So what do you think is the likelihood that that kind of work, that kind of funding would survive a change in administrations?\nAdvertisement\nMR. TIMMONS: Well, to the best of my understanding, a lot of these--a lot of these grants and loans are going to be moving very quickly. The administration is trying to move them through the process very quickly.\nBut, you know, I'd like to take the politics maybe out of some of--some of these discussions. Yes, there are philosophical disagreements on how we're enacting some of these policies that are part of the president's manufacturing strategy, but ultimately, we all have the same goal. And the same goal is for the United States to be the leader, for the United States to grow its manufacturing base, and for the United States to be able to increase the number of workers in the manufacturing sector, because, quite frankly, manufacturing has led to a stronger and healthier quality of life and economic status for Americans all across the board. And politicians of both parties understand that.\nThey might look at things a little bit differently, right? So you may see--you may see some elected officials say, well, let's have a program where we can spend money, and you might have others say, well, let's have a program where you can incentivize through tax policy. I think either of those can work, and we can debate all day about which one is more effective or which one is more free market oriented. But ultimately, we all want to get to the same objective.\nAdvertisement\nMR. LYNCH: You mentioned earlier the need for smart regulation. I'd be interested if you could provide sort of your favorite example of a grossly misguided regulation that puts burdens on your members that would strike the audience as almost ludicrous, not something that's a minor irritant that might take just a little bit more paperwork but something that you think is just obviously counterproductive and ought to be eliminated.\nMR. TIMMONS: Well, you want to make this really dramatic, it seems, so I--[laughs].\nMR. LYNCH: No, I want to--I want to give--I'm giving you a chance to--\nMR. TIMMONS: Yeah, I understand.\nMR. LYNCH: --help explain to viewers what changes you need to see.\nMR. TIMMONS: Yeah. Let me start with a positive because I think--I think--and then I'll get to a specific regulation that answers your question.\nOn the positive side, I can point to the Securities and Exchange Commission and their work about two years ago to introduce a climate emissions regulation that was going to be imposed on all businesses of all sizes. We had some real concerns with that proposal, because in the end, we couldn't comply. There was literally no way to comply with that regulation. This was an example of a regulatory agency, regulators, and the business community collaborating, talking, discussing what the goals and objectives are from the regulatory side or the regulator side of the aisle, and what the possibilities were and the realities were from the business side. And in the end, David, the SEC literally addressed every single thing that we said was problematic. So that's an example of how you can work together.\nNow, we don't love that regulation. Let me just be very clear about that. But it's a regulation that I think is at least achievable, and the agency listened. The other side of that is the particulate matter, PM2.5 regulation that was issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, which is--you know, it is onerous for manufacturers and actually is counter to what the president is trying to achieve through his manufacturing strategy. What the PM2.5 regulation will do, quite simply, is it will shut down the ability of businesses to invest and build new facilities in many communities across this country. It's going to cause mayors and governors to make a choice between, say, building a bridge that might be available or might be possible through the infrastructure funding legislation that was passed or having the private sector come in and build a new chips facility. These choices are going to be--these tradeoffs are going to be present very soon. That regulation is now in place, and it's going to cause a lot of very difficult decisions, and it's going to impede growth. It's going to impede the ability of manufacturers who could actually help solve the climate issue, to build facilities and innovate and create new products, to be a part of the solution. So it's one of those regulations that, frankly, is just not smart.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, you mentioned permitting issues a bit earlier, and that's been a perennial complaint for years. There was some movement, I think, at one point last year. There was a brief glimmer of hope for improvement that, I think, faded away. Are you at all optimistic about anything changing in that regard, say, in this calendar year, or is that inevitably something that gets pushed over to a new administration or the next administration?\nMR. TIMMONS: I am always an optimist, and on this, I am really optimistic. And the reason I am, David, is because Republicans and Democrats have both indicated--or they have all indicated to me that they're very concerned about the permitting process.\nIf you think about it, again, from the business perspective, where you want to put that shovel in the ground, but it's taking years for a permit to be able to do so, whether that's because of state agencies or federal agencies, and then you have--think about the clean energy investments that the administration is making right now, we simply can't get things built because of the lack of a streamlined permitting process.\nAnd then also think about if we're--if we're talking about our competition with China and China's ability to produce and mine critical minerals for many of those batteries and clean energy technologies that we're trying to employ here in the United States, but our inability to do so here because it takes 15 years to get a mine permitted, 15 years from now, I'm sorry, but China will have the advantage.\nSo we've got to figure out how to make sure that we are protecting safety, we're protecting environmental standards, but moving the process along much more quickly. And I would say also coordinating the various agencies that have to sign off on permits, coordinating their work, so that you have one--you know, one timeline rather than, say, 10 timelines, because you have 10 agencies that are part of the process.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, the unemployment rate remains quite low by historical standards, still plenty of job openings out there. What's the labor market look like for your members? Are they having trouble finding enough workers? And is that going to be a choke point, particularly for some of these projects in the chip world, where I think some of the efforts out in Arizona by TMSC have already run into snags in terms of the availability of skilled labor?\nMR. TIMMONS: Yeah, it is definitely a problem. As I mentioned, we have almost 600,000 jobs open in our sector.\nI'm really proud of our industry, though, because there are, of course, many open jobs throughout the entire economy. I don't know what it is now, eight-, nine-, ten million open jobs. But I'm proud of our industry because they took it head on, and they are continuing to do so. Not only are they upskilling and training the workers that are part of their--part of their employee base now so that those jobs are future-proofed as new technologies come on board, but they've also invested in programs to recruit the next generation of manufacturing workers.\nHere at the NAM, we had a campaign called Creators Wanted, and Creators Wanted went to communities all over the country to inspire young people with a--kind of a hands-on escape room concept to show them what skills are necessary in manufacturing. And, David, you could just see these young people come out beaming and saying, \"I want to be a part of manufacturing. How can I do this?\"\nWe went to my hometown of Circleville, Ohio, for the Circleville Pumpkin Show. We had thousands of kids going through that experience and coming out and saying, \"I want a job,\" and that's really important, because in central Ohio, you have two very big investments. You have the Honda and LG battery facility that's being created in the Mount Sterling area, and then you have the Intel facility that I was happy to attend the groundbreaking of with President Biden in the Columbus area. And those two plants alone are going to hire thousands and thousands of people.\nSo we've got an obligation, right, as the industry to take this on, but making sure that we have the right educational tools in place at the local level and having states work with us, which many are doing to ensure that we have the technical training that's necessary, that's important as well.\nMR. LYNCH: Yep. Well, Jay, I've still got several more questions for you, but unfortunately, we are out of time. So thanks for a great conversation. Jay Timmons, thanks for joining us today.\nMR. TIMMONS: Thanks for having me, David.\nMR. LYNCH: Next up, we'll hear from the President of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Valerie Sheares Ashby, right after this. So please stay with us.\n[Video plays]\nMR. ETZWILER: Hi. I'm David Etzwiler, CEO of the Siemens Foundation. Last fall, the Siemens Foundation created an EV charging workforce initiative called Everyone Charging Forward. Because the electric vehicle charging sector is experiencing rapid growth, there is and will be for the foreseeable future a significant need for workers in EV manufacturing, installation, and maintenance. What we recognized was a confluence of need and opportunity to draw more people from all backgrounds into this growing industry, and that's really what this initiative is all about, working together with our government, business, labor, philanthropy, and community partners to ensure everyone, especially those from underserved communities, has access to resources that can connect them to clean energy careers.\nHere with me today is Cheryl Sanford, director of Workforce Programming, MUST Careers, in Detroit, Michigan, which is developing a career readiness program with a heavy focus on the electrical field.\nHi, Cheryl. How are you?\nMS. SANFORD: I'm doing well, David. Thank you for having the conversation today.\nMR. ETZWILER: Absolutely, my pleasure.\nCheryl, MUST works with the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program, one of the foundation's partners, implementing statewide strategies and local partnerships. Tell us more about EVITP's and MUST's Electric Fast Track program and how it operates.\nMS. SANFORD: Thank you. I'm really excited about this new initiative in partnership with Siemens.\nThe program is really twofold, the purpose of the program is twofold. One is to upskill the current electricians with the EVITP training and certification, and that's for electricians that will be working on the EV charging installation projects going on all over the country.\nThe second part of the program--and this is really something that's new. It's only been piloted in--well, in our experience, we've piloted this program once in Michigan, and that is to provide a work-based learning opportunity for individuals who are thinking maybe they want a career in EV electrical industry but lack that hands-on experience. So this is an opportunity to provide career awareness and some of the hands-on experience that we always hear from our contractors. You know, when we're trying to help individuals make that connection and get into building trades, especially electrical, they lack the hands-on experience. So this is an opportunity to do that with a 10-week paid work experience component that will really take individuals who have had some classroom training and provide them with the kind of work-based learning, hands-on experience. So they'll get to work alongside journeyworker electricians and really decide if this is the best fit for them.\nMR. ETZWILER: Cheryl, that's great background. Help us understand the current demographic makeup of the electrical field and the future of the sector. Why the focus on new entrants?\nMS. SANFORD: Because we know over the foreseeable future that we are going to need more electricians, based on the historic investment in infrastructure in the country, which is fantastic.\nBut we know, for example, in the state of Michigan, that between now and 2030, we will need approximately 13.5 percent increase in electricians. In North Carolina, which is the other area where we will be piloting the program, the demand is expected to increase up to 17 percent.\nMR. ETZWILER: Wow.\nMS. SANFORD: And we know just looking at the demographics, again, in the state of Michigan, when you look at construction overall, less than 6 percent of the construction apprentices are females, approximately 17 percent for people of color, and for youth, it's less than 1 percent. So all of this investment provides a historic opportunity for us to really expand the pipeline of talent and to be more inclusive and diverse and to do it in a very intentional way. So we want to make sure that we are reaching out to those previously underserved populations to make sure that they are included, and the fact is that more and more of the skilled electricians are retiring.\nSo according to the National Electrical Contractors Association, approximately 10,000 electricians--this is nationwide, but 10,000 electricians retire every year. About 7,000 are coming in. So we--you know, we know that there's a gap, and again, that provides an opportunity for programs like the Electric Fast Track to fill that need and to reach out to those individuals who probably never thought they could work in this field. They never even thought about it. So with career exploration outreach, it just gives us an opportunity to be much more inclusive.\nMR. ETZWILER: Yeah. So much urgency in the statistics you give. What are the partnership trends or best practices that you're seeing around the country? What, for example, is necessary and helpful in these types of partnerships in local communities?\nMS. SANFORD: Well, we know from the work that we've done in this space, and MUST and EVITP have worked together for a long time working on providing those kind of programming opportunities for the building trades industry. And what we've learned is that industry engagement is key, and those partnerships are really key to the successful outcomes of this kind of program. So if we don't have industry at the table, then we're just training for the sake of training. We want to make sure that every participant who goes through this program will have a successful outcome, hopefully employment in the industry in a registered apprenticeship, and if by chance they decide after 10 weeks of working in the Electric Fast Track that this just isn't a good fit for you--maybe you've decided, you know, you thought you wanted to be an electrician, but you really don't--we have workforce development partners, community-based partners. And this provides an opportunity for us to redirect them back through the system.\nSo, you know, we don't want it to be a failure for someone because you decided you don't want to work in the construction industry or in the electrical industry. Our goal is to help those individuals find the occupation that is a better fit for them.\nMR. ETZWILER: That's great, Cheryl. That's a wonderful overview of all of that.\nAnd if I had to underline one takeaway from today's discussion, it's the importance of business, labor, and communities coming together to engage and support new and diverse entrants in the clean economy workforce. It's the right thing to do, and it's imperative to the success of our country's decarbonization, economic, and security goals. We simply must ensure participation by everyone in our economy.\nCheryl, thank you for being here today and for the insightful conversation. I look forward to our continued partnership, and with that, I'll turn it back to the Washington Post.\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nMS. SANFORD: Thank you.\n[Video plays]\nMR. LYNCH: Hello, and welcome back. For those just tuning in, I'm David J. Lynch, global economics correspondent here at The Post.\nI'm joined now by Valerie Sheares Ashby, president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Valerie, welcome to Washington Post Live.\nDR. ASHBY: Thank you so much. It's a pleasure to be here.\nMR. LYNCH: Well, we're glad to have you with us.\nNow, for any of our viewers who may not be familiar with UMBC and its historical role, its traditional role as an enormous pipeline of Black graduates in the STEM fields, perhaps you could just take a moment and educate us all. In particular, what was the opportunity that attracted you to the school a couple of years ago, and how do you plan to build on its already impressive legacy?\nDR. ASHBY: Well, I so appreciate that question. This is the question that energizes me daily.\nSo I'm really proud of UMBC. So for those who may not be familiar, UMBC is located in this Baltimore County area, which is very close to Washington, D.C., obviously, and so we are situated in a place where we have industry around us, we have government agencies around us, where the STEM workforce that they need is just tremendous. And we're also situated, obviously, in the state of Maryland that is very diverse, and so we are a public institution. It is our job to actually educate the Marylanders first and provide this workforce that is needed, and UMBC has been a leader for decades in this space.\nWe produce--we're number one in the production of Black undergraduates in the fields of the life sciences, mathematics, and computer science combined. That's quite a feat for us. And we produce these students, and they go on to do amazing things, not only in the state of Maryland but all over the country.\nWe're also the number one producer of Black graduates who go on to get MD-PhDs. So now they are scholar researchers in medicine, and so we're really proud of that. That has been our history.\nAnd I would just note that the goal is just to produce excellent scholars, and it turns out that when you actually have a goal of producing excellent scholars, you become more inclusive.\nAnd so for UMBC, part of what we say in our vision statement, in the very first sentence, is that we are not going to call ourselves excellent if we're not inclusive, and so that really then has been the impetus for everything that we do for years. And so we have now achieved this status, and it has become a part of our culture that we just expect all of our students to be excellent. And underrepresented minority students, in particular, are just thriving in this environment.\nAnd by the way, that's what drew me here. I am a chemist by training, as you know. So to come to an institution with this history and at this moment for our country, we really need to continue to do what we're doing, and we not only need us to do it, but we need all of higher education to really take this on as a priority.\nMR. LYNCH: Well, first of all, I promise not to ask you any questions about chemistry. That would be a\nshort conversation, at least on this side of the camera.\nDR. ASHBY: [Laughs] If I had a blackboard, I'd draw some organic chemistry formulas behind me, but, okay, not this time.\n[Laughter]\nMR. LYNCH: Not this time.\nSo Black students, in general, of course, are underrepresented in the sciences but not at your institution. So what's your secret? What should other universities be doing that they're not doing if they wanted to replicate your success?\nDR. ASHBY: So, you know, we can look back and really understand and learn, you know, some best practices that aren't rocket science, which that's the good news. It's not rocket science. Literally, anybody who has the desire can do this.\nAnd so what we have learned, mostly as a start from our Meyerhoff Scholars Program, which is nationally known, is that if you give students the opportunity, you give them the support, you give them a cohort, you give them the encouragement, you give them the opportunity to do research and to see themselves as scientists, then you really have given them everything that they need. And those students become successful. They get the highest grades in our courses. They go on to do internships and great research, and they go on to get PhDs and MDs and MD-PhDs. And so it's about this culture where our expectation is that our students will be successful, and so it is not about remedial anything. They're quite capable. The question is, are we giving them all the opportunities and the support in order to be successful in these disciplines? So that's the way we have approached this.\nMR. LYNCH: Let's talk a little bit about national policy now. I don't know if you caught our earlier segment, but we were talking a little bit about the Biden administration's industrial policies, particularly in the area of semiconductors, clean renewable energies, and the like. What's your assessment of the outlook for producing the size, skilled workforce that we're going to need to make those programs a success, and do you see that--those areas as an opportunity for your future graduates?\nDR. ASHBY: Without a doubt. These are the areas that we are training our students. It is the basic sciences. It is engineering. It's the social sciences. It's the fullness of the liberal arts education that's rooted in STEM. So absolutely, our students are qualified now and will be qualified for emerging technologies.\nThe other piece to this is that we are very clear about giving our students--I heard in a previous--in the previous segment--hands-on opportunities as a part of that preparation.\nSo for example, you were talking to Jay, who was mentioning about--talking about manufacturing. There, we have real digitized manufacturing facilities on this campus where students can now understand cybersecurity threats in relationship to digitized manufacturing, and not only that, we are upscaling those who are actually in the manufacturing fields, where these are professionals who come onto our campus. And they are allowed to now--they can upscale and really understand the connection between cybersecurity and manufacturing. And so it's a combination of tools that we are using to prepare our students, and we absolutely have students that are so well prepared. And the question is, how many more can we produce?\nMR. LYNCH: Now, artificial intelligence is obviously a topic that everyone in business and government and your neighborhood is talking about these days, and there seem to be broadly two views of it in a labor market context. Mark Cuban, I saw, quoted the other day, saying that the disruption we're going to experience in the next several years will dwarf anything we've seen in past technological changes.\nAt the same time, David Autor of MIT, who's a very well-known economist who popularized the term \"China shock\" in regard to the effect on unskilled labor in this country from the rise of China's manufacturing power, he's actually quite optimistic about the effects of AI. He says it may, in fact, revitalize the middle class. I'm curious what your view is, as someone who's in the field. Should we be worried about this from a labor market standpoint, or is it mostly upside?\nDR. ASHBY: So I would have to say to you, first of all, that I am an optimist, and as a scientist, new technology does not scare me. And I understand all of the downsides and the possibilities for people who--look, anytime you have new technology, people can use it for bad or they can use it for good, and so it's our job to actually train our students in order--so that they will be able to use the technologies for good. So it does not scare me.\nAnd also, I should just mention that not everybody needs a college degree. Let me just say that. So when we talk about the workforce that's going to be needed, it's going to be a number of college-educated students. It's going to be a number of students who have advanced degrees. But it's also going to be people who are going to community colleges or people who have high school diplomas who just have the skill set.\nSo we have an opportunity to have an impact on the education from high school all the way through an advanced terminal degree, and so with that kind of optimism, I'm confident that we can upscale a workforce that is broad. And also, by the way, I should mention this is why universities that educate their students in a liberal arts fashion are so important, because we will not only teach our students the science, but we will teach them the ethics. And that's critical for what we are talking about whether you--and by the way, we need to do that in high school and middle school and every other place. But that's why I am optimistic.\nI see our students. They are brilliant. They want to use this technology for good, and that gives me hope every day.\nMR. LYNCH: I think that last remark about liberal arts deserves a moment, because I think some people see a sharp choice between what they regard as meaningful, career-focused endeavors like the STEM fields, and then liberal arts, which is regarded as some sort of playground of listening to music and going to plays. But it's really much more than that, isn't it? It's about learning how to think and learning where ideas come from and learning the history even of scientific thought.\nDR. ASHBY: Yes, without a doubt. And so this is a place where we are not delivering a full education, if it is not a full liberal arts and sciences education. It is all of those disciplines that you just mentioned.\nBut just think about any of these scientific fields, and think about how you are going to apply that in a community where you don't understand their history. You don't understand the challenges. You don't understand the environment. You don't understand the culture. So we can produce all sorts of wonderful technologies, but communities may not adopt them or they may not trust our science if we don't understand how to enter communities and how to engage them as a part of the scientific process. So this is really important.\nAnd let me just throw in a little bit of data, because I know sometimes people say, oh, anecdotally, people love a liberal arts education. Ninety-two percent of my undergraduates walk out of this institution either going into employment or into graduate school, and 93 percent of them, of my undergraduates who have--with a college degree finished their four-year degree, are in disciplines that they studied. And so I just, you know--the talk about a liberal arts education and music and art and all those things and that's all you do--and let me just also say, I think it's a little bit of a matter of the mental health and well-being of our entire world.\nPeople need a whole life, and a whole life includes music and art and understanding religion and culture and the environment, all of those things, and there's something that happens in communities when people are happy. And so when you just think about just the ways that we don't even know how to have conversations with each other anymore, not just about STEM-related issues, but about anything--so I'm a real fan of a liberal arts and sciences education. I am a chemist, but I treasure my religion class and my philosophy class and my writing course and my communications courses. So it's a full package.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, UMBC obviously remains quite affordable, but colleges across the country are under pressure, deservedly so, for rising costs. There's a lot of frustration about tuition bills, and you hear a lot of voices saying, you know, with it being just so expensive, you know, college just isn't worth it anymore. What would you say to those folks, even acknowledging that, you know, college is not necessarily for everybody? But what do you say to folks who say it's just gotten way out of hand how expensive it is?\nDR. ASHBY: So several things. So first, let me say I am delighted to be in the University System of Maryland, which is a public system in the state of Maryland, and our costs in public higher education in the state of Maryland are, you know, relatively reasonable compared to many other institutions across the country.\nThat being said, there literally is not a single other game changer in a person's life that's more significant than a college education. It changes our health. It changes our communities. It changes our service. It changes the way we engage the political system. It changes everything that makes a life full.\nAnd for people particularly who come from economically challenged backgrounds, there is no greater game changer than a college degree, and so this is critical for us to state.\nNow, I do appreciate all of the talk about how expensive it is. Indeed, it can be. Even at our reasonable cost, it can seem expensive. Therefore, it's incumbent upon us to actually make it more accessible. So whether that's through increased need-based financial aid or various types of scholarships, it is important for us to make it available to students. It changes their lives. It changes their families' lives for generations. It changes communities. But it's our job in higher education to make our case and so to really help families understand the difference maker that this is.\nMR. LYNCH: Now, the Supreme Court last year severely limited the use of affirmative action and race in college admissions. How are universities adjusting to this change? How worried are you that that's going to be a further headwind working against efforts to increase minority representation in the STEM fields in particular?\nDR. ASHBY: So let me speak just about UMBC, and then maybe I can speak about it more broadly. I'm really proud. I go back to your original question of why I decided to come to UMBC and what drew me here.\nThis is an institution that, again, has understood that if you are not inclusive, you cannot be excellent. So when you think about STEM fields where we're talking about innovation and creativity, you need diverse teams of people from diverse backgrounds, diverse disciplines. All of that is necessary to be as creative and innovative as possible, and so for UMBC, this is not a challenge for us because we are simply looking for excellence. And by doing so, we are actually very inclusive, and so we have a campus that looks like our community, which is a beautiful thing.\nAnd so for me, this is just rooted in excellence. If we don't have multiple perspectives at the table and in the creation process and in the problem-solving process and the solution-making process, then we cannot be excellent.\nSo for us, it is not a challenge. If you walk across our campus, it looks like our community. It looks like the world, and because of that, students are getting a phenomenal education.\nNow, if you were actually using quotas to just check the box, to say that we have some diversity on our campus, you have a problem, because now you have to decide how serious are you about that, and do you really think you can be excellent without it?\nNow, that's--I'm glad that's not our question. It is not. But for universities and maybe some other institutions where it wasn't a priority, because you didn't really believe that excellence equaled diversity or diversity equaled excellence, now this is a challenge.\nAnd so I would say that my students who sit in a classroom, whether it's in the social sciences or humanities or natural sciences and they sit in that classroom with a diverse group of students to discuss hard, challenging topics, they are receiving a world-class education. And so it's a challenge for us in higher education to decide, do we really believe you can be excellent without diversity or not? And at UMBC, that's not our question.\nMR.

            "summary": "What does it mean to be a modern prince?\nIf you follow the British royal family, it means a heir and a spare, locked in a spiral of history, melodrama and betrayal. If you watch Hallmark movies, princes are invariably handsome but restive kings-in-waiting who find true love with scrappy American commoners.\nAnd then there's Denmark's Prince Joachim, who moved to Washington D.C. last summer. The prince, 54, is the son of Queen Margrethe II and the younger brother of King Frederik X, who was crowned in January when their mother abdicated after 52 years on the throne. Joachim is a working royal, a military defense expert, a husband, father, and a racecar aficionado. His job, and it is a job, is to represent Europe's oldest monarchy and carry it into the future.\nis a job, is to represent Europe's oldest monarchy and carry it into the future.\n'You reach back in time — in the Danish case, more than a thousand years,' he said last month. 'And you are — it may sound odd to say — the living legacy of that national identity.'\nAdvertisement\nSkip to end of carousel\nThe Style section\nThe Style section Style is where The Washington Post covers happenings on the front lines of culture and what it all means, including the arts, media, social trends, politics and yes, fashion, all told with personality and deep reporting.

The nation's capital plays hosts to royals from all over the world — usually when they are students — thanks to a huge international community and the anonymity it affords those born into these dynasties, This is his best shot at a drama-free life away from royal reporters who obsess over the comings and goings of even minor European nobles.\nAnd yes, the Danish royals have had their share of family drama. The queen made international headlines two years ago when she stripped Joachim's four children of their royal titles — a surprise, seemingly random move that is still a touchy subject. Then she shocked the country this past New Year's Eve when she announced she would abdicate; in a low-key ceremony, Frederik became king just two weeks later, leaving the two brothers to navigate a new, more formal relationship.\nSo it's a good time for a fresh start, a chance for Prince Joachim (pronounced Yo-ahh-cheem ) and his family to have some fun away from the spotlight. He's come to the United States to serve as defense attaché for the Danish embassy — working with the Pentagon and other NATO allies — and, in a broader sense, teach Americans about Denmark. (Was Hamlet a real prince of Denmark? Sorry, no.)\nYo-ahh-cheem) and his family to have some fun away from the spotlight. He's come to the United States to serve as defense attaché for the Danish embassy — working with the Pentagon and other NATO allies — and, in a broader sense, teach Americans about Denmark. (Was Hamlet a real prince of Denmark? Sorry, no.)\nAnd so the prince and his wife, Princess Marie, have agreed to sit for a rare interview at the Danish ambassador's residence. He's tall and lanky with almost perfect English; his wife, a French native, is petite and elegant and also fluent in English, thanks to a stint in New York years two decades ago. He's in a suit; she's in a pink blazer. No pomp, no circumstance, no flash.\nHis brother, just a year older, was destined to be king. But the role of a second royal son is always a balancing act: It comes with a title, expectations and an income but no real job description. It's the ultimate choose your own adventure. By the time he was eight years old, Joachim thought he would be a gentleman farmer, a profession he studied and pursued with mixed success: He was, he joked, very good at 'the gentleman part.'\nAdvertisement\nInstead, he found his calling in the Danish military. After completing his education (he speaks Danish, French, English and German), he enrolled in the reserves while also a working royal. Five years ago, he was invited to enroll in the elite École Militaire in Paris — a year-long program for officers and defense experts — then he was named a Danish brigadier general and a military attaché at the embassy in France. Last year, the palace announced he would be moving to Washington, where he would also focus on defense.\n'It's about defense industrial cooperation,' he explained. 'My main task here to pave the way — boost, help, inspire — for Danish defense industries, large and small, to enter the U.S.: Either provide or sub-supply, get into that big chain of regenerating and resupplying our armed forces.' In short: One of the thousands of diplomats in this town (who happens to be a member of the royal family).\nRufus Gifford, who became a celebrity in Denmark during his years as the American ambassador, got to know the royal family well. 'Joachim has been such a force for good in that he has always understood his role.' Here's a prince, he said, developing the relationship between the United States and Denmark as a NATO ally, taking on a serious and sensitive responsibility instead of coasting on his title. 'For him to keep his head down and do this work and be a fantastic representative of the country is something I think is extremely admirable.'\nAdvertisement\nAside from crown princes and princesses — whose career path was decided at birth — other royals have to find a role beyond the occasional state appearances. Most opt for nonpolitical jobs: Norway's Princess Märtha Louise stopped using her title professionally after criticism she was exploiting it for business purposes; Prince Philippos of Greece works in New York finance; Willem-Alexander, king of the Netherlands, flew as a KLM pilot for years.\nJoachim had the freedom to choose a profession, and that was doubly true in his personal life. The Danes are pretty open-mined when it comes to the royals, who are allowed to marry for love instead of bloodlines. King Frederik famously met his Australian wife, now Queen Mary, at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and married her four years later. In 1995, Joachim married a Hong-Kong marketing executive and had two sons, Nikolai, 24, and Felix, 21. The couple divorced ten years later. In 2008, he married Marie Cavallier, a French marketing and advertising executive; they have two children: Henrik, 14, and Athena, 12.\nAs Kate and Meghan know all too well, marrying into royalty isn't the fairy tale one might assume, even though you can become an actual princess. You fall in a love with a person; you marry a country.\n'I had high expectations,' said Princess Marie. 'I wanted to speak Danish perfectly. I wanted people to be proud of me. I wanted to fit in. So I think I put a lot of pressure on myself. But Denmark is actually an easy country to live in. Why? Because people respect each other a lot. I don't feel it's there's a lot of conflicts. Things work well.'\nThe Danes seem to enjoy their monarchy, which goes back to the 10th-century Vikings. They love the former queen and love her family.\nAdvertisement\n'The Danish monarchy very much is leading the way as it relates to what it means to be a modern royal family,' said Gifford. Their agenda includes climate change, trade, technology, what he calls 'next generation issues.'\nShare this article Share\nShare this article\nShare this article\nShare\nShare\nThe Danish are also very good at be royal without being snobs. 'Denmark is the least hierarchical society that I've ever lived in, for sure,' he explained. 'And yet the royal family is the definition of a hierarchy.' The pomp and circumstance is balanced by the things that connect them to average, ordinary people: road races, biking, sitting in the cold or rain (it rains a lot ) without complaining.\nlot) without complaining.\n'Danes like having a king or queen,' said Paol Pederson, a member of the Danish Club of Washington. 'It lends a calmness and stability to the view of Denmark.' Pederson was raised there — he remembers going to the Copenhagen as a child to see the royals in person — and has met the queen three times. Danish politicians actually run the country, Pedersen pointed out, and it is the royals who preserve the traditions and history. 'But they are expected to work for a living.'\nAdvertisement\nThe elephant in the throne room is the question of money. In most constitutional monarchies, the royal families are supported by taxpayers who are increasingly vocal about what they're getting. The British royals, already personally very rich, receive more than $100 million in public funds per year. To counter criticism, many of the smaller monarchies in Europe have downsized over the past few years, limiting the amount and number of people who receive anything from the public dole.\nIn 2016, the queen reduced the number of working royals who receive an annuity from the government to just her household, the crown prince (now king), her sister Princess Benedikte, and her younger son. She also stipulated that Frederik's oldest son, Christian, would be the only grandchild to receive an annuity as an adult; the other royal grandchildren are expected to work in paying jobs as adults.\nThe royal budget is public information: The 2023 financial report lists a total of $13 million in public funds; as a full-time working royal; Prince Joachim receives about $575,000 a year.\nAdvertisement\n'There are some who say that if you look at it in a tribal way, everybody has to contribute, right?' said the prince. 'And what you contribute is what you will be measured by. That means thanked for or blamed for.'\nMoney is one thing; titles are another. In 2022, the royal family found itself in a rare and public drama after the queen announced Joachim's four children would no longer be called royal highnesses and downsized them to 'excellencies' although they retain their respective places in the line of succession. They were prince and princess when they were born; they would now be know as the counts and countess of Monpezat (their grandfather's family title). The queen explained that she felt this was necessary for the future of the monarchy and the children would be better able to shape their lives without the formal affiliation to the Royal House. (King Frederik's four young children are still princes and princesses.) The queen's decision echoed Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf, who in 2019 demoted five grandchildren who were not in direct line for the throne.\n'I always feel great love for my entire family,' the queen said in her December 2022 New Year's Eve address to the nation. 'Difficulties and misunderstandings may arise in any family, also in mine. The whole country has witnessed that. That the relationship with Prince Joachim and Princess Marie has run into difficulties makes me sad. We have now had a quieter period and time for reflection, and I am sure that our family can embark on the new year together with confidence, understanding and new courage.'\nAdvertisement\nTitles are a clearly a sensitive subject for the Danish royals. Then-Princess Margrethe married French native Henri Marie Jean André de Laborde de Monpezat in 1967; throughout their long marriage, Henrik was publicly unhappy that she never upgraded him from Prince Consort to King Consort. So unhappy in fact, that when he died in 2018, he refused to be buried in the tomb reserved for the couple. Instead, he was cremated and his ashes split between a palace garden and the sea.\nFast forward to 2022: Prince Joachim and both wives — former and current — were united in their displeasure about the way the young princes and princess were downsized, saying they were blindsided and disappointed.\n'We weren't happy about the way it happened,' said Princess Marie. 'But it's a family thing. It's complicated.' What some people might see as frivolous is something more, she said: 'It's also their name. It's their identity since they were born. So it's more than just what people see as a title.'\nBut what's done is done: The queen always gets the last word in any argument. 'We've moved on,' Joachim said. (He was all smiles at his brother's coronation.)\nIn the smaller world of European royalty, it matters — but only to a certain extent. They all know each other — many are related — and the difference between being a prince or a count may not be a game changer in the larger scheme of their lives.\nAdvertisement\nJoachim's older sons are launched (Nikolai is a fashion model; Felix is in business school) and his younger children are thriving in an international school here in Washington.\n'We've lived here for seven months now, and very few people know who we are, Danes apart,' said the prince. The prince and princess can fly under the radar or use their titles to leverage attention for causes they care about. He's a patron to 60 organizations; she's been working on the issue of hunger and food waste for years, and since arriving in Washington has partnered with Veteran Coalition International, a Danish American nonprofit that focuses on long term care for international/NATO veterans and their families.\nBut you also might spot the Danish royals at a Formula One race. The prince calls historical cars and motor racing 'my passion.' He has his own racing car, and won 'five or six' Danish championships. The princess is also a fan; the family expects to attend races in the United States.",
