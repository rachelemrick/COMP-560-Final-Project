It also suggests that partisanship may not have as much of an impact on this group's environmental views, compared to Americans overall.\nA recent poll from AAPI Data and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds 84% of AAPI adults agree climate change exists. In comparison, 74% of U.S. adults hold the same sentiment. And three-quarters of AAPI adults who accept climate change is real attribute it entirely or mostly to human activity. Among the general U.S. adult population surveyed in an AP-NORC poll in September, only 61% say humans are causing it.\nThe poll is part of an ongoing project exploring the views of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, whose views can usually not be highlighted in other surveys because of small sample sizes and lack of linguistic representation.\nScientists overwhelmingly agree that heat-trapping gases released from the combustion of fossil fuels are pushing up global temperatures, upending weather patterns and endangering animal species. Many scientific organizations have made public statements on the issue.\nIn terms of partisanship, the percentage of AAPI Democrats, 84%, who acknowledge climate change falls exactly in line with the share of Democrats overall in the September poll. The share of AAPI Republicans who believe there is a climate crisis is lower, but they somewhat outnumber Republicans in general, 68% versus 49%.\nAdrian Wong, 26, of Whippany, New Jersey, is registered as unaffiliated but leans Republican. A biology major in college, the Chinese American says the science behind climate change is indisputable.\n'I've probably done more or looked more into it than the average person has,' Wong said. 'It's to me clear that it's changing due to human activity, not natural shifts.'\nThere has been growing conflict within the Republican Party between those who insist climate change is a progressive-generated hoax and those \u2014 mostly younger generations \u2014 who say the issue cannot be ignored. GOP lawmakers, in general, refuse to consider measures like mandated lowering of carbon emissions. However, some consider that an untenable position long-term. American Conservation Coalition, the largest conservative environmental group in the nation, has said Republicans running for office cannot risk alienating people who care about climate change.\nWong is not surprised that AAPI conservatives like himself recognize that the climate is changing. He thinks they are more highly educated and more likely to be exposed to science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n'It wouldn't surprise me if they were more likely to have studied more and actually more likely to have studied in science and STEM-related fields rather than, say like, finance or something,' Wong said.\nWhile climate change is an afterthought to her parents, Analisa Harangozo, 35, of Alameda, California, worries a great deal about it. She has noticed a rise in 'crazy heatwaves and droughts and just like crazy weather in general' in the San Francisco Bay Area. She and her husband are teaching their sons \u2014 ages 7 and 4 \u2014 to take small steps to reduce their carbon footprint like composting, growing food and eating less meat. They're also trying to minimize their accumulation of household items.\n'I always second-guess myself, \u2018Do I really need this?'' Harangozo said. 'Stuff will eventually end up in the landfill. So, we're really mindful with the products we buy, and whether or not they can be recycled or they're made from materials that are natural, like wood or what-not.'\nA registered independent with Democratic leanings, Harangozo is open to proposals from California Gov. Gavin Newsom and other state lawmakers to slash greenhouse gas emissions and invest in renewable energy.\n'I'm not knowledgeable enough to know what an attainable goal is,' she said. 'But, whatever it takes to actually make a difference, I'm all for it. I fully support.'\nKarthick Ramakrishnan, a public policy professor at the University of California, Riverside, and founder of AAPI Data, said the richness and detail of the data shows environmental groups need to consider reaching out to AAPI populations. They make up a relatively small share of the U.S. population \u2014 around 7%, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of 2021 census data \u2014 but their numbers are growing quickly.\n'Asian American and Pacific Islander voters are environmental voters,' Ramakrishnan said. 'Many of us still have an image in our minds of a particular kind of person maybe of a particular race, gender or age group. What we see here is across the board Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders care about the environment.'\nAsian American and Pacific Islanders may also have more of a stake in climate change because of connections to relatives abroad. China, considered one of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases alongside the U.S., vowed last year to reduce emissions. More Chinese companies are considering selling wind and solar power equipment in other countries. Around this time last year, Japan was preparing for another sweltering summer and risks of floods and landslides. That country has also pledged to curb emissions.\nHeavy rains swept across Pakistan last month, causing landslides and leaving over 36 people dead and dozens of others injured. In 2022, unprecedented rainfall and flooding in that country killed more than 1,700. In India, farmers are grappling with frequent cyclones and extreme heat. In southern India, the city of Bengaluru is seeing water levels running desperately low after an unusually hot February and March.\n'There's a fairly high level concern of what climate change means to low-income countries,' Ramakrishnan said. 'That sensitivity is either because people still have friends or family back in their home country or at least have some concern about what climate change does to other countries.'","rights":"nbcnews.com","rank":224,"topic":"news","country":"GB","language":"en","authors":"The Associated Press","media":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-08/230814-hawaii-wildfire-aftermath-jm-1613-6103be.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"NBCNews","_score":8.081977,"_id":"bcf5a38a018075bf2011c312369d2c7a"},{"title":"Europe is the fastest-warming continent, at nearly twice the average rate, report says","author":"Associated Press","published_date":"2024-04-22 17:58:31","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/europe-fastest-warming-continent-twice-global-average-report-rcna148829","clean_url":"nbcnews.com","excerpt":"The latest 5-year averages show that temperatures in Europe are running 2.3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, compared to 1.3 degrees higher globally.","summary":"Europe is the fastest-warming continent and its temperatures are rising at roughly twice the global average, two top climate monitoring organizations reported Monday, warning of the consequences for human health, glacier melt and economic activity.\nThe U.N.'s World Meteorological Organization and the European Union's climate agency, Copernicus, said in a joint report that the continent has the opportunity to develop targeted strategies to speed up the transition to renewable resources like wind, solar and hydroelectric power in response to the effects of climate change.\nThe continent generated 43% of its electricity from renewable resources last year, up from 36% the year before, the agencies say in their European State of the Climate report for last year. More energy in Europe was generated from renewables than from fossil fuels for the second year running.\nThe latest five-year averages show that temperatures in Europe are now running 2.3 degrees Celsius (4.1 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, compared to 1.3 degrees Celsius higher globally, the report says \u2014 just shy of the targets under the 2015 Paris climate accord to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nFirefighters and volunteers work to extinguish a burning field during a wildfire in Saronida, Greece, on July 17, 2023. Nick Paleologos / Bloomberg via Getty Images file 'Europe saw yet another year of increasing temperatures and intensifying climate extremes \u2014 including heat stress with record temperatures, wildfires, heat waves, glacier ice loss and lack of snowfall,' said Elisabeth Hamdouch, the deputy head of unit for Copernicus at the EU's executive commission.\nThe report serves up a continental complement for WMO's flagship state of the global climate report, which has been published annually for three decades, and this year came with a 'red alert' warning that the world isn't doing enough to fight the consequences of global warming.\nCopernicus has reported that March marked the 10th straight month of record monthly temperatures. The average sea-surface temperature for the ocean across Europe hit its highest annual level in 2023, the Europe report said.\nThe European report focuses this year on the impact of high temperatures on human health, noting that deaths related to heat have risen across the continent. It said more than 150 lives were lost directly last year in connection with storms, floods and wildfires.\nThe cost of weather- and climate-related economic losses in 2023 were estimated at more than 13.4 billion euros (about $14.3 billion).\n'Hundreds of thousands of people were affected by extreme climate events in 2023, which have been responsible for large losses at continental level, estimated to be at least in the tens of billions of euros,' said Copernicus director Carlo Buontempo.\nExtreme weather fanned heat waves, wildfires, droughts and flooding, the report said. High temperatures have contributed to a loss of glacier ice on the continent, including in the Alps \u2014 which have lost about 10% of their remaining glacier ice over the last two years.\nStill, the report's authors pointed to some exceptions, such as how temperatures were below average in Scandinavia and Iceland even if the mercury was higher than average across much of the continent as a whole.","rights":"nbcnews.com","rank":224,"topic":"news","country":"GB","language":"en","authors":"Associated Press","media":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-04/240422-spain-heat-wae-al-1331-6741bc.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@NBCNews","_score":7.212827,"_id":"0e2487bdb540f6e0aa7fd4ad97657cdc"},{"title":"Biden is marking Earth Day by announcing $7 billion in federal solar power grants","author":"The Associated Press","published_date":"2024-04-22 12:36:49","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/biden-marking-earth-day-announcing-7-billion-federal-solar-power-grant-rcna148768","clean_url":"nbcnews.com","excerpt":"Biden's latest environmental announcements come as he is working to energize young voters for his reelection campaign.","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden is marking Earth Day by announcing $7 billion in federal grants for residential solar projects serving 900,000-plus households in low- and middle-income communities. He also plans to expand his New Deal-style American Climate Corps green jobs training program.\nThe grants are being awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency, which unveiled the 60 recipients on Monday. The projects are expected to eventually reduce emissions by the equivalent of 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and save households $350 million annually, according to senior administration officials.\nBiden's latest environmental announcements come as he is working to energize young voters for his reelection campaign. Young people were a key part of a broad but potentially fragile coalition that helped him defeat then-President Donald Trump in 2020. Some have joined protests around the country of the administration's handling of Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\nSenior administration officials said young Americans are keenly invested in the Biden climate agenda and want to actually help enact it. The Climate Corps initiative is a way for them to do that, the officials said.\nSolar is gaining traction as a key renewable energy source that could reduce the nation's reliance on fossil fuels, which emit planet-warming greenhouse gases. Not only is it clean, but solar energy can also boost the reliability of the electric grid.\nBut solar energy can have high costs for initial installation, making it inaccessible for many Americans \u2014 and potentially meaning a mingling of environmental policy with election-year politics.\nForty-nine of the new grants are state-level awards, six serve Native American tribes and five are multi-state awards. They can be used for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens.\nBiden is making the announcement at northern Virginia's Prince William Forest Park, about 30 miles southwest of Washington. It was established in 1936 as a summer camp for underprivileged youth from Washington, part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps to help create jobs during the Great Depression.\nBiden used executive action last year to create the American Climate Corps modeled on Roosevelt's New Deal. He is announcing Monday that nearly 2,000 corps positions are being offered across 36 states, including jobs offered in partnership with the North American Building Trades Unions.\nBiden has often used Earth Day as a backdrop to further his administration's climate initiatives. Last year, he signed an executive order creating the White House Office of Environmental Justice, meant to help ensure that poverty, race and ethnic status do not lead to worse exposure to pollution and environmental harm.\nHe has tried to draw a contrast with GOP congressional leaders, who have called for less regulation of oil production to lower energy prices. Biden officials counter that GOP policies benefit highly profitable oil companies and could ultimately undermine U.S. efforts to compete with the Chinese in the renewable energy sector.\nBiden will use his Virginia visit to discuss how 'a climate crisis fully manifest to the American people in communities all across the country, is also an opportunity for us to come together,' said White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi.\nHe said the programs can 'unlock economic opportunity to create pathways to middle-class-supporting careers, to save people money and improve their quality of life.'\nThe awards came from the Solar for All program, part of the $27 billion 'green bank' created as part of a sweeping climate law passed in 2022. The bank is intended to reduce climate and air pollution and send money to neighborhoods most in need, especially disadvantaged and low-income communities disproportionately impacted by climate change.\nEPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe said she was 'looking forward to these funds getting out into the community, giving people skills, putting them to work in their local communities, and allowing people to save on their energy bills so that they can put those dollars to other needs.'\nAmong those receiving grants are state projects to provide solar-equipped roofs for homes, college residences and residential-serving community solar projects in West Virginia, a non-profit operating Mississippi solar lease program and solar workforce training initiatives in South Carolina.\nThe taxpayer-funded green bank has faced Republican opposition and concerns over accountability for how the money gets used. EPA previously disbursed the other $20 billion of the bank's funds to nonprofits and community development banks for clean energy projects such as residential heat pumps, additional energy-efficient home improvements and larger-scale projects like electric vehicle charging stations and community cooling centers.\nThe Associated Press","rights":"nbcnews.com","rank":224,"topic":"science","country":"GB","language":"en","authors":"The Associated Press","media":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-04/240422-solar-panels-kentucky-mn-0835-9f5ad0.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@NBCNews","_score":7.115578,"_id":"5676807203cfcd3334fe70df589b7848"},{"title":"Tall flowers, dead shrubs, ephemeral lake: Death Valley has become a picture of climate whiplash","author":"Evan Bush","published_date":"2024-04-20 11:00:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/death-valleys-wildflowers-lake-are-picture-climate-whiplash-rcna148241","clean_url":"nbcnews.com","excerpt":"After ping-ponging between severe drought and record rainfall, the famed California desert is offering up strange scenes.","summary":"Climate scientists have long predicted that global warming would both aggravate droughts in California's inland deserts and also intensify bouts of rainfall. Death Valley locals say they're watching that dynamic play out in real time. How desert plants, animals and local economies adapt to the changes in an environment that's already one of the most extreme on Earth will determine the future of this symbol of resilience.\n'It's interesting to have a front row seat,' Donnelly said. 'This is the signature of climate chaos.'\nA 1-in-1,000-year storm \u2014 twice Susan Sorrells, who owns the ecotourism town of Shoshone, which is near Death Valley National Park, said the area's weather is 'always a roller coaster ride.'\nBut that has been especially true over the last couple of years. In early 2022, Death Valley, like the rest of the American Southwest, remained mired in the driest period since the year 800. During the 22-year drought, soil moisture reached an all-time low. Plants were withering, including the creosote bush, which is known to live for thousands of years, thanks to deep roots that search for water and can survive on very little.\nIts dieback during drought, then, was evidence of the weather's severity.\n'Desert shrubs are really tough and slow to die,' said Lynn Sweet, a research ecologist at the University of California Riverside. 'But at some point, there is mortality.'\nThen, in August of that year, a deluge arrived.\nIn several hours, Death Valley National Park received a record 1.7 inches of rain \u2014 about three-quarters of its typical annual total. The 1-in-1,000 year storm, as weather forecasters would later call it, washed out park roads, moved boulders and trapped cars in debris.\nAbout a year later, remnants of Hurricane Hilary, a rare Pacific hurricane, dumped 2.2 inches of rain on the park \u2014 exceeding its typical annual rainfall in one day and setting a new 24-hour record.\n'To have the worst drought in recorded history and the most precipitation in history, it's clearly climate whiplash,' Donnelly said.\nRoad crews along Highway 190, where most of the road was washed out by Tropical Storm Hilary the week before, in Death Valley on Aug. 31, 2023. Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images file The rain closed the park, as well as Highway 127, which connects it to gateway communities but had become 'a raging river,' Sorrells said.\nShe operates an ecotourism business with a 20-bed inn, hiking trails, a trading post, an RV park and the Crowbar Cafe and Saloon. For Sorrells, the situation was dire, as the highway's reconstruction was slated to last through the winter and into spring, making the area nearly impossible to access throughout its busy season.\n'We have a local joke: We make all our money from October through the end of April, and then we lose it from May through September,' she said.\nThe community rallied together and pushed state leaders to speed up the project, Sorrells said. The park partially reopened in October, and the highway in January.\nThen things took a fascinating turn.\nSpring wildflowers, which germinated in the fall, survived a warm winter, when freezing temperatures would typically knock them back down, according to Donnelly. And in February, a multiday atmospheric river storm system brought another deluge.\nThe wildflowers 'lasted long enough for the atmospheric river to recharge them with all this rain,' Donnelly said. 'Now, they're growing in a very unusual way. They're much taller than normal, much thicker-stemmed, very robust wildflowers.'\nThere was also enough water to revive Lake Manly, an ancient lakebed usually filled with dust.\nFor the first time, the National Park Service announced in February that it would allow kayakers to paddle on the lake, which was as deep as 3 feet, according to NASA.","rights":"nbcnews.com","rank":224,"topic":"gaming","country":"GB","language":"en","authors":"Evan Bush","media":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-04/240419-death-valley-wildflower-mn-1530-369d36.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"NBCNews","_score":7.0862923,"_id":"ed2f0a2d4ef4c5fcd3080eb149894b4c"},{"title":"Conservative environmentalist discusses the politics of climate change","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-17 02:05:29","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/conservative-environmentalist-discusses-the-politics-of-climate-change-209125445666","clean_url":"nbcnews.com","excerpt":"Conservative environmentalist Benji Backer talks with NBC News' Gadi Schwartz about the politics of climate change, solutions for the future and his new book, \"The Conservative Environmentalist.\"","summary":"Play All","rights":"nbcnews.com","rank":224,"topic":"gaming","country":"GB","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/mpx/2704722219/2024_04/1713319085220_now_staytuned_conservative_environmentalist_240416_1920x1080-uczpzn.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@NBCNews","_score":7.0393806,"_id":"5392fcc002bb8acec32a36ff6f26a9a9"},{"title":"Worsening allergies tied to climate change and severe weather","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-18 23:22:29","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/worsening-allergies-tied-to-climate-change-and-severe-weather-209291845793","clean_url":"nbcnews.com","excerpt":"As doctors report more severe allergy symptoms in patients, scientists are blaming climate change and severe weather.

When corals are stressed, they turn white as they release symbiotic algae that live in their tissues. Bleaching is a signal that corals' health is endangered.\n'When a coral bleaches, it doesn't mean it's dead. It means it's weak and at risk of dying if conditions don't get better,' said Ana Palacio, an assistant scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies, a research institute that is based at the University of Miami in partnership with NOAA.\nCorals are critical ecosystems that support a vast array of fish and aquatic species, which help feed coastal communities and attract tourists. The economic value of reefs is estimated at $2.7 trillion per year, according to a 2020 report from the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network.\n'They protect our coastline. They offer protection from storms and hurricanes. They have a great value for our economy and safety,' Palacio said.\nCoral ecosystems are among the ecosystems scientists think are most at risk because of global warming. In 2018, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that 70% to 90% of the world's coral reefs would disappear if global average temperatures crossed a threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average.\nLast year was Earth's hottest on record. Average global temperatures approached that threshold for the first time, though scientists believe the temperatures were boosted by El Ni\u00f1o and that 2023 was an anomaly.\nIn Florida, as sea surface temperatures spiked, bleaching started early in the season, experts said.\n'Normally, bleaching will be observed in the Northern Hemisphere around August and September. We started to observe bleaching in July last year,' said Phanor Montoya-Maya, a marine biologist with the Coral Restoration Foundation, an organization that collects, restores and repopulates corals.\nPalacio said the region saw widespread mortality of elkhorn and staghorn corals, two species that have been the focus of restoration efforts.\n'In some locations, about 20% of those populations survived,' Palacio said of restored corals. 'We're concentrating our hope on why those corals survived and what they can tell us about resistance and how corals can be more resilient.'\nThe last global coral bleaching event happened in 2014 and lasted until 2017. More than 56% of global reef areas saw temperatures that could cause bleaching during that time period.\nBleached coral at the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, off the coast of Galveston, Texas, in the Gulf of Mexico, on Sept. 16, 2023. LM Otero / AP In an email on Monday, Manzello said that 54% of the world's coral reef areas had experienced bleaching-level heat stress in the past year and that the event was poised to become the worst bleaching event in history.\n'The percentage of reef areas experiencing bleaching-level heat stress has been increasing by roughly 1% per week,' Manzello said. 'It is likely that this event will surpass the previous peak.'\nMontoya-Maya said a bleaching alert is already in effect in Florida, even earlier than last year. He said the Coral Restoration Foundation was preparing for a busy summer responding to another bleaching event.\nThe natural pattern of El Ni\u00f1o has begun to dissipate and NOAA's Climate Prediction Center estimates there is a 60% chance La Ni\u00f1a develops this summer, which could help cool Atlantic waters and allow some corals to recover, at least temporarily.\n'This is quite heartbreaking and it's going to cause damage to a lot of reefs in the world,' Palacio said. 'I'm hoping this bleaching event is going to create some traction and people will start caring more and paying attention to what's happening with the climate.'\nEvan Bush","rights":"nbcnews.com","rank":224,"topic":"science","country":"GB","language":"en","authors":"Evan Bush","media":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-04/240415-coral-bleaching-mn-1515-434439.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"NBCNews","_score":6.5835094,"_id":"ed461ab2443e2c952fd1a71b1c980365"},{"title":"Heavy rains cause rare flooding in Dubai","author":"Denise Chow","published_date":"2024-04-16 21:44:27","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/heavy-rain-rare-flooding-dubai-middle-east-rcna148056","clean_url":"nbcnews.com","excerpt":"Flights into Dubai International Airport were temporarily diverted as a result of the storms, which appeared to inundate the tarmac.","summary":"Heavy rains battered parts of the Middle East on Tuesday, closing schools in the United Arab Emirates and flooding the tarmac at Dubai International Airport.

The annual rainfall in the UAE averages between 140 to 200 mm.\nThe NCM's statement followed an earlier Bloomberg report, in which Ahmed Habib, a meteorologist, had said that the Tuesday rains had stemmed partly from cloud seeding. Habib later told CNBC that six pilots had flown missions as part of regular protocol but had not seeded any clouds. CNBC was not able to independently verify the reports.\nCloud seeding, a process used to enhance rainfall, has been an integral part of the UAE's mission to solve water shortages. Seeding missions were introduced in the 1990s, and more than 1,000 hours of cloud seeding are now performed annually.\nThe NCM said it had tracked the incoming heavy rain but did not target any clouds during that period, attributing the storm to natural rainfall.\n\"We take the safety of our people, pilots, and aircrafts very seriously,\" AlYazeedi said. \"The NCM does not conduct cloud seeding operations during extreme weather events.\"\nThe Gulf state has experienced a rise in rainfall in the last few years, and precipitation is expected to increase by up 30% by the year 2080, according to a January study published in the journal Nature.\nTraditionally characterized by its desert climate and scarce rainfall, the UAE has experienced shifts in weather patterns as a consequence of climate change.\nThe UAE government's National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority issued warnings on X ahead of the extreme weather conditions and urged residents to stay home and adhere to safety guidelines.\nThe UAE's infrastructure and buildings are designed for the weather patterns typical to the region, so drainage systems struggled to keep up with the unprecedented downpours, resulting in flooding along many roads and at the Dubai airport.\nJoan Muwahed, CNBC","rights":"nbcnews.com","rank":224,"topic":"science","country":"GB","language":"en","authors":"Joan Muwahed","media":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-04/240417-dubai-floods-ch-1530-e87520.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"NBCNews","_score":6.347047,"_id":"d8922ac57a31196a0af44dc3abae2c75"},{"title":"Climate change: the connection between land and sea","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-22 14:32:48","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/climate-change-the-connection-between-land-and-sea-209458757675","clean_url":"nbcnews.com","excerpt":"The ocean makes up about 71 percent of the Earth's surface and what goes on beneath the water is still largely unknown.

Most of Ecuador's energy is from hydro-power.\nNot all the referendum measures \u2014 which can be approved or rejected separately \u2014 relate to security.

'And it is a microcosm of what is happening around the rest of the world.'\nThe northern city of Tianjin, home to more than 15 million people, was identified as one of the worst-hit. Last year, 3,000 residents were evacuated after a 'sudden geological disaster' that investigators blamed on water depletion as well as the construction of geothermal wells.\nMany of China's old coal districts have also suffered as a result of overmining, with authorities often forced to inject concrete into the crumbling shafts to reinforce land.\nThe problem is not limited to China. A separate study published in February said around 2.4 million square miles of land across the globe was at risk. Among the worst-hit countries is Indonesia, with large parts of the capital, Jakarta, now below sea level.\nNicholls said vulnerable cities could learn lessons from Tokyo, which sank by about 16 feet until it banned groundwater extraction in the 1970s.\n'Subsidence mitigation should be looked at very seriously, but you can't stop all of it so you are talking about adaptation and building dykes,' he added.\nOf the 44 major coastal cities suffering from the problem, 30 were in Asia, according to a 2022 Singapore study.\n'It is a problem of urbanization and population growth \u2014 larger population density, more water extracted, (and) more subsidence,' said Matt Wei, a geophysics expert at the University of Rhode Island.","rights":"nbcnews.com","rank":224,"topic":"news","country":"GB","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-04/240419-Zhuozhou-flooding-al-0530-e038bc.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@NBCNews","_score":5.0071435,"_id":"8b5be50547a59769413479daa0d26a8c"},{"title":"California official ousted for Covid remarks now accused of putting employee's desk on roof, workplace bullying","author":"David K.

'I think this incident and the stories of these brave maintenance workers, who stood up in public to share their stories and trauma, shows the the poor judgment of our superintendent to keep this person in place.'\nAnother school board member, Jag Lathan, declined to reveal on Thursday whether she wants Anello out. But the trustee made it clear that Turnage's alleged action was beyond the pale.\n'When I found out, I was horrified. That was unacceptable,' Lathan said. 'What I can tell you is that school district culture and climate matter. If our staff feels unsafe, that's unacceptable.'\nKen Turnage. KNTV Turnage, Anello and the superintendent's husband \u2014 former Antioch police chief Allan Cantando \u2014 did not immediately return messages seeking their comment on Thursday.\nEarlier this month, when an NBC Bay Area reporter questioned Anello during the public comments portion of a board meeting, the school's chief remained awkwardly silent for a minute and did not answer any queries about Turnage.\nFour years ago, when he held the position of Antioch's planning commission chairman, Turnage made national headlines with Facebook comments about Covid-19 at the peak of the pandemic.\nHe said that permitting illness to spread \"allows the sick, the old, the injured to meet its natural course in nature.'\nAnd if the virus had an impact on homeless people, at least that would \"fix what is a significant burden on our society and resources that can be used.'\nTurnage deleted the Facebook post following public outcry, but refused to resign. The Antioch City Council voted unanimously to remove his from his position as planning commission chairman over the remarks.\nTurnage made $78,741 in base pay with the school district in 2022 in his current job, the latest data reported by Transparent California, a data base of public employees compensation.

Shares of the electric vehicle maker tumbled almost 6%, falling to their lowest since May of last year, after CEO Elon Musk told employees the company is eliminating more than 10% of its global workforce.\n'There is nothing I hate more, but it must be done,' Musk wrote in a memo about the layoffs.\nTesla shares have been spiraling since the calendar turned, tumbling 29% in the first quarter, the worst period since late 2022 and the third-steepest drop since the company's initial public offering in 2010. The stock is 60% below its peak reached in November 2021.\nPrevious layoffs haven't drawn such market pessimism. In 2018, when Tesla cut 9% of headcount, shares rose more than 3%. In 2022, the stock plunged 9% on initial reports around layoffs but recovered after Musk made clarifying comments days later.\nThe Tesla of today finds itself in a different kind of predicament.\nEarlier this month, the automaker reported a drop in vehicle deliveries in the first quarter, the first annual decline since 2020 when the Covid pandemic disrupted production. In China, Tesla has faced an onslaught of competition from domestic EV makers, including BYD and the phone maker Xiaomi.\nPrior to the layoffs, Tesla had been cutting prices and providing other buyer incentives, leading to likely margin erosion. Last week, the company said it's slashing the subscription price of its premium driver assistance system, marketed as Full Self-Driving (FSD), by half for customers in the U.S. FSD doesn't make vehicles autonomous and requires an attentive driver at all times.\nAccording to the most recent available data from Kelley Blue Book, EV prices across the board were lower by 9.7% year over year in March, thanks to 'strong incentive packages.' Tesla's prices hit bottom in January, although their prices were edging higher in March.\nMonday's sell-off wasn't just about layoffs, as Tesla executives Drew Baglino and Rohan Patel announced they're leaving the company. Baglino had worked with Tesla since its early years, starting as a firmware and electrical engineer in 2006. Patel joined Tesla in 2016 after working as a senior advisor to former President Barack Obama on climate issues and other matters.\nMusk said in the layoffs memo that 'it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increased productivity.' However, analysts and investors see a demand problem,\nAccording to FactSet, 18 analysts have lowered their price targets on Tesla shares this month, while none have gotten more bullish.\n'Just when you think the news couldn't get any worse for Tesla, we have EV demand questions that have been popping up over the last few quarters,' Doug Clinton, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said on CNBC's 'Squawk Box' Monday. 'We have questions now about whether they're going to build the low-cost Model 2, price cuts on FSD.'\nTesla began to acknowledge earlier this year that 2024 growth might be 'notably lower' compared to the prior year. The company has said it's between two waves of EV growth but has refrained from issuing guidance for 2024.\nBeyond increased competition and the dynamics of the EV industry, there's also the unpredictability that comes with Musk.\nThe billionaire has faced scrutiny from multiple regulatory agencies over his dealings at X, formerly Twitter, and shareholders have expressed concerns about whether he's devoting enough attention to Tesla. Musk serves as CEO of SpaceX, owns X, started artificial intelligence venture xAI and runs brain computer interface company Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Co.\nMeanwhile, he has repeatedly disparaged undocumented immigrants, ranted against corporate diversity initiatives and reposted false conspiracy theories.\nMusk has previously said that he hadn't missed any 'important' meetings at Tesla, and that he wasn't 'totally missing in action.'\nTesla didn't respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nRohan Goswami, CNBC","rights":"nbcnews.com","rank":224,"topic":"business","country":"GB","language":"en","authors":"Rohan Goswami,Lora Kolodny","media":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-04/240416-tesla-mn-0845-342a73.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@NBCNews","_score":4.3293533,"_id":"f6c210ede9e19db7d89bcded66f09004"},{"title":"House progressives release an agenda for 2025, with ideas for Biden to excite the base","author":"Sahil Kapur","published_date":"2024-04-18 09:00:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-progressives-release-agenda-2025-ideas-biden-excite-base-rcna147843","clean_url":"nbcnews.com","excerpt":"The agenda is heavy on economics and lighter on cultural issues, carrying echoes of FDR's New Deal. It omits some issues that lack Democratic consensus, like \"Medicare for All.\"","summary":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Top House progressives will unveil a sweeping agenda Thursday to lay down a marker for the policies they'll push next year if Democrats win the 2024 election, from a higher minimum wage and strengthening antitrust laws to new federal benefits for seniors on Social Security and parents raising kids.\nThe Congressional Progressive Caucus agenda, first shared with NBC News, doubles as a blueprint of political advice for how it believes President Joe Biden can win over progressives and young voters who are uninspired by his re-election bid ahead of a rematch with former President Donald Trump.\n'If the progressive base is not excited and enthusiastic \u2014 and if they don't feel like we are trying to earn their votes and that they are important \u2014 then I think the horrific idea of a second Donald Trump presidency could become reality,' Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the progressive caucus chair, said in an interview. 'We cannot afford to let that happen. And we won't.'\nThe seven-point agenda is heavily focused on economics and lighter on cultural issues, carrying echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. It begins with provisions to boost the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour by 2028 and pass the PRO Act to strengthen unions, as well as other provisions, such as guaranteeing overtime pay. It includes policies to reduce the cost of living \u2014 by capping child care costs at 7% of income for all families; expanding Social Security benefits by closing tax loopholes; adding dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare; and enacting a series of policies to protect renters and make housing more affordable.\n2028 and pass the PRO Act to strengthen unions, as well as other provisions, such as guaranteeing overtime pay. It includes policies to reduce the cost of living \u2014 by capping child care costs at 7% of income for all families; expanding Social Security benefits by closing tax loopholes; adding dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare; and enacting a series of policies to protect renters and make housing more affordable. 'It's really about worker power and raising wages and lowering costs for poor people, middle-class Americans and the working people across this country,' Jayapal said.\nThe five other planks are investments in education, including universal pre-K and kindergarten; aggressive clean energy standards to tackle climate change; 'making our democracy work' with federal voting rights mandates, Washington, D.C., statehood and elimination of the Senate filibuster; taking on corporations and monopolies; and 'advancing justice' though abortion rights, pro-LGBTQ measures, pro-immigrant policies and setting national policing standards.\nThe agenda is also notable for what's not included. 'Medicare for All,' a rallying cry of the left for years, is excluded. Foreign policy issues like Israel and Gaza, which have sparked fiery pro-Palestinian protests across the country, are also kept out. Jayapal said that's partly because the caucus decided to make it a domestic-issue-only blueprint and partly out of pragmatism \u2014 to focus more on unifying issues for Democrats and steer clear of the ones that divide them.\n'The way we came to this agenda is to say that we were going to put into this agenda things that were populist and possible ... and affected a huge number of people,' she said. 'We haven't taken a position on particularly Israel and Gaza in the progressive caucus, and so that's not on here.'\nA supermajority of the 103 lawmakers in the caucus weighed in on the agenda, and 98% supported it, a spokesperson said.\nMuch of the agenda will have no realistic chance of passage unless Democrats sweep control of the White House, the House and the Senate this fall. And Jayapal emphasized that, in addition, Democrats would need 50 senators ready to pierce the 60-vote filibuster rule to get around likely GOP opposition. That would be a herculean task, as Democrats face a daunting map in 2024 Senate races, defending a slew of seats in purple and red states.\n'We are assuming that this is an agenda for a Democratic president with a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House,' Jayapal said.\nProgressives have had a rough two years, having been marginalized after Republicans took control of the House and steered the agenda rightward. Biden has broken with the left on issues like tougher asylum laws and crime. Some prominent Democrats, like Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, have eschewed the 'progressive' label as conservatives have found success in associating it with the left's most divisive ideas. Gallego, who is running for the Senate in his purple state, quietly left the progressive caucus. The caucus recently missed an opportunity to elect one of its members to a rare open Senate seat in deep-blue California, with two of them running and losing.\nStill, Jayapal said she believes that if Democrats win the 2024 elections, the progressive caucus will be well-positioned to advance the ideas in its new agenda, as it did with it opening bid that shaped two of Biden's signature laws, the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act. She has sought to institute changes to make the caucus more cohesive. It recently raised its dues for members.\nSome of the provisions in the new agenda represent items in Biden's 'Build Back Better' agenda that were left on the cutting room floor because of the thin majorities. Others could spark intraparty disagreements, including a far-reaching liberalization of the immigration system with a path to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally. Yet other pieces resemble popular causes that progressives want Biden to get behind, like expanding Social Security and legalizing marijuana.\n'We have to excite our base. We have to show them what the path forward is \u2014 not just say, \u2018This is the most important election of your life, and we expect you to vote.' I don't think that's going to turn people out. And so I think this agenda, really, speaks to the needs of poor people, working people, progressives across the country who want us to make that case to them,' Jayapal said. 'We are not seeing the momentum that we would like to see. We're going to have a tough election. ... We know we're going to have to put together that progressive coalition.

Bush via Getty Images At the time, several sailors said their struggles were directly related to a culture in which seeking help was not met with the necessary resources, as well as the unbearable state of the ship while it was docked and undergoing a lengthy overhaul in Virginia.\nThe deaths sparked investigations, prompted visits from the Navy's most powerful officials and led to the relocation of more than 280 sailors.\nFor at least one sailor's family, the years have done little to heal wounds.\n'It's still fresh, and it seems like they swept it under the carpet and moved on,' said John Sandor, whose 19-year-old son, Xavier, had long complained about the George Washington before taking his own life on the ship.\nA string of tragedies Mika'il Sharp, 23, died by suicide on April 9, 2022, at a family gender-reveal party in Portsmouth, Virginia. He had gotten married in the last year and had been promoted days prior, according to his family and the findings of a Navy investigation.\nAfter Natasha Huffman, 24, ended her life the next day, the Navy began discussing whether the two should be promoted posthumously.\nThey appeared eligible for such advancements, a Navy program manager wrote to the ship's leaders on April 12, 2022. Under the Navy's guidelines, any sailor who dies in the line of duty and meets certain eligibility requirements can be posthumously advanced.\nBrent Gaut, the ship's commanding officer, appeared supportive of the promotions and said he would deliver a decision shortly.\nMika'il Sharp. U.S. Navy via Natalie Jefferson On the morning of April 15, 2022, Mathis, who began his role as Gaut's second-in-command two months earlier, emailed behavioral health care doctors on his team to see if the Navy could have done anything to prevent Sharp and Huffman's deaths.\nGaut's second-in-command two months earlier, emailed behavioral health care doctors on his team to see if the Navy could have done anything to prevent Sharp and Huffman's deaths. 'I am not trying to point fingers at anyone else,' Mathis wrote. 'Hoping to learn something to take forward.'\nGaut, Mathis and Christopher Zeigler, the third-in-command, were 'starting to see more and more gripes about lack of access to mental healthcare,' Mathis wrote to the physicians, as he set up a meeting to discuss the issue.\n'It seems to me that we probably have a lack of supply to meet the demand,' he said. 'I need a better understanding here as well.'\nNatasha Huffman. via Facebook That night, while working his usual 12-hour shift on the ship, Xavier Sandor stepped inside a bathroom and told his parents in a text message that being home was the only thing that made him happy, according to his father. He asked to be buried near his high school friend before taking his life.\nHis mother read the message first and let out a painful howl. His father raced down the hall of their Shelton, Connecticut, home, which Xavier had walked through that morning.\nBy the time the Sandors arrived at the Riverside Regional Medical Center in Virginia, where Xavier was taken, he was gone. John Sandor, 51, fell to the floor in anguish.\n'The doctor got on his knees with me and said he did everything he could,' he said.\nIn Tennessee, where he was on leave, Gaut, who is now 53, had a 'mini panic attack,' he said in an email. His deputy sent out a mass email to department heads, alerting them to the third death of a freshman sailor in six days.\n'I know most of you are already aware, but I regret to inform you all that we had another apparent suicide last night,' Mathis wrote.\n'Call all of our folks and give them a verbal hug,' he continued. 'Let our Sailors know that we had another tragic event last night and remind them that they are loved and that there are resources available if people are struggling.'\nTwo days later, Mathis, now 46, questioned the posthumous promotions.\n'I am now in the anger phase of grief so I realize that is affecting my judgement,' he wrote. 'But I am not seeing how a Sailor committing suicide should warrant a posthumous advancement.'\nGaut, Mathis and Zeigler directed comments to the Navy. A Navy official said the emails are a \"snapshot and do not fully represent the level of care and support\" the commanders took to immediately help their crew.\nThe official said the correspondence \"reflects a period of time in which Navy leadership were working to provide council, guidance and comfort to the crew.\"\nOf the three sailors who died that week in April, Huffman was posthumously promoted, the Navy said. Sharp was not eligible because he had recently advanced, and Sandor had not taken the advancement test that would have made him eligible, according to the Navy.\nFacing the public, missed red flags The next week, as the deaths made national headlines, the ship's leaders began to brainstorm how to share the news.\nGaut asked a public affairs officer to start thinking about a Facebook post that would tell families 'what happened and the way forward,' but the idea was quickly shut down.\n'There is nothing we can say other than what has been said,' the press officer wrote. 'A social post will only attract negative attention.'\nThe public affairs team sent Gaut a draft of 'talking points' to consider when addressing the sailors. Mathis reviewed the memo, which confirmed five deaths by suicide since December 2021.\n'I thought briefly that maybe we should discuss data up to 12 months ago but I changed my mind and thought we should just focus on the 9\u201010 months you have been in command,' he wrote to Gaut.\nA Navy investigation released publicly in December 2022 determined that Sharp and Huffman's deaths were not related to life onboard the ship, but Xavier Sandor's was. A separate investigation found that the shipyard lacked sufficient parking, transportation and access to food and housing.\nTen days after Xavier's death, Gaut remained adamant that the suicides were not related to the ship's conditions. He wrote to a colleague that he was staying off social media because he knew 'this was not a quality of life issue.'\nA month after the deaths, Zeigler still dismissed claims about problems on the ship when a local pizzeria owner wrote the leaders with an offer to send 420 free pies, one to each of the sailors believed to be living onboard.\n'The issues we have aren't because of the exaggerated media stories of our living conditions so just want to make that perfectly clear before we move forward,' Zeigler, now 50, wrote.\nXavier Sandor. Courtesy John Sandor From 2017 to 2023, the George Washington was docked at the Newport News Shipyard in Virginia, where it underwent significant repairs and upgrades.\nWhile most of the roughly 2,700 sailors went home after their shifts, hundreds who lived out of state or didn't have off-site housing stayed on the vessel, where several sailors said there was constant construction noise and a lack of hot water and electricity.\nFor three months, Xavier, who was over 6-feet tall, lived in his Toyota Corolla and made 16-hour round trips back home when he could to escape the George Washington, his father said. Those drives usually happened every other weekend.\n'He'd crash for most of the two days and then drive back,' John Sandor said.\nShortly before his death, Xavier skipped a meeting with Zeigler to go home. It was a punishable offense, but the ship's leaders failed to properly document the infraction, which would have given them a reason to temporarily take away his firearm and potentially see that he was struggling to adapt to shipyard life, investigators said.\nIn the three days before he died, Xavier got a maximum of about 14 hours of total sleep, which likely affected his decision-making ability, according to the investigation.\nHis father said he will blame himself forever for not seeing the red flags, but he blames his son's commanders for missing them, too.\n'He shouldn't have been armed,' John Sandor said. 'My son should have never been put in that situation.'\nXavier Sandor with his father, John Sandor. Courtesy John Sandor Nine sailors died by suicide during the roughly six years the George Washington was docked in Virginia, Navy spokesperson Sandra Gall said.\nAfter the spate of deaths in April, the Navy gave the sailors more mental health resources, including psychologists, social workers and chaplains. Before, there had been only one psychologist on the ship.\nLeaders also amplified communication efforts, hosted morale-boosting events and provided shuttles to ease parking woes, Gall said.\n\"Navy leadership remains fully engaged with the crew to ensure their health and well-being, and to ensure a climate of trust that encourages Sailors to ask for help and provide quality of service feedback,\" Gall said.\nToday, the Sandors sit and mention Xavier's name as much as they can. They no longer host holidays in their home, which they've filled with photos of the young sailor and where they display the folded American flag they were given at his funeral.\nXavier's goldendoodle puppy, Grace, still waits on his bed every day, anticipating his return, John Sandor said.\n'It totally changed our lives,' he said, 'and it's miserable without him.'\nIf you or someone you know is in crisis, call 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.
