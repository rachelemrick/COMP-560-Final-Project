Merchan said he would also allow prosecutors to ask Trump about the two violations of Judge Arthur Engoron's gag order during that trial last fall. Trump was fined $15,000 for those violations.\nTrump shook his head as Merchan said that Engoron found he violated the law.\nProsecutors will also be allowed to ask Trump about both E. Jean Carroll verdicts in federal court where juries found that Trump defamed Carroll by denying her allegations that he raped her. Trump was ordered to pay $83.3 million for defaming Carroll.\nMerchan will also allow prosecutors to elect testimony from the former president about the settlement he reached with the New York attorney general that led to the dissolution of the Donald J. Trump Foundation.\nThe judge won't allow prosecutors to ask Trump about the ruling in Florida that sanctioned Trump for filing a frivolous lawsuit against Hillary Clinton.\nThe 2022 Trump Org tax fraud conviction is also off limits for prosecutors if Trump testifies, Merchan ruled.",

            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump sits beside his lawyer Todd Blanche on the second day of jury selection in his criminal trial in Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City, New York, on April 16. Christine Cornell/Pool/Reuters After being dark on Wednesday – as is expected for the duration of the expected six-week trial – the court will resume jury selection today with a new panel of 96 prospective jurors, looking for the remaining five jurors along with six alternates.\nHere are the takeaways from day 2 of the Trump hush money trial:\nWe have (more than half) a jury: So far four men and three women have been selected to serve on the jury. A man originally from Ireland who works in sales in New York City was appointed as the jury foreperson, who essentially serves as the panel spokesperson. Five of the seven have a college degree or higher education. Two men on the panel are lawyers. All but one juror empaneled Tuesday indicated that they're aware Trump is facing charges in other criminal cases. The woman was the only one of the 18 jurors questioned who said she wasn't aware of the other charges. None of them shared particularly strong views about Trump or politics.\nWe have (more than half) a jury: So far four men and three women have been selected to serve on the jury.

All but one juror empaneled Tuesday indicated that they're aware Trump is facing charges in other criminal cases. The woman was the only one of the 18 jurors questioned who said she wasn't aware of the other charges. None of them shared particularly strong views about Trump or politics. Trump's lawyers scrutinize jurors' social media: Trump's side asked the judge to remove five jurors for cause, pointing to alleged anti-Trump social media posts and trying to argue that the jurors were unfairly biased against the former president. When the former president's attorney Todd Blanche was questioning the jurors, he asked them one-by-one what they thought of Trump, outside of the case. He then tried to argue before the judge that many of the jurors' answers that they didn't have an opinion of Trump did not align with their social media. Judge Juan Merchan was generally skeptical, but he did agree on two counts that the jurors should be struck. As for the three jurors Merchan did not strike: Trump's side used its peremptory challenges to remove all of them anyway. After Tuesday, both Trump's team and the district attorney's office have four peremptory challenges remaining each.\nTrump's lawyers scrutinize jurors' social media: Trump's side asked the judge to remove five jurors for cause, pointing to alleged anti-Trump social media posts and trying to argue that the jurors were unfairly biased against the former president.

Trump gets admonished (again): Trump was admonished for his conduct when Merchan brought in one of the jurors individually to discuss her social media posts raised by Trump's team. After the juror left the courtroom, Merchan raised his voice and admonished Trump, saying he was was audibly speaking and gesturing in the direction of the juror. 'I will not have any jurors intimidated in the courtroom,' Merchan told Blanche, raising his voice.\nTrump gets admonished (again): Trump was admonished for his conduct when Merchan brought in one of the jurors individually to discuss her social media posts raised by Trump's team.

After swearing in the seven jurors Tuesday, Merchan told them he hopes they can return next Monday for opening statements – but he emphasized that the schedule could always change and the court would be in touch.\nJury selection could end – maybe – by the end of the week: One of the things Merchan has emphasized this week is that the court schedule is fluid.

Prosecutors and defense lawyers for former President Donald Trump opened the New York criminal trial on Monday by laying out their opposing sides of the case.\nIt's clear that a main point of contention will be what occurred at a pivotal August 2015 meeting between Trump, his former fixer Michael Cohen and the former publisher of the National Enquirer David Pecker at which they are said to have agreed to find and suppress negative stories that could affect Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\nCohen and Pecker would go on to facilitate hush money payments that benefitted Trump. The crime Trump is accused of committing is falsifying documents to hide those payments after he became president. Cohen went to prison after pleading guilty to violating campaign finance law. Pecker has cooperated with authorities.\nCohen and Pecker, both now split from Trump, will be key witnesses for the prosecution, and they are expected to detail what they say occurred at this meeting where they conspired to find and kill stories unflattering to Trump.\nAn open question will be whether the third person in that meeting, Trump, will take the stand in his own defense to give his side of the story.\nWhile he is under no obligation to testify, Trump has promised he will. Asked by a reporter at Mar-a-Lago earlier this month before the start of jury selection if it would be risky for him to take the stand, here's what he said:\n'I don't know, I'm testifying. I tell the truth. I mean, all I can do is tell the truth. And the truth is that there's no case, they have no case,' Trump said.\nLast week, Trump told reporters outside the courtroom that he wants to testify.\nBut taking the stand could lead to Trump, under oath, being asked some very uncomfortable questions.\nJudge Juan Merchan, in a ruling about the scope of what Trump could be asked, took an expansive attitude, as CNN's reporters in the courtroom, Kara Scannell, Lauren del Valle and Jeremy Herb, note.\nThey add in their real-time courtroom posts that prosecutors can cross-examine Trump on multiple legal setbacks in recent years:\n► $464 million civil fraud verdict – Trump was found to fraudulently inflate the value of his properties.\n$464 million civil fraud verdict – Trump was found to fraudulently inflate the value of his properties. ► Gag order violations – These were committed during the civil fraud trial for which Trump was fined $15,000.\nGag order violations – These were committed during the civil fraud trial for which Trump was fined $15,000. ► Defamation and sexual abuse liability – Juries in federal courts found that Trump defamed former magazine columnist E.

Merchan ruled prosecutors could not ask Trump, if he testifies, about his lawsuit against Hillary Clinton that a judge said was frivolous or the 2022 Trump Organization tax fraud conviction against his company.\nIn a CNN Opinion piece, Joey Jackson, a CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney, described what kind of defense he expects from Trump's team during the trial. Jackson argued that no matter what Trump says, whether he testifies 'will likely be a game time decision.'\nWhen CNN's Jake Tapper asked Will Scharf, one of Trump's attorneys, if he believes Trump should testify, Scharf also said that decision should be based on 'how the trial proceeds.'\n'I have said that I think President Trump will be a compelling witness if he does testify, because at the end of the day, he did nothing wrong,' Scharf said.\nThe first Carroll trial jury in 2023 was played a videotape of Trump's deposition by lawyers. At one point in that testimony, Trump mistook a photo of Carroll for his ex-wife Marla Maples. Read more about key moments from the video.\nTrump briefly took the stand in separate defamation proceedings in January 2024.\nAt his civil fraud trial in 2023, there was no jury, but Trump did take the stand during the proceedings. He brought a bombastic and combative style that drew rebukes from the judge in the case, Arthur Engoron, who later ordered Trump to pay a $355 million penalty.\nEven if he doesn't testify under oath in the New York criminal trial, Trump has already said quite a bit about the case – comments that could presumably be brought into evidence. During comments outside the courtroom last week, he tried to explain the payments reimbursing Cohen for the payment to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels.\n'I was paying a lawyer and we marked it down as a legal expense,' Trump said. 'Some accountant I didn't know marked it down as a legal expense. That's exactly what it was, and you get indicted over that?'\nIn a series of tweets in May 2018, before Cohen's ultimate guilty plea, Trump admitted to paying Cohen and said that money was a 'reimbursement.'\nHere are those Trump tweets all together:\nMr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA. These agreements are …..\nMr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA.

            "summary": "In his opening statement on Monday, prosecutor Matthew Colangelo sought to reframe the case against Donald Trump - saying it was about much more than the hush money he allegedly paid to cover up negative information about him.\nInstead, Colangelo said, Trump, along with his attorney Michael Cohen and David Pecker, the former chairman of the National Enquirer's parent company AMI, 'formed a conspiracy … to influence the presidential election.'\n'The defendant, Donald Trump, orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election,' the prosecutor said. 'Then he covered up that criminal conspiracy by lying in his New York business records over and over and over again.\"\n'It was election fraud, pure and simple,' Colangelo told the jury.\nThe scheme was three-pronged, Colangelo said: the trio sought to help Trump kill negative stories about Trump - a process known as 'catch-and-kill' - publish favorable stories about Trump and publish negative stories about Trump's political opponents.\nHe laid out three different instances where the trio allegedly conspired to prevent harmful information about Trump from becoming public prior to the 2016 election.\nThe first, prosecutors said, was a $30,000 payment to a former Trump Tower doorman who alleged Trump fathered a child - an allegation that ended up not being true: 'It was the first time that David Pecker had ever paid anyone for information about Donald Trump,' Colangelo said.\nPecker, the prosecutor said, was 'not acting as a publisher. He was acting as a co-conspirator.' Even after the allegation was determined to be false, Cohen instructed the Enquirer's parent company not to release the doorman from a non-disclosure agreement until after the presidential election.\nThe second catch-and-kill deal involved Karen McDougal, who alleged she had an affair with Trump. Trump, Colangelo said, 'desperately did not want this information about Karen McDougal to become public because he was concerned about the election.' AMI paid McDougal $150,000 for the rights to her story, the prosecutor said.\nKaren McDougal, who alleged she had an affair with Trump.

Trump has denied both affairs with McDougal and Daniels.\n'Another story about sexual infidelity, especially with a porn star, on the heels of the Access Hollywood tape would have been devastating to his campaign,' Colangelo told the jury. 'So at Trump's direction, Cohen negotiated the deal to buy Daniels' story,\" and prevent it from becoming public before the election.",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — The first criminal trial of Donald Trump is officially underway.\nProsecutors and Trump's attorneys delivered opening statements and the first witness – a former National Enquirer publisher – was called Monday in the historic and unprecedented criminal trial of a former president.\nEach side got their first chance to lay out a theory of the case for jurors. Prosecutors told jurors that the reimbursement of hush money payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels was part of a larger conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election by hiding damaging information about Trump.\nThe former president's attorneys responded by telling the jury that Trump was innocent and not involved in the creation of the 34 business records he's charged with falsifying. They also pointedly added that there's 'nothing wrong with trying to influence an election.'\nTrump continued to rail against the case as he entered and left the courtroom. On Tuesday, before the trial resumes, Judge Juan Merchan is holding a hearing on the district attorney's motion to sanction Trump for violating the judge's gag order barring discussion of witnesses.\nHere are the key takeaways from Monday:\nThe district attorney's office framed the case for jurors as illegal payments to try to influence illicitly influence the 2016 election that Trump then tried to illegally cover up by falsifying business records.\n'The defendant Donald Trump orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election,' said prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors. 'Then he covered up that criminal conspiracy by lying in his New York business records over and over and over again.'\nColangelo walked the jury through Trump's efforts, along with Cohen and former American Media Inc., chief David Pecker, to keep damaging information from coming to light during the 2016 election.\nDuring his opening statement, Colangelo also addressed questions about Cohen's veracity as a witness, both because it's a key part of the prosecution's case and also to get ahead of criticism from Trump's lawyers. But he told the jurors to remember that whatever issues they might have with Cohen's credibility, to remember that what he's saying is backed up by other witnesses and documents in the case.\n'Tune out the noise,' Colangelo said.\nDefense attorney Todd Blanche began his opening statement with a simple assertion: 'Donald Trump is innocent.'\nBlanche told the jury that the story isn't as simple as prosecutors laid out and argued that Trump was not involved with any of the business records he's accused of falsifying beyond signing the checks.\n'President Trump had nothing to do, had nothing to do with the invoice, with the check being generated, or with the entry on the ledger,' he said.\nBlanche didn't dispute the paper trail existed, but he argued to the jury there was nothing illegal about signing non-disclosure agreements – or with trying to influence an election.\n'I have a spoiler alert: There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy,' he added.\nBlanche also began his efforts to discredit Cohen's testimony, which will be a significant factor in the ultimate outcome of the case. Blanche said that Cohen has an 'obsession with getting President Trump' and noted that even last night he was still posting on social media about Trump.\n'His entire financial livelihood depends on President Trump's destruction,' Blanche said. 'You cannot make a serious decision about President Trump relying on the words of Michael Cohen.'\nAt the end of his statement, Blanche asked the jurors to use 'common sense' and said he was confident they would find a not guilty verdict.\n'You told all of us, you told the court, you told me, you will put aside whatever views you have of President Trump,' Blanche said as he ended his opening statement.\nProsecutors called former AMI CEO David Pecker as the first witness in their case against Trump. He testified for less than 30 minutes Monday morning before the trial adjourned for the day. He's expected to continue testifying Tuesday.\nCalling Pecker a co-conspirator during his opening statement, Colangelo teed up the former tabloid publisher as a key player in Trump's 'catch and kill' scheme to control the public narrative about him ahead of the 2016 election.\nProsecutors allege that an August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower with Pecker and Cohen sparked the conspiracy that ultimately led to the criminal charges against Trump. They claim Pecker agreed to act as the 'eyes and ears of the campaign' gathering information from tabloid sources.\nThe scheme, the prosecutor said, was three-pronged: AMI would publish flattering stories about Trump, publish hit stories on Trump's political opponents and kill negative stories that could harm Trump's campaign. The 'catch and kill' practice was at the 'core' of the conspiracy, Colangelo told the jury.\nPecker is expected to later testify about the scheme and his role in orchestrating two nondisclosure agreements for negative stories about Trump. Pecker's AMI paid Karen McDougal – who was alleging an affair with Trump in the months before the 2016 election – $150,000 for the rights to her story. (Trump has denied the affairs.)\nAs Pecker stepped down from the jury box, he smiled and said 'hi' to Trump's table.\nAs opening statements got underway in criminal court, other lawyers for Trump were in a courtroom a block away arguing over the legitimacy of the $175 million bond Trump posted to appeal the judgment in his civil fraud trial, where the former president was found liable for fraudulently inflating his asset values to obtain better loan terms.\nTrump, who could not attend the civil hearing because he's required to attend each day of the criminal trial, railed against Attorney General Letitia James on his way in and out of the courtroom Monday.\nAt the hearing, Trump's attorneys came to an agreement with the New York attorney general's office on the terms of that $175 million bond. James' team had previously challenged the bond, questioning the financial wherewithal of the underwriter, Knight Specialty Insurance Company.\nTrump's attorneys representing him in the civil matter later stopped by the criminal trial and spoke to cameras in the hallway outside the courtroom where Trump sat at the defense table.\n'He should not have two teams of lawyers here today,' Alina Habba said. 'He should not even be here today, because he did nothing wrong. It is an epitome of a witch hunt.'\nBefore the trial resumes Tuesday, Merchan is holding a hearing on allegations that Trump violated the judge's gag order barring discussion of witnesses.\nThe district attorney's office asked the judge to fine Trump $1,000 for each of several gag order violations leading up to and since the trial started. In addition to the fines, prosecutors want the judge to remind Trump he could be imprisoned if he continues to disobey the judge's order.\n'We think that it is important for the court to remind Mr. Trump that he is a criminal defendant,' prosecutor Chris Conroy said last week. 'And like all criminal defendants he's subject to court supervision.'\nTrump's lawyers have argued that his social media posts do not actually violate the gag order. Trump attorney Emil Bove argued last week that Cohen had been attacking Trump in 'connection to the campaign' and Trump's responses were related to the campaign.\nTrump spoke about Cohen while addressing the cameras after court ended Monday. 'The things he got in trouble for were things that had nothing to do with me. He got in trouble. He went to jail. This has nothing to do with me,' Trump said.\nThe jury has been instructed to arrive at 11 a.m. ET to begin the second day of the trial. Merchan said if arguments over the gag order were not finished by then, they would finish another time.\nCourt is only in session until 2 p.m. ET on Tuesday because of the Passover holiday.",

The letter, first reported by Politico, was dated on the first day of Trump's New York criminal hush money trial, which will severely curtail his flexibility to travel for fundraising and campaigning.\nThe letter also included guidelines for Republican candidates and committees when they are using Trump's name and likeness while fundraising and asked them to avoid 'speaking on behalf of' Trump, 'creating memberships, clubs, or rewards that are not authorized by the campaign,' 'impersonating President Trump or his campaign,' and mentioning Trump's family without their consent or the consent of the campaign.\n'It is important to protect small dollar donors from scammers that use the president's name and likeness,' Trump campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez said in a statement.\nTrump has closely guarded the use of his brand and name. In 2021, his team sent cease-and-desist letters to the RNC and the party's congressional fundraising arms, asking them to stop using his name and image in their fundraising appeals. Since becoming his party's presumptive nominee, Trump has launched a takeover of the RNC and now is raising money jointly with the national party.",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — Former President Donald Trump's rally in North Carolina – set to be his first since the start of his hush money criminal trial began in New York – was postponed Saturday due to concerns over severe weather.\nTrump called into the Wilmington rally from his airplane, with his message played over loudspeakers at the rally.\n'We're devastated that this could happen, but we want to keep everybody safe,' Trump told supporters. 'There seems to be some thunder and lightning and it's a pretty big storm so if you don't mind, I think we're going to have to just do a raincheck, I'm so sad.'\nDespite the postponement, Trump, largely confined to a Manhattan courtroom for most of the past week, still reemerged on the campaign circuit here in North Carolina, where the stakes of the Republican's trial-to-trail presidential campaign are especially high.\nHe held a fundraiser in Charlotte, and he also posted several times on Truth Social about how he thinks presidents should be immune from prosecution. His flurry of posts comes as the Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on April 25 over whether Trump may claim immunity from prosecution in the federal election subversion case.\nSaturday capped an unprecedented week in American politics as the first criminal trial of a former president kicked off. The trial, which will determine whether Trump illegally sought to undermine the 2016 election through a scheme to pay off women with whom he allegedly had extramarital affairs, is expected to begin with opening statements on Monday.\nThe task ahead in New York for Trump is clear: Convince seven men and five women on the jury he is innocent of the 34 charges he faces. In battlegrounds like North Carolina, the challenge for Trump is less straightforward but similarly daunting: He must persuade voters in these states to overlook whatever details emerge from his New York trial when determining the country's next president. That includes evidence of alleged hush money payments as well as testimony from his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, a former Playboy playmate and an adult film star.\nAppearing in Greensboro, North Carolina, ahead of the state's primary last month, Trump remarked on his legal peril at length. He told the crowd that the 91 charges he then faced (it's now down to 88) were 'not legit.' He baselessly claimed the case against him in New York, which was brought by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, was 'being run by the Department of Justice for election interference – knock out your political opponent.'\n'The one thing they didn't know is the people of our country hear about it from me,' Trump asserted then.\nTrump handily won the primary days later during a convincing Super Tuesday performance. Yet, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley managed to win support from 23% of Republican primary voters in North Carolina, with many in Trump's party saying they could not overlook the vast legal challenges he faces. Three in 10 GOP voters said Trump would not be fit for the presidency if he was convicted of a crime – a troubling sign for the former president in a state he won over President Joe Biden by only 1.3% four years ago.\nTrump's campaign pointed to poll numbers that showed two-thirds of Americans don't believe he has broken any laws.\n'Polling shows the American people see right through the Stalinist tactics employed by Crooked Joe and his allies,' Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told CNN in a statement. 'President Trump and our team will continue fighting for truth in the courtroom, while working to earn votes on the campaign trail.'\nThroughout the dramatic first week of his trial – marked by a series of stunning moments, including potential jurors brought to tears by the intense pressure of their duty and a man who set himself on fire outside the courthouse – Trump made clear he intends to make sure people continue to hear about the case from him. In theatrical news conferences in front of courthouse cameras and aggressively posting on social media, Trump repeatedly lashed out at the judge overseeing the case and tested the boundaries of the gag order intended to keep him from intimidating jurors and witnesses.\nWithout cameras inside the courtroom, Trump has also challenged the narratives that have emerged from those watching the proceedings. In a fundraising text to supporters, Trump claimed he stormed out of the courtroom during the first day of the trial – a statement not supported by those who witnessed him walk out. Trump posted on Truth Social that 'I was PRAYING not sleeping!!' when multiple news outlets reported the former president appeared to doze off during the proceedings.\nThe judge overseeing the case, Judge Juan Merchan, is requiring Trump to appear in the courtroom during the trial, which could last several weeks. Court is in session every weekday except Wednesdays, leaving Trump with smaller windows to travel, making weekend events like Saturday's postponed Wilmington rally a focal point of his campaign calendar.\n'I'm supposed to be in New Hampshire. I'm supposed to be in Georgia. I'm supposed to be in North Carolina, South Carolina. I'm supposed to be a lot of different places campaigning,' Trump told reporters outside the courtroom this week. 'But I've been here all day on a trial that really is a very unfair trial.'\nTrump's statement, however, overlooks that the former president has often voluntarily appeared at proceedings for his civil cases rather than campaign. Trump also kept a notably light political schedule throughout the GOP primary when the legal cases against him had yet to reach this stage.\nRegardless of where Trump is spending his time, his campaign insists it is readying a robust operation, including paid teams and volunteers in every battleground state.\n'Our aggressive and experienced operation is focused on turning out votes and highlighting the contrast between Joe Biden's weakness and failures with President Trump's record of success,' Leavitt said.",

Without live or even taped audio or video, the play-by-play was relayed to the outside world by those few reporters actually inside the courtroom. CNN's Kara Scannell and Jeremy Herb fed information from the court that ultimately made its way to the rest of us.\nThe first order of business in state court in Manhattan is to begin jury selection, a process anticipated to take as long as two weeks. The trial itself, which will take place on weekdays except Wednesdays, could stretch to two full months.\nOf the first group of 96 potential jurors who crammed into the courtroom, more than half were immediately excused for saying they could not be fair and impartial.\nTrump wants to take part in sidebars, which could put him very close to jurors. According to Scannell, defendants rarely get involved in sidebars with judges during jury selection, but Trump's attorneys have indicated he will want to be involved, either approaching the bench or in a side room. This is a rare request.\nTrump wants to take part in sidebars, which could put him very close to jurors. According to Scannell, defendants rarely get involved in sidebars with judges during jury selection, but Trump's attorneys have indicated he will want to be involved, either approaching the bench or in a side room. This is a rare request. 'I have covered about two dozen trials, and I can't remember one time the defendant opted to go up to the bench as the judge and the attorneys are asking questions of the potential juror,' Scannell said on CNN during a midday courtroom break. 'So, this is really remarkable to me that he is choosing to do that, and he will be eye-to-eye with these potential jurors in close proximity as they answer questions.'\nSearching for 18 impartial people. Ultimately, the field of jurors needs to be winnowed down to 12 jurors and six alternates. Around 500 jurors are expected to be called during each day of jury selection, and Scannell said the court would begin vetting about 100 potential jurors at a time in the courtroom.\nSearching for 18 impartial people.

It's ridiculous to think jurors would not have heard of Trump or even have opinions about him. He is, after all, one of the most famous people in the world. Anybody so ignorant of world events so as to not have an impression of Trump would probably not be fit to serve on a jury anyway, writes Jeffrey Abramson, author of 'We, The Jury: The Jury System and the Ideal of Democracy.'\nauthor of 'We, The Jury: The Jury System and the Ideal of Democracy.' 'An open mind does not require an empty mind,' Abramson argues in a piece for CNN Opinion as he explains the process known as 'voir dire.'\n'We can find fair jurors who understand the difference between law and politics,' Abramson adds, noting that Trump has already faced New York juries who found him liable in civil cases related to defamation and sexual abuse of E. Jean Carroll, a former magazine columnist who said Trump raped her in a department store in 1996, although Trump denies the claim.\nA Manhattan jury also found Trump's business, the Trump Organization, guilty of tax evasion, although Trump was not personally named in that case.\nThe jurors will remain anonymous, but Abramson argues both sides in the case need to 'sketch a personality profile of each potential juror.' A person with military training, for instance, who values loyalty might be a better juror for Trump, whereas someone who admires whistleblowers might be a better juror for the government, he writes.\nWhat will jurors hear? At one point, Judge Juan Merchan read off the names of more than 40 people who could feature in the trial. Potential witnesses range from former Trump aides like Kellyanne Conway and Rudy Giuliani to the women who allege they had affairs with Trump: Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal.\nWhat will jurors hear?

Potential witnesses range from former Trump aides like Kellyanne Conway and Rudy Giuliani to the women who allege they had affairs with Trump: Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. CNN's Kaanita Iyer has a rundown of the key players.\nAnd here is an excellent visual timeline of the entire hush money scandal.\nMuch of the morning centered on questions about what evidence Merchan will allow jurors to hear.\nThe judge, per Scannell and Herb's feeds, will allow:\n► Testimony from McDougal – She's the former Playboy Playmate whose story of her alleged affair with Trump was bought by the National Enquirer with the intention of killing it before the 2016 election. But Merchan will not allow testimony about McDougal's allegation that the affair was conducted while Trump's wife, Melania, was pregnant and after she gave birth to their son Barron. That kind of testimony, Merchan said, could prejudice the jury against Trump.\nTestimony from McDougal – She's the former Playboy Playmate whose story of her alleged affair with Trump was bought by the National Enquirer with the intention of killing it before the 2016 election.

There was also much discussion about what jurors can hear from or about Michael Cohen, Trump's former fixer and the key witness in the case. It was Cohen who orchestrated the hush money payments and who pleaded guilty to federal charges of violating campaign finance law, for which he served time in prison. Trump is accused by New York of falsifying business records when he paid Cohen back for the hush money scheme. Merchan has a nuanced set of guidelines for how to include the key elements of Cohen's side of the story without making jurors think Trump is guilty of the crimes Cohen admitted committing.\nNew York Times reporter and CNN political analyst Maggie Haberman noted that Trump had to sit and watch while all of these uncomfortable subjects were discussed in court.\n'This trial is going to be filled with personal discomfort for Donald Trump, who has often been able to just attack and then walk away,' she told CNN's Jake Tapper. 'This is going to be much harder for him here.'",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — The first criminal trial of former President Donald Trump is here.\nThe opening day of the first criminal trial of a former US president began Monday, hitting home the reality that the presumptive Republican nominee for president will be sitting in a Manhattan courtroom as a defendant four days a week.\nTrump, who has pleaded not guilty to the 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, sat alongside his three attorneys as jury selection began, watching them debate prosecutors over what evidence could be admitted and passing notes as they spoke.\nChoosing a roster of 12 jurors who can decide Trump's fate will be difficult, as more than 50 people immediately were dismissed when they said they couldn't be fair and impartial.\nTrump did little talking inside the courtroom Monday. But his incendiary rhetoric was once again at issue, with a new call from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office for Judge Juan Merchan to sanction Trump for violating the judge's gag order.\nHere are the key takeaways from day one of 'The People of the State of New York vs Donald Trump.'\nMerchan brought in 96 New Yorkers as prospective jurors. More than half were quickly dismissed because they said they did not think they could be fair and impartial.\nThe swift dismissal of the prospective jury pool underscores the difficulty in picking a jury when the defendant is a former president who elicits strong feelings on both sides of the aisle.\nTrump has complained that he cannot get a fair jury in Manhattan, where the jurors must live. Among the jurors that stayed, most said they could be fair and impartial in this case.\nBut as the judge began having jurors answer 40 questions about their backgrounds, media they consume and whether they have strong feelings about Trump, one more potential juror was weeded out.\nThe woman answered yes to question 34: ' Do you have any strong opinions or firmly held beliefs about former President Donald Trump, or the fact that he is a current candidate for president that would interfere with your ability to be a fair and impartial juror?'\n'Do you have any strong opinions or firmly held beliefs about former President Donald Trump, or the fact that he is a current candidate for president that would interfere with your ability to be a fair and impartial juror?' Merchan stopped her questioning and asked whether the lawyers had any objection to dismissing her. After a brief sidebar she was thanked for her service and dismissed.\n'I just couldn't do it,' the juror was heard saying in the hallway outside the courtroom.\nAmong the other nine potential jurors who were questioned, none said they had read any books written by either Trump or Michael Cohen. And none had said they'd worked or volunteered for Trump.\nAfter months of appeals to delay the start of the trial, the defense is now looking to slow down the legal proceedings as the November elections near.\nSources told CNN's Paula Reid that there will likely be many objections and sidebars during the trial because the defense is completely focused on preserving every issue for appeal.\nFor instance, jury selection is already expected to last a week but on Monday Trump attorney Todd Blanche requested more time to question potential jurors. Blanche asked for 30 minutes for the first round of questions and 20 minutes for subsequent rounds – double the usual time – and the judge and DA's office agreed.\nBlanche also attempted to raise problems with the current system of requiring a pre-motion letter 48 hours before filing motions, which Merchan said is in place 'because we were being absolutely inundated with motions, many of which frankly were close to frivolous if not frivolous' — an apparent dig at the recent motions filed by Trump attorneys.\nThese tactics fit the larger Trump legal strategy, which included months of appeals to delay the start of the trial, which was successful on separate grounds. The defense now hopes legal proceedings, which are expected to last six to eight weeks, move at a slow pace with the 2024 election just months away.\nProsecutors asked Merchan to sanction Trump for violating the gag order prohibiting him from talking about witnesses in the case, the DA's office or court staff.\nChris Conroy asked to hold Trump in contempt for violating the gag order and sanction Trump $1,000 for each of three social media posts he made that they say violate the order.\nthey say violate the order. 'We think that it is important for the court to remind Mr. Trump that he is a criminal defendant,' Conroy said. 'And like all criminal defendants he's subject to court supervision.'\nOne of Trump's posts on Truth Social called eventual trial witness Michael Cohen his 'SleazeBag former attorney,' and in another he re-posted Stormy Daniels' letter from 2018 denying an affair with Trump, which she has since rescinded.\nA third was a re-post from former Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti criticizing Cohen and Daniels. The post on X accused them of making money on 'bogus documentaries' and TV interviews.\nTrump on Monday morning also shared a New York Post story, quoting from the story: 'A serial perjurer will try to prove an old misdemeanor against Trump in an embarrassment for the New York legal system.'\nMerchan scheduled a hearing on the district attorney's motion for next Tuesday.\nThis isn't the first time Trump has been scrutinized for his social media posts. He was fined twice for violating a gag order imposed by New York Judge Arthur Engoron in his civil fraud trial.\nMerchan made several key rulings that may frame how the case is presented, delivering wins for both sides.\nAside from refusing to recuse himself from the case, the judge sided with prosecutors in allowing Karen McDougal, an actress and model who alleged she also had an affair with Trump, to testify. Prosecutors can also introduce National Enquirer stories slamming Trump's opponents as evidence.\nAmerican Media Inc. agreed to pay McDougal $150,000 five months before the 2016 election for her silence about allegations of an affair with Trump, according to prosecutors. Trump has denied the affair. This payment is not part of the charges against Trump, but prosecutors have said that the testimony would help establish a pattern of payments.\nA key victory for Trump, meanwhile, was Merchan ruling that the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape can't be played in court, saying it was prejudicial. Prosecutors also will not be allowed to bring up other sexual assault allegations against Trump that surfaced after the 'Access Hollywood tape' was made public in October 2016.\n'They are very prejudicial, and at this point, given what we know today, it was just a rumor,' Merchan said.\nMerchan also denied prosecutors' request to show E. Jean Carroll's deposition from her defamation case against Trump because it would be 'building in a trial into a trial.'",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — Donald Trump's campaign is deploying his top surrogates, including potential vice presidential picks, to span the airwaves in what they are characterizing as a full-fledged media defense of the former president, as he confronts a historic criminal trial in New York City, his advisers told CNN.\nIn recent days, the Trump campaign has circulated a document of talking points, obtained by CNN, to his allies, as well as directly booked surrogates on television as part of its effort to have the former president's top allies 'blanketing the airwaves,' as one senior Trump adviser described it.\nTrump has told his advisers that he wants as much media coverage of his court appearances as possible – including having his supporters defend him on TV, sources familiar with the conversations told CNN.\nThe campaign's strategy of having Trump's surrogates maximize media coverage isn't new: It's the same approach his team used in the aftermath of each of his indictments. A new element playing out behind the scenes, however, is the timing of this media defense campaign.\nNot only is the proceeding taking place at a time when his team is uncertain of how the trial and the salacious details of the case will play with general election voters, but it also comes as Trump is weighing potential running mates – making this period a tryout of sorts for his vice presidential contenders.\nSome of Trump's prospective VP picks are taking their own initiative, without urging from the former president's campaign, to defend him, according to sources familiar with their tactics.\n'The stakes are very high not just for the president personally and politically but also for his surrogates. They have to know – and I'm sure they all do – that everything you say is going to be noticed not just by the president but by his closest advisors as well,' said Gregg Keller, a Republican strategist. 'It's not just going to be a situation where maybe you say something sub-optimal and it gets lost in the mix or doesn't get noticed. That's not how things operate in Trump World. They know and hear about everything.'\nAnother veteran Republican strategist, granted anonymity to speak candidly, said, 'Really, the assignment is nominally ‘go defend Trump on TV.' The assignment is actually ‘go show that you're a really, really effective communicator so Trump believes he has in you an ally and a surrogate that's going to be compelling.''\nAlready, at least four potential Trump VP contenders have appeared on TV or made statements on social media undercutting the credibility of the case and players within it, or falsely claimed election interference.\nOn CNN Monday morning, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum called the case 'a sham trial' run by a 'politically motivated' district attorney and claimed: 'If this was brought against anybody other than President Trump, this would have been a misdemeanor.'\nBurgum also suggested that the criminal trial's unprecedented nature has been blown out of proportion. 'What's unprecedented, what's historic, is the fact the lawfare that's going on where the two-tier justice system is trying to take something that's basically a boring business filing case and turn it into the trial of the century, and Americans can see right through it,' he said.\nPutting the general election in focus, Burgum also said the American people want to see Trump debate President Joe Biden on stage, as the Trump campaign last week called on the Commission on Presidential Debates to move up the debate schedule and add more debates.\nBurgum has kept in regular touch with Trump officials and spoke with them as recently as the Sunday before his interview, according to a Republican with knowledge of those talks.\nRep. Elise Stefanik, the House Republican conference chair, highlighted how she led a criminal referral in November 2023 demanding Attorney General Merrick Garland immediately investigate Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen for lying to Congress during a February 2019 deposition.\n'The DOJ still refuses to charge the disgraced, disbarred attorney who admitted his guilt. Now, Soros-funded Alvin Bragg is relying on disgraced Michael Cohen as his key witness in his sham case. The double standard of justice is clear,' Stefanik posted on X. She also called presiding Judge Juan Merchan 'corrupt' and called the case a 'show trial,' claiming election interference.\nRelated article Analysis: Trump's unusual trial request on Day 1\nRelated article Analysis: Trump's unusual trial request on Day 1 Moments later, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance posted of the Manhattan district attorney: 'What Alvin Bragg is doing to President Trump is a disgrace to the rule of law and the opposite of Justice. It's also election interference.'\nRather than mentioning the trial specifically, Sen. Tim Scott painted with a broader brush.\n'What the radical Left is doing is not just election interference, it's election engineering. They will try everything (and fail) to stop Donald J. Trump,' the South Carolina Republican posted on X.\nWhile Trump told entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy that he will not be chosen as his running mate, according to a source familiar with the conversation, he is being considered for a Cabinet position. Bloomberg was first to report on the conversation, which the source said occurred at Mar-a-Lago in the first week of March.\nMonday morning, Ramaswamy posted a nearly 3-minute video on X direct-to-camera arguing that Bragg's case demonstrates 'a bastardization of our legal system.'\n'You have Alvin Bragg, a Manhattan DA who was elected on the promise of going after Donald Trump. For what crime, we have no idea, just the idea that they had to go after Donald Trump,' Ramaswamy said. 'I think Trump is going to prevail. But most importantly, I hope we move beyond this phase of our history, where you have one political party that thinks it can use the legal system to prosecute its opponents.'\nMuch of the commentary being shared by Trump's surrogates reference the themes highlighted in talking points circulated by the former president's campaign.\nThe document, labeled 'The Biden Trial, Talking Points,' parrots the same language the former president has used to attack the case.\nIt urges Trump surrogates to paint the trial as 'a full-frontal assault on American Democracy and the Constitution' and a 'witch hunt' designed by the Biden campaign to hurt the former president's 2024 White House bid – despite it being a state case brought by Manhattan's top prosecutor.\nIt also directs supporters not to refer to the case as a 'hush money case,' instead labeling it as being 'entries in the company's records,' and claiming Trump 'did not control the books.'\nThe talking points dedicate an entire page to attacking Bragg, and a separate section to discrediting Cohen, Trump's former 'fixer' who is expected to serve as a lead witness in prosecutors' arguments. The document emphasizes Cohen's 2018 guilty plea to campaign finance violations and paints him as someone with a 'personal vendetta' against the former president.\nSprinkled throughout the document is an emphasis on Trump's innocence, claiming that 'President Trump did nothing wrong, his position has never wavered.'\nAnd twice, the same line, which acknowledges Trump could potentially be convicted, appears – claiming that Trump 'faces no realistic threat of jail, even with a wrongful guilty verdict from the jury.'\nThe talking points also say Trump will 'never stop fighting' for the American people – rather than as a means of self-preservation – something surrogates emphasize in underscoring how they believe he will prevail and efforts against him will fail.",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — Jury selection is set to begin Monday to impanel a group of 12 New Yorkers who will ultimately decide whether to convict former President Donald Trump in his first criminal trial.\nCourt officials expect about 500 new jurors to appear each day beginning April 15 to be available for the selection process, though some of those individuals will also be pulled to other cases in the court system.\nAs in any state criminal court case in the county, the pool will be limited to people who live in Manhattan.\nAbout 100 prospective jurors at a time will be brought into Judge Juan Merchan's courtroom to be vetted.\nTwelve jurors will make up the panel that will ultimately consider the 34 counts of falsifying business records against Trump. Six alternates will also hear the case in case a juror on the main panel needs to be replaced.\nProspective jurors can be dismissed by the judge for cause if he finds they shouldn't serve on the panel. Prosecutors and Trump's defense team will also get 10 peremptory strikes they can use to remove a juror from the pool, no questions asked.\nPotential jurors tapped to enter the prospective pool for Trump's panel will complete a questionnaire created by the judge with input from the attorneys for Trump and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.\nThey will be asked a wide range of questions, including where in the city they live, where they get their news, whether they've ever attended a rally for the former president and whether they have had any affiliation with groups like the Proud Boys or the QAnon movement.\nPotential jurors will be quizzed on their feelings about Trump, but they won't be asked explicitly which political party they belong to or which candidates they've voted for or have made campaign contributions to. Trump's lawyers wanted to ask those questions, but the judge excluded them from the final questionnaire.\nThe prospective jurors will be asked if they or anyone in their circle have ever been to Trump rally, worked or volunteered for a Trump presidential campaign, the Trump presidential administration, or any other political entity affiliated with Trump. They'll also be asked if they've ever participated in any anti-Trump groups or events.\nIn addition to their news consumption, jurors will be asked whether they've ever read or listened to any books or podcasts by Michael Cohen or former Manhattan prosecutor Mark Pomerantz, who also wrote a book about this case.\nTrump's social media platform, Truth Social, is also listed among the platforms potential panel members will be asked about.\nIf they make it into the jury box in Merchan's courtroom, they'll read their answers out loud. The attorneys and the judge can then ask them follow-up questions to further vet them for possible conflicts or biases.\nMerchan has said he will dismiss any prospective jurors who self-report that they believe they are unable to serve on the panel. Merchan ruled he will dismiss those prospective jurors without individually questioning them about their reasoning despite a request from Trump's attorneys to do so.\nWhen Merchan presided over the Trump Organization's criminal tax fraud trial in 2022, he individually questioned prospective jurors about their reasoning.\nIn a pretrial letter last week, the judge said that process was 'time consuming and unproductive' and not logistically feasible in a packed courtroom filled with several attorneys for each side plus the Secret Service agents providing added security for Trump.\nHundreds of New York jurors have been asked similar questions about their feelings about Trump and their news-reading habits at other trials such as the Trump Organization tax fraud trial and Trump's civil trials with writer E. Jean Carroll.\nJurors in both trials with Carroll in New York federal court were asked whether they associated with any fringe groups.\nA couple of jurors in Trump's most recent trial with Carroll said they believed the 2020 election was stolen. Merchan said he will not ask jurors their thoughts on the 2020 election outcome during the voir dire process in this case.\nThe jury will remain anonymous Identifying information about the jurors will not be publicly released to protect jurors' privacy and avoid 'exposing them to an atmosphere of intimidation.'\nMerchan warned Trump in a gag order that he can't make public comments or direct anyone else to make public comments about jurors involved in the proceedings.\nA sketch artist will be allowed in the courtroom during the selection process, but they have been instructed not to sketch jurors' faces.\nThe media cannot photograph or record the proceedings, and only a few reporters will be permitted into the courtroom at one time to see prospective jurors questioned in the jury box.\nMost reporters will cover jury selection from an overflow courtroom with a view of Trump and the lawyers on closed-circuit monitors.",

            "summary": "New York CNN —\nNew York CNN — Trump Media & Technology Group's stock is tumbling again after the company announced a potentially massive new influx of shares. The struggling company is rapidly losing money, and a new stock offering could help it stay afloat.\nBut there's a downside to going back to the market with more shares: The addition of 21.5 million shares for sale announced Monday would add more than 15% more stock to the publicly available shares of the Truth Social owner. That would substantially devalue existing shareholders' stakes — including that of former President Donald Trump. And it means that millions of shares could be sold off.\nThis filing seeks to register all shares related to the merger that took Trump Media public, including those that are tied to warrants. Warrants give the holder the right to buy shares of a company's stock at a set price.\n'The belief is that they're going to exchange the warrant for a share of stock and then immediately sell that stock,' said John Rekenthaler, vice president of research at Morningstar.\nMatthew Tuttle, chief executive of Tuttle Capital Management, says that management would be 'stupid' not to sell more stock, even though the move will upset shareholders.\nShares of TMTG (DJT) fell roughly 17% mid-day Monday. The stock had rocketed higher in recent months in anticipation of merging a blank-check acquisition company with Trump's media business. But it has lost more than 60% of its value from its peak on March 26, the day after the merger was completed and it started trading publicly as TMTG.\nMonday. The stock had rocketed higher in recent months in anticipation of merging a blank-check acquisition company with Trump's media business. But it has lost more than 60% of its value from its peak on March 26, the day after the merger was completed and it started trading publicly as TMTG. 'Whenever you see a stock jump, like you saw this jump, a secondary offering is always a risk,' said Tuttle. 'I think a lot of investors in this don't know that. … You've got a lot of probably Trump fans sitting there saying, what the heck?'\nStill, the stock's move lower based on this latest update will likely be temporary, he said.\n'This is going to piss some people off. Other people might look at it and try to buy the dip,' said Tuttle. 'As long as Trump is in the news in some way, shape or form, this is going to be a meme stock. People are going to trade it.'\nShareholders, including Trump, have already seen their holdings dwindle in value since the company went public.\nAnyone who bought Trump Media at the closing high of $66.22 on March 27 has now lost more than half of their money. The steep declines have put a dent in Trump's net worth. The former president's stake was valued at $5.2 billion at the closing high for Trump Media's stock price. As of Monday morning, it had plummeted to about $2.3 billion. Trump's net worth fell about $400,000 Monday from the stock's plunge.\nThis filing also seeks to register more than 146 million shares held by some stockholders for resale — including all 114.8 million of Trump's 78.8 million current and 36 million potential shares that could be granted if the stock price holds above a certain level.\nAlthough they won't be able to sell those shares right away, this move means they're one step closer to being able to once the rest of the prohibitions are cleared including a six-month lock up period, says Michael Ohlrogge, associate professor at NYU School of Law.\nThere are a number of reasons behind the stock's eye-popping swings. The company is tied to Trump, a polarizing political figure whose association with the stock has attracted scrutiny. Trump Media's public debut also marked the former president's return to Wall Street after years of regulatory and legal hurdles.\nExperts have warned retail investors to be careful if they choose to trade the stock, especially because the company doesn't have the fundamentals to back up its sky-high valuation. Trump Media lost $58 million in 2023 and made just $4.1 million in revenue.\nTrump currently owns more than 57% of the company's shares. Unless he were to purchase stock in the new public offering, Trump would own just under half of the company's publicly traded stock after it issues more shares.\nBut the company needs money. It has said it has substantial doubt about its ability to continue operating. The company generates little revenue, it's losing millions of dollars and it is losing many of its users as well.\nAlthough the share offering was not directly related to Trump's criminal trial beginning Monday, the company noted in a warning to potential investors that Trump's ongoing legal proceedings pose a risk to the company's reputation and brand.\n'President Donald J. Trump is the subject of numerous legal proceedings. An adverse outcome in one or more of the ongoing legal proceedings could negatively impact TMTG,' the company noted. 'If President Donald J. Trump were to cease to be able to devote substantial time to Truth Social, TMTG's business would be adversely affected.'\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and context.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and context.",

Follow him on Threads . The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. CNN —\nCNN — Two different rallies in support of Donald Trump posed a dangerous situation, yet produced two vastly different responses from the former president.\nOn Saturday, shortly before his rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, was scheduled to kick off, Trump — by phone from his private jet — told his supporters who remained for the outdoor event that he was canceling because of the severe weather threat that posed 'a certain danger to all of this.' Trump — whose message played over loudspeakers at the rally — added that 'we want to make sure that everybody is safe above all,' as he urged them to quickly 'leave the site and seek shelter.'\nYet on January 6, 2021, as Trump supporters laid siege to the Capitol — and 129 of those participants have been charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to police officers who tried to maintain law and order — Trump was silent for more than three hours rather than swiftly putting out a statement similar to the call to his North Carolina supporters to immediately 'leave the site' for the safety of all.\nsupporters to immediately 'leave the site' for the safety of all. Instead, as member Rep. Elaine Luria, a Virginia Democrat, said during a July 2022 hearing of the bipartisan House committee charged with investigating the Jan. 6 attack, 'Trump sat in his dining room and watched the attack on television while his senior-most staff, closest advisers and family members begged him' to put out a statement urging his supporters to immediately leave. Luria added, 'When lives and our democracy hung in the balance, President Trump refused to act because of his selfish desire to stay in power.'\nWe saw dramatically different conduct by Trump in the face of these two events. On Saturday, after the National Weather Service warned of the likelihood of dangerous winds and hail, Trump appeared to be concerned for supporters whom he desperately needs to win the battleground state of North Carolina — which he barely won in 2020 by less than 1.5%. Trump promptly directed his faithful voters to leave to avoid danger.\nIn contrast, on Jan. 6, Trump was concerned with remaining in power despite losing the election and, thus, wanted his supporters to remain there to help him with that task. In fact, more than an hour into the brutal Capitol attack that Trump was 'gleefully' watching on television, per then-White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, Trump attacked Vice President Mike Pence with a tweet that declared Pence 'didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.' Former Deputy National Security Adviser Matt Pottinger later described that tweet as 'fuel being poured on the fire.'\nThe Jan. 6 committee's investigation determined that Trump's tweet was followed by surging crowds both outside and inside the Capitol, which had been breached 11 minutes earlier.\nTrump has celebrated and defended the Jan. 6 attackers in the years since. Some shockingly unpatriotic examples include Trump speaking at a fundraiser he welcomed at his country club to support those charged for their role in the attack.\nThen there's Trump kicking off a rally by asking the crowd to 'please rise for the horribly and unfairly treated January 6 hostages' followed by a recording of the national anthem performed by a choir of people incarcerated in connection with the attack on our Capitol on Trump's behalf. And Trump has defended the Jan. 6 prisoners as 'hostages' and 'patriots' as he has vowed to pardon 'a large portion of them' — 'as soon as the first day' of a new term — if he is elected in November.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook Trump's continued praise of the Jan. 6 attackers may explain why at Trump's rally on Saturday at least 10 men wearing the uniform of the Proud Boys — an extremist organization very involved in the Jan. 6 attack — were seen outside the entrance. And it's why one of those people felt comfortable holding a sign that read, 'Free All of the J6 Prisoners.' Several high-ranking members of the Proud Boys — whom Trump directed at a September 2020 presidential debate to 'stand back and stand by' — have been convicted of serious felonies in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, including their leader, Enrique Tarrio, who was sentenced to more than 20 years in prison for seditious conspiracy and other charges. The Proud Boys and the others who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6 were there for Trump, which is apparently why Trump has their back if he gets back in office.\nAs NBC News reported, after Trump told his supporters to flee the bad weather Saturday, loud groans of disappointment were heard from the audience. But that was followed by their 'swift departure.' On Jan. 6, Trump finally released a video at 4:17 p.m. that called for 'peace' and directed his supporters 'to go home now.' A little over an hour later, the Capitol building was secured.\nTrump supporters obviously listen to him. So should you. Not to heed Trump's words like they do, but to grasp that Trump's celebration of the Jan. 6 attackers and especially his vow to pardon them risks encouraging future violence by his supporters. And this is the man GOP voters have chosen to be their 2024 presidential nominee.",

Former President Donald Trump, who has previously been found liable in civil trials, is now set to face charges that could land him in prison.\nTrump is accused of 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection with a hush money payment his former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, made to adult-film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, to cover up an alleged affair ahead of the 2016 election. (Trump has pleaded not guilty.)\nThe verdict may well depend on whether the jury of 12 understands the gravity of the matter: Far from being about sex or small-time fraud, it is about Trump's alleged attempt to win the 2016 presidential election by burying a last-minute story that could have cost him votes. The case will require jurors to focus on the actual charges and not become distracted by the tawdry sexual details surrounding the case.\nImpartiality is the key to jury justice, but we can hardly expect jurors to approach the case without strong opinions about Trump. Indeed, it would be disturbing to seat jurors whose only qualification was their ignorance about major news events of the day.\nFortunately, an open mind does not require an empty mind. We can find fair jurors who understand the difference between law and politics. The presiding judge, Juan Merchan, managed to seat just such a fair jury in the 2022 trial of the Trump Organization. He can do so here as well, by following standard practice in New York and elsewhere of excusing persons for hardship and then probing the rest for bias during a process known as the voir dire.\nThe process may take longer than the usual jury selection and the pool of persons questioned will be larger. But otherwise, the process will be familiar. In selecting 18 persons – 12 jurors and six alternates – each side can challenge an unlimited number of jurors for 'cause,' namely bias. And even if the judge finds a potential juror impartial, New York law in a felony trial such as this gives Trump and the prosecution 10 peremptory strikes each – the right to excuse a person for any reason at all, so long as the challenge isn't motivated by racial or equivalent forms of group prejudice.\nMerchan has already released the questionnaire he will use to vet persons for bias. It consists of 42 questions in which he strikes a sensible balance between questions he will not allow – asking jurors how they vote or what their political party affiliation is – and inquiries he will permit; for example, asking whether a potential juror supports groups such as the Proud Boys on the right or Antifa on the left.\nPotential jurors can be asked whether they have ever attended pro- or anti-Trump rallies or followed his social media posts or Cohen's podcasts. Such questions will help detect those with the kind of extreme commitments that harden a juror's mind before trial.\nBut there will be differences from normal New York practice. One is that the names of jurors will be kept from the public, even though the parties will know them. Another is that Merchan plans to take jurors who self-identify as biased at their word and excuse them without the normal follow-up individual interview. He argues that such individual questioning would be time-consuming and largely a charade that would not change the need to excuse such persons.\nOf course, a Manhattan trial venue favors the government, since the borough chose Biden over Trump in the 2020 election by a margin of 86% to 12%. There is something to be said for Trump's claim that he faces an uphill battle in jury selection.\nBut for months now, Trump has tried to tilt the playing field by unleashing his own prejudicial pretrial publicity. In the usual case, the defendant is the one who complains that media coverage has biased jurors. Indeed, Trump lodged this complaint in arguing unsuccessfully for moving the trial from Manhattan or postponing it.\nBut this is a case where the defendant had as much access to the media as the government did. On social media, Trump called Merchan 'a certified Trump hater' and went so far as to accuse the judge's daughter of working to 'Get Trump,' in reference to her role in a firm that does digital campaign work for Democrats. As District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleged in a court filing, Trump is the one who sought 'to pollute the jury pool by making baseless and inflammatory accusations' about 'witnesses, individual prosecutors, and the Court itself.'\nTrump's savvy when it comes to creating a media frenzy in his favor explains why the juror questionnaire specifically asks potential jurors whether they have ever 'followed Donald Trump on any social media' or 'have any feelings or opinions about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case.'\nRelated video Smerconish: Can Trump get a fair trial in Manhattan?\nRelated video Smerconish: Can Trump get a fair trial in Manhattan? It is a good guess that the prosecution will argue that frequent followers of Trump's social media posts have been prejudiced beyond repair. It is an equally good surmise that Trump will counter by going after those who check the box next to The New York Times as their major source of news. Each side plays hunches about what makes a juror more favorable to their side than the other.\nOne factor likely to complicate jury selection is the expected introduction into evidence of salacious sexual details about Trump's alleged affair with Daniels, which he denies. Indeed, the prosecution is expected to buttress its case by showing Trump had an alleged pattern of paying hush money to cover up sexual peccadillos, including with a former Playboy model.\nTypically, a defendant, especially a married man running for president, would prefer avoiding the embarrassment and humiliation of airing dirty laundry in public. But Trump may try a 'what's all the fuss about' defense and prefer jurors who dismiss the charges as an overblown reaction to just another sex story. Trump has survived previous sex scandals and he may prefer jurors predisposed to view the case as one about his private life rather than about important pubic matters.\nTrue, another New York jury found Trump liable of defaming and sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll in 2023 and again this year. But there the jury faced evidence that the sex was coerced. The trial that begins today is about paying Daniels to keep quiet about an alleged consensual affair.\nDuring jury selection, both sides will also try to anticipate how prospective jurors might react to the testimony of key prosecution witness, Cohen. He is the onetime Trump loyalist who flipped on his boss and pled guilty to charges stemming from falsifying records to conceal the hush money payments Trump allegedly asked him to make on his behalf to Daniels.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook Trump has fiercely attacked the credibility of Cohen, and Cohen has responded. This is why Question 35 on the questionnaire asks what jurors know of their feud, including whether they have read or listened to any of Cohen's books or podcasts.\nSome jurors might have more trouble than others believing the testimony of a convicted felon. Some might have negative reactions to someone who turned on a former boss. That is why each side might do well to sketch a personality profile of each potential juror. A person who, through military training or otherwise, values loyalty above all else might make a pro-Trump juror, whereas the government might prefer the kind of person who admires whistleblowers and distrusts blind loyalty.\nThere is a famous quip of unknown origin that goes: 'In England, the trial starts when jury selection is over. In the US, it is already over.' It remains to be seen whether this proves true in a trial without precedent.",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — Donald Trump's criminal New York hush money trial begins Monday, more than a year after the former president was indicted in the case.\nThe trial, which will begin with jury selection, is expected to feature several high-profile witnesses, including those who were in Trump's inner circle around the 2016 election, sources have told CNN.\nHere are the notable people in this case.\nThe former president has been accused of taking part in an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election and an unlawful plan to suppress negative information, which included a hush-money payment made to an adult film star to hide an affair. Trump has denied the affair.\nProsecutors allege that Trump allegedly disguised the transaction as a legal payment and falsified business records numerous times to 'promote his candidacy.'\nTrump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records. He has pleaded not guilty.\nAdult-film star Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels, received a $130,000 payment just days before the 2016 presidential election.\nShe shared in a documentary released last month that she accepted the payment to keep her one-night stand with Trump in 2006 from becoming public to protect her husband and daughter.\nTrump's attorneys subsequently used the release of the documentary to try to bar Daniels from testifying and argued that it should be grounds to dismiss the indictment or delay the trial — both unsuccessful challenges, though the judge did delay the trial on separate grounds.\nThe $130,000 payment to Daniels was made by Cohen, then Trump's personal attorney, who landed in federal prison over that transaction for breaking campaign finance laws. Cohen, now a critical witness, has said that Trump directed him to make the payment to Daniels.\nTrump and his legal team attempted to bar Cohen from testifying, arguing that he's committed perjury more than once in other cases, but the request was denied last month.\nAs the then-chairman of American Media Inc., which publishes the National Inquirer, David Pecker was involved in numerous 'catch and kill' schemes he orchestrated on behalf of Trump and allegedly helped broker the deal with Daniels.\nAccording to court documents, an agent for Daniels contacted AMI in October 2016 and said that she was willing to go public with her allegations of an affair with Trump. Pecker then allegedly contacted Cohen, who subsequently negotiated the deal, per court filings from Cohen's plea agreement.\nIn a separate incident, AMI agreed to pay model and actress Karen McDougal $150,000 months before the 2016 election for her silence about an alleged affair with Trump. While this payment is not part of the charges against Trump, prosecutors are expected to use it to establish a pattern of such payments.\nPecker has been granted immunity in exchange for his testimony and AMI signed a non-prosecution agreement with prosecutors.\nThe day after the release of an 'Access Hollywood' tape in which Trump can be heard making vulgar comments about his treatment of women, Hope Hicks, who then served as Trump's campaign press secretary, called Cohen, according to court documents, to suppress additional allegations of a sexual nature from becoming public.\nFrom there, Cohen, acting as a middleman, was involved in at least 10 telephone calls that day, some involving Trump and Hicks and others involving Pecker and another AMI executive.\nCNN has previously reported that Hicks is expected to be called to testify, according to a source familiar with the case.\nAs the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg led the investigation into the former president's involvement in the hush money payment — a yearslong probe he inherited from his predecessor, who began the investigation when Trump was still in the White House.\nTrump has repeatedly attacked Bragg since the charges were brought, attempting to cast the investigation as politically motivated.\nNew York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan, who is known for maintaining control of his courtroom even when his cases draw considerable attention, will preside over this case.\nHe has previously been involved in other cases related to Trump and his allies, including the Trump Organization tax fraud trial, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's criminal fraud case and the sentencing of Trump's longtime chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg.\nTrump has made two requests for Merchan to be rescued from the case, while leveling attacks against the judge and his daughter over her political work for Democratic politicians. Merchan rejected the first motion last year. A separate emergency relief request by Trump to stop the trial so he could appeal a lower court's ruling on presidential immunity and have the judge recused from the case was rejected last week.\nMerchan has also imposed a gag order on the former president, barring him from making statements about attorneys, court staff, or the family members of prosecutors, lawyers, members of the court or the Manhattan district attorney.\nSydney Kashiwagi and CNN's Devan Cole, Kara Scannell, Lauren del Valle, Jeremy Herb, Marshall Cohen and Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report.\nSydney Kashiwagi and CNN's Devan Cole, Kara Scannell, Lauren del Valle, Jeremy Herb, Marshall Cohen and Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report.",

Here's what we know about them: The first seated juror, who will be the foreperson on Trump's jury, is a man originally from Ireland. He works in sales and has some college education. He is married but doesn't have kids. He reads The New York Times and Daily Mail and watches some Fox News and MSNBC. The second juror is an oncology nurse who lives with her fiancé. She's a native New Yorker. She reads The New York Times and watches CNN. The third seated juror is a corporate lawyer. He's originally from Oregon. He gets his news from The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Google. He's a younger man who's never been married and doesn't have kids. The fourth juror is an older man originally Puerto Rico who's married with adult children and two grandkids. When asked about his hobbies, he said, \"I guess my hobby is my family.\" He has an IT business for training and consulting and attended one year of college. He told the court he finds Trump fascinating and mysterious. 'So many people are set off one way or the other and that is interesting,' the man said. 'Really, this one guy can do all of this, wow.' Trump 'makes things interesting,' the man said, but also didn't indicate any strong feelings about his politics. The fifth juror is a young Black woman who teaches English language in a public charter school system. She has a master's degree in education, is not married and doesn't have any kids. The juror said that as a person of color she has friends who have strong opinions on Trump, but she personally is not a political person. She said she tries to avoid political conversations and doesn't really care for the news. The juror did say she appreciates Trump's candor: 'President Trump speaks his mind and I'd rather that than someone who's in office who you don't know what they're thinking.\" She was also the only juror of 18 in the box Tuesday morning who said she wasn't aware that Trump is facing charges in other criminal cases. The sixth juror is a software engineer at a large broadcast company who recently graduated from college. She voiced no strong feelings about Donald Trump one way or the other and said, 'I will be fair and impartial.\" She is not married and has no kids, currently living with three roommates in Chelsea. The juror gets her news from The New York Times, Google, Facebook and TikTok. She asked the judge whether her sister's wedding on a Sunday in September would be a scheduling conflict. Merchan quipped, 'If we were still here in September that would be a big problem,' garnering laughs in the courtroom. The seventh juror is a civil litigator who is married with two kids and lives on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. Originally from North Carolina, he reads The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, New York Post and The Washington Post. He said he has \"political views as to the Trump presidency\" and that he thinks there were likely Trump administration policies he disagreed with. \"I don't know the man and I don't have opinions about him personally,\" he said. \"I certainly follow the news, I'm aware there are other lawsuits out there. But I'm not sure that I know anyone's character.\" 7 hr 32 min ago From CNN's Aditi Sangal Former President Donald Trump awaits the start of proceedings at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York on Tuesday. Mary Altaffer/Pool/AP Before Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial began, experts had deemed that selecting a jury would be a long and challenging task. But seven jurors had already been seated by the end of Day 2. Five more jurors, as well as six alternates, are required for jury selection to conclude. 'Remember, the tactic here from defense counsel for months and months, it was to delay this trial. This pace is absolutely antithetical to trying to delay that process. In other words, this defendant, Donald Trump, has the pacing of most defendants who are charged with the crime in New York City,' CNN chief legal analyst Laura Coates said Tuesday. Remember: For months now, Trump's team has pushed to delay the New York trial, as part of the former president's broader strategy of trying to push back all four of his trials until after the 2024 election. 7 hr 36 min ago From CNN's Kara Scannell, Jeremy Herb, Lauren del Valle, Julian Cummings and Laura Dolan Former US President Donald Trump attends the first day of his trial at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City on April 15. Angela Weiss/Pool/Getty Images Donald Trump has faced three civil trials in New York since he left the White House, but this is the first time he faces possible jail time. The former president is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, stemming from reimbursements made to his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen for hush money payments he made before the 2016 election to an adult film star alleging an affair with Trump. The former president has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair with Stormy Daniels. Each count represents a separate instance of the alleged misconduct, pointing to different business records associated with a series of repayments to Cohen (ledger entries, checks, stubs, invoices, etc.) that were allegedly falsified to conceal his criminal conduct. Penalty: The maximum penalty for each count is four years in state prison. However, the judge has discretion on how long any sentence should be and whether to allow any sentences to be served consecutively. He could also sentence Trump to probation. New York caps sentencing for this type of felony at 20 years. A president has no authority to pardon state crimes. 7 hr 40 min ago From CNN's Maureen Chowdhury Kara McGee speaks with CNN on Tuesday. Kara McGee, a juror dismissed from the hush money criminal trial, told CNN Tuesday she wasn't sure if she was being considered for the case against Donald Trump until she walked into the courtroom and saw the former president. \"So yeah, it was when we walked into the courtroom and saw him that it was — that I was sure, that it was definitely this case,\" McGee said. She said that Trump made eye contact with her, which she said was \"odd.\" McGee said that it was a fascinating experience because on the one hand, she was aware that \"this is history in the making and whatever the outcome of this is, everything going forward will be affected by it\" and at the same time she walked into the courtroom and saw Trump sitting there and realized, \"Oh it's just a guy ... he's just a dude.\" McGee said that she believes she was dismissed because of her answer to a question regarding additional things that may impact her ability to serve on the jury. McGee said she mentioned her work schedule conflicting with her being able to be in court from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. for an extended period of time. She said she was dismissed right after that question, even though they did not specify why she was dismissed. 7 hr 44 min ago From CNN's Kaanita Iyer Donald Trump's legal team is frustrated after one juror was dismissed for having a pro-Trump bias, CNN's Kristen Holmes reported. The former president's attorneys have been concerned about the political makeup of Manhattan and worried that they were not going to get anyone sympathetic to Trump, according to Holmes. The defense team is not optimistic that it is going to win this case outright, Holmes says, but they are trying to get at least one sympathetic juror to try and aim for a hung jury. Remember: A unanimous verdict is required for conviction. 7 hr 47 min ago From CNN's Lauren del Valle, Jhasua Razo and Gillian Roberts Former President Donald Trump's first criminal trial is expected to take six to eight weeks from start to finish. This trial, related to a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016, is the first of four ongoing criminal cases that are expected to head to trial for the presumptive 2024 GOP presidential nominee. Read more about the stages of the case, and what they mean here. 8 hr 2 min ago The identities of the jurors will remain anonymous, but are known to the attorneys on both sides. On Monday, former President Donald Trump's attorney Todd Blanche asked Judge Juan Merchan how attorneys will get the names of the jury pool. Merchan said he will give them copies of jury lists with just numbers and a single copy with names and numbers. He told the lawyers the jurors are not to be photographed. 8 hr 17 min ago From CNN's Amy O'Kruk and Curt Merrill Former President Donald Trump was first indicted in March 2023 by the Manhattan district attorney on state charges related to a hush money payment to an adult film star in 2016. As the case goes to trial, catch up on the key people in the case below: 8 hr 19 min ago An exhaustive process is underway to seat 12 jurors , along with six alternates, for Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial. The judge released the questionnaire that will be presented to potential jurors, which contains multiple questions that could signal political views to the lawyers on both sides. Here's what potential jurors could be asked about: News consumption.\nAffiliations with groups like the Proud Boys, QAnon and Antifa.\nWhether they or anyone in their circle attended a Trump rally or an anti-Trump event.\nIf they've ever read books or listened to podcasts from Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and a key witness for the district attorney.\nIf they've read any of Trump's own books.\nIf they have views on whether a former president can be charged in state court.\nIf they have views on how Trump is being treated in this case. Why does this matter: The questions will be used for the judge to strike jurors at the outset, if they don't believe they can render a verdict fairly. They will also be used by lawyers for both sides to strike jurors for any reason — a key part of the jury selection process.\nProsecutors and Donald Trump's attorneys are reviewing the latest panel of 18 potential jurors after asking them about their feelings about the former president and whether they can remain fair in the trial.\nThere are currently five seated jurors in Trump's hush money criminal trial, after two empaneled jurors were excused today.

Mary Altaffer/Pool/AP Before Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial began, experts had deemed that selecting a jury would be a long and challenging task. But seven jurors had already been seated by the end of Day 2.\nFive more jurors, as well as six alternates, are required for jury selection to conclude.\n'Remember, the tactic here from defense counsel for months and months, it was to delay this trial. This pace is absolutely antithetical to trying to delay that process. In other words, this defendant, Donald Trump, has the pacing of most defendants who are charged with the crime in New York City,' CNN chief legal analyst Laura Coates said Tuesday. Remember: For months now, Trump's team has pushed to delay the New York trial, as part of the former president's broader strategy of trying to push back all four of his trials until after the 2024 election.\nRemember: For months now, Trump's team has pushed to delay the New York trial, as part of the former president's broader strategy of trying to push back all four of his trials until after the 2024 election. 7 hr 36 min ago From CNN's Kara Scannell, Jeremy Herb, Lauren del Valle, Julian Cummings and Laura Dolan\nFormer US President Donald Trump attends the first day of his trial at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City on April 15. Angela Weiss/Pool/Getty Images Donald Trump has faced three civil trials in New York since he left the White House, but this is the first time he faces possible jail time.\nThe former president is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, stemming from reimbursements made to his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen for hush money payments he made before the 2016 election to an adult film star alleging an affair with Trump. The former president has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair with Stormy Daniels.\nEach count represents a separate instance of the alleged misconduct, pointing to different business records associated with a series of repayments to Cohen (ledger entries, checks, stubs, invoices, etc.) that were allegedly falsified to conceal his criminal conduct.\nPenalty: The maximum penalty for each count is four years in state prison.

Kara McGee, a juror dismissed from the hush money criminal trial, told CNN Tuesday she wasn't sure if she was being considered for the case against Donald Trump until she walked into the courtroom and saw the former president.\n\"So yeah, it was when we walked into the courtroom and saw him that it was — that I was sure, that it was definitely this case,\" McGee said. She said that Trump made eye contact with her, which she said was \"odd.\" McGee said that it was a fascinating experience because on the one hand, she was aware that \"this is history in the making and whatever the outcome of this is, everything going forward will be affected by it\" and at the same time she walked into the courtroom and saw Trump sitting there and realized, \"Oh it's just a guy ... he's just a dude.\"\nMcGee said that she believes she was dismissed because of her answer to a question regarding additional things that may impact her ability to serve on the jury. McGee said she mentioned her work schedule conflicting with her being able to be in court from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. for an extended period of time. She said she was dismissed right after that question, even though they did not specify why she was dismissed.\n7 hr 44 min ago From CNN's Kaanita Iyer\nDonald Trump's legal team is frustrated after one juror was dismissed for having a pro-Trump bias, CNN's Kristen Holmes reported.\nThe former president's attorneys have been concerned about the political makeup of Manhattan and worried that they were not going to get anyone sympathetic to Trump, according to Holmes.\nThe defense team is not optimistic that it is going to win this case outright, Holmes says, but they are trying to get at least one sympathetic juror to try and aim for a hung jury.\nRemember: A unanimous verdict is required for conviction.\nRemember: A unanimous verdict is required for conviction. 7 hr 47 min ago From CNN's Lauren del Valle, Jhasua Razo and Gillian Roberts\nFormer President Donald Trump's first criminal trial is expected to take six to eight weeks from start to finish.\nThis trial, related to a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016, is the first of four ongoing criminal cases that are expected to head to trial for the presumptive 2024 GOP presidential nominee.\nRead more about the stages of the case, and what they mean here.\n8 hr 2 min ago The identities of the jurors will remain anonymous, but are known to the attorneys on both sides.\nOn Monday, former President Donald Trump's attorney Todd Blanche asked Judge Juan Merchan how attorneys will get the names of the jury pool.

            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump's New York criminal hush money trial, set to begin Monday, brings with it a long list of charges, witnesses, potential penalties, appeals and attorneys.\nHere's everything you need to know.\nThe charges stem from reimbursements made to Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen for hush money payments he made before the 2016 election to adult film star Stormy Daniels to stop her from speaking publicly about her alleged affair with Trump a decade earlier. The former president has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair with Daniels.\nWhile it's known as the 'hush money' trial, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has said this case is about election interference, alleging the $130,000 payment was part of a wider scheme enacted by Trump and his allies from 2015 to 2017 to keep damaging information from voters.\nProsecutors allege that once the 'Access Hollywood' tape – wherein Trump speaks graphically about his proclivity to grope women – became public, the campaign was scrambling to quash Daniels' allegation out of concern of how it would play with female voters. Prosecutors will have to prove that Trump is guilty of falsifying business records with the intent to hide that $130,000 payment.\nTrump is required to attend the trial unless he receives a waiver from Judge Juan Merchan.\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's Office officially launched its investigation into the alleged hush money schemes under the previous DA, Cy Vance, in August 2018, the same month Cohen pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the Daniels payments. Under Vance, prosecutors shifted their investigation to focus on the Trump Organization's finances and away from the repayment scheme.\nBragg, who took office in January 2022, has accused Trump of leaning on his political power to avoid criminal responsibility for years and campaigned on a promise to prosecute the former president. A grand jury was eventually green-lit to hear the hush money case in December 2022, leading to the historic indictment of the former president just over a year ago.\nCohen said he paid Daniels at Trump's request shortly before the 2016 election to keep her quiet. Cohen paid Daniels the $130,000 through a shell corporation he set up and funded at a Manhattan bank. Cohen plead guilty in 2018 to violating federal campaign finance laws and implicated Trump directly in the scheme.\nThe falsified business records include invoices created by Cohen, entries for the payments recorded on Trump books, and checks that were mostly signed by Trump to Cohen. Prosecutors allege they falsely say the payments were for legal expenses pursuant to a retainer agreement, but prosecutors allege there never was a retainer agreement.\nTrump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, all related to the cover-up of hush money payments to Daniels.\nEach count represents a separate instance of the alleged misconduct, pointing to different business records associated with a series of repayments to Cohen (ledger entries, checks, stubs, invoices, etc.) that were allegedly falsified to conceal his criminal conduct.\nThe maximum penalty for each count is four years in state prison, but the judge has discretion over how long any sentence should be and whether to allow any sentences to be served consecutively. He could also sentence Trump to probation.\nNew York caps sentencing for this type of felony at 20 years. A president has no authority to pardon state crimes.\nJury selection is expected to take one to two weeks, with the entire trial expected to last six to eight weeks.\nTrump's attorneys went to a New York appeals court three times this past week to try to pause the trial while the court heard challenges on several issues. All of the requests for stays were swiftly rejected, though Trump's lawyers will still be able to continue to litigate their appeals on several issues – including the gag order and recusing the judge – even if the trial is not paused.\nEarlier this month, Merchan expanded his gag order, banning Trump from attacking witnesses and jurors, to include family members of the court and family members of the Manhattan district attorney.\nMerchan warned that Trump's rhetoric threatens to instill fear in those who might be involved in the proceedings for their loved ones. Trump is still allowed to comment on Bragg and Merchan, who he has since accused of taking away his First Amendment rights.\nAn appeal on the gag order is still pending.\nCourt officials expect that about 100 new prospective jurors from Manhattan at a time will be brought into Merchan's downtown Manhattan courtroom to be vetted to ultimately sit on a 12-person jury with six alternates.\nThe potential jurors will be asked to fill out a questionnaire giving information on where in the city they live, where they get their news, their feelings about the former president, whether they've ever attended a rally for the former president or had any affiliations with groups like the Proud Boys or with the QAnon movement.\nNotably, they won't be asked what political party they belong to or how they've voted in the past. Merchan said he will not ask jurors their thoughts on the 2020 election outcome.\nBut the judge plans to ask whether anyone feels they could not be fair or impartial or otherwise serve in the case and then excuse those who raise their hands without inquiring further.\nIn a letter Friday afternoon, Trump's attorneys said that approach is 'inadequate because the plan would not create a sufficient record for the purpose of any necessary appellate review, or a venue-change motion.' Instead, they asked the judge to distinguish between jurors who said they can't be fair and those who are otherwise unable to serve.\nThe jury will remain anonymous to the public to avoid 'exposing them to an atmosphere of intimidation' and Merchan warned Trump in a gag order that he can't make public comments or direct anyone else to make public comments about jurors involved in the proceedings.\nOther witnesses will include bankers and Trump Organization officials who handled the payments, lawyers involved in the transaction, as well as other people who worked on Trump's campaign, the people said.\nCohen, Daniels, Trump's longtime friend and former chief executive of American Media David Pecker, and Trump's former campaign spokesperson Hope Hicks are among the high-profile witnesses who are expected to be called by prosecutors, according to people familiar with the case.\nManhattan prosecutors\n- Alvin Bragg\nManhattan prosecutors\n- Alvin Bragg - Matthew Colangelo\n- Christopher Conroy\n- Joshua Steinglass\n- Susan Hoffinger\n- Becky Mangold\nTrump criminal attorneys\nTrump criminal attorneys - Todd Blanche\n- Emil Bove\n- Susan Necheles",

Please scroll through the posts below to learn about the third day of Trump's trial in New York. 11 hr 48 min ago Seven jurors were seated in Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial Tuesday. Here's what we know about them: The first seated juror, who will be the foreperson on Trump's jury, is a man originally from Ireland. He works in sales and has some college education. He is married but doesn't have kids. He reads The New York Times and Daily Mail and watches some Fox News and MSNBC. The second juror is an oncology nurse who lives with her fiancé. She's a native New Yorker. She reads The New York Times and watches CNN. The third seated juror is a corporate lawyer. He's originally from Oregon. He gets his news from The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Google. He's a younger man who's never been married and doesn't have kids. The fourth juror is an older man originally Puerto Rico who's married with adult children and two grandkids. When asked about his hobbies, he said, \"I guess my hobby is my family.\" He has an IT business for training and consulting and attended one year of college. He told the court he finds Trump fascinating and mysterious. 'So many people are set off one way or the other and that is interesting,' the man said. 'Really, this one guy can do all of this, wow.' Trump 'makes things interesting,' the man said, but also didn't indicate any strong feelings about his politics. The fifth juror is a young Black woman who teaches English language in a public charter school system. She has a master's degree in education, is not married and doesn't have any kids. The juror said that as a person of color she has friends who have strong opinions on Trump, but she personally is not a political person. She said she tries to avoid political conversations and doesn't really care for the news. The juror did say she appreciates Trump's candor: 'President Trump speaks his mind and I'd rather that than someone who's in office who you don't know what they're thinking.\" She was also the only juror of 18 in the box Tuesday morning who said she wasn't aware that Trump is facing charges in other criminal cases. The sixth juror is a software engineer at a large broadcast company who recently graduated from college. She voiced no strong feelings about Donald Trump one way or the other and said, 'I will be fair and impartial.\" She is not married and has no kids, currently living with three roommates in Chelsea. The juror gets her news from The New York Times, Google, Facebook and TikTok. She asked the judge whether her sister's wedding on a Sunday in September would be a scheduling conflict. Merchan quipped, 'If we were still here in September that would be a big problem,' garnering laughs in the courtroom. The seventh juror is a civil litigator who is married with two kids and lives on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. Originally from North Carolina, he reads The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, New York Post and The Washington Post. He said he has \"political views as to the Trump presidency\" and that he thinks there were likely Trump administration policies he disagreed with. \"I don't know the man and I don't have opinions about him personally,\" he said. \"I certainly follow the news, I'm aware there are other lawsuits out there. But I'm not sure that I know anyone's character.\" 11 hr 50 min ago From CNN's Aditi Sangal Former President Donald Trump awaits the start of proceedings at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York on Tuesday. Mary Altaffer/Pool/AP Before Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial began, experts had deemed that selecting a jury would be a long and challenging task. But seven jurors had already been seated by the end of Day 2. Five more jurors, as well as six alternates, are required for jury selection to conclude. 'Remember, the tactic here from defense counsel for months and months, it was to delay this trial. This pace is absolutely antithetical to trying to delay that process. In other words, this defendant, Donald Trump, has the pacing of most defendants who are charged with the crime in New York City,' CNN chief legal analyst Laura Coates said Tuesday. Remember: For months now, Trump's team has pushed to delay the New York trial, as part of the former president's broader strategy of trying to push back all four of his trials until after the 2024 election. 11 hr 53 min ago From CNN's Kara Scannell, Jeremy Herb, Lauren del Valle, Julian Cummings and Laura Dolan Former US President Donald Trump attends the first day of his trial at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City on April 15. Angela Weiss/Pool/Getty Images Donald Trump has faced three civil trials in New York since he left the White House, but this is the first time he faces possible jail time. The former president is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, stemming from reimbursements made to his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen for hush money payments he made before the 2016 election to an adult film star alleging an affair with Trump. The former president has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair with Stormy Daniels. Each count represents a separate instance of the alleged misconduct, pointing to different business records associated with a series of repayments to Cohen (ledger entries, checks, stubs, invoices, etc.) that were allegedly falsified to conceal his criminal conduct. Penalty: The maximum penalty for each count is four years in state prison. However, the judge has discretion on how long any sentence should be and whether to allow any sentences to be served consecutively. He could also sentence Trump to probation. New York caps sentencing for this type of felony at 20 years. A president has no authority to pardon state crimes. 11 hr 57 min ago From CNN's Maureen Chowdhury Kara McGee speaks with CNN on Tuesday. Kara McGee, a juror dismissed from the hush money criminal trial, told CNN Tuesday she wasn't sure if she was being considered for the case against Donald Trump until she walked into the courtroom and saw the former president. \"So yeah, it was when we walked into the courtroom and saw him that it was — that I was sure, that it was definitely this case,\" McGee said. She said that Trump made eye contact with her, which she said was \"odd.\" McGee said that it was a fascinating experience because on the one hand, she was aware that \"this is history in the making and whatever the outcome of this is, everything going forward will be affected by it\" and at the same time she walked into the courtroom and saw Trump sitting there and realized, \"Oh it's just a guy ... he's just a dude.\" McGee said that she believes she was dismissed because of her answer to a question regarding additional things that may impact her ability to serve on the jury. McGee said she mentioned her work schedule conflicting with her being able to be in court from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. for an extended period of time. She said she was dismissed right after that question, even though they did not specify why she was dismissed. 12 hr 1 min ago From CNN's Kaanita Iyer Donald Trump's legal team is frustrated after one juror was dismissed for having a pro-Trump bias, CNN's Kristen Holmes reported. The former president's attorneys have been concerned about the political makeup of Manhattan and worried that they were not going to get anyone sympathetic to Trump, according to Holmes. The defense team is not optimistic that it is going to win this case outright, Holmes says, but they are trying to get at least one sympathetic juror to try and aim for a hung jury. Remember: A unanimous verdict is required for conviction. 12 hr 4 min ago From CNN's Lauren del Valle, Jhasua Razo and Gillian Roberts Former President Donald Trump's first criminal trial is expected to take six to eight weeks from start to finish. This trial, related to a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016, is the first of four ongoing criminal cases that are expected to head to trial for the presumptive 2024 GOP presidential nominee. Read more about the stages of the case, and what they mean here. 12 hr 19 min ago The identities of the jurors will remain anonymous, but are known to the attorneys on both sides. On Monday, former President Donald Trump's attorney Todd Blanche asked Judge Juan Merchan how attorneys will get the names of the jury pool. Merchan said he will give them copies of jury lists with just numbers and a single copy with names and numbers. He told the lawyers the jurors are not to be photographed. 12 hr 34 min ago From CNN's Amy O'Kruk and Curt Merrill Former President Donald Trump was first indicted in March 2023 by the Manhattan district attorney on state charges related to a hush money payment to an adult film star in 2016. As the case goes to trial, catch up on the key people in the case below: 12 hr 37 min ago An exhaustive process is underway to seat 12 jurors , along with six alternates, for Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial. The judge released the questionnaire that will be presented to potential jurors, which contains multiple questions that could signal political views to the lawyers on both sides. Here's what potential jurors could be asked about: News consumption.\nAffiliations with groups like the Proud Boys, QAnon and Antifa.\nWhether they or anyone in their circle attended a Trump rally or an anti-Trump event.\nIf they've ever read books or listened to podcasts from Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and a key witness for the district attorney.\nIf they've read any of Trump's own books.\nIf they have views on whether a former president can be charged in state court.\nIf they have views on how Trump is being treated in this case. Why does this matter: The questions will be used for the judge to strike jurors at the outset, if they don't believe they can render a verdict fairly. They will also be used by lawyers for both sides to strike jurors for any reason — a key part of the jury selection process.\nWhere things stand: The full 12-person jury has been seated in Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial. The panel comprises seven men and five women. A woman was also chosen as an alternate Thursday.

Read more opinion at CNN.\nJeffrey Abramson is emeritus professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin and author of 'We, The Jury: The Jury System and the Ideal of Democracy.' The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. CNN —\nCNN — On Monday, jury selection for the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president begins in Manhattan. Former President Donald Trump, who has previously been found liable in civil trials, is now set to face charges that could land him in prison.\nTrump is accused of 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection with a hush money payment his former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, made to adult-film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, to cover up an alleged affair ahead of the 2016 election. (Trump has pleaded not guilty.)\nThe verdict may well depend on whether the jury of 12 understands the gravity of the matter: Far from being about sex or small-time fraud, it is about Trump's alleged attempt to win the 2016 presidential election by burying a last-minute story that could have cost him votes. The case will require jurors to focus on the actual charges and not become distracted by the tawdry sexual details surrounding the case.\nImpartiality is the key to jury justice, but we can hardly expect jurors to approach the case without strong opinions about Trump. Indeed, it would be disturbing to seat jurors whose only qualification was their ignorance about major news events of the day.\nFortunately, an open mind does not require an empty mind. We can find fair jurors who understand the difference between law and politics. The presiding judge, Juan Merchan, managed to seat just such a fair jury in the 2022 trial of the Trump Organization. He can do so here as well, by following standard practice in New York and elsewhere of excusing persons for hardship and then probing the rest for bias during a process known as the voir dire.\nThe process may take longer than the usual jury selection and the pool of persons questioned will be larger. But otherwise, the process will be familiar. In selecting 18 persons – 12 jurors and six alternates – each side can challenge an unlimited number of jurors for 'cause,' namely bias. And even if the judge finds a potential juror impartial, New York law in a felony trial such as this gives Trump and the prosecution 10 peremptory strikes each – the right to excuse a person for any reason at all, so long as the challenge isn't motivated by racial or equivalent forms of group prejudice.\nMerchan has already released the questionnaire he will use to vet persons for bias. It consists of 42 questions in which he strikes a sensible balance between questions he will not allow – asking jurors how they vote or what their political party affiliation is – and inquiries he will permit; for example, asking whether a potential juror supports groups such as the Proud Boys on the right or Antifa on the left.\nPotential jurors can be asked whether they have ever attended pro- or anti-Trump rallies or followed his social media posts or Cohen's podcasts. Such questions will help detect those with the kind of extreme commitments that harden a juror's mind before trial.\nBut there will be differences from normal New York practice. One is that the names of jurors will be kept from the public, even though the parties will know them. Another is that Merchan plans to take jurors who self-identify as biased at their word and excuse them without the normal follow-up individual interview. He argues that such individual questioning would be time-consuming and largely a charade that would not change the need to excuse such persons.\nOf course, a Manhattan trial venue favors the government, since the borough chose Biden over Trump in the 2020 election by a margin of 86% to 12%. There is something to be said for Trump's claim that he faces an uphill battle in jury selection.\nBut for months now, Trump has tried to tilt the playing field by unleashing his own prejudicial pretrial publicity. In the usual case, the defendant is the one who complains that media coverage has biased jurors. Indeed, Trump lodged this complaint in arguing unsuccessfully for moving the trial from Manhattan or postponing it.\nBut this is a case where the defendant had as much access to the media as the government did. On social media, Trump called Merchan 'a certified Trump hater' and went so far as to accuse the judge's daughter of working to 'Get Trump,' in reference to her role in a firm that does digital campaign work for Democrats. As District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleged in a court filing, Trump is the one who sought 'to pollute the jury pool by making baseless and inflammatory accusations' about 'witnesses, individual prosecutors, and the Court itself.'\nTrump's savvy when it comes to creating a media frenzy in his favor explains why the juror questionnaire specifically asks potential jurors whether they have ever 'followed Donald Trump on any social media' or 'have any feelings or opinions about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case.'\nvideo\nvideo Related video Smerconish: Can Trump get a fair trial in Manhattan?\nRelated video Smerconish: Can Trump get a fair trial in Manhattan? It is a good guess that the prosecution will argue that frequent followers of Trump's social media posts have been prejudiced beyond repair. It is an equally good surmise that Trump will counter by going after those who check the box next to The New York Times as their major source of news. Each side plays hunches about what makes a juror more favorable to their side than the other.\nOne factor likely to complicate jury selection is the expected introduction into evidence of salacious sexual details about Trump's alleged affair with Daniels, which he denies. Indeed, the prosecution is expected to buttress its case by showing Trump had an alleged pattern of paying hush money to cover up sexual peccadillos, including with a former Playboy model.\nTypically, a defendant, especially a married man running for president, would prefer avoiding the embarrassment and humiliation of airing dirty laundry in public. But Trump may try a 'what's all the fuss about' defense and prefer jurors who dismiss the charges as an overblown reaction to just another sex story. Trump has survived previous sex scandals and he may prefer jurors predisposed to view the case as one about his private life rather than about important pubic matters.\nTrue, another New York jury found Trump liable of defaming and sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll in 2023 and again this year. But there the jury faced evidence that the sex was coerced. The trial that begins today is about paying Daniels to keep quiet about an alleged consensual affair.\nDuring jury selection, both sides will also try to anticipate how prospective jurors might react to the testimony of key prosecution witness, Cohen. He is the onetime Trump loyalist who flipped on his boss and pled guilty to charges stemming from falsifying records to conceal the hush money payments Trump allegedly asked him to make on his behalf to Daniels.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook Trump has fiercely attacked the credibility of Cohen, and Cohen has responded. This is why Question 35 on the questionnaire asks what jurors know of their feud, including whether they have read or listened to any of Cohen's books or podcasts.\nSome jurors might have more trouble than others believing the testimony of a convicted felon. Some might have negative reactions to someone who turned on a former boss. That is why each side might do well to sketch a personality profile of each potential juror. A person who, through military training or otherwise, values loyalty above all else might make a pro-Trump juror, whereas the government might prefer the kind of person who admires whistleblowers and distrusts blind loyalty.\nThere is a famous quip of unknown origin that goes: 'In England, the trial starts when jury selection is over. In the US, it is already over.' It remains to be seen whether this proves true in a trial without precedent.",

            "excerpt": "Former President Donald Trump is on the cusp of scoring a major financial bonanza – at least on paper.",
            "summary": "New York CNN —\nNew York CNN — Former President Donald Trump is on the cusp of scoring a major financial bonanza – at least on paper.\nAs long as Trump Media & Technology Group's share price doesn't spectacularly implode before Tuesday's closing bell, Trump is on track to receive another 36 million shares as the owner of Truth Social.\nThis milestone is on track to be hit after the market closes on Tuesday.\nEven though Trump Media is losing money and Truth Social is very tiny, those new shares Trump is in line to receive would be valued at about $1.3 billion at current prices.\n$1.3 billion at current prices. Trump's net worth has been on a roller coaster ride ever since his social media company finalized its deal to go public late last month. The former president is the dominant shareholder in a stock that has been called a 'meme stock on steroids.'\nAlthough Trump Media's share price has been cut in half since peaking on March 27, it's still trading comfortably above levels that would trigger certain performance provisions in the merger agreement.\nAccording to SEC filings, Trump Media can issue additional shares to pre-merger shareholders such as the former president if the dollar volume-weighted average price equals or exceeds $12.50 for any 20 trading days within any 30 day trading period beginning on March 25.\nThe full earnout of 40 million shares would be triggered if that price metric equals or exceeds $17.50 over the same timeframe.\nTuesday marks the 20 th trading day and Trump Media's share price has not traded below the $17.50 level at any point since the clock started on March 25.\nth trading day and Trump Media's share price has not traded below the $17.50 level at any point since the clock started on March 25. 'It seems almost certain to me that the earnout conditions will be satisfied at this point, given how high the share price has been,' said Michael Ohlrogge, an associate professor at the NYU School of Law.\nThe merger agreement calls for Trump to receive 90% of those earnout shares, translating to 36 million additional shares.\nThat would give Trump an even more dominant stake of 114.75 million shares, amounting to 65% of the total outstanding shares, according to filings.\nOf course, Trump Media's share price is subject to extreme volatility, meaning the value of this stake can swing wildly.\nThere are also practical and legal restrictions that would likely prevent Trump from cashing in this stock anytime soon.\nAccording to filings, the earnout shares Trump appears to be in line to receive are subject to the lock-up restrictions that prevent insiders from selling or borrowing against their stock for months after the merger closed.\nEven if Trump was able to get around this lock-up agreement, experts say it would be practically difficult for him to sell a sizable chunk of his stake without causing a crash in the share price. After all, Trump is the largest shareholder, chairman and most popular user on Truth Social.\nEven though Trump Media's share price has retreated since spiking to $66 last month, experts warn it remains overvalued based on fundamental metrics.\nOne common way to value stocks is to compare its price relative to its revenue.\nThe average social media stock trades at a price-to-sales ratio of roughly 10x, according to Matthew Kennedy, senior IPO strategist at Renaissance Capital. That peer group includes Facebook owner Meta, Pinterest, Snap, Reddit and Rumble.\nBy comparison, Trump Media is trading at north of 1,200 times sales, according to Kennedy.\n'The stock appears to be grossly overvalued,' said Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida.\nRitter, who has been studying IPOs for four decades, expects Trump Media's share price to eventually plunge to just $1 or $2 per share.\nOhlrogge, the NYU professor, said Trump Media's share price is 'responding primarily to non-rational factors.'\nFor instance, Ohlrogge pointed to how the stock plunged last week after the company indicated it plans to register new shares.\n'There should have been nothing surprising about that filing since it was just doing precisely what the company said it would do after it went public…There was no real rational reason to have a negative impact on the price,' he said, adding that the price reflects the 'whims and sentiments of very uninformed traders, driving the price this way and that.'\nIn a sign that Trump Media is worried about its share price, the company took the unusual step last week of telling its shareholders how to avoid their stock from being loaned to short sellers betting against it.\nTrump Media updated a FAQ section on its website to include the short-selling prevention tips.\n'That is highly unusual,' said Peter Byrne, a securities lawyer at Cooley who focuses on companies going public. 'We don't typically see companies publish information like this.'",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — Donald Trump has been inside a half-dozen courthouses over the past year, but he had a new experience walking into a downtown Manhattan courtroom Monday morning: a half-empty room.\nThe former president slowly walked through the cavernous and dingy courtroom, past six empty rows of benches – set aside for prospective jurors – giving a quick glance to the six reporters sitting in the back row before sauntering to the front of the room and taking his seat at the defense table.\nThe vacant rows served as a reminder to Trump that he's in a different setting now that he's a criminal defendant for the first time. By the afternoon, the courtroom was packed full with 96 jurors – some of whom may be on the jury who will hear the hush money trial against the Republican presumptive presidential nominee.\nRelated article Takeaways from the first day of the Trump hush money trial\nRelated article Takeaways from the first day of the Trump hush money trial Trump only spoke three times during Monday's session, acknowledging to the judge he understood his rights as a criminal defendant. Throughout the day Trump often engaged with his attorneys, whispering to them and sharing notes as they debated motions with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.\nTrump also sat back at times and closed his eyes as Judge Juan Merchan slogged through the jury pool and asked up to 42 questions of each prospective juror.\nWhile Trump didn't have a platform inside the courtroom, he didn't take long to make his feelings known when he left for the day, speaking to the camera right outside the courtroom after pulling out his iPhone from his suit pocket and handing it to an aide.\n'It looks like the judge does not allow me to escape this scam. It's a scam,' Trump said, complaining that the judge said he could not attend next week's Supreme Court arguments on presidential immunity and his son's graduation, though Merchan did not rule one way or the other on whether Trump would be excused for the graduation.\nBoth during the morning session and when jurors were brought in during the afternoon, just six reporters and one sketch artist sat inside the courtroom, forming a protective pool that gave reports on what they saw and heard to the roughly 100 reporters watching on closed-circuit television screens in an overflow courtroom.\nTrump sat at the defendant's table between his attorneys, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove. During breaks, he conferred with Blanche frequently.\nTrump watched the computer screen at the defense table as the district attorney's office played evidence that his lawyers argued should be kept out of the trial, including a snippet of his deposition from the E. Jean Carroll defamation case where he was asked about the 'Access Hollywood' tape and footage from a 2016 rally where he denied sexual assault allegations that followed the tape emerging.\nTrump also looked forward as his tweets about his former fixer Michael Cohen from 2018 and his posts on Truth Social from this year were shown in the courtroom.\nWhen the jury pool was brought in, most jurors did not visibly react upon sitting down and seeing Trump was the defendant in the case. One male juror turned to his left as he walked into the courtroom, appeared to see Trump and smiled.\nTrump looked toward Merchan as the judge addressed the prospective jurors to explain the case and their instructions as potential jurors. Trump craned his neck and then turned around in his seat as more than 50 prospective jurors of the 96 brought into the courtroom initially raised their hand to indicate they couldn't be impartial in the trial.\nEntering and exiting the courtroom, Trump had to walk right past Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought this case against Trump and was seated in the fourth row behind his prosecutors.\nIn the morning, Trump did not look in Bragg's direction, but in the afternoon he stared over to Bragg and the press pool as the jurors left the courtroom.\n﻿Trump will be back at the defendant's table on Tuesday, when Merchan will continue questioning the prospective jurors who could ultimately decide whether to convict Trump in the first criminal trial of a former president. There were 32 jurors left in the pool from the 96 that started at the end of the day Monday – and Merchan suggested another new batch of prospective jurors may be brought in Tuesday, too.",

Rebecca Wright/CNN Donald Trump has faced three civil trials in New York since he left the White House, but this is the first time he faces possible jail time. The former president is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, stemming from reimbursements made to his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen for hush money payments he made before the 2016 election to an adult film star alleging an affair with Trump. The former president has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair with Stormy Daniels. Each count represents a separate instance of the alleged misconduct, pointing to different business records associated with a series of repayments to Cohen (ledger entries, checks, stubs, invoices, etc.) that were allegedly falsified to conceal his criminal conduct. Penalty: The maximum penalty for each count is four years in state prison. However, the judge has discretion on how long any sentence should be and whether to allow any sentences to be served consecutively. He could also sentence Trump to probation. New York caps sentencing for this type of felony at 20 years. A president has no authority to pardon state crimes. 10 min ago From CNN's Devan Cole Judge Juan Merchan poses for a picture in his chambers in New York, Thursday, March 14. Seth Wenig/AP/File The New York judge overseeing Donald Trump's hush money trial will take center stage in the case Monday with jury selection kicking off in the historic criminal prosecution of the former president. New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan is a seasoned jurist who is no stranger to Trump's orbit. He has presided over the Trump Organization tax fraud trial, sentenced the former president's close confidant Allen Weisselberg to prison over his role in the scheme and overseen former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's criminal fraud case. But it's the former president's trial on charges that he illegally falsified business records over the reimbursement of hush money payments made before the 2016 election that will leave a lasting mark on Merchan's long career atop the state-level trial court. Merchan launched his legal career in 1994 when he started off as an assistant district attorney in the trial division in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. Several years later, he moved on to the state attorney general's office, where he worked on cases in Long Island. In 2006, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, then a Republican, appointed Merchan to Family Court in the Bronx, and Democratic Gov. David Paterson appointed him to the New York State Court of Claims in 2009, the same year he began serving as an acting New York Supreme Court judge. Born in Bogotá, Colombia, Merchan emigrated to the United States at the age of six and grew up in the New York City neighborhood of Jackson Heights, Queens, according to a New York Times profile of the judge. He was the first in his family to go to college. He received his law degree from Hofstra University. 13 min ago From CNN's Paula Reid Donald Trump's lawyers expect to have a Sandoval hearing today before jury selection gets underway in the hush money trial, a source familiar with the plans tells CNN. A Sandoval hearing is a common preliminary proceeding that reviews a defendant's criminal history and looks at how much prosecutors can ask if a defendant testifies. 22 min ago From CNN's Amy O'Kruk and Curt Merrill Former President Donald Trump was first indicted in March 2023 by the Manhattan district attorney on state charges related to a hush money payment to an adult-film star in 2016. Now the case is going to trial. Catch up on the key people in the case below: 27 min ago From CNN's Kara Scannell and Lauren del Valle Donald Trump will make history when he arrives in lower Manhattan Monday morning as the first former president to go on trial for criminal charges. Despite a blitz of last-minute attempts to derail the trial, jury selection is expected to get underway and will continue until a panel of 12 New Yorkers and alternates are seated, a process that could take at least a week. The historic trial centers on a potential sex scandal coverup that took place just days before the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors allege Trump falsified business records to hide the reimbursement of hush money payments that were made to influence the election outcome. Trump has pleaded not guilty and has denied having an affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels. The case will be a major test for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, as it may be the only one of Trump's four criminal cases to face a jury before Election Day. Trump will trade the campaign trail for the courtroom, where the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is expected to be four days a week for the next two months. The former president has used his court appearances to rally supporters for his campaign but, despite his showmanship, the stakes for Trump are high. Trump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. If convicted, Judge Juan Merchan, the no-nonsense judge overseeing the trial, could sentence Trump to probation or a maximum sentence of 1 1/3 to 4 years on each count in state prison. A president has no authority to pardon state crimes. 40 min ago From CNN's Lauren del Valle, Jhasua Razo and Gillian Roberts Former President Donald Trump's first criminal trial begins Monday. Jury selection will start, and is expected to take six to eight weeks for the whole process from start to finish. This trial, related to a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016, is the first of four ongoing criminal cases that are expected to head to trial for the presumptive 2024 GOP presidential nominee. Read more about the stages of the case, and what they mean here. 31 min ago From CNN's Stephen Collinson The United States will cross a historic threshold on Monday when for the first time a former president goes on criminal trial in a case laced with fateful significance because Donald Trump could be back in the Oval Office next year. When the presumptive GOP nominee walks into court for the start of jury selection, he and the country will enter a new state of reality as legal and political worlds collide in a trial almost guaranteed to deepen Americans' bitter ideological estrangement. The trial, related to hush money payments to an adult film actress before the 2016 election, will mark yet another extraordinary twist in the story of Trump, whose incessant testing of the limits of presidential decorum and the law has caused nearly nine years of political tumult and may still have years left to run. It raises the possibility that, depending on the jury's verdict, the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election could be a convicted felon. And given the case's subject matter — details about a payment to a woman who alleged that she had a sexual relationship with Trump, which he denies — it could reflect poorly on Trump's character and ethics as voters weigh their decisions in November. Read Collinson's full analysis ahead of Trump's first criminal trial . 40 min ago From CNN's Mark Morales When former President Donald Trump appears in a New York courtroom today to face an unprecedented legal battle in his hush money case, law enforcement will deploy a sophisticated and multi-layered security plan greater than that of his previous high-profile cases in Manhattan, law enforcement officials told CNN. Trump, who is supposed to be in court and does not have the option of skipping any of the estimated six-to-eight week trial, is now the presumptive Republican nominee set to rematch President Joe Biden in November – a key difference from his attendance during a civil fraud case brought by state Attorney General Letitia James that inherently raises the stakes and will mean a more robust security package. The hallmark of the strategy is a combination of extra staffing, strategically placed frozen zones, and high-tech deployments and intelligence, which includes monitoring social media for anything ranging from lone wolf threats to major politically themed protests and disturbances, the officials said. 'Obviously, the threat picture is bigger,' said New York Police Department Assistant Chief John Hart, commanding officer of the NYPD's Intelligence and Counterterrorism Division, who added that the department did a similar security ramp-up around Trump when he became the GOP nominee in 2016. Read more about how law enforcement is preparing for the trial. 2 min ago From CNN's Kate Sullivan Former President Donald Trump attends a news conference at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on April 12. Wilfredo Lee/AP Former President Donald Trump said Friday he would testify at his New York criminal hush money trial. 'Yeah, I would testify,' Trump said at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago, Florida, as he continued railing against the charges against him. 'I'm testifying. I tell the truth. I mean, all I can do is tell the truth. And the truth is that there's no case, they have no case,' he added.

Trump will trade the campaign trail for the courtroom, where the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is expected to be four days a week for the next two months.\nThe former president has used his court appearances to rally supporters for his campaign but, despite his showmanship, the stakes for Trump are high. Trump is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. If convicted, Judge Juan Merchan, the no-nonsense judge overseeing the trial, could sentence Trump to probation or a maximum sentence of 1 1/3 to 4 years on each count in state prison. A president has no authority to pardon state crimes.\n40 min ago From CNN's Lauren del Valle, Jhasua Razo and Gillian Roberts\nFormer President Donald Trump's first criminal trial begins Monday.\nJury selection will start, and is expected to take six to eight weeks for the whole process from start to finish.\nThis trial, related to a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016, is the first of four ongoing criminal cases that are expected to head to trial for the presumptive 2024 GOP presidential nominee.\nRead more about the stages of the case, and what they mean here.\n31 min ago From CNN's Stephen Collinson\nThe United States will cross a historic threshold on Monday when for the first time a former president goes on criminal trial in a case laced with fateful significance because Donald Trump could be back in the Oval Office next year.\nWhen the presumptive GOP nominee walks into court for the start of jury selection, he and the country will enter a new state of reality as legal and political worlds collide in a trial almost guaranteed to deepen Americans' bitter ideological estrangement.\nThe trial, related to hush money payments to an adult film actress before the 2016 election, will mark yet another extraordinary twist in the story of Trump, whose incessant testing of the limits of presidential decorum and the law has caused nearly nine years of political tumult and may still have years left to run. It raises the possibility that, depending on the jury's verdict, the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election could be a convicted felon. And given the case's subject matter — details about a payment to a woman who alleged that she had a sexual relationship with Trump, which he denies — it could reflect poorly on Trump's character and ethics as voters weigh their decisions in November.\nRead Collinson's full analysis ahead of Trump's first criminal trial .\nRead Collinson's full analysis ahead of Trump's first criminal trial. 40 min ago From CNN's Mark Morales\nWhen former President Donald Trump appears in a New York courtroom today to face an unprecedented legal battle in his hush money case, law enforcement will deploy a sophisticated and multi-layered security plan greater than that of his previous high-profile cases in Manhattan, law enforcement officials told CNN.\nTrump, who is supposed to be in court and does not have the option of skipping any of the estimated six-to-eight week trial, is now the presumptive Republican nominee set to rematch President Joe Biden in November – a key difference from his attendance during a civil fraud case brought by state Attorney General Letitia James that inherently raises the stakes and will mean a more robust security package.\nThe hallmark of the strategy is a combination of extra staffing, strategically placed frozen zones, and high-tech deployments and intelligence, which includes monitoring social media for anything ranging from lone wolf threats to major politically themed protests and disturbances, the officials said.\n'Obviously, the threat picture is bigger,' said New York Police Department Assistant Chief John Hart, commanding officer of the NYPD's Intelligence and Counterterrorism Division, who added that the department did a similar security ramp-up around Trump when he became the GOP nominee in 2016.\nRead more about how law enforcement is preparing for the trial.\nRead more about how law enforcement is preparing for the trial. 2 min ago From CNN's Kate Sullivan\nFormer President Donald Trump attends a news conference at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on April 12.

Jabin Botsford/Pool/Reuters Donald Trump has been inside a half-dozen courthouses over the past year, but he had a new experience walking into a downtown Manhattan courtroom Monday morning: a half-empty room.\nThe former president slowly walked through the cavernous and dingy courtroom, past six empty rows of benches – set aside for prospective jurors – giving a quick glance to the six reporters sitting in the back row before sauntering to the front of the room and taking his seat at the defense table.\nThe vacant rows served as a reminder to Trump that he's in a different setting now that he's a criminal defendant for the first time. By the afternoon, the courtroom was packed full with 96 jurors – some of whom may be on the jury who will hear the hush money trial against the Republican presumptive presidential nominee.\nTrump only spoke three times during Monday's session, acknowledging to the judge he understood his rights as a criminal defendant.

He served as counsel to the House Judiciary Committee for the first impeachment and trial of Donald Trump. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. CNN —\nCNN — Judge Juan Merchan began the long-awaited Manhattan criminal trial of former President Donald Trump on Monday by interviewing prospective jurors. Debate has been raging about every aspect of this historic trial – including what to call it. It is the first of four expected criminal trials involving Trump, and the only one in American history to feature a former president as the defendant.\nAlthough it has long been referred to as the 'hush money' case, the judge's first substantive words to the jury made clear that is wrong. We should call it an 'election interference' trial going forward.\nWhen the judge described the case to prospective jurors, he said. 'The allegations are in substance, that Donald Trump falsified business records to conceal an agreement with others to unlawfully influence the 2016 presidential election.' (Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied all wrongdoing in the cases against him.)\nMerchan's point: The core issue in the trial that began Monday is not the payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels in October 2016 to conceal her claimed affair with Trump (he denies the affair took place). The core issue is why Trump made them.\nwhy Trump made them. Paying hush money by itself is not a crime. The crime alleged in this case is felony document falsification, as the judge detailed. That requires intent to conceal, aid or commit another crime. Here, the prosecution alleges that the intent was to violate federal campaign finance laws and also the state statute prohibiting the 'unlawful influence' of an election — i.e., election interference.\nanother crime. Here, the prosecution alleges that the intent was to violate federal campaign finance laws and also the state statute prohibiting the 'unlawful influence' of an election — i.e., election interference. That point was also cleverly hammered home during the first half of Monday's proceedings. The morning was devoted to resolving the remaining legal disputes before the trial can begin, mostly about what evidence could be used. Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass skillfully advanced the election interference theory by structuring his evidentiary points in chronological order within that frame.\nSteinglass began with issues relating to the alleged August 2015 Trump Tower meeting where Trump, his former fixer Michael Cohen and David Pecker, former chairman and CEO of American Media, which publishes the National Enquirer, allegedly agreed to benefit Trump's campaign through a 'catch and kill' scheme of buying salacious stories and then burying them to diminish their ability to taint Trump's presidential campaign.\nSteinglass then raised legal issues that hit the other key moments as the alleged scheme unfolded throughout 2015 and 2016, ending on the two crucial players in the payoff: Daniels and Cohen. It was a virtuoso summary of what we can expect at trial.\nOf course, it's one thing, as the judge also explained, for the DA to make those allegations. It's another thing to prove them, and District Attorney Alvin Bragg must now do that. Trump, as the judge reminded the prospective jurors, is innocent until proven guilty and the case against him must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Trump says he is innocent and will by all indications vigorously contest the proceedings.\nBut we need to be accurate about what the accusation is that will now be the subject of that contestation. In a new book, I contend that given the indictment and the likely proof, using the 'hush money' label distracts from the main point of the case and diminishes its seriousness. Eminent experts increasingly agree, including one of our nation's leading constitutional scholars and other prominent legal commentators.\nThe essence of the charges here, therefore, are as significant in their own way as the ones concerning election interference in the 2020 campaign that have gotten more attention, a federal case brought by special prosecutor Jack Smith and a Georgia case brought by Fulton County DA Fani Willis.\nTrump's alleged 2020 attempt to overthrow our government distorts perceptions of how serious the charges related to the 2016 election are. We can't allow the extreme nature of Trump's later behavior to change the benchmark for what is a serious alleged offense. The Manhattan case meets that standard – and then some.\nElection interference skeptics contend the charges here are for document falsification by the Trump organization in 2017, after the 2016 election concluded, to hide what happened the year before from being revealed. How can we call this an election interference trial, they ask, if the election was already over when the 34 alleged document falsification crimes occurred?\nThese questions misunderstand that the payment to Daniels was itself allegedly illegal under federal and state law, and was plainly intended to influence the 2016 election. Cohen, as an individual, was limited by law to $2,700 in contributions to the campaign. Yet he transferred $130,000 to benefit the campaign, allegedly at Trump's direction.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook That is why Cohen pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance violations (in addition to other offenses), for which he was incarcerated. And no one can seriously dispute that the reason he and Trump allegedly hatched the scheme was to deprive voters of information that could have changed the outcome of an extremely close election.\nThe legitimacy of American governance rests upon the honesty of our elections. When information is withheld from voters, as Bragg alleges happened here, that undermines democracy. Calling this trial a mere 'hush money' case risks minimizing what's at stake. It is an election interference one and we should say so.",

            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump, now the presumptive Republican nominee, has made a number of promises on the campaign trail, including rolling back car pollution rules, building 10 new cities and appointing a special prosecutor to investigate President Joe Biden and his family. While some of Trump's plans are lacking in detail, here are some of the policies he says he would enact if elected for a second term. Trump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal last month and making a trip to the southern border on February 29, where he touted his previous hard-line immigration policies. In a Des Moines Register op-ed published roughly a week before winning the Iowa caucuses in January, Trump vowed to use the 'Alien Enemies Act to remove known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States.' 'We will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement — including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS,' he wrote. In a video posted on Truth Social in late February before his border visit, Trump also promised to 'carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.' After the Israel-Hamas war began last October, Trump also promised to terminate the visas of 'Hamas' sympathizers.' 'We'll get them off our college campuses, out of our cities and get them the hell out of our country, if that's OK with you,' he added. Trump announced plans in a September 2023 campaign video to close the Department of Education and send 'all education and education work and needs back to the states.' 'We want them to run the education of our children, because they'll do a much better job of it,' he added. The former president has also promised to 'put parents back in charge and give them the final say' in education. In a January 2023 campaign video, the former president said he would give funding preferences and 'favorable treatment' to schools that allow parents to elect principals, abolish teacher tenure for K-12 teachers, use merit pay to incentivize quality teaching and cut the number of school administrators, such as those overseeing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Trump also said in that campaign video that he would cut funding for schools that teach critical race theory and gender ideology. In a later speech, Trump said he would bring back the 1776 Commission, which was launched in his previous administration to 'teach our values and promote our history and our traditions to our children.' The former president said he would charge the Department of Justice and the Department of Education with investigating civil rights violations of race-based discrimination in schools while also removing 'Marxists' from the Department of Education. A second Trump administration would pursue violations in schools of both the Constitution's Establishment and Free Exercise clauses, which prohibit the government establishment of religion and protect a citizen's right to practice their own religion, he said. Last November, Trump promised to replace the Affordable Care Act, known colloquially as Obamacare, in a series of posts on Truth Social. A Trump-backed effort to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in 2017 after three Republicans senators joined with Democrats to vote against the bill. 'Getting much better Healthcare than Obamacare for the American people will be a priority of the Trump Administration,' he said. 'It is not a matter of cost, it is a matter of HEALTH. America will have one of the best Healthcare Plans anywhere in the world. Right now it has one of the WORST!,' he continued. He also doubled down on his vow during a speech in early January. Trump also vowed in a June 2023 campaign video to reinstate his previous executive order so that the US government would pay the same price for pharmaceuticals as other developed countries. Some of the former president's pharmaceutical policies were overturned by Biden. Trump has promised to use the Department of Justice to attack critics and former allies. In several videos and speeches, the former president also laid out plans to gut the current justice system by firing 'radical Marxist prosecutors that are destroying America.' 'I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,' Trump said in June 2023 remarks. 'I will totally obliterate the Deep State.' Trump said in a campaign video last year that he would reinstate a 2020 executive order to remove 'rogue' bureaucrats and propose a constitutional amendment for term limits on members of Congress. To address what he labeled the 'disturbing' relationship between technology platforms and the government, the former president said in a January 2023 video that he would enact a seven-year cooling off period before employees at agencies such as the FBI or CIA can work for platforms that oversee mass user data. Trump added in multiple campaign releases that he would task the Justice Department with investigating online censorship, ban federal agencies from 'colluding' to censor citizens and suspend federal money to universities participating in 'censorship-supporting activities.' In a September 2023 speech at the Family Research Council's Pray Vote Stand Summit in Washington, DC, Trump also touted plans to continue appointing conservative judges. 'I will once again appoint rock-solid conservative judges to do what they have to do in the mold of Justices Antonin Scalia; Samuel Alito, a great gentleman; and another great gentleman, Clarence Thomas,' he said. Trump has also pledged to 'appoint U.S. Attorneys who will be the polar opposite of the Soros District Attorneys and others that are being appointed throughout the United States.' In a September 2023 speech in Washington, DC, Trump also announced that he would appoint a task force to review the cases of people he claimed had been 'unjustly persecuted by the Biden administration.' Trump noted that he wanted to 'study the situation very quickly, and sign their pardons or commutations on day one.' It's a move that could lead to potential pardons of many rioters from the January 6, 2021, insurrection – which he suggested he would do at a CNN town hall in May 2023. * Only promises on judge appointments and congressional term limits are similar to prior campaigns Trump said in two February 2023 campaign videos that if 'Marxist' prosecutors refuse to charge crimes and surrender 'our cities to violent criminals,' he 'will not hesitate to send in federal law enforcement to restore peace and public safety.' Trump added that he would instruct the Department of Justice to open civil rights investigations into 'radical left' prosecutors' offices that engaged in racial enforcement of the law, encourage Congress to use their legal authority over Washington, DC, to restore 'law and order' and overhaul federal standards of disciplining minors to address rising crimes like carjackings. Addressing policies made in what Trump calls the 'Democrats' war on police,' the former president vowed in a campaign video that he would pass a 'record investment' to hire and retrain police, strengthen protections like qualified immunity, increase penalties for assaulting law enforcement officers and deploy the National Guard when local law enforcement 'refuses to act.' The former president added that he would require law enforcement agencies that receive money from his funding investment or the Department of Justice to use 'proven common sense' measures such as stop-and-frisk. Trump has continued his attacks against member countries of NATO, a European and North American defense alliance. At a South Carolina rally last month, Trump said he would not abide by the alliance's collective-defense clause and would encourage Russia to do 'whatever the hell they want' if a member country didn't meet spending guidelines. 'NATO was busted until I came along,' Trump said. 'I said, ‘Everybody's gonna pay.' They said, ‘Well, if we don't pay, are you still going to protect us?' I said, ‘Absolutely not.' They couldn't believe the answer.' The former president has also previously pledged to end the war in Ukraine, though he's offered no details on how he would do so. 'Shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,' Trump said at a New Hampshire campaign event last year, adding in another speech that it would take him 'no longer than one day' to settle the war if elected. Trump further addressed his strategy of stopping the 'never-ending wars' by vowing to remove 'warmongers,' 'frauds' and 'failures in the senior ranks of our government,' and replace them with national security officials who would defend America's interests. The former president added in a campaign video that he would stop lobbyists and government contractors from pushing senior military officials toward war. In addition, Trump has said he would restore his 'wonderful' travel ban on individuals from several majority-Muslim countries to 'keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country' after Biden overturned the ban in 2021. Trump said in multiple campaign videos that he would spearhead an effort to build so-called 'Freedom Cities' to 'reopen the frontier, reignite American imagination, and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people, all hardworking families, a new shot at home ownership and in fact, the American Dream.' In his plan, the federal government would charter 10 new cities on federal land, awarding them to areas with the best development proposals. The former president said in a campaign video that the Freedom Cities would bring the return of US manufacturing, economic opportunity, new industries and affordable living. In the March 2023 video, Trump added that the US under a second Trump administration would lead in efforts to 'develop vertical-takeoff-and-landing vehicles for families and individuals,' not letting China lead 'this revolution in air mobility.' The former president said these airborne vehicles would change commerce and bring wealth into rural communities. At the same rally in South Carolina, Trump pledged to impose 'stiff penalties on China and other trade abusers.' 'It's called you screw us, and we screw you,' Trump said. Under his proposed 'Trump Reciprocal Trade Act,' the former president said if other countries impose tariffs on the US, the country would impose 'a reciprocal, identical' tariff right back. It was the same pledge Trump made in a campaign video in 2023: to impose the same tariffs that other countries may impose on the US on those countries. The goal, the former president said then, is to get other countries to drop their tariffs. As part of a larger strategy to bring jobs back into the US, Trump also said he would implement his so-called 'America First' trade agenda if elected. By setting universal baseline tariffs on a majority of foreign goods, the former president said Americans would see taxes decrease as tariffs increase. His proposal also includes a four-year plan to phase out all Chinese imports of essential goods, as well as stopping China from buying up America and stopping the investment of US companies in China. Trump also said in February that he would consider imposing a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports if he's reelected. The former president has particularly focused on China, vowing in a January 2023 campaign video to restrict Chinese ownership of US infrastructure such as energy, technology, telecommunications and natural resources. Trump also said he would force the Chinese to sell current holdings that may put national security at risk. 'Economic security is national security,' he said. ``\nFormer President Donald Trump, now the presumptive Republican nominee, has made a number of promises on the campaign trail, including rolling back car pollution rules, building 10 new cities and appointing a special prosecutor to investigate President Joe Biden and his family.\nWhile some of Trump's plans are lacking in detail, here are some of the policies he says he would enact if elected for a second term.\nTrump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal last month and making a trip to the southern border on February 29, where he touted his previous hard-line immigration policies.\nIn a Des Moines Register op-ed published roughly a week before winning the Iowa caucuses in January, Trump vowed to use the 'Alien Enemies Act to remove known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States.'\n'We will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement — including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS,' he wrote.\nIn a video posted on Truth Social in late February before his border visit, Trump also promised to 'carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.'\nAfter the Israel-Hamas war began last October, Trump also promised to terminate the visas of 'Hamas' sympathizers.'\n'We'll get them off our college campuses, out of our cities and get them the hell out of our country, if that's OK with you,' he added.\nTrump announced plans in a September 2023 campaign video to close the Department of Education and send 'all education and education work and needs back to the states.'\n'We want them to run the education of our children, because they'll do a much better job of it,' he added.\nThe former president has also promised to 'put parents back in charge and give them the final say' in education. In a January 2023 campaign video, the former president said he would give funding preferences and 'favorable treatment' to schools that allow parents to elect principals, abolish teacher tenure for K-12 teachers, use merit pay to incentivize quality teaching and cut the number of school administrators, such as those overseeing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\nTrump also said in that campaign video that he would cut funding for schools that teach critical race theory and gender ideology. In a later speech, Trump said he would bring back the 1776 Commission, which was launched in his previous administration to 'teach our values and promote our history and our traditions to our children.'\nThe former president said he would charge the Department of Justice and the Department of Education with investigating civil rights violations of race-based discrimination in schools while also removing 'Marxists' from the Department of Education. A second Trump administration would pursue violations in schools of both the Constitution's Establishment and Free Exercise clauses, which prohibit the government establishment of religion and protect a citizen's right to practice their own religion, he said.\nLast November, Trump promised to replace the Affordable Care Act, known colloquially as Obamacare, in a series of posts on Truth Social. A Trump-backed effort to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in 2017 after three Republicans senators joined with Democrats to vote against the bill.\n'Getting much better Healthcare than Obamacare for the American people will be a priority of the Trump Administration,' he said.\n'It is not a matter of cost, it is a matter of HEALTH. America will have one of the best Healthcare Plans anywhere in the world. Right now it has one of the WORST!,' he continued. He also doubled down on his vow during a speech in early January.\nTrump also vowed in a June 2023 campaign video to reinstate his previous executive order so that the US government would pay the same price for pharmaceuticals as other developed countries. Some of the former president's pharmaceutical policies were overturned by Biden.\nTrump has promised to use the Department of Justice to attack critics and former allies. In several videos and speeches, the former president also laid out plans to gut the current justice system by firing 'radical Marxist prosecutors that are destroying America.'\n'I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,' Trump said in June 2023 remarks.

            "summary": "New York CNN —\nNew York CNN — Jury selection in Donald Trump's hush money business fraud case began Thursday looking like the task of finding 12 jurors had run aground.\nTwo of the seven initial jurors who were seated Tuesday were excused. Judge Juan Merchan's hopes to begin the trial on Monday with opening arguments appeared to be dwindling fast.\nBy the end of the day, the jury in the first criminal trial of a former president in US history had been seated. Only five alternates are left to be selected on Friday.\nIt's also clear the trial will be a bumpy one. The Manhattan district attorney's office, for instance, said it won't let the defense know who its first witnesses are to prevent Trump from posting on social media about them.\nA hearing over what prosecutors can say about Trump's legal history is also likely on Friday.\nHere are the takeaways from Thursday's topsy turvy jury selection in Trump's criminal trial:\nOnce Trump's attorneys and the district attorney's office used up their 10 peremptory strikes to remove jurors, things moved quickly.\nThe judge rejected Trump's challenges to remove jurors for cause because they had expressed negative opinions about Trump, telling the former president's attorneys that not liking his persona was not enough.\nThe seated jury includes seven men and five women. The new jurors empaneled Thursday include an investment banker, a security engineer, a retired wealth manager, a speech therapist and a physical therapist.\nThe jury pool was quickly whittled down from a second panel of 96 Thursday morning, after nearly 50 prospective jurors said they did not feel they could be fair and impartial and another nine said they had other conflicts.\nHear what Trump said minutes after jury was seated in hush money trial\n03:29 - Source: CNN\n03:29 - Source: CNN Compared to Tuesday, there were fewer jurors who had a change of heart once they began reading the questionnaire in the courtroom – just one of the initial 18 jurors was dismissed during that process on Thursday. (Court was dark on Wednesday.)\nPerhaps one reason: The second pool of jurors knew that Trump was the defendant on Tuesday, giving them time to think about being on the panel. The first panel of 96 jurors had to say whether they thought they could be fair just minutes after walking into the courtroom, seeing Trump as the defendant and hearing the judge explain the case and the jury's role.\nTrump's legal team ran out of peremptory challenges to remove a couple jurors who voiced negative opinions of the former president and his politics.\nOne woman who will eventually decide Trump's fate called him selfish and self-serving.\nJuror 11 was seated on the jury after Merchan denied Trump's challenge to the juror for cause. Trump's lawyers argued she should be dismissed because she said she does not like Trump's 'persona.'\n'I don't like his persona,' she said. 'I don't like some of my coworkers, but I don't try to sabotage their work.'\n'He just seems very selfish and self-serving so I don't really appreciate that in any public servant, so I don't know him as a person, so I don't know how he is in terms of his integrity,' she added. 'It's just not my cup of tea.'\nIn denying Trump's challenge, Merchan said it's not enough that she doesn't like his persona because she said she was certain she could set that aside to be fair and impartial.\nOn Thursday afternoon, jurors were generally more open about their opinions of Trump. Many said they don't like his politics or some of his behavior in public but felt they could see past that to be a fair and impartial juror.\nAnother juror said she doesn't agree with some of his politics, and when it was a frequent topic of conversation with friends and family when he was president, some negative opinions of Trump were floated.\nWhen asked by Trump's attorney Susan Necheles if she'd feel pressured by others to convict Trump, she said, 'Not at all.' She said she would make sure not to talk about the case with anybody.\nThere is one juror who follows Trump on social media and has read quotes from his book the 'Art of the Deal.'\nHe's an investment banker who has a master's degree. He said during voir dire that he follows Michael Cohen on Twitter and he's followed Trump since he became president, 'Generally because it was a news item when he would put a tweet out so good to be aware of that.'\nTrump's lawyers successfully petitioned Merchan to remove one woman who was questioned about several strongly worded anti-Trump social media posts. The defense lawyers used Trump's last few peremptory strikes to remove a woman who had slept at Necheles' home — Merchan denied a challenge for cause for that panelist.\nThursday morning highlighted how unpredictable the jury in a high-profile trial can be, especially in an unprecedented case that involves a former president. Thursday's court session began with one of the seven jurors who had been empaneled Tuesday returning to ask to be dismissed from the jury.\nThe juror, No. 2, an oncology nurse and native New Yorker, came in and said that she had concerns that 'aspects of my identity' have been made public after having friends, colleagues and family conveying to her that she had been identified as a potential juror.\nMerchan excused her without objections. The judge then directed the media not to mention physical appearances that could identify jurors. He complained specifically that there were reports that one of the jurors who was selected had an Irish accent.\n'We just lost' what would have been a good juror for the case, Merchan said.\nHe also told the media not to report on two questions on the questionnaire that all prospective jurors are being asked: Their current and former employers.\nLater, a second juror who had been seated was excused after prosecutors notified the court that during their research they found information about the juror showing that he was arrested in the 1990s for tearing down political advertisements.\nAt the end of the day, Trump's attorney Todd Blanche asked the district attorney's office to share the first three witnesses they plan to call, noting that opening arguments and the first witness testimony could begin as soon as Monday.\nThe district attorney's office refused. Assistant District Attorney Josh Steinglass acknowledged that courtesy is often extended. But because Trump has been posting on social media about their witnesses, he said with a shrug, 'We're not telling him who the witnesses are.'\nMerchan said he couldn't fault prosecutors for that. Trump visibly shook his head over the exchange.\nBlanche then proposed that he would assure the district attorneys' office that Trump would not post about the witnesses if they shared their witness list.\n'I don't think you can make that representation,' Merchan responded.\nBlanche continued to protest, but Merchan said he would not order them to turn over their witnesses. 'They're not required to,' he said.\nThe tactic from the district attorney's office means that not only will Trump's team be in the dark about upcoming witnesses, the DA's office could also choose to keep the identities of witnesses in the wings from the public, too – meaning it's possible witnesses become a surprise on a daily basis.\nFriday, there are 22 prospective jurors who have yet to go through the questionnaire process from the second panel. Merchan will begin with them to try to fill out a slate of five additional alternate jurors, although the judge noted he may change that number.\nTrump's attorneys and the district attorney's office also will get additional peremptory challenges for the alternate jurors. Neither used a challenge for the first alternate chosen on Thursday.\nIf jury selection wraps up quickly enough Friday, Merchan said he will hold what's called a Sandoval hearing Friday afternoon, where they will discuss what in Trump's legal history can be used to try to impeach him if he chooses to testify.\nProsecutors say in filings they'll ask the former president about the recent verdicts against him, including the recent civil fraud trial and the E. Jean Carroll defamation case.\nBut if a sufficient number of alternates cannot be chosen out of the 22, Merchan has teed up an additional panel of 96 jurors, who were sworn in Thursday and told to return on Friday – that's likely the final pool of people who will make up the Trump hush money trial jury.\nOn Thursday, the downtown Manhattan courtroom was noticeably cold – Trump commented on it to reporters as he left and his attorney even asked if the temperature could be raised. Merchan noted the temperature in the courtroom – perhaps in more ways than one – as the prospective jurors in the case filed in on Thursday.\n'I want to apologize that it's chilly in here,' Merchan said. 'We're trying to do the best we can to control the temperature, but it's one extreme or the other.'",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — A few weeks after being elected Manhattan's top prosecutor, Alvin Bragg sat in a Harlem café bullishly explaining how he planned to balance his reformist priorities for the borough with the infamously knotty task of confronting former President Donald Trump in court.\n'I've done a lot of cases that are considered no-win,' Bragg told CNN at the time, in December 2021. 'I think going into most of those cases people were like, ‘Ooh, you're gonna get a lot of heat however it comes out.' That's the job.'\nAbout 15 months later, on April 4, 2023, Bragg and his team of prosecutors stepped into that white-hot spotlight by indicting Trump on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments delivered to quiet a sex scandal ahead of the 2016 president election. Bragg sat in in the courtroom as Trump was arraigned on the charges. After a little more than a year of legal wrangling, pundits' clashing over the strength of his case and a tabloid backlash to his progressive politics, Trump's criminal trial – the first of its kind for a former American president – is set to begin on Monday in New York City.\nBragg is now facing up to what many of his peers and other outside observers would describe as the textbook definition of a 'no-win' assignment. His decision to prosecute Trump came under immediate, searing scrutiny from all quarters. Democrats largely viewed him as brave, even if they worried over the political implications of the case, while Republicans immediately cast the 50-year-old Harlem native as a craven opportunist acting on what Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan described as 'blatant political animus toward former President Trump.'\nManhattan's first Black district attorney, Bragg carries an estimable legal resume but none of the blue-blood pedigree enjoyed by his two predecessors, Cy Vance Jr. and Robert Morgenthau, whose fathers served in presidential administrations. Morgenthau first won the job in 1974. Vance took over in 2010. Previous occupants Charles Seymour Whitman and Thomas Dewey went on to become governors of New York. Dewey twice won the GOP presidential nomination, though he fell memorably shy of the White House on both occasions.\nBragg, a Harvard-educated attorney, previously served in roles including assistant US attorney in the Southern District of New York; a top lawyer in the New York attorney general's office, as a civil rights lawyer; and as a professor and co-director of the New York Law School Racial Justice Project, where he represented family members of the late Eric Garner in a lawsuit against the city. Garner was killed in 2014 after a plainclothes police officer placed him in an unauthorized chokehold following a dispute over his allegedly hawking loose cigarettes.\nThough Bragg's ambitions are widely considered to be less lofty than some of his predecessors, the Trump trial will likely write both his political future and legacy. The landmark case will take on added significance because of its timing – in the midst of a presidential campaign, first among four criminal cases, at the state and federal level, facing Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.\nThe indictment stems from a $130,000 payment made by Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen – now the prosecution's star witness – to adult film star Stormy Daniels days before the 2016 election. In exchange, she agreed to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump.\nProsecutors allege Trump was involved in the coverup, involving falsified invoices, business records and checks to repay Cohen. The theory of the case is that Trump and his allies were motivated to stop Daniel's story from offending female voters and therefore they tried to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.\nThe former president and his allies blitzed Bragg ahead of the charges, in some cases stoking fear about civil unrest to follow.\nOne of his lawyers, Alina Habba, warned of 'mayhem' across the city following an indictment, telling CNN, 'If there are (security) concerns, that's rightfully so.' Though her prediction fell flat, Trump himself responded with a similarly dramatic take, warning in a late night social media post of 'potential death & destruction' upon his being charged.\n'I never thought anything like this could happen in America, never thought it could happen,' Trump said in a more restrained statement about the indictment. 'The only crime that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it.'\nBragg's office faced a surge in threats after the indictment, forcing his security detail to bring in additional assistance from the New York police department. Twice last year, the district attorney's office received letters with white powder containing messages. One said, 'Alvin: I'm going to kill you.' The other letter included imagines of Bragg and Trump and the words 'you will be sorry.'\nThe former president, who has a habit of showing up to court even when his presence is not required, will be mandated to attend the trial and is expected to regularly address its developments. Despite multiple warnings from the presiding judge, Bragg, whom Trump has previously called a 'degenerate psychopath' and 'thug,' is likely to be at the center of his animus.\nFor his part, Bragg, who is not speaking to reporters ahead of the trial, has projected confidence that the facts of the case, and not the characters involved, will vindicate his decision to bring it. He has attended every pre-trial hearing in the case in support of his team .\n. 'At its core, this case today is one with allegations like so many of our white-collar cases,' Bragg said last year when announcing the charges. 'Someone lied again and again to protect their interests and evade the laws to which we are all held accountable.'\nBragg took office on the same day New York City Mayor Eric Adams was sworn-in, on January 1, 2022. He immediately set out to deliver on a pair of campaign promises: to aggressively pursue Trump's alleged misdeeds and put in place a new, more progressive model of law enforcement in the district attorney's office.\nNeither went as planned.\nLess than a week after coming on the job, Bragg released a memo outlining new charging, bail, plea and sentencing policies. His policies, he said, were rooted in his own experience – being held at gunpoint six times in his life, three of them by overzealous police officers. But his plan faced immediate blowback from police union leaders and right-wing media. After an election that Adams, a former NYPD officer, won largely on the strength of a tough-on-crime message, Bragg's list of crimes he would not prosecute – misdemeanors related to marijuana and resisting arrest, among them – landed with a thud.\n'Safety is paramount. New Yorkers deserve to be safe from crime and safe from the dangers posed by mass incarceration,' Bragg tweeted during the ensuing maelstrom. 'We will be tough when we need to be, but we will not be seeking to destroy lives through unnecessary incarceration.'\nThough the furor surrounding the memo eventually died down – in part because Bragg walked back parts of it – the new DA's pledge to come down hard on Trump, who was being investigated on multiple fronts by his predecessor, was ramping up.\nBut that pledge faced an unexpected adversary. Two months into office, Bragg was confronted by two senior attorneys leading the Trump investigation. They wanted to move forward and seek charges from a grand jury investigating the accuracy of the Trump Organization's financial statements that were used to obtain loans. When Bragg refused to authorize them to seek an indictment they abruptly and noisily resigned, putting additional pressure on the new district attorney.\nThat April, Bragg told CNN, 'Investigations are not linear, so we are following the leads in front of us. That's what we're doing.'\nMonths later, after his lawyers won a conviction of two Trump Organization entities on a decade long tax fraud scheme, his prosecutors quietly honed their focus, moving away from the financial statements and to the hush money payments.\nDuring his campaign for district attorney, Bragg repeatedly boasted, particularly during the Democratic primary, that he helped sue the Trump administration 'more than a hundred times' in his previous capacity as the state's chief deputy attorney general.\nBragg also touted his leadership role in one of that office's highest-profile lawsuits, targeting the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which then-attorney general Barbara Underwood said had been 'functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests,' with a 'shocking pattern of illegality' that included illegal intermingling with Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\nTrump eventually paid $2 million of his own money to a group of charities, and the foundation was dissolved. The memories of that encounter, and Bragg's campaign rhetoric, though, has endured, with Trump's legal and public relations teams repeatedly arguing Bragg cannot be considered an impartial party.\nIn February, concerns about Trump's behavior before and during the trial, along with hundreds of threats to Bragg's office, led prosecutors to seek a gag order against the former president, whose words they argued would 'pose a significant and imminent threat to the orderly administration of this criminal proceeding.' Bragg is not covered by the order, but his staff of prosecutors are.\nJudge Juan Merchan largely accepted the request, hoping to put the brakes on Trump's 'inflammatory' language. But only days after an expanded order was issued, Trump lashed out again – this time aiming his ire at Cohen and Daniels, who is also expected to testify.\nThe pair, he said on his Truth Social site, are 'sleaze bags who have, with their lies and misrepresentations, cost our Country dearly!'",

Angela Weiss/Pool/Getty Images Lawyers on both sides are working to select a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates in the hush money trial against former President Donald Trump.\nOn Monday, 96 prospective jurors were brought into Judge Juan Merchan's courtroom to be vetted. More than half were excused after saying they couldn't be fair and impartial, and at least nine others were excused after raising their hand when Merchan asked whether they could not serve for any other reason.\nBefore the selection process began, Merchan made several rulings on evidence that can be included in the trial.\nHow the process will work:\nHow the process will work: Potential jurors will complete a questionnaire created by the judge with input from the attorneys for Trump and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.\nIf the potential jurors make it into the jury box, they'll read their answers out loud. The attorneys and the judge can then ask follow-up questions to further vet them for possible conflicts or biases.\nEighteen potential jurors were called into the jury box Monday. Merchan questioned nine people before court ended for the day. One person was dismissed after she said she had firmly held beliefs about Trump. Merchan excused another juror who said his child was getting married on June 8.\nThe judge can dismiss prospective jurors for cause.

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — The United States will cross a historic threshold on Monday when for the first time a former president goes on criminal trial in a case laced with fateful significance because Donald Trump could be back in the Oval Office next year.\nWhen the presumptive GOP nominee walks into court for the start of jury selection, he and the country will enter a new state of reality as legal and political worlds collide in a trial almost guaranteed to deepen Americans' bitter ideological estrangement.\nThe trial, related to hush money payments to an adult film actress before the 2016 election, will mark yet another extraordinary twist in the story of Trump, whose incessant testing of the limits of presidential decorum and the law has caused nearly nine years of political tumult and may still have years left to run. It raises the possibility that, depending on the jury's verdict, the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election could be a convicted felon. And given the case's subject matter — details about a payment to a woman who alleged that she had a sexual relationship with Trump, which he denies — it could reflect poorly on Trump's character and ethics as voters weigh their decisions in November.\nHush money payments are not illegal. Trump is accused of falsifying business records to keep unflattering information that could have hurt his campaign from the voters in an alleged early example of election interference. The fact that this case stems from alleged personal conduct means that it could have a lesser political impact than Trump's three other looming trials, which are rooted in greater constitutional and legal concerns pertinent to the powers of the presidency.\nThe fact that this case stems from alleged personal conduct means that it could have a lesser political impact than Trump's three other looming trials, which are rooted in greater constitutional and legal concerns pertinent to the powers of the presidency. But the success of the ex-president's legal delaying tactics in the other cases — related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election and hoarding of classified documents — means the hush money trial may be the only one to take place before the election. And Trump — though he is entitled to the presumption of innocence and the airing of evidence like any other defendant — is showing signs of increasing agitation at the prospect of the trial and the indignity it represents for someone who used to be the most powerful man in the world.\nStill, if he had to choose only one of the quartet of cases to reach a conclusion before the election, it would be this one.\nRelated article Your questions about Trump's trial, answered\nRelated article Your questions about Trump's trial, answered The United States, unlike democracies that have been historically less stable, is not a nation accustomed to seeing its former heads of state on trial. While the circumstances of this case and Trump's broader legal troubles are unique, this new precedent does open the possibility that it will be less of a leap for future presidents to be pursued by legal investigations. Indeed, Trump has already warned that if he wins in November, he will dedicate his second presidency to 'retribution' and will use the powers of the presidency to go after his foes, including the Biden family.\nNone of this is remotely normal. But it is all part of the extreme political, legal and constitutional challenges that Trump constantly poses to US institutions and that he is signaling would intensify if he wins a second term. The incessant cacophony stirred by his volcanic personality is by design — it makes it hard for Americans to process each distinct Rubicon that is crossed.\nThe former president has made fervent attempts to delegitimize the case, the judge and the legal system itself — partly to hedge against any future guilty verdicts. He has blasted Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat who is leading the prosecution, as politically biased. And Judge Juan Merchan expanded a gag order after Trump named his daughter, who has done work for Democrats, on social media.\nWhile the trial will not be televised, it is bound to be a national spectacle over the period of six weeks to two months that it is expected to last. In his previous civil trials, including a massive fraud case that went against him, Trump has used court breaks to stage free rolling and often angry televised news conferences, seeking to attack the probity of the court and to air issues in the case. He has often been an obstreperous defendant, infringing the behavioral codes of the courtroom and infuriating judges. At one point during the civil fraud trial, Judge Arthur Engoron admonished Trump for turning the courtroom into the campaign trail, and asked his attorney, 'Can you control your client?'\nFor all of Trump's claims of unfair treatment by the legal system, many other defendants would likely have faced far harsher treatment for their attacks on trials, prosecutors and court officers.\nWhile the Manhattan trial is in session four days a week, the ex-president will be required to attend — at a time when President Joe Biden will be free to blitz swing states. This is one reason why Trump's 2024 campaign is running as much through the courtrooms as according to the traditional rhythms of a White House bid.\nThe moment Trump shows up in the courtroom on Monday will be one of unfathomable drama and a test for members of the pool of citizens who will be vetted for service on a jury like none other in American history. 'He's the most famous person in the world. And when you've come face-to-face with somebody that's got that kind of charisma, that kind of power, it tends to be intimidating, it tends to be shocking, it tends to be exciting,' Robert Hirschhorn, a jury and trial consultant, said on CNN on Friday.\nThe task of finding jurors who lack strong opinions and prejudices against a defendant and the legal system , who can serve for a prolonged period and will make judgements solely based on the law and the evidence, is complex in any case. Because the accused is Trump, legal experts are predicting that jury selection could take as long as a week or more, which must conclude before prosecutors lay out their opening arguments against the former president.\n, who can serve for a prolonged period and will make judgements solely based on the law and the evidence, is complex in any case. Because the accused is Trump, legal experts are predicting that jury selection could take as long as a week or more, which must conclude before prosecutors lay out their opening arguments against the former president. But as he contemplates the beginning of his trial, Trump appears to be gleaning an understanding that his fate is now out of his hands and will be soon in those of 12 anonymous citizens whom he will not be allowed to bully, persuade or politicize. 'Jury selection is largely luck. It depends who you get. It's very unfair that I'm having a trial there,' Trump said on Friday, alluding to New York City's liberal lean.\nTrump is already seeking to turn the trial into a circus to further his merged legal defense and chief campaign argument that he's being persecuted by 'deranged prosecutors' trying to bar his return to the Oval Office. He branded himself as a 'proud political dissident' at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February and has compared himself to South African anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela and dead Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. On Saturday night in the swing state of Pennsylvania, Trump promised, 'I will be fighting for the freedom of 325 million Americans,' as he embarked on an unprecedented shuttle between a criminal trial and the campaign trail. On Sunday, he used his Truth Social network to blast 'a blatant and unprecedented attack' against his campaign and claimed that Biden coordinated with Bragg. There is no evidence that this is true.\nTrump's arguments are convincing to many Republican voters who embraced his narrative of persecution and made him their nominee in quick time this year. But will he be able to convince undecided general election voters that he's a victim, or will his first trial thicken a cloud of criminality that could doom his White House hopes and improve Biden's chances of landing a second term? Some polls have shown that a minority of Republican voters might have pause about voting for the ex-president if he is found guilty after a trial. But the circumstances are so unusual that it is impossible to predict how the politics of a conviction or an acquittal could play out.\nPolitical uncertainty over the case is being exacerbated by the charged backdrop. There is no clear leader in national polling in the race between Biden and Trump, which is likely to be decided by thousands of votes in a handful of battleground states. The president's prospects are being challenged by high interest rates and elevated prices that are causing pain for millions of Americans. Biden spent the weekend presiding over a successful defense of Israel after Iran sent hundreds of missiles and drones toward the Jewish state as fears of a wider Middle East war spiked. The deteriorating situation could bolster Trump's claims the world is spinning out of control under his successor's watch. That means that this and any future Trump trials — while a never-before-seen interruption to a presidential election campaign — may be only one factor that decides the destiny of the White House in November.\nTrump is charged in Manhattan with falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in what prosecutors said was an attempt to interfere in the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and has denied having an affair with Daniels.\n'Manhattan is home to the country's most significant business market. We cannot allow New York businesses to manipulate their records to cover up criminal conduct,' Bragg wrote as he unveiled the indictment — Trump's first — in April 2023. 'The trail of money and lies exposes a pattern that, the People allege, violates one of New York's basic and fundamental business laws.'\nTrump's supporters claim that he's a victim of selective and politicized justice because he is being prosecuted over what they contend is a novel legal theory in a case stemming from personal embarrassments and campaign finance infringements. But Bragg's framing of the case identifies a common theme with Trump's other indictments: Is a president accountable to the same laws as every other citizen, or he is above the law?\n'This payment was made to deprive voters of essential information, which in turn was covered up with the intent to affect an election. … That's the allegation – deceiving voters to grasp power,' said Norm Eisen, a CNN legal analyst and author of the new book 'Trying Trump: A Guide to His First Election Interference Criminal Trial. '\n' Eisen added: ' Now , Alvin Bragg might not prove it — but that is why this is an alleged election interference case.'\n' Now , Alvin Bragg might not prove it — but that is why this is an alleged election interference case.' Trump's attorneys have argued that this trial should be delayed until the Supreme Court rules on his sweeping claims of presidential immunity arising from the federal election interference case brought by special counsel Jack Smith. While the initial conduct at issue in this case took place before Trump was president, prosecutors argue that he signed off on the alleged cover-up to reimburse his lawyer Michael Cohen for phony legal services while president.\nAs part of a desperate flurry of filings designed to postpone accountability in the hush money case, the former president has also been claiming that he cannot get a fair trial in New York — the city where he made his name but that has overwhelmingly voted against him. Merchan has declined efforts by the president's attorneys to get the trial relocated to a jurisdiction where voters may be more favorable to Trump.\nThe former president is charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. If convicted, he could face probation or a maximum sentence of 1 1/3 to 4 years on each count in state prison. Many legal experts believe that, as a first offender, Trump would not face jail time, or that if he did, any custodial sentences would run concurrently.\nTrump's attorneys have not tipped their hand over possible defenses. But it's almost certain they will attack the credibility and personal testimony of both Cohen and Daniels. Cohen will face criticism for being an unreliable witness after spending time in prison after being convicted of tax offenses, of lying to Congress and other offenses.",

And I also know you've been asked many times — you've had your disagreements with the former president,' Bill Hemmer on Fox's 'America's Newsroom' asked Barr. 'He's the presumptive nominee — we assume he will be the nominee. Will you support him in 2024?'\n'I've said all along given two bad choices, I think it's my duty to pick the person I think would do the least harm to the country,' Barr replied. 'And in my mind, I will vote the Republican ticket.

'Trump may be playing Russian roulette, but a continuation of the Biden administration is national suicide in my opinion.'\nBarr, who left the Trump administration in December 2020 after publicly refuting the then-president's claims of a stolen election, has often criticized Trump, including saying that the former president knew he lost the election even as he was trying to overturn it and that he thinks Trump would lose on the national level.\nBarr has also spoken on Trump's indictments and criticized in June claims by Trump and some of his allies that he is being targeted and unfairly treated by the federal government in its case against him for his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office.\nindictments and criticized in June claims by Trump and some of his allies that he is being targeted and unfairly treated by the federal government in its case against him for his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office.

And that's the analysis that I would do,' he told CNN in August.\nBarr gave testimony in 2022 to the House committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, where he described in detail why Trump's fraud claims were 'bogus' and why he has seen nothing since to convince him there was fraud.",

The struggling company is rapidly losing money, and a new stock offering could help it stay afloat.\nBut there's a downside to going back to the market with new shares: A new public stock offering of 21.5 million shares announced Monday would add more than 15% more stock to the publicly available shares of the Truth Social owner. That would substantially devalue existing shareholders' stakes — including that of former President Donald Trump.\nShares of TMTG (DJT) fell 10% Monday. The stock had rocketed higher in recent months in anticipation of merging a blank-check acquisition company with Trump's media business. But it has lost more than 60% of its value from its peak on March 26, the day after the merger was completed and it started trading publicly as TMTG.\nMatthew Tuttle, chief executive of Tuttle Capital Management, says that management would be 'stupid' not to issue new stock, even though the move will upset shareholders.\n'Whenever you see a stock jump, like you saw this jump, a secondary offering is always a risk,' said Tuttle. 'I think a lot of investors in this don't know that. … You've got a lot of probably Trump fans sitting there saying, what the heck?'\nStill, the stock's move lower based on this latest update will likely be temporary, he said.\n'This is going to piss some people off. Other people might look at it and try to buy the dip,' said Tuttle. 'As long as Trump is in the news in some way, shape or form, this is going to be a meme stock. People are going to trade it.'\nTrump currently owns more than 57% of the company's shares. Unless he were to purchase stock in the new public offering, Trump would own just under half of the company's publicly traded stock after it issues more shares.\nBut the company needs money.

The company generates little revenue, it's losing millions of dollars and it is losing many of its users as well.\nAlthough the share offering was not directly related to Trump's criminal trial beginning Monday, the company noted in a warning to potential investors that Trump's ongoing legal proceedings pose a risk to the company's reputation and brand.\n'President Donald J. Trump is the subject of numerous legal proceedings. An adverse outcome in one or more of the ongoing legal proceedings could negatively impact TMTG,' the company noted. 'If President Donald J.

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — Seven jurors were placed Tuesday on the panel that will decide former President Donald Trump's guilt or innocence in the New York hush money case, a process that has highlighted how difficult – and often contentious – it will be to pick a full jury.\nTrump's lawyers dug through prospective jurors' social media posts to try to root out those with an anti-Trump bias from getting on the jury, even questioning several of them about their posts as the defense team asked to remove them from the jury for cause.\nThat process prompted Judge Juan Merchan to sternly admonish Trump for his conduct toward the first juror questioned about her social media. It was a swift warning that he would not tolerate any attempts to intimidate jurors – an issue that did not come up the rest of the day but will surely linger over the criminal trial, the first of a former US president.\nThe courtroom is dark on Wednesday – as is expected for the duration of the expected six-week trial – but jury selection will resume on Thursday with a new panel of 96 prospective jurors who could end up on the panel.\nHere are the takeaways from day 2 of the Trump hush money trial:\nSo far four men and three women have been selected to serve on the jury that will ultimately consider 34 counts of falsifying business records against Trump.\nA man originally from Ireland who works in sales in New York City was appointed as the jury foreperson, who essentially serves as the panel spokesperson.\nFive of the seven have a college degree or higher education. Two men on the panel are lawyers.\nAll but one juror empaneled Tuesday indicated that they're aware Trump is facing charges in other criminal cases. The woman was the only one of the 18 jurors questioned who said she wasn't aware of the other charges.\nNone of them shared particularly strong views about Trump or politics.\nWhen the attorneys finished questioning the first 18 jurors in a process known as voir dire, both sides were given the chance to ask the judge to dismiss jurors for cause.\nHaving jurors removed for cause is an important part of the process because each side is allowed to strike 10 jurors in total for any reason, in what are known as preemptory challenges. Jurors struck for cause by the judge do not count against those 10.\nRelated article How a trial works: Trump's first criminal case is in court\nRelated article How a trial works: Trump's first criminal case is in court Trump's side asked the judge to remove five jurors for cause, pointing to alleged anti-Trump social media posts and trying to argue that the jurors were unfairly biased against the former president.\nWhile the jurors in this case are anonymous to the public, the lawyers were given the identities of the first panel of 96 prospective jurors on Monday. That gave Trump's team the chance to mine their public social media postings to be ready for their challenges to the judge.\nWhen the former president's attorney Todd Blanche was questioning the jurors, he asked them one-by-one what they thought of Trump, outside of the case. He then tried to argue before the judge that many of the jurors' answers that they didn't have an opinion of Trump did not align with their social media.\nMerchan was generally skeptical, but he did agree on two counts that the jurors should be struck. One man had posted 'lock him up'on Facebook while Trump was president.\nAs for the three jurors Merchan did not strike: Trump's side used its preemptory challenges to remove all of them anyway. After Tuesday, both Trump's team and the district attorney's office have four preemptory challenges remaining each.\nTrump's courtroom conduct got him once again – briefly – in hot water with a judge.\nTrump was admonished for his conduct when Merchan brought in one of the jurors individually to discuss her social media posts raised by Trump's team, in which she videotaped celebrations in New York after Joe Biden won the 2020 election.\n'I very, very strongly believe that regardless of my thoughts about anyone or anything political, feelings or convictions, that the job of a juror is to understand the facts of a trial and to be the judge of those facts,' the juror said.\nAfter the juror left the courtroom, Merchan raised his voice and admonished Trump, saying he was was audibly speaking and gesturing in the direction of the juror.\n'Your client was audibly uttering,' Merchan told Blanche, raising his voice. 'I will not have any jurors intimidated in the courtroom.'\nThe moment passed without any further discussion, and the judge did not raise concerns about Trump's conduct when more jurors were brought in individually.\nBut it's a moment worth noting, as the judge has already expanded his gag order in the case barring Trump from speaking about witnesses, as well as family and staff of the district attorney's office and the court.\nAnd the district attorney is asking the judge next week to sanction Trump for violating that gag order, with $1,000 fines and a warning that future violations could result in imprisonment.\nThat hearing is next Tuesday, potentially just after the trial is underway.\nThe voir dire process, where the lawyers from both sides got 30 minutes to question potential jurors, previewed how the two sides are approaching the jury pool – and ultimately, the jury in the case.\nAssistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass walked the jurors through the case, while signaling how prosecutors will appeal to the jury at trial, noting that not all witnesses will remember events in the past the same and that witnesses might remember small details differently.\n'Can you be realistic and not hold witnesses to unrealistic standards?' he asked the jury pool, asking any to say if they can't accept that.\nHe said outright some witnesses 'have some edge,' describing them as a tabloid publisher, an adult film star and said Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen was convicted of federal crimes, including lying to Congress.\nSteinglass asked jurors whether they would be able to approach the testimony from a convicted felon with an open mind.\nHe also noted that witnesses have written books, made podcasts and participated in documentaries.\nHe made the point that while jurors can consider all this in assessing a credibility of the witness, it's not the only thing they should consider.\n'The question really is, as I keep saying, can you wait until you hear not only the witness testimony but the rest of the evidence of the case' before deciding whether to believe something, Steinglass asked.\nBlanche, meanwhile, spent nearly all of his time focused on how jurors view Trump. He asked jurors if they had favorable or unfavorable views of the former president.\nOne man went back-and-forth with Blanche repeatedly, while largely refusing to share his views on Trump, saying his views don't matter in a courtroom and that he could compartmentalize.\n'I'll say I'm a Democrat, so there you go, but I walk in there and he's a defendant and that's all he is,' the juror said.\nThe juror was later struck for cause by the judge on a challenge from Trump's team over his social media posts.\nOne of the things Merchan has emphasized this week is that the court schedule is fluid. But the judge is hoping to wrap up jury selection this week.\nAfter swearing in the seven jurors Tuesday, Merchan told them he hopes they can return next Monday for opening statements – but he emphasized that the schedule could always change and the court would be in touch.\nHe then swore in a new panel of 96 jurors Tuesday afternoon before dismissing them for the day, saving time logistically before they return Thursday morning.\nThose jurors will go through the same process that's played out over the past two days with the first panel of 96 jurors. The new panel will be asked if they think they cannot be impartial or if they have a conflict, and then undergo questioning first from the judge and then the lawyers on both sides.\nThere's no guarantee that will get us to a full jury of 12 jurors, plus six expected alternates: Only seven were selected out of the first panel of 96.",

            "excerpt": "There are two Donald Trump criminal trials now taking place.",
            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — There are two Donald Trump criminal trials now taking place.\nThere's the one in a Manhattan courtroom, where a judge, attorneys for both sides and prospective jurors are making strenuous efforts to lay the foundation of the fair trial to which the ex-president and every other citizen is entitled.\nAnd there's the imaginary trial that exists in Trump's rhetoric, led by 'heartless thugs' and a 'very conflicted judge' who is 'rushing the trial' that the presumptive GOP nominee claims is a 'Biden inspired witch-hunt.'\nIn court on Tuesday, Trump made eye contact with potential jurors and was admonished by Judge Juan Merchan for muttering while one was questioned. But the surprisingly snappy pace of the process confounded initial expectations that putting on trial possibly the most famous man on Earth would be a laborious and prolonged process. While there were occasional moments of levity in the court and reminders that Trump's status make him a defendant like none other, conversations that members of the jury pool had with the judge and defense lawyers and prosecutors hinted at the gravity of what will unfold in the coming weeks. One potential juror, for instance, noted: 'This is real. This man's life is on the line, the country's on the line, this is serious.'\nAs Trump's hush money trial quickened on its second, compelling day — with seven jurors seated — Trump stepped up efforts to discredit the proceedings and the legal system itself. He bolstered the argument that is both his primary defense and his main campaign message — that he's a persecuted victim being prosecuted because he's on course to win back the White House in November. The former president's strategy encapsulates one of the most consequential challenges to the American courts system in modern memory — one that is likely to leave it tarnished in the eyes of tens of millions of his supporters whatever the jury decides. And it exemplifies the unprecedented circumstances of the first former president going on trial in the middle of an election campaign that is now running more through multiple court rooms than swing states.\nBut outside the courtroom, the former president raged, offering a skewed commentary on the good faith efforts inside.\nWhen the search for 12 jurors plus alternates paused for the day, Trump motorcaded to a bodega uptown, to highlight what he says is rising crime faced by the owners of small stores that are often open all night and especially serve immigrant communities. Trump was in his element, waving to a crowd that chanted 'Four more years' and 'We love Trump,' as he belted out quotes that dripped with falsehoods about foreign nations emptying their prisons and asylums to send a tide of migrants to American cities.\nIn a rowdy event in which he looked more like a mayoral candidate than a presumptive presidential nominee, he made two points. First that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg should be going after ‘real' criminals and not him, and that his obligation to attend the trial was keeping him off the campaign trail, as his rival, President Joe Biden, sweeps this week through swing-state Pennsylvania.\n'It's Alvin Bragg's fault, he goes after people like Trump, who did nothing wrong,' the former president said standing under a sign for an ATM, in a scene the long-time master self-publicist seemed to be offering up for a front page in the New York Post. 'It makes me campaign locally and that's OK,' Trump said, wrapping up his spot of street politicking in the city that made his name and that will send forth 12 jurors with his legal destiny, and potentially even his liberty, in their hands.\nTrump is accused of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, an adult film star who alleged she had an affair with Trump before he became president. Bragg's theory of the case is that this alleged conduct resulted in Trump keeping vital information from voters ahead of the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies having a sexual relationship with Daniels. This is only one of four trials looming over Trump; the others focus on his attempts to overturn the 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents.\nThe current trial is not televised, meaning that Trump is deprived of a platform. But that restriction does allow him to mount a misleading daily commentary on what is taking place inside the courtroom that is likely to be the most that many viewers of conservative media learn about the case.\nIn line with the four-day-a-week schedule for the trial, proceedings will halt on Wednesday. Trump is expected to have dinner with Polish President Andrzej Duda, a nationalist who was one of the ex-president's favorite foreign leaders during his term. Criminal defendants don't generally take a break from their trials to sup with visiting presidents. The visit will be another reminder of the extraordinary circumstances of an election entangled with Trump's legal fate and may be seen as a highly symbolic endorsement by Duda of his friend during his hour of need.\nAs the trial reaches its first break, two things are already becoming clear.\nFirst, the conventions of the criminal trial – like those in thousands of courtrooms every day – mean this case will grind on relentlessly. There's little the former president can do to stop it, despite the pre-trial delaying tactics and complex litigation common to all his cases. This sense of order was reflected in the solid progress in seating jurors on Tuesday.\n'It is remarkable how normal it is in this situation,' Mimi Rocah, a former division chief at the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, told CNN's Erin Burnett. 'The criminal justice system, the jury system, is working the way it's supposed to work.'\nThe second major takeaway two days in is that Trump – who carved a public persona as a ruthless real estate shark, told victims 'You're fired' on 'The Apprentice,' sees himself as a strongman president and has his own Boeing that can take him where he wants, when he wants – must cede total control when court is in session. He can't act out and is being forced by a gag order not to attack witnesses or family members of officers of the court.\nWhen he was muttering in court on Tuesday, Merchan told the ex-president's lawyer, 'I will not have any jurors intimidated in the courtroom.' The incident was likely just a taste of clashes to come between Trump and the judge. In previous civil trials, Trump challenged the dignity of the rule of the court and feuded with other judges. The fact that his time is not his own is also highlighted by his complaints that he's unable to attend a US Supreme Court hearing arising from his federal election interference trial next week. And he's also complaining the judge won't let him attend his son Barron's high school graduation – even though Merchan is yet to rule on the issue.\nFor anyone wondering whether a former Republican president who alienates his opponents could get a free trial in New York, Tuesday's jury selection process might prove something of a relief. There is great debate among legal scholars and partisans on whether Bragg's case is a legal stretch and whether Trump is guilty of the alleged conduct. But potential jurors appeared to take their obligation deeply seriously. It was notable that a large group admitted that they couldn't honestly say they could judge Trump fairly – testimony to the extreme reactions that the former president evokes.\n'I don't think I can be as impartial and unbiased as I thought I could be,' said one man who was excused.\nBut other potential jurors said they'd be able to put any political feelings about Trump to one side and focus on the evidence and the law. 'I feel that politically, we have big disagreements, your client and myself,' one person said. 'There are certain things he's said that I don't care for. But lots of people say things I don't care for.' She added: 'But when I'm coming here, that can't count, that has to go away.'\nIn a sign of the times, the judge and lawyers spent hours combing through social media postings of potential jurors and family members, seeking evidence of bias. And in another revealing trend that hinted at the ex-president's political appeal, some potential jurors mentioned that they viewed his rhetorical eruptions as those of someone who speaks his mind, unlike conventional politicians.\nWhen one potential juror asked Merchan if attendance at her sister's wedding in September could be a reason not to serve, the judge sparked laughter in court by replying: 'If we were still here in September that would be a big problem.'\nJury consultant Robert Hirschhorn told CNN's Burnett that Trump should be happy with the process so far. 'It's a mixed group, that's exactly what you want.' He added: 'The former president caught himself some pretty good jurors today.'\nTrump has asked the Supreme Court to agree with his expansive claim of presidential immunity in a bid to derail his trials. But so far, his hush money trial suggests that despite the former president's undiluted craving for power, every American remains equal under the law.\nCourtroom artist Christine Cornell has sketched some of the most notorious defendants in modern history, including crime family boss John Gotti and financier Bernie Madoff, and has been drawing Trump for years. She conjured up Trump's new reality best when she told CNN Tuesday: 'It's just another human being. He's just a guy in a pinch.'",

Jabin Botsford/Pool/Reuters Donald Trump has been inside a half-dozen courthouses over the past year, but he had a new experience walking into a downtown Manhattan courtroom Monday morning: a half-empty room.\nThe former president slowly walked through the cavernous and dingy courtroom, past six empty rows of benches – set aside for prospective jurors – giving a quick glance to the six reporters sitting in the back row before sauntering to the front of the room and taking his seat at the defense table.\nThe vacant rows served as a reminder to Trump that he's in a different setting now that he's a criminal defendant for the first time. By the afternoon, the courtroom was packed full with 96 jurors – some of whom may be on the jury who will hear the hush money trial against the Republican presumptive presidential nominee.\nTrump only spoke three times during Monday's session, acknowledging to the judge he understood his rights as a criminal defendant. Throughout the day Trump often engaged with his attorneys, whispering to them and sharing notes as they debated motions with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.\nTrump also sat back at times and closed his eyes as Judge Juan Merchan slogged through the jury pool and asked up to 42 questions of each prospective juror.\nWhile Trump didn't have a platform inside the courtroom, he didn't take long to make his feelings known when he left for the day, speaking to the camera right outside the courtroom after pulling out his iPhone from his suit pocket and handing it to an aide.\n'It looks like the judge does not allow me to escape this scam. It's a scam,' Trump said, complaining that the judge said he could not attend next week's Supreme Court arguments on presidential immunity and his son's graduation, though Merchan did not rule one way or the other on whether Trump would be excused for the graduation.

In this week's mammoth New York trial of former President Donald Trump on charges of falsifying business records in connection to hush money paid to an adult film star, the yawning gap between 'Us' and 'Them' is along partisan lines.\nThat dynamic has already reared its head, as at least 50 jurors – representing more than half of the first group of prospective jurors – were dismissed on the first day of jury selection Monday because they said they couldn't be impartial. The mass dismissal underscores the difficulty of finding acceptable jurors and is just the first obstacle facing the unprecedented prosecution of a former president that will leave a bad taste in many voters' mouths from the unmistakable political undertones.\nIt should come as no surprise that it will be hard to find jurors who don't bring strong political predispositions to bear given that the motivation for bringing this case looks to be so transparently political. The circus that is the first-ever criminal trial of a former president illustrates why this particular case may have been a poor choice to break that precedent.\nThough seven were sworn in on Tuesday, there were still illustrations of the problems of a politicized jury pool. One potential juror who underwent questioning, for instance, was subsequently struck for cause after Trump's team found social media posts from the juror referencing Trump that say, 'Get him out' and 'Lock him up.'\nRelated article Opinion: Don't call it a ‘hush money' case\nRelated article Opinion: Don't call it a ‘hush money' case Indeed, it seems unlikely that this case would be being prosecuted with the same vigor and creative legal theorizing if Trump were an everyday citizen. After all, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg came into office promising to focus on the ongoing investigation of Trump, and would have likely felt political heat from New York Democrats had he decided to close the investigation without bringing charges.\nIn the end, as The New York Times reported in March 2023, Bragg's office took a 'circuitous and sometimes uncertain road' to filing criminal charges, reviving a dying investigation that originally focused on Trump's business practices with a renewed focus on hush money payments.\nTo Bragg's supporters, it's a mark of his diligence and fortitude that he left no stone unturned. To his detractors, the drawn-out investigation, seeming to pivot from one potential crime to another, gives the impression of a DA looking for a crime to pin on an unfavored individual. (Trump has pleaded not guilty.)\nAfter all, making hush money payments, as Trump is alleged to have done with former adult film actress Stormy Daniels, isn't illegal. Instead, the case is built around a rather aggressive interpretation of the relevant statutes: In his records, Trump recorded his reimbursement to former 'fixer' Michael Cohen, who handled the Daniels payment, as a legal expense. This deception would normally be considered a misdemeanor offense in New York state.\nBut Bragg, unwilling to let Trump off the hook easily, is hinging his case on the allegation that this misdemeanor offense was in service of a violation of federal campaign finance laws. The Federal Election Commission opted not to charge Trump with a violation of election law on this front, with two Republican commissioners noting that Cohen had already pleaded guilty in relation to the alleged violation, and further government action 'was not the best use of resources.'\nAnother problem, as National Review's Andrew McCarthy has pointed out, is that Bragg, a state prosecutor, is seeking to enforce a federal statute, bringing this case against an offense 'that the feds themselves did not believe Trump committed, and that Bragg is politically engineering into a new election law of his very own.'\nNot that Trump is blameless in this. Trump's manifest character flaws and history of shady dealings are being highlighted, once again, by a trial that includes the phrases 'hush money' and 'porn star.' And even while this case faces significant legal scrutiny from lawyers and legal commentators, his other pending trials, such as his handling of classified materials at his Mar-a-Lago home or his attempt to bully Georgia election officials in 2020, do run a much stronger risk of placing him in serious legal danger.\nIn a sense, it's hard to blame the jurors who feel they can't be impartial. For decades, Trump has been a fixture on our airwaves, social media sites and political coverage. And his well-documented celebrity, outrageous social media posts and charged political rhetoric make him a challenge for even the most sober-minded juror to treat as an individual rather than a politician.\nTrump also has an unquestioned ability to push his supporters to defend the indefensible, even as he induces his opponents to stretch the envelope in their attempts to derail his candidacy. As such, no matter how the current trial is resolved, it will emphasize yet again how Republicans could – and, I would argue, should – have picked a presidential nominee with less baggage.\nBut they didn't, and now many are feeling a rally-round-the-flag effect in what is likely the first and potentially only Trump criminal case that's going to trial before Election Day.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook If Democrats are so willing to come up with creative legal theories to keep him out of office, some voters may think that all their rhetoric about 'constitutional norms' wasn't as high-minded as it sounded.\nThe recent Supreme Court decision unanimously striking down Colorado's attempt to remove Trump from the ballot was a reminder that too-cute attempts to keep Trump out of the White House can backfire. And the flimsiness of the hush money case will allow Trump's supporters to downplay the seriousness of the other charges against him, making it less likely that they will have a significant political impact in November.\nBragg's decision to bring this case, with its attenuated connection to an actual crime, can't be taken out of its political context. The weakness of this case muddies the water for future efforts to attack Trump's more egregious conduct. The jury selection and following court maneuverings will highlight how strong the disagreements are between 'Us' and 'Them.' And Trump's ability to push both his supporters and his detractors past the bounds of normal political battles, and to pull out all the stops to win, will remain unparalleled.",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — David Pecker, the former chairman of the National Enquirer's parent company, is expected to be the first witness called by the Manhattan district attorney's office in former President Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial, according to a person familiar with the plans.\nPecker was a central player in the alleged scheme to pay hush money to adult-film star Stormy Daniels to cover up her alleged affair with Trump ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\nThe DA's office is expected to call him after the completion of opening statements, which are set to begin Monday. The New York Times was first to report on the expected witness.\nAs the then-chairman and CEO of American Media Inc., Pecker was involved in numerous 'catch-and-kill' schemes orchestrated on Trump's behalf.\nIn October 2016, an agent for Daniels contacted AMI and said she was willing to go public with her allegations of an affair with Trump. The former president has denied the affair.\nRelated article Here are the key players in Trump's hush money trial\nRelated article Here are the key players in Trump's hush money trial Pecker then allegedly contacted Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, who negotiated the deal to 'purchase [her] silence' for $130,000, according to court filings.\nThat $130,000 payment, which was reimbursed to Cohen by the Trump Organization, is at the center of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's case against the former president. Bragg accused Trump in an April 2023 indictment of 'falsifying New York business records in order to conceal damaging information and unlawful activity from American voters before and after the 2016 election.' Trump has pleaded not guilty.\nDaniels and Cohen are also expected to appear as witnesses during the trial, sources previously told CNN.\nIn a separate incident, AMI agreed to pay model and actress Karen McDougal $150,000 months before the 2016 election for her silence about an alleged affair with Trump. While this payment is not part of the charges against the former president, prosecutors are expected to use it to establish a pattern of such payments.\nAMI was not criminally charged but did admit to making the payment to McDougal. The company paid a $187,500 fine to the Federal Election Commission for making an unlawful campaign contribution.\nPecker has been granted immunity in exchange for his testimony, and AMI signed a non-prosecution agreement with prosecutors.\nThis story story has been updated with additional information.\nThis story story has been updated with additional information.

The FBI's interview summary said Person 16 had not spoken to Nauta since Trump was in the White House.\n'NAUTA was told by FPOTUS' people that his investigation was not going anywhere, that it was politically motivated and ‘much ado about nothing,'' the interview summary says, referring to the abbreviation for Former President of the United States. 'NAUTA was also told that even if he gets charged with lying to the FBI, FPOTUS will pardon him in 2024.'\nThe summary also indicated the witness refused for the interview to be recorded, saying that would be 'a far bigger risk for him in the Trump world.'\nThe witness visited Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida a number of times after the end of Trump's presidency.

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — The historic first criminal trial of a former US president begins with opening statements on Monday.\nJudge Juan Merchan swiftly moved through consideration of roughly 200 potential jurors to find a jury pool of 18 by midday Friday, swearing in 12 jurors and six alternates who will decide Donald Trump's fate in the New York hush money case.\nThere had been estimates at the start of the week that jury selection could spill into a second week, and it appeared likely after Merchan lost two empaneled jurors on Thursday. But the judge found enough prospective jurors who were willing to serve and said they could be impartial that he didn't have to turn to a third panel of around 100 jurors in reserve Friday.\nTrump – whose lawyers on Friday continued to try to delay the trial – complained about Merchan's pace as he left the courtroom for the day.\n'The trial starts on Monday, which is long before a lot of people thought. The judge wants this to go as fast as possible. That's for his reasons, not for my reasons,' Trump said in the hallway of the 15 th floor courtroom.\nth floor courtroom. Here are takeaways from the final day of jury selection in Trump's hush money trial:\nFour women and one man were added to the jury on Friday as five of the six alternates for the case. They will sit in the jury box and will hear the duration of the trial, but they will only be put on the jury should one or more of the 12 jurors be excused from the case.\nThe final additions to the jury included a woman from Spain, a native New Yorker who is a fan of martial arts, a contract specialist, a woman who works for a clothing company, and a project manager for a construction company.\nAll 18 of the jurors will meet as a group for the first time on Monday morning when the trial is set to begin. Five of the jurors came from an initial panel of 96 that was sworn in Monday, while the rest came from a second panel that did not begin answering questions until Thursday morning.\nThe fourth day of jury selection played out similarly to the first three. Prosecutors focused their questions in the case on preparing the jurors to accept testimony from less-than-favorable witnesses, like Michael Cohen. Trump's attorneys, meanwhile, were almost singularly focused on a single question: What did jurors think about Donald Trump?\nThe former president appeared less interested in the proceedings during much of the questioning by the district attorney's office, sitting back in his chair and fiddling with papers. But when his lawyers began asking jurors what they thought of him, the former president was turned toward the jury box, paying full attention.\nThere were several emotional moments during Friday morning's questioning of potential jurors, with two jurors telling the judge in the middle of voir dire they no longer felt they could serve.\nOne female prospective juror who works in sales for a trading company began crying when she was handed the microphone during the voir dire process.\n'I'm sorry. I thought I could do this. I wouldn't want someone who feels this way to judge my case either,' she said, adding: 'This is so much more stressful than I thought.'\nMerchan invited her to come up to the bench to talk privately. He then excused her.\nAt one point after that jury had left, another juror raised her hand and told the court she started feeling 'high anxiety' as she sat and listened to a line of questioning about the credibility of witnesses.\nThe woman said she was feeling 'anxiety and self-doubt' as she asked to approach the bench. She too was excused.\nEveryone in the jury pool had the chance to be excused at the outset if they felt they could not be fair and impartial in this case, without further questioning by the judge.\nThe jurors who took part in voir dire on Friday had known that Trump was the defendant in the case since Tuesday, giving them several days to weigh what it would be like to be on the historic panel before having to step into the jury box.\nBut the excused jurors – along with an empaneled juror who was excused earlier in the week after she expressed concerns that part of her identity was made public – underscored how heavily trying a former president weighs on the justice system.\nDespite seating a jury, Trump's legal team again tried to stop the trial in its tracks with another strategic appeal.\nThe move shows how Trump lawyers are likely to continue to try to throw up procedural roadblocks in the criminal trial, even as it's already gotten underway.\nIn a new motion filed Friday morning, Trump's lawyers once again asked an appeals court to temporarily halt the trial until they ruled on Trump's appeal to move the venue of the hush money trial out of Manhattan.\nAttorney Cliff Robert argued on Trump's behalf at a hastily scheduled hearing Friday afternoon.\nRobert, speaking in a different courtroom from where the trial was ongoing, told the judge that seating a jury in three days with so many potential jurors being dismissed for cause over bias is 'untenable.'\nTrump unsuccessfully appealed with the same request for a stay over the change of venue motion last week.\nThe DA's team argued at that point that the motion was premature because jury selection hadn't happened yet. Robert said Friday that he had rightfully returned to renew Trump's request since a jury had been empaneled.\nRobert also pointed to the woman who asked to be dismissed on Thursday following media attention.\nTrump's lawyer argued that the juror's fears proved it's unfair for Trump to be tried in the city due to the publicity surrounding the former president.\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's Office Chief of Appeals Steven Wu argued the record actually showed that 'jury selection has worked.'\nThere's been a 'robust process,' he said, to ensure jurors can be fair and root out potentially biased jurors.\nDespite Trump's attempts to delay, opening statements in his criminal trial will begin Monday morning.\nThen the trial will fully shift into details about Trump's alleged affair with an adult film star (which he denies) and the hush-money payment made to her in the run-up to the 2016 election. Prosecutors will lay out the theory of their case, followed by Trump's attorneys summarizing their arguments against the charges.\nAfter that, the first witness will be called. Prosecutors haven't said who it will be – saying they don't want to see Trump posting about any witnesses ahead of time.\nOn Tuesday, the morning will shift to Trump's discussion of witnesses in the case, as Merchan plans to hold a hearing on social media posts by the former president that prosecutors say violated his gag order.\nThey're asking the judge to fine Trump $1,000 per post and remind him that violations of the gag order could result in imprisonment.",

Donald Trump has faced three civil trials in New York since he left the White House, but this is the first time he faces possible jail time.\nTrump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records, stemming from reimbursements made to Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen for hush money payments he made before the 2016 election to an adult film star alleging an affair with Trump. The former president has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair with Stormy Daniels.\nIt's known as the 'hush money' trial, but Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg says this case is about election interference, alleging the $130,000 payment was part of a wider scheme enacted by Trump and his allies from 2015 to 2017 to keep damaging information from voters.\nProsecutors allege once the Access Hollywood tape became public the campaign was scrambling to quash Daniels' allegation out of concern of how it would play with female voters. Prosecutors will have to prove that Trump is guilty of falsifying business records with the intent to hide that $130,000 payment.\nRead more about the trial — and what is at stake.\nRead more about the trial — and what is at stake.",

            "summary": "New York CNN —\nNew York CNN — Did Donald Trump fall asleep in court?\nAs the first criminal trial of a former American president commenced Monday, The New York Times' Maggie Haberman delivered a stunning report from the Manhattan courtroom. Trump, she reported, 'appeared to nod off a few times,' with his mouth 'going slack and his head drooping onto his chest.'\nHaberman, it goes without saying, is in a class of her own when it comes to reporting on Trump. When Haberman reports news about the Republican frontrunner, readers can take it to the bank. And her observation about Trump's apparent low-energy demeanor was corroborated by other reporters who confirmed that the defendant's eyes were shut for lengthy periods of time.\n'He looked like he was nodding off and at one point in a pretty true tell that he was falling asleep, his head nodded down and then he sort of jolted back up at one point,' The NYT's Susanne Craig also said on MSNBC.\nBut the Trump campaign later denied the former president had fallen asleep during the hearing — an obvious problem for a candidate who has made the 'Sleepy Joe' moniker a key attack line — claiming that the mid-trial snooze never happened.\n'This is 100% Fake News coming from ‘journalists' who weren't even in the court room,' a Trump campaign spokesperson later insisted.\nRelated article Trump has an unusual request on trial Day 1\nRelated article Trump has an unusual request on trial Day 1 On this particular matter, the stakes are not very consequential. Nevertheless, the episode underscores the information vacuum that has been birthed by the lack of transparency into the case. The Trump campaign forcefully denying Haberman and other reporters' accounts quickly created two versions of events for people at home to choose to believe: Trump or Haberman. And it's a safe bet that much of the country would (wrongly) place its trust in Trump, despite his propensity to lie.\nThe public was not permitted to see the hearing with its own eyes, as cameras have been barred from the courtroom, in keeping with a New York state court rule.\nInstead, Americans, unable to watch the historic proceedings play out, will have no choice but to place its trust in Haberman and a small group of reporters selected to sit inside the courtroom to observe the high-stakes trial.\nInstead, Americans, unable to watch the historic proceedings play out, will have no choice but to place its trust in Haberman and a small group of reporters selected to sit inside the courtroom to observe the high-stakes trial. While photographers are only briefly allowed in the courtroom at the start of the day, there will be no undeniable proof one way or the other to surface. The only visuals from inside the courtroom will be provided by a sketch artist tasked with depicting the range of expressions and emotions during the unprecedented trial.\nThe lack of cameras in the Manhattan courtroom is not new. Federal and New York state courts have long barred the filming of proceedings, much to the chagrin of news organizations and advocacy groups that have pushed for the judiciary to increase transparency. One of the concerns has been that by welcoming the public into the courtroom, cases will transform into public spectacles, similar to the O.J. Simpson trial in the mid-1990s. But there are a lot of holes in that argument. And, given the historic nature of the Trump trials, with a former president staring down dozens of criminal charges, news organizations have requested that exemptions be made. But thus far it has been to no avail.\nAs a consequence, a select few reporters will need to be the eyes and ears of the country, providing accurate representations of what transpired behind closed doors. While a handful of journalists are granted access inside the actual courtroom, most others are actually stationed in an overflow room, where they can watch a video stream of the proceedings and file dispatches.\nThe setup effectively ensures that there will be no shared reality of the unprecedented case as members of the public will have news from the trial filtered through the lens of whichever media they choose to consume. That fragmented media environment is where Trump also thrives, given that he has a powerful propaganda machine at his disposal, with outlets like Fox News willing to do his bidding, no matter how dishonest it is.",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — Joe Biden holds a big edge on the airwaves over Donald Trump in the opening weeks of their general election matchup. The president and his allies nearly tripled his rival's network in ad spending over the past month and a half while Trump has had to devote millions of campaign funds to legal expenses.\nFrom March 6 – the day after Super Tuesday when Trump effectively secured the 2024 GOP presidential nomination – through Sunday, Biden's campaign and other Democratic advertisers spent $27.2 million on advertising for the presidential race, while the Trump campaign and GOP advertisers spent about $9.3 million, according to AdImpact data.\nThe Biden campaign's ad spending has included millions in key battleground states such as Michigan ($4.1 million), Pennsylvania ($3.9 million), Arizona ($2.5 million), Wisconsin ($2.2 million) and Georgia ($2.2 million). The Biden network has used its plentiful airtime to promote the administration's first-term record and to slam Trump, focusing on key issues such as the cost of living and abortion rights.\nFor example, Biden's campaign has spent over half a million dollars in just the past 10 days airing a new ad in Arizona, seizing on the high-profile fight over abortion rights there. 'Because of Donald Trump, millions of women lost the fundamental freedom to control their own bodies. And now women's lives are in danger because of that. The question is, if Donald Trump gets back in power, what freedom will you lose next?,' the ad says.\nMeanwhile, a pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., recently ramped up its advertising, booking over $1 million worth of airtime in Pennsylvania to coincide with Biden's recent campaign swing through the state last week.\n'Biden's open border puts us all at risk by releasing criminal illegals into our communities,' the MAGA Inc. spot says. Immigration and crime have been a key point of emphasis in Trump campaign messaging throughout his 2024 bid.\nTrump has also benefited since Super Tuesday from a nearly $3 million anti-Biden campaign from outside groups aligned with the oil and gas industries, which have been running ads in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, criticizing California fuel standards defended by the Biden administration.\nBut despite these signs of activity, Trump's network has been significantly outspent on the airwaves by Biden since becoming the presumptive nominee.\nTrump has also been forced off the campaign trail with the beginning of his criminal hush money trial in New York.\nBiden spent three days in Pennsylvania last week, meeting union voters, rallying with the Kennedys and slamming his predecessor's economic policies. At the same time, Trump was in court in New York, and the lone campaign event he had set for last week, a Saturday rally in North Carolina, was postponed due to bad weather.\nThe latest round of Federal Election Commission filings further show how Biden's fundraising edge is enabling his advertising advantage.\nEntering April, Biden's campaign reported $85.5 million in cash on hand, nearly doubling Trump's war chest of $45.1 million. A similar disparity exists between the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee, both poised to play key supporting roles in the election – the DNC reported $45.2 million on hand at March 31, while the RNC reported about $21.6 million.\nTrump's mounting legal expenses are exacerbating the gap. The former president's constellation of political committees has had to direct millions of dollars toward legal costs as several cases against the former president proceed; in March alone, a leadership PAC fronting most of Trump's legal fees spent about $3.7 million on legal-related expenses – nearly $3 out of every $4 it collected.\nThat leadership PAC, Save America, has spent more than $70 million on legal expenses since the start of 2021, FEC records show, a massive drain on funds that could otherwise be spent on efforts such as large ad campaigns.\nStill, polls continue to show a margin-of-error race between Biden and Trump. CNN's latest Poll of Polls average finds no clear leader, with each taking an average of 47% support among the potential electorate. That finding is effectively unchanged from averages from earlier this year.",

Jean Carroll who juries have said Trump should pay nearly $90 million over her claims that he raped her in 1996 and then defamed her repeatedly after she came forward in 2019.\nProsecutors also listed Trump's lawsuit against Hillary Clinton that was dismissed for being frivolous and in bad-faith and a settlement with the New York attorney general that resulted in the dissolution of the Donald J. Trump Foundation.\nThey'll also question him about the 2022 tax fraud conviction of Trump's company, a case also tried by the DA's office before Judge Juan Merchan.\nThe judge plans to hold a proceeding called a Sandoval hearing to rule on what's fair fodder for prosecutors if Trump takes the stand in his defense later at trial.\nA Sandoval hearing is a common preliminary proceeding that reviews a defendant's criminal history and looks at how much prosecutors can ask if a defendant testifies.\nMerchan said at the end of the day Tuesday that the matter could be debated in court on Friday – but only if jury selection was completed in time, which is still to be determined.\n'If for some reason we are fortunate and get done early on Friday, we will take up Sandoval at that time,' Merchan said.",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — Jury selection in the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president has moved briskly, with the judge suggesting opening statements could begin Monday.\nOn Tuesday, after just a day and a half of jury selection, seven people from Manhattan were selected to judge the evidence in the New York case against former President Donald Trump.\nThursday, attorneys will pick up with a pool of nearly 100 jurors and begin questioning them until they seat a total of 12 jurors and as many as six alternates.\nFour men and three women have been selected so far as jurors for the case. They include two attorneys, an oncology nurse, a software engineer, a schoolteacher who said she likes that Trump speaks his mind, and a grandfather who said he finds Trump fascinating and mysterious. The foreman is originally from Ireland and works in sales.\nTrump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records to coverup payments made to bury an allegation of an affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election. Trump has denied the affair and pleaded not guilty to the charges.\nEach side's strategy for picking jurors has become clear.\nProsecutors have pressed jurors about whether they would be able to follow the judge's instructions and if they could set aside any preconceived notions they might have about some witnesses with 'baggage,' including a tabloid publisher, an adult film star, and a former lawyer (Michael Cohen) who has pleaded guilty.\nThey also asked jurors if they would be able to distinguish between believability and likability when evaluating their testimony.\nTrump's attorneys strove to understand the jurors' opinions on the former president and whether they could truly set that aside. They also dug deep into social media history and uncovered posts, some several years old and others more recent, that led the judge to dismiss two potential jurors for cause.\nIn the roughly 10 hours that court was in session earlier this week, Trump occasionally closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair. At other times he tapped his attorney Todd Blanche on the shoulder to whisper in his ear or passed a note to him. In one moment they appeared to smile. While the attorneys questioned jurors seated in the jury box Trump turned his chair to face them as they answered questions. He met at least one juror's eye as she walked in the courtroom, according to one potential juror who was dismissed.\nIn all, seven jurors were selected from a batch of 96, more than half of whom said they couldn't be fair or impartial.\nThursday morning, a new panel of 96 jurors, already sworn in, will return to the courtroom. The judge will ask two broad questions: whether any juror feels they can't be fair or impartial, and whether they are unable to serve on the trial for another reason. The trial is expected to last at least six weeks.\nThe remaining jurors will then answer 42 questions on a questionnaire. Prosecutors and Trump's lawyers get 30 minutes each to ask the first 18 jurors more specific questions, after which they will conduct strikes.\nBoth sides were given 10 peremptory strikes that they could use to excuse jurors. Trump and prosecutors used six on Tuesday, leaving them each with four strikes remaining.\nWednesday morning, Trump complained about the process on social media claiming he believed he had an unlimited number of strikes.\nHowever, the number of strikes each party has is determined by law, and Judge Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the trial, informed the parties of the number of strikes during a pre-trial conference earlier this year, which Trump attended.\nOn Tuesday, Trump tested the limits of Merchan, who uncharacteristically raised his voice when he observed that the former president was muttering and gesturing toward the direction of one juror being questioned.\nThe judge stopped the proceeding and said he wanted to put that on the record, and then spoke to Trump's attorney, saying, 'I won't tolerate that. I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom. I want to make that crystal clear.'",

He served as counsel to the House Judiciary Committee for the first impeachment and trial of Trump. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. CNN —\nCNN — I will be joining the line Monday morning to witness opening statements in the first-ever criminal trial of a former American president.\nJournalists are to queue up in the long exterior entryway to the 17-story building at 100 Centre St. – its elegant pale yellow granite and limestone Art Deco facade is a sharp contrast to the faded and dark hallways. There's an air of sadness inside this building, the shadows of the countless thousands of criminal defendants who have been here before former President Donald Trump – all the way back to when the notorious Tombs prison stood on this spot.\nAt a little after 9:30 a.m. in the spartan wood-paneled courtroom 1523, where Justice Juan Merchan presides, the prosecution will tell the jury how they intend to prove that Trump committed 34 felony counts of document falsification – allegedly to cover up an illegal scheme 'to influence the 2016 presidential election' in the form of hush money payments to avoid a damaging scandal.\nOpening for the People will be one of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's big three who are leading this case: Matthew Colangelo, Susan Hoffinger and Joshua Steinglass.\nIt will likely be Colangelo, 48 years old and slight of build with graying hair. I've crossed paths with him over the years and he's a smart and effective advocate who has had a rich career in public service, including stints at the Justice Department and the Office of the New York State Attorney General. (For much more about Colangelo, and all the other players, see my new book.)\nColangelo, or whoever may be opening, needs to do three things: First, hammer home the seriousness of the case – that this was election interference, as I argued last week at CNN Opinion, not just hush money – because if the jury believes it's serious that makes them think twice about giving into any doubts they may have about Trump's guilt.\nRelated article Here are the key players in Trump's hush money trial\nRelated article Here are the key players in Trump's hush money trial Second, the prosecutor must build a bridge for the jury into Trump's brain in order to find the criminal intent required to convict on felony document falsification.\nThe DA will need to prove that the false records here at issue (ones saying the hush money repayments were attorney fees) were intended to hide another crime. Since Trump either will deny criminal intent on the stand or won't testify at all, the prosecution will need to explain to the jury that the way to get there is through other witnesses and through documents. It's also notable that the jury has two lawyers on it – the DA will be particularly focused on talking to those two jurors so they can educate the non-lawyer jurors on how this works.\nThird, the prosecution's opening needs to 'draw the sting' regarding the DA's more controversial witnesses – like former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, adult film actress Stormy Daniels, and former American Media CEO and National Enquirer publisher David Pecker – by acknowledging their foibles, while guiding the jury to accept their perspective.\nAs a trial lawyer, I always would rather the jury hear about any problems with witnesses from me first, together with the solution. Here that solution is corroboration, a vast amount of supporting and interlocking evidence.\nNext up to open for the defense will very likely be Todd Blanche. If lacking the star power of a Colangelo, he's also had a distinguished career as a federal prosecutor and top white-collar criminal defense lawyer.\nHis mission today is the flip side of the prosecution's: First, he will explain why the case doesn't matter – that it is about Trump wanting to conceal an embarrassing personal peccadillo and about some accountant that Trump didn't even know writing down imprecise words in his business records.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook If the DA wants to build a bridge for the jury into what Trump was thinking, Blanche wants to preemptively destroy it.\nPart of the way he'll do that is by attacking the critical witnesses who form the foundation for the prosecution's case. Blanche will surely look to preemptively demolish Cohen, and the other key witnesses such as Daniels and Pecker. Blanche will maintain that if you can't trust these witnesses then the bridge the prosecution sought to build falls into the gorge.\nAfter the openings, it will be on to the first witness, reportedly Pecker. But before that I'll be back to you with an evaluation of how both sides did for the next installment of my trial diary.",

            "summary": "Editor's Note: Joey Jackson is a criminal defense attorney and a legal analyst for CNN and HLN. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\nJoey Jackson is a criminal defense attorney and a legal analyst for CNN and HLN. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. CNN —\nCNN — It was a little more than a year ago, on April 3, 2023, that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg announced a 34-count criminal indictment against former President Donald J. Trump. Now the trial against Trump is set to begin, with opening statements scheduled to get underway Monday at 9:30 a.m.\nTrump stands accused of falsifying invoices and business ledgers and sending reimbursement checks to his then-attorney Michael Cohen under the pretext that they were payments for legal services rendered.\nProsecutors say they were no such thing, but were rather reimbursement to Cohen for a $130,000 payment he made on Trump's behalf to former adult actress Stormy Daniels. Daniels was paid, they say, to keep her from outing Trump ahead of the election in order to conceal their liaison and thereby enhance his election prospects.\nIn New York state, falsifying business records is a misdemeanor carrying a penalty of up to a year in jail. However, if it can be demonstrated that the reason for the falsification was to commit some other crime, as prosecutors say is the case here, it becomes a felony punishable by up to four years in jail.\nThat means that prosecutors have two orders of business in their bid to secure a conviction against the former president. First, they must establish the fraudulent nature of the business records which underlie the alleged scheme. Secondly, they must demonstrate that Trump's intention in falsifying the records was related to the 2016 presidential election.\nThat, in the simplest terms, is the prosecution's case against the former president.\nRelated article Opinion: Trump followers were asleep at the switch\nRelated article Opinion: Trump followers were asleep at the switch One cannot help but wonder what's going through the minds of the jurors — the statements they made during the jury selection process notwithstanding. Are they starstruck? Intimidated? Biased for or against Trump? We really won't know until after the proceedings are over and the jury speaks with their verdict. At that point, the jurors may or may not choose to publicly provide an explanation regarding their decision.\nTrump has said that prosecutors have 'no case' against him. We will soon find out whether that's true. Prosecutors most certainly will take a very different position when opening statements get under way. But each side will be mindful to tailor their opening arguments to the target audience: the jury. They are the ones whose opinions matter most in this trial.\nThe court has seated an 18-member panel consisting of 12 jurors and six alternates who are critically important, since one or more of them might be called to step in should one of the jurors need to be excused — for instance if they have a personal emergency or simply beg off the case. The longer the trial goes on, the more likely that that could happen.\nWith regard to the primary jury panel of 12, I am struck by how many professionals have been seated. It includes two lawyers, a tech worker, a software engineer, finance professionals, a teacher and a salesperson, among others. In my view, that's a group that's going to zero in on facts, logic, documents and evidence. That could be very good for Trump because they likely would not be inclined to base their verdict on politics — his or theirs.\nIt could also work against him, however, since the jurors may turn out to be dispassionate, unemotional and otherwise unpersuaded by defense claims of prosecutorial unfairness, governmental overreaching or witch hunts.\nOpening statements are not evidence, but are designed to provide a preview of what the evidence will show, and I expect them to come out swinging. We can anticipate a logical rendition of the proof they intend to present, consisting of ledgers, invoices, checks, text messages, emails, audio recordings and other documents.\nWe can also expect them to differentiate the message from the messenger. Cohen, for instance, is a convicted felon and perjurer, as many people know. Daniels has led a life that some would find unsavory. Expect prosecutors to talk about that freely, as they did during jury selection. But they will also condition the jury by making the point that jurors need not rely upon the word of any one witness.\nProsecutors instead will ask the jury to focus on documentary evidence that corroborates and buttresses witness claims. That means you can expect them to focus first and foremost on the documents that they say lay out the hush money scheme. The witnesses are just 'messengers' underscoring facts that have already been established by compelling hard evidence. Prosecutors will attempt to lessen the sting of defense attacks on the credibility of their witnesses by arguing that the message itself — the evidence relating to Trump's guilt — is unmistakable. The texts, emails and documents irrefutably prove his guilt, they will insist.\nOn the issue of Trump's intent, prosecutors will note that it defies common sense and logic that he would have paid the hush money for any other reason than to hide it from voters. Not only will they point to the timing of the payment just days before the 2016 election, but they will almost certainly point to communications and statements in meetings in which they say the scheme and its purpose were discussed. I don't expect prosecutors to get into the weeds on Monday with respect to what the evidence will show, but I do expect that their overview will be organized, focused and tethered to a meticulous timeline of events, facts and participants.\nThe defense team's opening arguments are more of a wild card fraught with challenges, but they have a few options. The first would be to commit to an actual defense. But what might that look like, and will it work?\nTeam Trump could say that he is completely innocent and the state's case is built upon a pack of lies with no factual basis. This would be risky, however. After all, if the state can show that none of the Trump payments to his then-lawyer Cohen were for any legal work performed and that there was no retainer agreement, why would Trump be making any payments at all? The jury might find such a claim hard to believe.\nAnother defense maneuver might be to adopt a strategy employed by former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards, who was prosecuted more than a decade ago for alleged federal campaign finance violations. Edwards successfully claimed during his trial that he hid the birth of his love child not to deceive voters, but to protect his wife and family.\nIn Trump's case, however, a similar defense would pose great risks. He would have to own up to being guilty of falsifying business records. That defense would have to concede that he's a criminal, albeit a low-level one, and would contradict public statements he's made about the case.\nIf he were to go that route, he would be saying in effect, yes, I did it, but my intent was to protect my marriage. It had nothing to do with the election. Trump would have already admitted to the entire underlying scheme by virtue of his defense. That would allow prosecutors to turn the focus of their case from the alleged ruse he would be stipulating that he was part of, to his motive: Was it for his family, or to increase his odds of becoming president? But I simply don't see Trump making an admission of guilt — even for comparatively petty misdemeanors.\nThe other option the defense has in its opening argument is one that is used quite often and is the safest bet in many cases: Team Trump could simply ask the jurors to keep an open mind throughout the case. In adopting this strategy, the defense would remind the jury that the standard of proving guilt — 'beyond a reasonable doubt'— is a very high bar.\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook Their next step would be to pound away at the unsavory nature of the state's witnesses and to assert that they cannot be trusted. They might then pivot to discussing how Trump should and must not be found guilty merely because of his politics and anyone's disdain for him. What I most do not expect as the trial gets underway is any commitment by the defense as to whether Trump will testify. While he has said publicly he will do so, that will likely be a game time decision.\nHistory is unfolding before us. Since the signing of the Declaration of Independence almost 250 years ago, no president has ever been criminally prosecuted. That said, everyone is, or should be, viewed equally under the law and everyone has the presumption of innocence — even a former president.\nSo here we are. Did Trump violate the law? Following Monday's opening statements and after they've had the chance to hear the revelation of evidence during trial, the jury will decide.",

            "summary": "The New York judge overseeing Donald Trump's hush money trial will take center stage in the case Monday with jury selection kicking off in the historic criminal prosecution of the former president.\nNew York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan is a seasoned jurist who is no stranger to Trump's orbit. He has presided over the Trump Organization tax fraud trial, sentenced the former president's close confidant Allen Weisselberg to prison over his role in the scheme and overseen former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's criminal fraud case.\nBut it's the former president's trial on charges that he illegally falsified business records over the reimbursement of hush money payments made before the 2016 election that will leave a lasting mark on Merchan's long career atop the state-level trial court.\nAll eyes will be on the judge as he oversees the first trial Trump has in the four criminal cases brought against him by state and federal prosecutors last year. The presumptive Republican nominee has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\nMerchan has been described by observers as a 'tough' judge, yet one who is fair, no matter who is before him.\nHere's what you need to know.\nTrump's trial is likely to be a spectacle with wall-to-wall media coverage and a show of law enforcement to provide protection to the former president as he attends the proceedings, which are expected to last several weeks. In the lead-up to the start of the trial, Trump fanned the flames on social media with his views on the judge.\nBut in the courthouse, Merchan does not stand for disruptions or delays, attorneys who have appeared before him previously told CNN, and he's known to maintain control of his courtroom even when his cases draw considerable attention.\n'Judge Merchan was efficient, practical, and listened carefully to what I had to say,' Nicholas Gravante, the attorney who represented Weisselberg in his plea in the tax fraud case, said last year.\n'He was clear in signaling his judicial inclinations, which helped me tremendously in giving Mr. Weisselberg informed legal advice,' Gravante said. 'Judge Merchan was always well-prepared, accessible, and – most importantly in the Weisselberg matter – a man of his word. He treated me and my colleagues with the utmost respect, both in open court and behind closed doors.'\nThat sentiment was echoed by Karen Friedman Agnifilo, a private practice attorney who previously worked as a prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, supervising cases Merchan presided over.\n'[Merchan] doesn't let the prosecutors or the defendants create any issues in his courtroom. He doesn't let a media circus or any other kind of circus happen. I don't think Donald Trump attacking him and threatening him is going to bode very well for him in the courtroom,' Agnifilo, who is also a CNN legal analyst, said last year before Trump was arraigned in the hush money case.\nMerchan has attempted to get out ahead of any potential issues created by Trump during the trial by issuing a gag order against the former president in recent weeks. The order, which bars Trump from publicly commenting on witnesses and the staff of the court and district attorney, was later broadened by Merchan to cover the judge's own family after Trump went after his daughter on social media.\n'It is no longer just a mere possibility or a reasonable likelihood that there exists a threat to the integrity of the judicial proceedings. The threat is very real. Admonitions are not enough, nor is reliance on self-restraint,' Merchan wrote in his ruling expanding the gag order.\nTrump is appealing the gag order, a move that is part of his broader effort to delay the hush money trial.\nMerchan and other judges in the state have so far rejected Trump's various bids to delay the trial, though Merchan did postpone the trial's start date last month after a late production of discovery documents.\nTrump has a long history of attacking people involved in his criminal and civil cases, including the judges overseeing them.\nMerchan is no exception.\nLast month, the former president described him as a 'certified Trump hater' on his Truth Social platform and went on to single out the judge's daughter, Loren Merchan, over her Democratic ties in an attack that led the judge to expand the gag order.\nIn focusing on Loren Merchan, Trump has said that she is a senior executive at 'a Super Liberal Democrat firm' that has worked with top Democrats, including President Joe Biden. The former president pushed the discredited claims that Loren Merchan posted an incendiary image of the former president behind bars on her social media account – an account that the court said didn't even belong to her.\nTrump also claimed Judge Merchan has ruled against him in pretrial motions 'because his daughter makes money by working to ‘Get Trump.''\nLoren Merchan has not commented publicly on the case.\nThough it's true that Loren Merchan has served as president of Authentic Campaigns, a firm that does digital campaign work like online fundraising, mobile messaging and web design, the firm has scrubbed references to her on its site, and it's difficult to directly link Authentic to specific political ads. Still, the firm works for campaigns that have disparaged Trump, including for being charged with crimes.\nLast year, Merchan rejected a request by Trump for the judge to recuse himself from the case due to his daughter's work. He wrote in his order that the court 'has examined its conscience and is certain in its ability to be fair and impartial.'\nTrump is challenging the judge's decision to not step away from the case.\nMerchan showed some of his tough side when Weisselberg was sentenced in 2023, telling the former Trump associate that if he had not already promised him a five-month sentence, he would have handed him a 'much greater' sentence after having listened to evidence at trial.\nWhen he presided over Bannon's criminal fraud case, Merchan chastised the former Trump aide's new team of attorneys for delaying the case when they asked for more time to review new evidence.\nIn addition to the Trump cases, Merchan has also presided over other high-profile cases, including the 'soccer mom madam' trial, in which he set a $2 million bond for suburban mom Anna Gristina, who was charged with running a $2,000-an-hour escort service for the wealthy, Bloomberg News reported.\nMerchan also handed a 25-years-to-life sentence to a Senegalese man who raped and murdered his girlfriend.\nThen-Trump attorney Timothy Parlatore said during an interview on CNN last year that Merchan was 'not easy' on him when he tried a case before him, but echoed that the judge likely will be fair.\n'I've tried a case in front of him before. He could be tough. I don't think it's necessarily going to be something that's going to change his ability to evaluate the facts and the law in this case,' Parlatore said.\nMerchan, however, is also credited by his peers for having helped create the Manhattan Mental Health Court, which he often presides over and where he has earned a reputation for 'compassionate' rulings that give defendants second chances.\n'I watched a colleague of mine try a shooting case where someone got shot, so he's able to try those very serious violent crimes and then switch,' Brendan Tracy, a criminal defense attorney who previously served as an assistant district attorney in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, told CNN last year.\n'Maybe someone who was a serial shoplifter and then charged with grand larceny and is in mental health treatment court because they had mental health issues, he was able to handle the wide range of cases and do them all fairly,' Tracy added.\nStill, Earl Ward, a trial attorney and chair of public defender nonprofit The Bronx Defenders, said that having watched Merchan preside over cases in the Mental Health Court, the judge often sided with prosecutors.\n'He's fair and his rulings are consistent with the law, but if it's a close call, his reputation is that he lands on the prosecution's side,' Ward previously told CNN.\nMerchan launched his legal career in 1994 when he started off as an assistant district attorney in the trial division in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. Several years later, he moved on to the state attorney general's office, where he worked on cases in Long Island.\nIn 2006, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, then a Republican, appointed Merchan to Family Court in the Bronx, and Democratic Gov. David Paterson appointed him to the New York State Court of Claims in 2009, the same year he began serving as an acting New York Supreme Court judge.\nBorn in Bogotá, Colombia, Merchan emigrated to the United States at the age of 6 and grew up in the New York City neighborhood of Jackson Heights, Queens, according to a New York Times profile of the judge. He was the first in his family to go to college.\nMerchan initially studied business at Baruch College in New York before he dropped out of school to work, only to return several years later to finish school so that he could get his law degree, the Times reported.\nHe eventually received his law degree from Hofstra University.\nSydney Kashiwagi and CNN's Marshall Cohen, Kara Scannell, Lauren del Valle and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.",

            "summary": "New York City CNN —\nNew York City CNN — Donald Trump is trying to turn the tables on Alvin Bragg.\nThe former president ended the second day of his hush money trial in Manhattan by visiting a Harlem bodega where, in 2022, store clerk Jose Alba stabbed an attacker, then got brought up on murder charges by the Manhattan district attorney's office.\nThe case was dropped less than three weeks after the incident, but not before Bragg, who is now leading Trump's prosecution, came under withering attack by the city tabloids and other mostly right-wing critics over what many – including Mayor Eric Adams – viewed as a clear act of self-defense.\nWhile the trial in Lower Manhattan will mostly keep Trump off the campaign trail, his visit to the bodega brought the campaign to the city – where anxieties over a pandemic-era rise in crime drove Adams' mayoral campaign in 2021 and, despite rates now dropping, has made Gotham a useful cudgel for Republicans ahead of the 2024 general election.\n'They want law and order, they have a lot of crime, tremendous crime and their stores over there, stores are being robbed,' Trump said of bodegas in New York during his visit.\nThe New York GOP's message, which Trump called back to during a brief session with reporters outside the store, resonated in 2022 as Republicans won congressional seats outside the city after focusing their campaigns on public safety and worries that violent crime here would radiate out into the suburbs.\nTrump on Tuesday made his visit to Harlem's Sanaa Convenient Store, formerly known as Blue Moon, to meet with a co-owner of the store and Francisco Marte, the founder of the Bodega and Small Business Association. Throngs of supporters, protesters and curious rubberneckers began to amass on Broadway a little after 3 p.m., as word spread that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee was expected.\nBy the time Trump emerged from his black SUV a little after 6:30 p.m., the crowds were exchanging chants, with detractors calling him a 'traitor' and a 'fascist' while fans screamed his name, 'four more years,' and, at one point – at the urging of campaign staff – began to sing the National Anthem.\nA group of women, about 50 yards up the block behind a police barrier yelled out for Trump, calling him, in Spanish, 'my tiger!' Meanwhile, employees of the Romantic Depot shop across the street – 'NY's Best Lingerie Store' – waved a red banner advertising a product named after Trump.\n'It's Alvin Bragg's fault. Alvin Bragg does nothing. He goes after guys like Trump who did nothing wrong,' Trump said. 'There are hundreds of murderers all over the city, they know who they are and they don't pick them up. They go after Trump.\nBragg's office dismissed Trump's talking point, first in a social media post showing the downward trajectory of major crimes, then in a statement defending its handling of the Alba case.\n'This matter was resolved nearly two years ago, and the charges were dismissed after a thorough investigation,' a Bragg spokesperson told CNN. 'D.A. Bragg's top priority remains combating violent crime and the office has worked hand in hand with the NYPD to drive down overall crime in Manhattan, including double digit decreases in homicides and shootings since he took office.'\nMarte, the small business advocate, said the Trump campaign contacted him for a meeting, which he parlayed into an invitation to visit a bodega. His group does not support political candidates, he added, but was pleased Trump decided to come and highlight their concerns about violent crime in the city.\nIn an interview about an hour before Trump arrived, Marte praised the former president's 'tough on crime' rhetoric, but said he hoped Trump wouldn't use the occasion to attack the city or exaggerate the threat.\n'New York is a little dangerous. It is dangerous, but we are working on that. But we need support,' said Marte, before saying President Joe Biden would also be welcome.\nTrump is currently on trial in New York four days a week, severely limiting his ability to campaign or fundraise outside of the state. The trial is forcing his team to come up with creative ideas to campaign while remaining local.\n'It makes me campaign locally, that's OK,' Trump said of the trial. 'We're going to give New York a very good shot for the presidency, we think we should be able to do it, a lot of things have changed.'\nNew York remains a Democratic stronghold. Trump lost to Biden by 23 points in 2020, and argued the influx of migrants into the state could push more New Yorkers to cast their ballots for him in November.\nOn Tuesday, Trump used the appearance at the bodega to attack Bragg.\n'Alvin Bragg does nothing. He goes after Trump, who did nothing wrong,' Trump said.\nThe visit to this bodega came two years after Alba, who was not present for the visit, was charged with second-degree murder after he stabbed Austin Simon in a confrontation.\nAlba and his lawyers argued that he acted in self-defense, saying surveillance video of the incident – which showed that Simon tried to pull Alba out from the booth before Alba grabbed a knife off the counter – confirmed their account.\n'Mr. Alba was simply doing his job when he was aggressively cornered by a much younger and bigger man,' Alice Fontier, a spokeswoman for Alba's attorney, said at the time.\nThe charges against Alba were dropped amid an angry, tabloid-fueled backlash to Bragg's decision to charge him at all.\nAdams publicly backed Alba and applauded the move to dismiss the charges against him.\n'I think in this case, we had an innocent, hardworking New Yorker that was doing his job and someone was extremely aggressive towards him,' Adams told reporters at the time. 'And I believe after the DA's review, the DA, in my opinion, made the right decision.'\nProsecutors, in their court motion, said they 'determined that we cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not justified in his use of deadly physical force.'\nIn April 2023, House Republicans on the Judiciary Committee invited Alba to testify at a so-called 'field hearing' in New York City. In his opening statement, Alba wrote that he was 'not motivated by a political agenda' and only wanted 'to tell the public about the horrible experience I had to go through because of crime in this city.'\n'I stabbed that man in self-defense. But when the police came, even though I was injured myself, I was placed under arrest,' Alba recalled. 'When I came before the judge, the prosecutor said I was being charged with Murder in the Second Degree. They asked for bail, even though so many people are being let go these days, and I couldn't afford it.'\nAlba filed a lawsuit, seeking unspecified damages, against the City of New York, Bragg and others involved in his arrest on September 29, 2023, claiming Alba was discriminated against because he is Hispanic. Simon was Black.\n'While in theory, Bragg's ‘racial equity' policies are a well-intentioned attempt by him to implement evenhanded justice, the means and methods employed by Bragg have instead had an opposite effect,' Alba's lawyers wrote, 'and resulted in discrimination against certain defendants based on race.'\nLawyers for the city have asked for the lawsuit to be thrown out, telling the court in their own filing that prosecutors and police acted reasonably in the moment – and that 'the undisputed facts show that after the plaintiff's arrest, there was even more evidence to support a finding of probable cause for his prosecution.'\nNew York state lawmakers in 2019 passed a criminal justice reform package designed to end the use of use of cash bail and jail for most cases involving misdemeanors and less serious felonies. The new law went into effect in 2020, shortly before the first cases of Covid-19 were reported in the city, which would be hit hard by the pandemic.\nBut rising crime during that period sparked a political backlash that led Democrats in Albany to repeatedly revise and limit the scope of the law. There is no clear evidence of a connection between bail reform and the spike in crime, but Republicans here and around the country have used the issue as a cudgel against Democrats, arguing they are 'soft on crime.'\nThe Alba case offered an ironic twist in the political narrative, with many Republicans and right-wing news sources effectively arguing that Bragg's office took too harsh a tack against the clerk, calling the initial charges tone-deaf and misdirected.\nBragg, who ran on a platform of progressive reform, was elected alongside Adams, a former police officer who promised a crackdown on crime, in 2021. He came under immediate fire from critics after he released a memo outlining new charging, bail, plea and sentencing policies.\nThe policies, Bragg said, were rooted in his own experience – being held at gunpoint six times in his life, three of them by overzealous police officers. But his plan faced immediate blowback from police union leaders and right-wing media.\n'Safety is paramount. New Yorkers deserve to be safe from crime and safe from the dangers posed by mass incarceration,' Bragg tweeted during the uproar that followed. 'We will be tough when we need to be, but we will not be seeking to destroy lives through unnecessary incarceration.'",

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — Donald Trump was once, and may soon be again, the most powerful man in the world. But on Monday, his diminished reality as a criminal defendant will become clear in humbling fashion during opening statements in his first criminal trial.\nThe presumptive GOP presidential nominee has long chafed at the constraints of the law, the Constitution and general decorum as he's presented himself as an omnipotent force throughout his business and political career. But with jury selection now complete in his hush money trial in Manhattan, Trump's fate is in the hands of prosecutors, his attorneys, a judge and 12 people, who, according to bedrock principles of the legal system, are regarded as peers of the ex-president. Nothing is more antithetical to Trump's lifelong operating assumption that because of who he is, he is immune from such accountability.\nJust over six months from the election that could see him restored to the White House, Trump has little ability to dictate action in proceedings in which his liberty may be at stake. His normal weapons of histrionics, obfuscation and intimidation have no currency inside a courtroom. The fact that he is compelled to be in court four days a week for multiple weeks is also a serious inconvenience to the Republican candidate. This constraint was exacerbated on Saturday, one of the few windows to get out on the campaign trial, when his rally in North Carolina – a swing state that President Joe Biden is trying to flip – was canceled owing to a dangerous storm.\nRegardless of its outcome, this trial – and the way it's affecting Trump's schedule and demeanor – is underscoring how the presumptive GOP nominee is like no other presidential candidate in history. Whether or not he's a convicted felon by Election Day, voters will be reminded of questions around his character and his many legal entanglements – with three more criminal cases looming, all in which he's pleaded not guilty. And while Trump has used a narrative of victimhood to great success in GOP primaries, it remains to be seen how that argument lands with a broader electorate.\nTrump's unaccustomed loss of his capacity to control events may be one reason why he insists he will testify in the trial even though it might be injurious to his case. He's already seeking to devalue the prosecution in the minds of voters who will be charged in November with deciding whether they want him again as their president.\n'The trial starts on Monday, which is long before a lot of people thought. The judge wants this to go as fast as possible. That's for his reasons, not for my reasons,' Trump fumed outside the courtroom Friday. Until now, he's found success in launching endless litigation to create delays – a legal strategy that's still slowing down the three other criminal cases against him.\nThe ex-president's remarks Friday followed a contentious procedural hearing in which prosecutors and defense attorneys haggled over the evidence and past alleged misdeeds that could be brought up under cross-examination if Trump testifies. The process, known as a Sandoval hearing, offered the ex-president a glimpse of personal and unflattering revelations that the trial could dredge up.\nCriminal defense attorney Stacey Schneider told CNN that hearing details of past cases, including Trump's losses in a defamation case to the writer E. Jean Carroll and the massive verdict against him in a New York civil fraud trial, had been an unpleasant experience. 'I think there is an emotional tilt to what the president was dealing with just a few minutes before he came out with that statement,' Schneider said Friday. 'Defendants coming out of a Sandoval hearing are not pleased; it's just the nature of the hearing. It's the worst preview of what could come if you take the stand. It's rattling. I think he was rattled.'\nThe ex-president's fixation on his situation barely eased over the weekend. He issued a stream of angry Truth Social posts focusing on his claim that as an ex-president he's immune from prosecution for acts in office. That case will be heard by the Supreme Court in oral arguments on Thursday. The matter focuses primarily on his federal election interference case but also has a bearing on the hush money matter since some conduct allegedly took place when he was in the Oval Office. 'Of course I was entitled, as President of the United States and Commander in Chief, to Immunity,' Trump wrote in one of the Saturday posts.\nThe Manhattan trial arises from a hush money payment to former adult-film star Stormy Daniels, which prosecutors allege was made to cover up an affair to mislead voters in the 2016 election. Trump denies any affair and has pleaded not guilty to charges of falsifying business records as part of the scheme.\nRelated card Here are the key players in Trump's hush money trial\nRelated card Here are the key players in Trump's hush money trial The trial is expected to be a personally testing experience for Trump – not least because likely witnesses include former associates or friends whose testimony the ex-president is likely to view as a betrayal. They include his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen and David Pecker, the former chairman of American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer. Pecker will be the first witness called by the district attorney's office, according to a person familiar with the plans.\nProsecutors have declined to offer the defense the courtesy of full witness lists before each day of the trial, arguing that Trump's social media attacks could put those set to testify at risk and prejudice the case. About their offer to hand over the name of the first witness by Sunday, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass had warned, 'Should that be tweeted, it will be the last time.' Judge Juan Merchan has declined to force prosecutors to give advance notice of witnesses, especially with a contempt hearing scheduled for Tuesday over claims Trump violated his gag order with social media posts.\nProsecutors in the case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg must prove only Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in the courtroom. The jurors have been extensively cross-examined to ensure they make their judgment based on the law and the evidence rather than the political overtones of the case. Yet the backdrop of an approaching election and the identity of the defendant mean there is national scrutiny on what appears, in essence, to be a fairly simple case about business records.\nThere are, therefore, implicit questions for Bragg over the strength and advisability of a case that has made Trump the first former president to go on trial at the same time as he's trying to get his job back. The principle that every American is equal under the law is a central issue here.\nTrump is baselessly arguing that he's part of an orchestrated campaign of legal weaponization and victimization by the White House to thwart his 2024 bid. But even though there's no evidence Biden has had any involvement in Bragg's case, some voters may perceive this case as simply the presumptive GOP nominee being pursued by a Democratic prosecutor. Furthermore, for many voters, events arising from an election eight years ago seem remote, especially since allegations of Trump's tawdry behavior have been well aired by now. There's also a widely held sense that the allegations in the Manhattan trial are less serious than those facing Trump in his other three criminal indictments. Those cases, which cover efforts to subvert the 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, have grave implications for democracy and the office of the presidency.\nEven before Trump's daily outside-the-courtroom rants to the camera, Americans were polarized over his situation. The idea that he's a victim of political persecution enjoys far greater acceptance outside elite political and media circles on the coasts and in the cities – even if it is not supported by the facts. In nine years on the political stage, Trump has tapped into and worsened widespread mistrust of the country's institutions among many voters, so it's less of a leap for him to portray this case as corrupt.\nThe political case against the prosecutions was laid out by South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, one of a number of Trump surrogates who may be auditioning for his vice-presidential nomination in TV appearances in his defense.\n'I think it's a little ridiculous that they have waited years to bring these types of charges against Donald Trump,' Noem told CNN's Dana Bash on 'State of the Union' on Sunday. 'If they wanted to make these kinds of charges against him, they should have done it years ago, when this happened. To do it conveniently during a presidential election, when he's campaigning to return to the White House, I think proves that this is all politically motivated.'\nWhile Trump is barred by the partial gag order from assailing witnesses, the restriction does not apply to his supporters. Noem took a chance to attack Cohen, who served time in prison after being convicted on tax charges, lying to Congress and violating campaign finance laws.\nDespite endless speculation, there is no way to know how voters – especially those in critical swing states – might respond to a conviction of Trump in this case, or in the other matters that look increasingly unlikely to come to trial before the election. In a New York Times/Siena poll released earlier this month, 46% of likely voters thought Trump should be found guilty in the hush money trial, while 37% thought he should not be. Attitudes about the trial largely followed party lines in the poll, which was conducted before jury selection began.\nWhile most of the pretrial focus has been on a possible conviction, an acquittal of the presumptive GOP nominee could also have unpredictable political consequences in a race that a new CNN Poll of Polls on Sunday showed as a virtual dead heat between the previous president and the current one. But Noem rehearsed a political argument that Trump and his associates will be seeking to land as the trial goes ahead. 'I'm walking around this state and talking to people, talking to people across the country, they don't even know which trial this is,' Noem said. 'What they really care about is that they're trying to figure out how to pay their gas bills. They're trying to figure out how to pay their electricity and put food on the table for their kids.'\nThe South Dakota governor's downplaying of the allegations against Trump also ignores the extraordinary historic reality of an ex-president facing multiple criminal trials. But the deeply consequential political and personal stakes for the former president will become even clearer when the first trial begins for real on Monday.",

CNN —\nCNN — While former President Donald Trump is spinning conspiracy theories about people infiltrating the jury in his hush money criminal trial, the judge in the case is finding it difficult to protect jurors' anonymity.\nAnonymity for juries like the one being formed to hear charges in New York against Trump is supposed to add a layer of protection for jurors doing their civic duty. Once reserved only for cases involving violent criminal enterprises, the practice is becoming more common. It's usually employed for high-profile cases but also at will by judges in some states. Rules vary.\nRELATED: Full 12-person jury set for Trump trial after Thursday proceedings. Alternates still needed.\nThe concept of anonymous juries is still relatively new; the first in US history was empaneled in New York in 1977 for the trial of Leroy 'Nicky' Barnes, a drug kingpin known as Mr. Untouchable, according to The New York Times. Barnes, famous for avoiding conviction, caught the attention of then-President Jimmy Carter, who told the Justice Department to take special care with the case, which yielded a guilty verdict.\nEven the lawyers in that case weren't permitted to know the identities of the jurors, a step further than the precautions in place for the Trump trial in New York. Both prosecutors and Trump's defense have been poring over the social media profiles and pasts of potential jurors in Judge Juan Merchan's courtroom.\nMerchan issued an order in March agreeing with prosecutors that most information about the jurors would be sealed. Trump's lawyers did not disagree, according to the order.\nA separate Trump-related jury, the one that found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation of E. Jean Carroll, was fully anonymous – like the one that convicted Barnes – and the identities of jurors were not known to lawyers on either side.\nCNN's Jeremy Herb recently wrote about how Trump has acted around juries before this current case.\nIn this hyperconnected social media age, anonymity is hard to achieve. One juror who had been sworn onto the panel on Tuesday was excused by Merchan on Thursday after she said her anonymity was blown.\nAspects of my identity have already been out there in the public.\nFormer Juror No. 2\n'Yesterday alone, I had friends, colleagues and family push things to my phone questioning my identity as a juror,' the former Juror No. 2 told Merchan.\nMerchan admonished the press for publishing information that could identify jurors.\n'We just lost what probably would've been a very good juror,' Merchan said in court. 'The first thing she said was she was afraid and intimidated by the press.'\nRead more about Merchan scolding the press from CNN's Hadas Gold.\nTrump, ever trying to chip away at the justice system that is prosecuting him, seeded a new conspiracy theory by posting a quote on social media, attributed to Fox News host Jesse Watters, that 'undercover Liberal Activists' were trying to get on the jury.\nSet aside the fact that there is no evidence to support this claim – and consider that the prosecution needs every juror to agree with them to get a guilty verdict, while Trump just needs one to vote for acquittal to result in a hung jury. Meanwhile, a special hearing on whether Trump has violated a gag order for his continued social media attacks is set for next week.\na hung jury. Meanwhile, a special hearing on whether Trump has violated a gag order for his continued social media attacks is set for next week. Maybe Trump remembers one of the most infamous, anonymous jury incidents, featuring another famous New Yorker, the mob boss John Gotti.\nThe anonymity of jurors in that case from 1987 allowed the jury foreman, who just so happened to have organized crime connections, to contact Gotti and, in exchange for bribes, guarantee a hung jury.\nThe informer who turned on Gotti, Salvatore 'Sammy the Bull' Gravano, also told authorities the juror, George Pape, had been bought off. Pape voted to acquit Gotti, but so did the 11 other jurors. The contaminated acquittal stood since the Constitution protects against double jeopardy, according to a New York Times report at the time. Gotti later went to prison after a subsequent conviction on different charges.\nClearly there's a massive difference between a major push by the federal government to go after organized crime in the 1980s with racketeering charges and Trump's prosecution for the Class E felony of falsifying a business record in furtherance of campaign violations.\nBut the unyielding support Trump commands from his supporters and the violent things they will do on his behalf, like storming the US Capitol, suggest this is the type of case where anonymity is clearly warranted – although the practice of anonymous juries is in tension with the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution, which guarantees a public, fair and speedy trial by an impartial jury.\nMerchan told news outlets to better refrain from reporting details that could unmask the jurors, like physical descriptions, and prohibited them from including elements that are on a jury questionnaire, like their places of business.\nThere is known, public information about the jurors – their genders, professions, family situations and more – that it's reasonable to think they could be unmasked by determined internet sleuths or loose-lipped acquaintances.\nInvestigations into the jurors are also being conducted in real time during this process. Trump's defense was scrolling through old social media posts and asking jurors about them.\nProsecutors are looking for flaws with jurors. Another juror, a Puerto Rican grandfather who had said he finds Trump 'fascinating and mysterious,' was also dismissed Thursday. The exact circumstances of his dismissal are not clear, but prosecutors informed the judge their review of criminal records showed a person sharing the man's name was arrested in the 1990s for tearing down political advertisements.\nThe exact circumstances of his dismissal are not clear, but prosecutors informed the judge their review of criminal records showed a person sharing the man's name was arrested in the 1990s for tearing down political advertisements.

These jurors will be asked to take on the weight of sitting in judgment of a former and maybe future president.\n'Jurors show up, and a lot of times, they don't think they're going to end up being selected for whatever reason. And so when they go through the process, as soon as they're sworn in a panel, that can be pretty jolting,' the jury consultant Alan Tuerkheimer told CNN's Omar Jimenez in an interview on Max.

            "summary": "CNN —\nCNN — Donald Trump's leadership PAC spent as much money as it took in last month, with his legal bills remaining a top expense as the former president grappled with the aftermath of losing a civil fraud case and prepared for the start of a historic criminal trial in a Manhattan court.\nSave America, the political action committee that has underwritten much of Trump's legal expenses, spent nearly $3.7 million on legal-related expenses in March – nearly $3 out of every $4 it collected, according to a filing Saturday night with the Federal Election Commission. And the committee ended this month with an additional $886,000 in outstanding legal bills – most of which were owed to Robert & Robert, the firm that has represented Trump and his family in a business fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. That case ended in February with a staggering $355 million judgment against him, not counting interest.\nOpening arguments are slated to begin Monday in a separate case, the criminal hush money trial that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has brought against Trump – the first former president to face criminal prosecution. Save America paid a combined $1.14 million in March to Blanche Law and NechelesLaw LLP, whose principals have flanked Trump in court during jury selection in recent days.\nSaturday's filings underscore how much financial ground Trump must make up as the general election campaign heats up. President Joe Biden and the Democratic National Committee expanded their cash advantage over Trump and the GOP in March.\nBiden's principal campaign committee entered April with $85.5 million stockpiled in its war chest, while Trump's main campaign account had $45.1 million.\nThe money Save America spent just on legal expenses last month rivals the $3.7 million Trump's campaign committee spent altogether in March as he pursues a third bid for the White House. That marked a significantly slower pace of campaign spending for the former president.\nBy contrast, Biden's campaign – flush with money – reported more than $29 million in expenditures last month. It plowed nearly $22 million into producing and placing campaign ads.\nSave America has relied on tens of millions of dollars it has clawed back from a Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., to help keep it afloat. The new filings show the super PAC sent another $5 million back to Save America in March – bringing its total refunds to $57.25 million.\nBut this source of money will soon run dry. The leadership PAC had donated a total of $60 million to MAGA Inc., and cannot seek more than that in refunds.\nTrump's political team will tap another cash pipeline in the quest to replenish that dwindling resource. Under a recently inked joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee and dozens of state parties, Save America is slated to get a $5,000 slice of money collected from each individual donor who participates in high-dollar fundraising. And the agreement prioritizes payments to Save America ahead of contributions to the RNC, according to the fine print of an invitation obtained by CNN.\nThe first big event under the umbrella of the new fundraising committee – a dinner at the Florida home of a billionaire investor – raised a record $50.5 million, according to the Trump campaign.\nThis week's filings also pointed to the financial boon that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s vice presidential pick represents for his independent bid for the White House. His campaign received a $2 million contribution from Nicole Shanahan in March and raised more than $3 million more that month, campaign filings show.\nKennedy also burned through cash in March, spending $4.5 million, as the campaign spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on consulting, events, advertising and payroll, up from February, when the campaign spent about $2.9 million. Kennedy's campaign ended March with about $6 million in cash on hand.\nShanahan is an independently wealthy tech executive and the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin. Politicians can contribute unlimited amounts of their own money to benefit their campaigns.\nCNN's Aaron Pellish contributed to this report.",

            "summary": "A view of Judge Juan Manuel Merchan's courtroom at Manhattan Criminal Court in New York on March 12. Brendan McDermid/Reuters The jury selection process for the hush money trial against former President Donald Trump will be tedious and the questionnaire involved is a key tool in weeding out potential bias, CNN legal analysts said.\n\"A lot of it is very typical in terms of where you're from, etcetera, but not questions about who you voted for,\" CNN chief legal analyst Laura Coates said.\nAttorneys do want to know the jurors' views on the case and also their media sources, she noted —which could be pretty reflective of who they are, their beliefs are on a particular issue and also their political activity, \"whether you or someone in your actual circle, not just you alone, has attended a rally either for Trump or anti-Trump.\"\nPotential jurors can be removed based on strikes and challenges to answers to the lengthy questionnaire. Also each party involved in the case will have the opportunity to dismiss 10 jurors based on a peremptory challenge — meaning they can remove a juror without any reason or explanation, Elie Honig, former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York, explained to CNN.\nAnd finally, the big elephant in the room will be the election. \"This is a tough jury pool for Donald Trump,\" Honig noted. \"This is a jury pool loaded against Donald Trump — politically.\" Honig continued that in Manhattan, New York County, Trump only got 12.3% of the vote in 2020. \"Important to remember, no Bronx, no Queens, no Staten Island, no Brooklyn here. This is Manhattan and Manhattan only.\"",

            "summary": "New York CNN —\nNew York CNN — Investors in Trump Media & Technology Group's stock are finally, after two days of turmoil, seeing an uptick in their shares.\nThe stock TMTG (DJT) rebounded by more than 12% in early afternoon trading on Wednesday after tumbling precipitously earlier this week.\nthis week. Shares closed more than 14% lower on Tuesday after the company's premier product, Truth Social, announced a major expansion into streaming, a notoriously cost-intensive business in which media behemoths like Disney have struggled to turn a profit. It also fell 18% on Monday after the company took steps to sell millions of extra shares.\nThe company, which is majority-owned by former President Donald Trump, is down about 60% from the all-time high it set on March 26, the day after it merged with a blank-check acquisition company to go public.\nThe company's market value as of Wednesday was just over $3.5 billion, well below its peak of nearly $8 billion when the company began trading at nearly $70 a share.\nThere are many reasons why Trump Media shares have been so volatile, including the fact that the company is inextricably linked to the former president. His name recognition, politically polarizing nature and close association with the company have captured the attention of retail investors, professional traders and the news media, creating a volatile environment for the stock.\nreasons why Trump Media shares have been so volatile, including the fact that the company is inextricably linked to the former president. His name recognition, politically polarizing nature and close association with the company have captured the attention of retail investors, professional traders and the news media, creating a volatile environment for the stock. Although the company is still worth billions of dollars, it is struggling to make money and needs cash. Experts have warned investors to be careful if they choose to trade the stock, because the company doesn't have the fundamentals to back up its sky-high valuation.\nTrump Media lost $58 million in 2023 and made just $4.1 million in revenue.\nTrump Media's extreme peaks and troughs have caused wild swings in the net worth of the company's largest shareholder and chairman: former President Donald Trump.\nOn just one particularly bad day, Trump's net worth plunged by $1 billion.\nTrump is currently in the midst of a criminal trial where he has been charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records for his alleged role in a hush money scheme before the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty.\nMore on the case here.",

Angela Weiss/Pool/Getty Images Donald Trump has faced three civil trials in New York since he left the White House, but this is the first time he faces possible jail time.\nThe former president is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, stemming from reimbursements made to his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen for hush money payments he made before the 2016 election to an adult film star alleging an affair with Trump. The former president has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair with Stormy Daniels.\nEach count represents a separate instance of the alleged misconduct, pointing to different business records associated with a series of repayments to Cohen (ledger entries, checks, stubs, invoices, etc.) that were allegedly falsified to conceal his criminal conduct.\nPenalty: The maximum penalty for each count is four years in state prison. However, the judge has discretion on how long any sentence should be and whether to allow any sentences to be served consecutively. He could also sentence Trump to probation.\nPenalty: The maximum penalty for each count is four years in state prison.
