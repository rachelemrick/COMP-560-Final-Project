            "summary": "PHOENIX — Arizona lawmakers kicked off a highly anticipated legislative session Wednesday, amid mounting pressure on Republicans to repeal a near-total ban on abortion from 1864 that was upheld by the battleground state's Supreme Court.\nFollowing that ruling, Republicans across Arizona and the country — including former President Donald Trump — called on state legislators to repeal the ban as the party has continued to deal with blowback on the issue of reproductive rights in the nearly two years since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade.\nThe Arizona Supreme Court ruling last week allowed a Civil War-era law in Arizona to stand that made abortion a felony punishable by two to five years in prison for anyone who performs one or helps a woman obtain one. The law — which was codified in 1901 and again in 1913, after Arizona gained statehood — outlaws abortion from the moment of conception but includes an exception to save the woman's life.\nThe bombshell decision added the swing state to the growing lists of places where abortion care is effectively banned — and set off an explosion of political activity. Democrats furiously undertook efforts to repeal the ban, while Republicans scrambled feverishly to offset the political fallout by discussing a series of possible contingencies.\nThose options include pushing alternative ballot measures to compete with a proposed constitutional amendment to expand abortion rights in the state, according to a leaked strategy document circulated among Arizona Republicans obtained Monday by NBC News.\nThe document made no mention of repealing the ban and Arizona House Republicans squashed an effort by Democrats during their session last Wednesday to repeal the ban.\nDespite the growing pressure on Arizona Republicans, Democratic lawmakers face an uphill climb in repealing the ban: Republicans hold a narrow two-seat majority in both legislative chambers, meaning that Democrats need three Republicans in both the state House and state Senate to repeal the ban.\nArizona political insiders and experts told NBC News that because Republicans are considering so many varying courses of action Wednesday, it remained unclear whether, or when, a bill to repeal the ban will even be introduced during the session.\nAdam Edelman Alex Tabet",

            "excerpt": "Republicans are publicly dismissing concerns about fundraising, saying their House candidates can remain competitive with Democrats.",
            "summary": "Republicans have sounded the alarm in recent years that Democrats are overwhelming their candidates in fundraising. And despite making some improvements last year, some of the most vulnerable House Republicans are once again falling behind their Democratic opponents.\nDemocratic candidates outraised Republicans in almost every one of the most competitive seats in the race for the House, according to new fundraising reports filed this week, a setback for Republicans who had been hoping their candidates were turning a corner.\nMoney alone doesn't determine winners and losers, especially in a presidential cycle where most voter attention will be focused on the top of the ticket. And Republicans expect their candidates and outside effort to be well-funded. But as Democrats need a net gain of just four seats to retake control of the House, their incumbents and challengers entered April in a significantly better financial position than their Republican rivals.\nRepublicans admit the fundraising gap isn't ideal, but they're tamping down concerns — at least publicly\n'Our swing-district incumbents continue to stack the cash they'll need to beat their extreme challengers,' National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Will Reinert said in a statement.\nThe latest fundraising reports, spanning the first three months of the year, also come as Republicans navigate life without an experienced prolific fundraiser as speaker after Kevin McCarthy's ouster (and with current Speaker Mike Johnson fighting continual intraparty threats to his leadership).\nTen of the 11 Republican incumbents in races rated as 'toss ups' by The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter were outraised by at least one Democratic challenger. Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer was the only GOP incumbent in that category to lead her district in fundraising.\nRepublican incumbents who were outraised include: Arizona Reps. David Schweikert and Juan Ciscomani; California Reps. John Duarte, David Valadao, Mike Garcia and Ken Calvert; New Jersey Rep. Tom Kean Jr.; and New York Reps. Mike Lawler, Marc Molinaro and Anthony D'Esposito.\nIn races against Schweikert, Garcia, Calvert, Lawler and Molinaro, a Democratic candidate also finished the first quarter of 2024 with more cash on hand than the incumbent.\nAnd Republican candidates were also outraised in two other 'toss-up' seats being vacated by Democratic incumbents in Michigan.\nDemocrats also showed strong fundraising in a handful of other seats more likely to stay in Republican hands, with their candidates outraising Republican Reps. Kevin Kiley of California, Anna Paulina Luna of Florida, Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Zach Nunn of Iowa, Don Bacon of Nebraska and Nick LaLota of New York. But those Republicans still had more cash banked away.\nHouse Democratic candidates have held a financial edge over their GOP rivals ever since the Democratic small-dollar fundraising boom that took place after former President Donald Trump took office. In 2018, that advantage has helped them take control of the House. But just two years later, the GOP won big across the House battlegrounds despite operating at a financial deficit, setting the party up to retake the majority in 2022.\nDespite those gains, party strategists have still raised concerns about disparities in candidate fundraising, which gave Democrats a significant edge on the airwaves, since candidates receive lower TV ad rates than outside groups.\nDemocrats are confident they'll continue to have a financial advantage heading into November. Just two of their vulnerable incumbents — Connecticut Rep. Jahana Hayes and Texas Rep. Vicente Gonazalez — were outraised by their likely GOP opponents.\nOn average, Democratic incumbents in 'tossup' races raised more than $1 million on average in the first quarter, while the average GOP incumbent in a similar race raised $619,000.\n'Everyone can see the writing on the wall: House Republicans, consumed by chaos and crisis, are about to lose their majority,' Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Viet Shelton said in a statement.\nRepublicans in competitive races did step up their fundraising last year as they look to defend their slim majority. The NRCC also launched a 'million dollar mission' to encourage lawmakers to give to their colleagues' campaigns and boost vulnerable incumbents' accounts in the off-year.\nMcCarthy's exit has dealt a blow to GOP fundraising. Speaker Mike Johnson's joint fundraising committee, which funnels money to vulnerable GOP lawmakers and state parties, raised $9.1 million from January through March. McCarthy's similar committee brought in three times more — $28.9 million — over the same period last year.\nStill, even those within the party who have sounded the alarm about the GOP fundraising disadvantage in the past believe the gap has been narrowed enough to mute any significant impact.\n'You can't get outspent 5- or 6-to-1, but that's not what's happening in the races that matter. In this environment, you could get narrowly outspent and still have the edge,' said Corry Bliss, a veteran GOP strategist who previously ran the House Republicans' top super PAC, Congressional Leadership Fund.\nBliss argued that the top of the ticket will have a more significant impact than the GOP candidates' fundraising disadvantages, especially considering super PACs like CLF continue to rake in strong fundraising hauls.\n'Joe Biden's approval rating, Joe Biden's foreign policies, Joe Biden's economic policies will be the most important thing in these House races,' he said.\n'Of course given the choice you want more money than your opponent. But given the voice, I'll take a $5 gallon of gas and Joe Biden with 34% approval rating over [stronger] online fundraising.'\nOutside super PACs like CLF will still play a major role in House races, especially in the costly TV markets in New York and California, which are hosting many of the top battlegrounds. CLF, and the House Democrats' House Majority PAC, both remain well-funded.\nBut strong candidate fundraising can allow outside groups to supplement GOP candidate spending, rather than shouldering the entire load.\n'It allows CLF and the super PACs to be the whipped cream and the cherry on the advertising sundae, not the full three scoops,' said Matt Gorman, a former NRCC spokesman, arguing Republican candidate fundraising is better off than it was just a few years ago.\nStill, not everyone is dismissing worries about a potentially widening fundraising gap.\n\"It's always a concern when we see our incumbents and candidates being outspent,' said one national GOP strategist involved in House races.\nBen Kamisar Bridget Bowman Joe Murphy",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — A third House Republican has signed onto an effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson from power, giving his opponents the votes they'd need to remove the Republican leader unless Democrats stepped in to save him.\nRep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., signed onto the \"motion to vacate\" authored by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., both Republicans said Friday. If brought to the floor as a privileged resolution, it would force a vote within two legislative days on whether to oust Johnson as speaker. A simple majority vote would be needed to succeed.\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., joined the motion to vacate earlier this week but has said he doesn't want to force a vote on it, instead pushing for Johnson to resign. The three Republicans and other hard-right members of the conference are furious at the speaker for bringing up votes to provide aid for Ukraine, particularly without U.S. border security provisions attached.\n'We need a Speaker who puts America first rather than bending to the reckless demands of the warmongers, neo-cons and the military industrial complex making billions from a costly and endless war half a world away,' Gosar said in a statement Friday.\nIf brought to the floor, those three Republican votes would be enough to remove Johnson as speaker if all Democrats vote against him. Some Democrats have indicated they would step in to save Johnson, but Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Friday that \"the pre-requisite to the conversation\" about saving Johnson is that the foreign aid bills pass \"in totality.\"\nThe addition of a third Republican on the motion to vacate is a huge blow to Johnson, raising the likelihood that he is either ousted from power or that he's saved by Democrats, which could further undermine him within the conference.\n'Johnson is done,\" said one Republican who supports the speaker. \"It's sad.'\nGreene \"has the votes,\" said another Republican. The member said they believe Democrats will vote to save Johnson — especially after the way the aid packages were structured, which drew the ire of some conservatives.\nMassie said the intention isn't to force a vote to oust Johnson but instead to show their numbers and get the speaker to resign on his own. That would avoid weeks of chaos on the floor, where the House must hold consecutive votes to install a speaker, and instead allow Republicans to meet behind closed doors and choose a new leader before Johnson voluntarily vacates the chair, Massie told reporters.\n'The strategy all along has been to ask the speaker to resign in a fashion like John Boehner resigned, where John Boehner cleaned the barn and said, 'I'm leaving and you've got plenty of time to replace me,'\" Massie said. \"So, in that circumstance, we didn't end up with the speaker-less House. ... Just like when you leave a job, you give two weeks' notice, we're looking for Mike's notice.'\nMassie suggested that a vote to oust Johnson could result in Republicans ending up in the minority; the balance of power is so close in the House that it wouldn't take much movement to elect Jeffries as speaker. Voting to remove Johnson would lead the House to hold vote after vote \"sometimes two times, three times a day,\" Massie noted. Thus voting for Jeffries just to end the chaos might start to look appealing to a handful of Republicans.\n'If Johnson would do it in the manner that John Boehner did it, there's no chance to go into the minority because it's not fought out on the floor. ... Jeffries is not on the ballot when we do this in conference,\" Massie stressed. \"And so that's the goal.'\nHe added that he had 12 people in mind who could do a better job than Johnson.\nGreene has not indicated if or when she'll try to force a vote on the motion to vacate.\nGosar announced that he had joined the effort to oust Johnson just after the House voted to advance the package of four foreign aid bills — one for Ukraine, one for Israel, another for Taiwan and a fourth that attempts to counter China by providing a pathway to ban TikTok in the U.S. as well as other national security priorities.\nJohnson called the House package of foreign aid bills 'the best possible product that we can get under these circumstances,' noting that Democrats control the Senate and the White House.\nHe said that a discharge petition from Democrats to force the House to take up a Senate-passed foreign aid package would have 'happened imminently' if the House had not acted.\n'The reality here is that if the House did not do this ... we would have had to eat the Senate supplemental bill,' he told reporters.\nKyle Stewart Julie Tsirkin Ali Vitali",

            "summary": "Democrats are facing an uphill battle to keep control of the Senate, but new fundraising reports show they are building up an early cash advantage for the fight.\nFundraising bursts have helped Democrats win tough races in recent years, with donors opening up their wallets wider following Donald Trump's presidential election win in 2016 and fueling a 'green wave' to boost Democratic candidates.\nThat green wave is building once again, according to fundraising reports covering the first three months of the year, which were filed Monday with the Federal Election Commission.\nBut it remains to be seen whether the money can carry Democrats to victory in a year where they're on defense in some GOP-leaning states. Republicans need a net gain of just one or two seats to take control of the Senate, depending which party wins the White House, since the vice president casts tie-breaking votes in the Senate.\nHere are three takeaways from the fundraising reports in Senate races that the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter rates as competitive:\n1. Democrats are stockpiling cash… In the 10 states with competitive Senate races, Democrats are stockpiling millions of dollars ahead of November.\nPer an NBC News analysis of candidates who raised more than $50,000 in the first quarter, Democrats in those 10 races ended the quarter with a combined $100 million in their campaign accounts — more than twice as much as the Republican candidates, who had a combined $42.5 million on hand.\nDemocrats ended the quarter with more cash on hand than their GOP opponents in all but one of the competitive races. Only Florida GOP Sen. Rick Scott had more money in his campaign account than his likely Democratic opponent, besting former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell by $1 million.\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown, one of two Democrats running for re-election in a state that Trump won, ended the quarter with the largest war chest, banking away $16 million. His GOP opponent, businessman Bernie Moreno, had $1.8 million in his account after winning a competitive primary last month.\nFive other Democratic candidates ended the quarter with more than $10 million in their campaign accounts: Sens. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Jon Tester of Montana, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, and a non-incumbent: Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, who is raising major money online as he runs against GOP Sen. Ted Cruz.\nDemocrats also outraised their GOP opponents in each competitive race except for Wisconsin, where wealthy businessman Eric Hovde's $8 million loan to his campaign boosted his fundraising number over Baldwin, putting his total raised at $9.1 million while Baldwin raised $5.4 million. All of Baldwin's fundraising came from other donors.\n2. … and Democrats are largely outspending GOP opponents Not only have Democrats been outraising their GOP challengers and building up their cash reserves, but the new reports also show that they're now largely outspending their Republican opponents.\nThat early spending has helped Democrats in past election cycles, as they try to define themselves with voters early in the campaign and inoculate themselves from future GOP attacks. But like other campaign finance trends, they offer no guarantee in terms of results.\nAcross the 10 battlegrounds, Democrats spent a combined $65.7 million in the first quarter to Republicans' $30.3 million\nThe two exceptions were in Wisconsin, where Hovde spent $3.7 million to Baldwin's $3.2 million, and in Pennsylvania. There, Casey was barely outspent by former hedge fund manager David McCormick, with the Republican spending $3.3 million to Casey's $3.2 million.\n3. Wealthy candidates boost the GOP Both Hovde and McCormick underscore another dynamic Republicans are hoping to leverage this year: wealthy candidates who can self-fund some of their campaigns.\nEight GOP Senate candidates in competitive races, including Hovde, have loaned or donated more than $500,000 of their own money to their campaigns.\nincluding Hovde, have loaned or donated more than $500,000 of their own money to their campaigns. Some of the more prominent self-funders included Hovde, Moreno and McCormick. Montana Republican Tim Sheehy, a top recruit, also loaned his campaign $500,000.\nNevada Republican Jeff Gunter, Michigan Republican Sandy Pensler, and Maryland Republican Robin Ficker spent more than $500,000 of their own money on their races as they compete in GOP primaries against candidates that are backed by the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\nBridget Bowman Joe Murphy",

            "excerpt": "In Washington state, local lawmaker Leslie Lewallen is mounting a long-shot challenge make the general election over MAGA-aligned Republican Joe Kent.",
            "summary": "The House seat representing southwest Washington state is among Republicans' top targets to expand their slim majority in the 2024 elections — if they can nominate a candidate who can win.\nFormer GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler represented the area for over a decade, but a year after voting to impeach then-President Donald Trump, she lost her 2022 GOP primary to Joe Kent, an Army veteran who had challenged Herrera Beutler from the right.\nKent then lost the general election to Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez in a campaign that focused on Kent's right-wing ties — even as the GOP's Senate candidate, Tiffany Smiley, carried the same district by 8 points. (Smiley lost to the Democratic incumbent, Patty Murray.)\nKent is running for the seat again this year, hoping for an opposite result, but Camas City Council Member Leslie Lewallen is hoping to take that spot on the general election ballot for herself. She is pitching herself as a Republican who is more palatable to the district's voters.\n'Joe Kent had his opportunity in 2022. He lost. He'll lose again, by an even wider margin,\" Lewallen told NBC News during a trip to Washington, D.C.\nShe added that she worries that if Kent and Gluesenkamp Perez are on the general election ballot again, 'we could lose this seat for a very long time and we could lose the majority in the House of Representatives.'\n'There's frankly just too much at stake. We should never have lost that seat,' Lewallen said.\nA tough path to beat Kent in the primary Across the country in 2022, Republicans blamed the absence of a \"red wave\" on poor candidate quality, pointing to Kent as one example.\nKent questioned the integrity of the 2020 election, called Jan. 6 defendants \"political prisoners\" and attended a \"Justice for J6\" rally organized by one of his advisers. The Associated Press also investigated his ties to far-right groups during the campaign.\nBut Republicans in the state and nationally say Kent's place on the general election ballot this year is almost a foregone conclusion, with Lewallen's campaign struggling to define a clear path to finishing ahead of him in the top-two primary.\nLewallen's campaign struggling to define a clear path to finishing ahead of him in the top-two primary. 'Joe Kent has the support of all seven county Republican Parties in [the district] and also the Washington State Republican Party,' Kent's campaign said in a statement, adding, 'Grassroots and mainstream voters in the district are unified in support of replacing the extreme Democrat incumbent with common sense conservative, Joe Kent.'\nOne national Republican strategist said that Lewallen \"seems like a good candidate with a nice bio, but the question is can she win the primary? From what we've seen of her campaign so far, it doesn't look likely.'\nIn the first three months of 2024, Kent raised just over $225,000, while Lewallen raised just over $193,000. That's a closer spread than the last quarter of 2023, but Kent is still outraising Lewallen. And both paled in comparison to Gluesenkamp Perez, who raised over $850,000 in the same period.\nthree months of 2024, Kent raised just over $225,000, while Lewallen raised just over $193,000. That's a closer spread than the last quarter of 2023, but Kent is still outraising Lewallen. And both paled in comparison to Gluesenkamp Perez, who raised over $850,000 in the same period. Meanwhile, the Washington state Republican Party decided to officially endorse Kent last year.\n\"This is politics,\" said the party's chair, Jim Walsh, adding, \"Nothing is ever certain, certain, certain, but Kent's path looks pretty clear.\"\nAbove all, Walsh said, Republicans in the state and the district should be focused on beating Gluesenkamp Perez.\nHe pointed to what he thought should be the biggest issue in the race: \"Dissatisfaction with Marie Perez's track record\" in Congress.\n\"While Perez has a very effective PR campaign and operation and gets lots of photo ops, the fact is her voting record is really not representative of what Washington's 3rd's values are,\" Walsh added.\nFor their part, Democrats are convinced that Kent will be their opponent in November and hope to run a similar campaign to the one that defeated him in 2022.\n\"Joe Kent will be my opponent in the general election, and I invite Republicans and conservatives who can't stomach Joe Kent's angry, dangerous, divisive view of the world to support my campaign instead, like they did in 2022,' Gluesenkamp Perez said in a statement.\nMarching forward But Lewallen isn't mounting her campaign alone. She's backed by many of the strategists who worked on Smiley' campaign in 2022, as well as Smiley herself.\nWinning for Women, a national group that backs female Republicans running for office, has endorsed Lewallen, too. The group's super PAC has spent millions of dollars supporting female GOP candidates in recent elections.\n\"The choice here is simple: If Leslie is our nominee, Republicans win back this seat. Joe Kent has already shown he cannot win, and nominating him effectively guarantees two more years of Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a liberal extremist who is out of touch with the voters of this district,\" WFW Action Fund executive director Danielle Barrow said in a statement.\nBarrow added that the group raised over $40,000 for Lewallen in a single event in the first quarter of this year and it already has additional fundraisers planned for the second quarter.\nSo far this year, a few GOP House candidates who lost swing seats in 2022 have failed in repeat runs. In Ohio, J.R. Majewski, who was seeking a rematch against Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, dropped out ahead of this year's primary amid a cascade of unflattering news stories and other revelations.\nAnd in North Carolina, far-right candidate Sandy Smith lost the GOP primary this year to retired Army Col. Laurie Buckhout, who was backed by an outside group tied to House Republican leadership. Smith, the GOP nominee in 2022, lost to Democratic Rep. Don Davis.\nBut every race is different.\n\"Joe Kent has the support of all seven county Republican Parties in [the district] and also the Washington State Republican Party,\" Kent's campaign said in a statement, adding, \"Grassroots and mainstream voters in the district are unified in support of replacing the extreme Democrat incumbent with common sense conservative, Joe Kent.\"\nLewallen said she found Kent's 2022 campaign \"very frustrating\" because he \"did not talk about anything important to southwest Washington. \"\n\"did not talk about anything important to southwest Washington.\" \"The entire campaign focused on this Washington instead of our Washington,\" she said. \"I want to move forward. I think most of Americans want to move forward. They want to see what's broken get fixed. They want to elect members of Congress who are there to govern and to not play the performative politics.\"\nAlexandra Marquez",

            "summary": "PHOENIX — Republican state legislators in Arizona are considering pushing alternative ballot measures competing with a proposed constitutional amendment expanding abortion rights in the state, according to a PowerPoint presentation obtained by NBC News, as the GOP faces the fallout from a state Supreme Court ruling upholding a near-total abortion ban.\nThe strategy document includes a slide titled: 'PHASE 2: SEND VOTERS TWO OTHER OPTIONS THAT CONFLICT WITH AAA INITIATIVE,' in reference to the Arizona for Abortion Access ballot measure which aims to enshrine abortion rights into the state's constitution through fetal viability and vastly expand the scope for exceptions.\nThe document outlines a plan to give the voters alternatives to the Arizona for Abortion Access ballot measure, presenting options for other constitutional amendments like the '15-week Reproductive Care and Abortion Act and Heartbeat Protection Act.'\nAnd the document also discusses presenting voters with an option for a limit on abortions after 15 weeks that would actually be a stricter ban.\n'Could scale back 15-week law to 14-week law,' reads the presentation. 'In reality, a 14-week law disguised as a 15-week law because it would only allow abortion until the beginning of the 15th week,' it goes on.\nThe Arizona state Legislature is slated to reconvene on Wednesday as pressure mounts from Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, to repeal Arizona's 1864 abortion ban.\nState House Speaker Ben Toma said in a statement responding to the presentation: 'The document presents ideas drafted for internal discussion and consideration within the caucus. I've publicly stated that we are looking at options to address this subject, and this is simply part of that.'\nDawn Penich, spokesperson for Arizona for Abortion Access, the coalition of reproductive rights organizations including the ACLU of Arizona and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona, said that the document 'shows yet again why Arizonans can't leave our most basic and personal rights in the hands of politicians in the state legislature.\nThe Republican PowerPoint also outlines a plan to 'constitutionalize existing laws,' on the books in Arizona in response to the debate over abortion policy. That includes 'forbidding anyone who is not a licensed physician from performing an abortion,' and outlawing 'discriminatory abortions' or 'prohibiting physicians from performing an abortion when a physician knows the purpose is based on genetic abnormality or race or gender.'\nThe purpose of putting forward those proposals, according to the document: 'Changes narrative — Republicans have a plan!' It says the GOP needs to give voters 'give voters something other than the extreme abortion-on- demand AAA Initiative' to choose in November. The 24-week ballot measure has gotten a surge of attention in the last week after the state Supreme Court ruled that Arizona's near-total ban dating from 1864 was enforceable.\nThe Republican strategy document also has a contingency plan in the event that the Arizona For Abortion Access Act's referendum succeeds in November by adding a 'conditional enactment' to it.\nThe PowerPoint presentation ends with a slide that includes a meme of late-night television host Seth Meyers and the text, 'BOOM. EASY AS THAT.'\nAlex Tabet Adam Edelman",

            "excerpt": "House Speaker Mike Johnson told members that they expect to vote on separate aid bills for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies on \"Saturday evening\" after an amendment process.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Facing a divided party and pressure to act, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced he will roll out four bills Wednesday to provide assistance to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan and advance other national security priorities, with the hope of holding final votes on Saturday.\nThe bills represent a major test of Johnson's ability to navigate a thicket of political and global challenges with a wafer-thin majority. And it comes as Johnson, R-La., faces a serious threat to his gavel from Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky.\nJohnson's biggest challenge is Ukraine funding, an issue that has bitterly divided the GOP. He has been squeezed by conservative security hawks who want to help Ukraine fend off Russia's aggression and by an empowered isolationist wing that is feeding off former President Donald Trump's criticism of NATO and prior Ukraine aid measures.\nMultiple Republicans say they oppose any funding for Ukraine, meaning that a significant share of Democrats will be required to carry that measure over the finish line.\nIn a message to members before releasing the legislation, Johnson said there would be \"three bills that will fund America's national security interests and allies in Israel, the Indo-Pacific, and Ukraine, including a loan structure for aid, and enhanced strategy and accountability.\"\nHe said Republican leadership will come forward with an amendment process \"alongside a fourth bill that includes the REPO Act,\" which is aimed at seizing Russian assets to benefit Ukraine; the House-passed bill to ban TikTok in the U.S. unless it divests from its China-based owner; as well as \"sanctions and other measures to confront Russia, China, and Iran.\"\n'We expect the vote on final passage on these bills to be on Saturday evening,' Johnson said in a text message obtained by NBC News.\nHe said there will also be a \"border security bill that includes the core components of H.R.2\" — a conservative, House-passed immigration bill — moving under a separate process. That measure serves as a sweetener for reticent conservatives who are unhappy that the aid bills don't include domestic immigration provisions.\nSwift conservative pushback Multiple House conservatives pushed back immediately on social media Wednesday after Johnson's message went out, complaining that the border measures weren't directly tied to Ukraine funding.\n\"The Republican Speaker of the House is seeking a rule to pass almost $100 billion in foreign aid — while unquestionably, dangerous criminals, terrorists, & fentanyl pour across our border. The border 'vote' in this package is a watered-down dangerous cover vote. I will oppose,\" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, wrote on X.\nRep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., the most recent chair of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, said: \"Anything less than tying Ukraine aid to real border security fails to live up to @SpeakerJohnson's own words just several weeks ago. Our constituents demand — and deserve — more from us.\"\nRep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, earlier called aid to Ukraine unnecessary, saying: 'I'm not giving them a nickel today, tomorrow or next week.\"\n'Putin is not going into Poland. I don't care what you say. Besides, anyway, it doesn't really matter because ... when Donald Trump wins, Putin's leavin'. Putin's leavin' Ukraine,' Nehls said ahead of the bill's release, without explaining his logic.\nHouse Democrats have repeatedly called on Johnson to bring up a Senate-passed foreign aid package instead, calling it the best — if not only — path to getting a bill on Biden's desk. They have posted a \"discharge petition\" with 195 signatories to end-run Johnson and force a vote on that bill. It needs 218 votes to come up, meaning it will need the backing of some Republicans in addition to Democrats.\nAt a Wednesday meeting with Democrats, House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., told members that they need to use their 'personal relationships' with Republicans to garner support for the discharge petition, according to two people familiar with her comments.\nTreasury Secretary Yellen dials up pressure At a bilateral meeting later Wednesday with Ukraine Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen plans to dial up the pressure on House Republicans to act.\n'The failure of House Republicans to act to support Ukraine in this pivotal moment of the war for so long has been inexcusable—and detrimental to our national security,' Yellen will say, according to a Treasury source. 'Every moment of delay by House Republicans strengthens Putin and emboldens America's adversaries around the world who are closely watching to see if we, the United States, maintains its resolve to support a democratic Ukraine as it fends off an autocratic Russia.'\nMeanwhile, Greene has not said when she might force a vote on her \"motion to vacate\" the speaker's chair, which would take a simple majority to remove Johnson from his job. Her effort gained a cosponsor in Massie on Tuesday, who predicted Johnson would be voted out.\nIt's not clear the votes are there to oust Johnson. Many conservatives, including some who voted to remove former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, have not joined the effort to oust Johnson. Some Democrats have also said they'll vote to protect Johnson from a motion to depose him.\nBut Massie said that would only hurt his standing with the GOP in the long term.\n'Then he goes further in the hole with Republicans. He becomes toxic to the conference. For every Democrat who comes to his aid he'll lose 2 to 3 more Republicans,' Massie said. 'He doesn't have much shelf life after that.'\nJohnson struck a defiant tone Tuesday when asked about the threat to his gavel, calling it 'absurd' while saying he's 'not concerned' about the motion and will continue to do his job.\nSahil Kapur Rebecca Kaplan Julie Tsirkin contributed.",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — After a weeklong delay, the House of Representatives on Tuesday afternoon will send its articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to the Senate, a spokesperson for Speaker Mike Johnson confirmed.\nIt will kick off what's expected to be a very short trial in the upper chamber — one that could wrap up by week's end. However, Republicans, who are demanding a full Senate trial, are fighting to drag out the process in a bid to shine the spotlight on what they see as Mayorkas' failure to curtail migrant crossings and secure the southern border.\nAs was done for the two Donald Trump impeachments, the impeachment managers will escort a pair of articles from the House chamber, across the Rotunda and onto the Senate floor sometime after 2 p.m. ET.\nThe Senate will receive the articles, and all 100 senators will be sworn in as jurors in the trial on Wednesday afternoon. It is unclear exactly how long the trial will last, though Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has said the Senate will deal with the matter 'expeditiously.'\nIt's expected that Senate Democrats, who control the chamber, will band together and vote to dismiss or table the issue, then move on to other business, including the chamber's need to renew a critical spy tool before it expires Friday. None of the Senate's 51 Democrats have said they support the Mayorkas impeachment, and even a handful of GOP senators have said the impeachment is meritless.\n\"Impeachment should never be used to settle a policy disagreement; that would set a horrible precedent for the Congress,\" Schumer said in a floor speech Monday. \"Nevertheless, the Senate's plan has not changed since last week. We are ready to go whenever the House sends us the articles. We want to address this issue as expeditiously as possible.\"\nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican, had originally planned to send the Mayorkas articles to the Senate on April 10, but Senate conservatives, led by Mike Lee of Utah, successfully lobbied the speaker to postpone the action to prevent a speedy dismissal by Democrats at the end of the week as lawmakers were preparing to leave Washington.\nMayorkas, Biden's top border official and the first Latino to lead the Homeland Security Department, became only the second Cabinet secretary in history — and the first since 1876 — to be impeached by the House. Republicans' first attempt to impeach him collapsed spectacularly on the House floor, but they were successful on the second try, on Feb. 13, with just a single vote to spare; the tally was 214-213, with three Republicans joining all Democrats in voting no.\nIn their two articles, House Republicans charged Mayorkas with 'high crimes and misdemeanors' for failing to enforce immigration and border security laws, resulting, they said, in 'millions' of undocumented immigrants illegally crossing into the U.S. each year; and for knowingly lying under oath to Congress.\nMayorkas' Democratic allies have lambasted the GOP's impeachment as a politically motivated 'sham' launched months before the presidential election and argued that Republicans' criticism of the DHS secretary amounts to policy differences rather than impeachable offenses. Several conservatives have argued against impeaching Mayorkas as well, blasting the move as inappropriate. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., a Trump ally, called it 'the worst, dumbest exercise and use of time.'\nThe 11 House impeachment managers, the prosecutors appointed by Johnson, are a mix of senior Republicans and conservative hard-liners.\nThey are: Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green of Tennessee; the Homeland panel's vice chair, Michael Guest of Mississippi; Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul of Texas, who previously was Homeland chairman; Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York; Rep. August Pfluger of Texas; Rep. Laurel Lee of Florida; four conservative Freedom Caucus members: Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Clay Higgins of Louisiana, Ben Cline of Virginia and Harriet Hageman of Wyoming; and far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., one of Trump's top allies on the Hill who led the push to impeach Mayorkas.",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — A second House Republican said he will support the effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson from power, pointing to the GOP leader's handling of foreign aid for Ukraine and other U.S. allies.\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who is a member of Johnson's own Rules Committee, said he informed the speaker directly in a closed-door meeting of House Republicans Tuesday that he is co-sponsoring the resolution offered by far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to remove Johnson, R-La., from the top job.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. Getty Images \"He should pre-announce his resignation (as Boehner did), so we can pick a new Speaker without ever being without a GOP speaker,\" Massie wrote on X, referring to former GOP Speaker John Boehner, who resigned in the middle of his term in 2015 while facing a similar conservative rebellion from Massie and others.\nJohnson told rank-and-file House Republicans in the room that he won't resign, Massie said, a point he reiterated to reporters.\n'I am not resigning. And it is in my view an absurd notion that someone would bring a vacate motion when we are simply here trying to do our jobs,' Johnson said after the private meeting. 'It is not helpful to the country. It does not help the House Republicans advance our agenda which is in the best interest of the American people here: a secure border, sound governance — and it's not helpful to the unity that we have in the body.'\nHe added: 'I am not concerned about this. I am going to do my job.'\nWith the GOP majority hanging by a thread, Johnson can only afford exactly two GOP defections if Greene files her motion as \"privileged,\" forcing a floor vote to vacate the speaker's chair. To successfully remove him in that scenario, at least three Republicans — and all Democrats — would need to vote for the motion to vacate for Johnson to lose his job.\nSome Democrats, however, have said they would vote to save Johnson to prevent the House from spiraling out of control, similar to what happened last fall after conservatives toppled then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, ushering in three weeks of chaos and ultimately paving the way for Johnson's ascent.\nThis week's conservative rebellion comes as Johnson attempts to move stalled foreign aid for U.S. allies including Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan through the House. Far-right members, including Greene, are demanding that Johnson and his leadership team focus their attention and resources on shoring up security of the southern border with Mexico.\nMassie's support for Johnson's ouster is significant in one other regard. The Kentuckian serves on the Rules Committee, known on Capitol Hill as the \"speaker's committee,\" because its members are appointed by the speaker and typically carry out the speaker's wishes. Massie, however, was put on the influential panel by McCarthy last year, and Johnson has had to bypass the Rules Committee on a number of occasions to get critical legislation to the floor.\nScott Wong Rebecca Kaplan Kyle Stewart, Syedah Asghar, Lori Rampani, Ryan Nobles and Sahil Kapur contributed.",

            "summary": "Three House Republicans who voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy are facing a new onslaught on the airwaves, as an outside group with ties to a McCarthy ally launches new ads targeting them on border security funding.\nAmerican Prosperity Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy group, has placed nearly $700,000 in ad spending targeting Reps. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, Bob Good of Virginia and Eli Crane of Arizona, per the ad tracking firm AdImpact. The group also spent more than $90,000 targeting Ohio Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, a top general election target for the GOP.\nThe group, which was founded 2022, announced on Wednesday an effort targeting members of Congress 'who have voted against funding for enhanced border security in the past,' per a press release.\nThe group launched two ads targeting Good and Mace, with each spot saying Good and Mace 'voted against funding our border security, opposed billions for ICE, opposed millions for new technology, opposed thousands of new border agents.' The ads point to their votes against a sweeping government spending package, which 112 House Republicans opposed.\nRepublican strategist Brian O. Walsh, a close McCarthy ally, is a senior adviser to American Prosperity Alliance. Walsh told NBC News he doesn't speak for McCarthy.\nAs a nonprofit, the group does not have to disclose its donors, and it's not clear if McCarthy is involved in this specific effort. Allies were reluctant to directly call this a 'revenge tour' against the former colleagues that banded together to oust him.\nInstead, one source familiar with these groups' strategy allowed that McCarthy had been active in supporting challengers to some GOP incumbents, but that it was less of an active 'recruitment' process and more that McCarthy was supporting candidates who had already organically chosen to run.\nWhile McCarthy's exact role is not clear, he did signal back in October that he could take on some of the lawmakers who cost him the speakership.\n'A lot of them I helped get elected, so I probably should have picked somebody else,' McCarthy told reporters, speaking about the eight Republicans who voted to oust him. Asked if he would support primary challengers against those members, McCarthy said at the time, 'I'm a free agent now, aren't I?'\nMace, Good and Crane are all facing credible primary challengers. Crane is facing former Yavapai County Supervisor Jack Smith in Arizona, and Good is facing state Sen. John McGuire in Virginia. Good has also faced some criticism from allies of former President Donald Trump for endorsing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the 2024 presidential primary.\nGood's spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment, but the chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus is expected to face more opposition ahead of his June primary. Last month. Republican Main Street Partnership, a group backing centrist House Republicans, announced its super PAC would engage in the race to defeat Good, per the New York Times. The group has not yet started spending in the race.\nMace is facing attorney Catherine Templeton, who served in two positions in former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley's Cabinet. And this week, Templeton got a boost from another outside group.\nA super PAC tied to Winning for Women — a group that supports GOP women candidates and is made up of former Haley allies — launched a new TV ad Tuesday touting Templeton. The group, along with Haley, had previously backed Mace in her tough 2022 primary. But Mace ultimately endorsed Trump in the 2024 GOP presidential primary, earning the ire of Haley and her allies. Templeton also backed Trump in the race after initially supporting Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C.\n'We are proud to support principled leaders like Catherine Templeton who are interested in governing in a conservative and responsible manner,' Winning For Women Action Fund executive director Danielle Barrow said in a statement.\nBarrow went on to describe Templeton as 'the only consistent conservative in this race who Lowcountry voters can depend on and trust to secure our border, stop inflation, and truly do the people's work in Washington.'\nAnd this is likely just the beginning of the efforts to take on McCarthy's detractors.\n'More groups will get involved,' said the source familiar with these group's strategy. 'This isn't the end.'",

            "excerpt": "Jewish voters could play a major role in the big battleground state this fall. Before that, there's a key primary approaching Tuesday in Pittsburgh.",
            "summary": "PITTSBURGH — In the heart of one of America's most prominent historically Jewish neighborhoods, Dan and Baila Cohen keep the front entrance of their 70-year-old Judaica store locked during business hours.\nIt's not how they'd prefer it. But in light of Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack in Israel, Israel's ongoing military campaign in Gaza and tensions at home, they said, the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh told them they needed to be vigilant about who enters their business.\n'That's the reality of the world,' Dan Cohen said.\nIt's not the first time they've had to take additional safety precautions. The couple completed their purchase of Pinsker's Books and Judaica in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood in 2018 just days after a white supremacist gunned down 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue a few blocks away in the deadliest antisemitic attack in American history. But this time feels different.\n'Oct. 27 really unified' Squirrel Hill and Pittsburgh, Baila Cohen said of the Tree of Life massacre. 'Oct. 7 … really started polarizing the community itself, because that's when we started seeing much more of the infighting and conflicts.'\nConversations with more than 30 political strategists, activists and voters outlined how that tension has put Jewish voters in an unfamiliar spot ahead of the 2024 elections: on the front lines of the fight for control of the White House and Congress. Nowhere is that more apparent than in Pennsylvania, the swing state with the largest Jewish population — about 300,000 voting-age Jews in a state President Joe Biden won by roughly 80,000 votes in 2020.\nWhat's more, the congressional district that includes Squirrel Hill features a primary Tuesday that is among the first electoral tests of sentiment on both sides of the conflict in Gaza and concerns over rising antisemitism in the U.S. Democratic Rep. Summer Lee, a 'squad'-aligned progressive critical of Israel's handling of the war and one of the first lawmakers to call for a cease-fire last year, will face Bhavini Patel, an Edgewood Borough Council member who has painted Lee's advocacy as harmful to Biden's re-election chances and out of step with her district.\n'We have communities that are hurting. The Jewish community is one of them. And there are people who are … not going to agree 100% on everything that you say,' Lee said in an interview, adding she has been 'very clear and very upfront' about her cease-fire position. 'I have condemned Hamas. We've worked with the families of hostages; we've done everything that I think is necessary to do that. And at the end of the day, we disagree.'\nA dozen Jewish voters in the district who spoke to NBC News, whether supporting Lee or Patel, almost universally said their votes in November would be driven by issues beyond Israel, saying that the Jewish electorate isn't a 'monolith' and that democracy, abortion rights and the economy weighed heavily on them.\nMost Jewish voters in Squirrel Hill — and nationally — align with the Democratic Party. A Pew Research Center survey released this month found 69% of Jews leaning Democratic, while 29% aligned Republican.\nBut Republicans aren't looking for a massive defection. GOP strategists and Republicans involved in Jewish outreach expressed confidence that Democratic divisions over Israel will help move a small but potentially significant number of Jewish voters into their camp in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona. They pointed to surveys showing President Donald Trump's improved performance among Jews in 2020, compared with his 2016 race, as evidence of a slow shift that could continue.\n'Before Oct. 7, most candidates would say this issue is so messy. … It's not necessarily something that I want to focus on in my campaign,' said Tali deGroot, political director for the liberal Jewish group J Street. 'And I would have said, ‘Absolutely, this isn't a voting issue for people we poll year after year.' And it's too soon to tell if it's going to be a voting issue. But not talking about it is not an option.'‘Playing with fire' In Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, the war and its impact at home took center stage last week at a campaign event where Lee launched her 'Jews for Summer' coalition.\nLee talked about 'how our liberation is tied together,' whether 'in western Pennsylvania or the West Bank.' She spoke about how the district still needs 'deep healing' following both the Oct. 7 attack and the killing of Jews at Tree of Life. And she framed her primary as a covert Republican effort to divide a multiethnic, cross-religious support base by using splits over Israel.\n'There are people who have to convince you that the only reason why I could believe in peace is because I actually hate some of our neighbors, not because we love each other,' said Lee, who overcame significant spending by groups aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group, when she narrowly won her first congressional primary in 2022.\nIsrael didn't have the salience it does now. Lee has accused the Israeli government of committing 'war crimes,\" called for an end to unconditional military aid to the country and joined a handful of other progressives in mid-2022, before the Israel-Hamas war, who voted against a GOP-led resolution that said Israel wasn't 'a racist or apartheid state.' She has also condemned Hamas' attack and repeatedly spoken out against antisemitism.\nOn Saturday, she joined 36 Democrats and 21 Republicans in voting against an aid package to the country, which passed overwhelmingly. She and Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., were the only Pennsylvania members to vote against it.\nHer early call for a cease-fire is now largely in step with Democratic voters, but Jewish leaders have expressed unease with how Lee and some of her allies have discussed the issue. Last month, more than 40 Pittsburgh-area rabbis wrote in a letter, after an earlier meeting with Lee, that she has 'continued to use divisive rhetoric' that the group has at times 'perceived as openly antisemitic.'\nTheir letter didn't describe that rhetoric, but it said Lee opposed House measures to condemn antisemitism and criticized her calls for an 'unconditional cease-fire from one side,' which they said 'devalues the lives and beliefs of one group.' They also called on her to return campaign contributions 'from people who have voiced virulently antisemitic sentiments.' In February, Lee canceled an appearance before the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations amid backlash over other speakers' antisemitic and homophobic remarks, which she condemned.\nKaren Hochenberg, president of a local Democratic club that has endorsed Patel, said Lee has lost considerable support in the Jewish community, including hers. While Hochenberg aligns with Lee on many issues, she and others have been 'hurt' by some of her votes and actions, and she said she wished Lee had been more vocal about the Hamas attack.\n'Many Jews now are starting to question where are we on the road map of intersectionality,' Hochenberg said. 'Jews are starting to really take a look at how comfortable we are and if we're going to send candidates to Congress who's going to be there and have the voice of the Jewish community in mind, as well.'\nJeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgher leading a new Jewish voter group, said the pushback Lee faces isn't so much about Israel but about what he called an unwillingness to meet with constituents who don't share her views.\n'She finds the individuals who agree with her already who are anti-Zionist, who are extremist or fringe of the left of politics, and she will hold them up on a pedestal while spreading things' that, Kazzaz said, make local Jews 'less safe.'\nBut overall, Lee is looking stronger in her district now than in her first run, even to some opponents. AIPAC-linked groups aren't getting involved in her primary this time. Lee has framed her campaign around efforts to counter MAGA Republicans and bring federal dollars to the district.\nJonathan Mayo, a Squirrel Hill resident co-leading the Jews for Summer coalition, told NBC News he aligns with Lee's position on Israel but emphasized that he's not a single-issue voter.\n'It is so important to speak out and show that there are members of the Squirrel Hill Jewish community who still very much support Summer Lee,' he said.\nPatel, meanwhile, is framing her challenge to Lee around who offers Biden the most support, hitting Lee for not criticizing activists and groups calling for 'uncommitted' votes against the president in Tuesday's primary.\n'It's essentially playing with fire,' Patel said in an interview, arguing it could boost Trump.\nLee allies have countered that anti-Biden GOP megadonors support Patel's campaign. An outside group boosting Patel recently disclosed that it received an $800,000 donation from right-wing billionaire Jeffrey Yass. (Patel said she 'denounces' Yass, calling any focus on him a distraction.)\nLee has said she is supporting Biden in the fall. She's endorsed by congressional Democratic leadership and by Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has become arguably the most staunchly pro-Israel Democrat in Congress. And in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, Biden shouted out Lee as someone 'who had my back.'\n'We're going to make sure that the person who's sitting in the White House is not going to be replaced,' Lee said at her event on a recent Sunday.\nSeveral attendees said they were casting anti-Biden protest votes Tuesday. But most said they would support him this fall.\nOne of them, Harry Hochheiser, said Biden 'is the only legitimate choice' against Trump. He said the divisions opened up in the Jewish community over the war have been devastating.\n'I don't think any of us enjoy these divisions,' Hochheiser, a University of Pittsburgh professor and pro-Palestinian activist voting uncommitted in the primary but backing Biden against Trump, said of tensions in the Jewish community over Israel.\n‘More salient than it has been' The fight for Jewish votes in Pittsburgh is only part of a bigger landscape. Across Pennsylvania, Republican Dave McCormick has put Israel at the forefront of his campaign against Democratic Sen. Bob Casey. Nationally, groups in both parties are preparing for what they say could be the largest investment ever made to court the Jewish vote at the presidential level.\nBiden's handling of the war is the main flashpoint. Initially, he was more deferential to Israel. But as the death toll mounted in Gaza and left-wing blowback intensified at home, he has sharpened his criticism of Israeli leadership, pushed for increased humanitarian aid and ramped-up efforts to reach a cease-fire agreement. Still, he hasn't gone as far as his critics to his left would like.\nAs for whether Republicans can pick up voters disaffected by the Democratic divide over Israel, Mark Mellman, president of Democratic Majority for Israel, said it's 'mostly noise' but cautioned 'there is a serious chance' depending how the coming months play out.\nJewish voters have 'been extraordinarily appreciative of the support that President Biden and Democratic leaders have given Israel over the course of this conflict,' he said. 'I hear from some people that is beginning to change as people perceive some change in the positions of those Democratic leaders. But look … Biden has been extraordinary.'\nA 2021 Pew Research Center survey found a wide split in partisanship among Jewish voters depending on which movement they aligned with. Orthodox Jews favored Republicans over Democrats by 75% to 20%, while 70% of Conservative Jews and 80% of Reform Jews backed Democrats.\nSam Markstein, national political director at the Republican Jewish Coalition, said much of the Jewish vote is based in states where Republicans have no shot at all, contributing to the gulf in support between Republicans and Democrats. Pointing to an Associated Press VoteCast survey after the 2020 election that found Trump improved on his 2016 performance among Jewish voters, Markstein predicts the Republican Jewish Coalition will make its 'largest investment at the top of the ticket ever' this cycle to target Jewish voters in battlegrounds.\n'That's where you're going to see the most success this year,' he said.\nSome other surveys had more positive trends for Democrats. This month's Pew survey found the share of Jewish voters who align with Democrats has increased 8 points since 2020.\nDan Siegel, who led Jewish outreach for Biden's 2020 campaign, said Jewish voters' foremost concerns are similar to those of any other voting group: the economy, health care and education.\n'I do think [Israel] may be a little bit more top of mind. But I also think at the end of the day, elections are a binary choice,' Siegel said, predicting Jewish voters 'are going to want that strong, steady hand, not an authoritarian demagogue who is unwieldy at best in a crisis.'\nTrump, who strongly favored Israel as president, has offered limited commentary on the war. Speaking last month with Israel Hayom, an Israeli newspaper, Trump said, 'You have to finish up your war. You have to get it done. We have to get to peace. We can't have this going on.'\nBiden's campaign has zoomed in on recent comments Trump has made about Jewish voters; he said on Real America's Voice that 'any Jewish person who votes for Biden does not love Israel and, frankly, should be spoken to.'\nIn a statement, Karoline Leavitt, Trump's national press secretary, slammed Democrats for caving in 'to the demands of far-left Palestinian extremists.\"\nAsked about Trump's comments on the war, Markstein said he believed Trump 'was just giving voice to the frustration of … people [who] want this to be concluded, with Israel defeating Hamas and rescuing the hostages.' On Trump's remarks about Jewish voters, Markstein said Trump 'was just trying to say in a Trumpian way … why haven't they been more vocal in their opposition to what their own leaders of their party are doing?'\nBack in Pittsburgh, Kipp Dawson, a Jewish civil rights activist backing Lee, said she would be horrified by Trump's re-election and expressed hope that Lee would be able to bring skeptical Democrats back on board with Biden this fall.\n'My sense is that things are extraordinarily in flux in this country right now,' she said. 'The big issue for November is who's going to come out to vote.'\nAt Pinsker's, the Cohens declined to say whom they'd support in next week's primary or the general election, though they said a number of Jews in Squirrel Hill were eager to back Patel.\n'The Jewish community really feels that if they don't take the stand now, [U.S. support for Israel] is not going to be assured,' Baila Cohen said. 'Everyone's very interested in getting actively involved and being part of the political scene in a way that doesn't always play out.'\nAllan Smith Emma Barnett",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Senators will open the impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Wednesday afternoon, but it's expected to look nothing like the full-blown Senate trials Donald Trump faced in 2020 and 2021.\nSenate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, are expected to quickly move to dismiss or table the two impeachment articles, which would require only a simple majority vote. Meanwhile, Republicans want to drag out the process and make it as politically painful as possible for the other party.\nThere is no scenario in which Mayorkas will be convicted. None of the Senate's 51 Democrats have said they support impeachment, and even some moderate Republicans have expressed openness to tabling the articles after some debate, arguing that Mayorkas' conduct does not rise to the level of impeachment.\nSenate President Pro Tem Patty Murray, D-Wash., will preside over the trial. At 1 p.m. ET, she and the 99 other senators will be sworn in as jurors. Both sides were working Tuesday to come to an agreement on a process that could include time for limited debate and votes on Republican-led motions, a Senate source said. But unlike in the Trump trials, which both took longer than two weeks, Democrats could finish the Mayorkas trial as early as Wednesday evening.\n'What I hope happens is that there will be an opportunity at least for some discussion once we are sworn in, and how long that is and what that entails is yet to be determined, but I would rather not go straight from swearing everybody in to, boom, we're going to move to table,' said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who is skeptical of the impeachment push.\n'At a bare minimum you have to have some process here,' she said, 'and if you just move to table ... you're not only putting the Republicans in a challenging spot, but you're setting the precedent that this is what we're going to do with every future impeachment. Do we really want to do that?'\nTuesday, the 11 House GOP impeachment managers, or prosecutors, walked across the Capitol to the Senate chamber and hand-delivered the two articles, accusing Mayorkas of failing to enforce immigration laws and secure the border, as well as lying to Congress under oath, including by saying the U.S. border with Mexico is 'secure.'\nAfter they read the articles on the Senate floor, the managers joined conservative senators at a news conference where they demanded a full trial and said a motion to quickly dispense with the articles would be unprecedented.\nBut Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who has led the GOP push for a full trial, said it would be 'acceptable' if the Senate referred the articles to a special impeachment committee.\n'Look, I know a number of us would prefer to have a full trial on the floor, but both are acceptable,' Lee told reporters, adding that a select committee 'conducts a trial and then, after it completes its work, the matter falls back to us' in the full Senate.\n'Either one would be acceptable,\" he said.\nScott Wong Frank Thorp V",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The policy contrasts between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are sharpening as the general election campaign gets fully underway.\nBut what does the choice represent for ordinary voters and the economic and cultural issues they care about? A rematch between the Democratic incumbent and his Republican predecessor may feel uninspiring to many voters, but the policy stakes are enormous for tens of millions of Americans — and the world.\nHere are seven big issues at stake in the 2024 election.\nAbortion The contrast: Biden favors federal abortion protections; Trump opposes them. Trump supported nationwide restrictions on abortion as president but now downplays the need for a federal ban, as Republicans are divided over the issue. Biden does not support federal limits.\nThe contrast: Biden favors federal abortion protections; Trump opposes them. Trump supported nationwide restrictions on abortion as president but now downplays the need for a federal ban, as Republicans are divided over the issue. Biden does not support federal limits. Biden has championed the Women's Health Protection Act, a bill to protect abortion rights in all 50 states under federal law and prohibit medically unnecessary hurdles to accessing the procedure. He has asked voters to send him a Democratic Congress that supports legal abortion to achieve that.\nTrump has boasted that he \"broke Roe v. Wade\" by picking three of the five Supreme Court justices who overturned it, delivering on a four-decade goal of the GOP. More recently, Trump has openly fretted that the backlash may cost him and his party the election. Last week, Trump said the issue should be left to states, a shift from his support for nationwide restrictions when he was president. His new stance has drawn pushback from GOP allies, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and anti-abortion-rights advocates, who say that he is wrong and that Republicans should not be deterred from their long-standing goal of enacting some nationwide abortion limits.\nSome Republicans downplay the prospects of federal abortion restrictions' passing Congress, even if they win full control. Biden and his allies are telling voters to look at the GOP's long history of championing federal restrictions and not their recent rhetoric.\nImmigration The contrast: Trump has promised a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration and tougher executive actions; Biden is asking Congress to give him more tools to manage an overwhelmed border and create new legal pathways to immigrate to the U.S.\nThe contrast: Trump has promised a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration and tougher executive actions; Biden is asking Congress to give him more tools to manage an overwhelmed border and create new legal pathways to immigrate to the U.S. Trump has called existing border laws an existential threat to the U.S., saying migrants are 'poisoning the blood of our country' and bringing new 'languages.' His campaign website says: 'President Trump will shut down Biden's border disaster. He will again end catch-and-release, restore Remain in Mexico, and eliminate asylum fraud. In cooperative states, President Trump will deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement to assist with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals.'\nAfter having rescinded some of Trump's policies, Biden has recently shifted to support stricter immigration laws as the system remains overwhelmed. He championed a bipartisan bill to raise the bar for gaining asylum, grant more U.S. resources to process asylum claims and turn away migrants who do not qualify, and empower the president to temporarily shut down the border if migration levels hit certain triggers. (Republicans blocked the bill in the Senate amid lobbying by Trump, who wants to use the border as an election issue.) Biden has also endorsed the U.S. Citizenship Act, which would grant a pathway to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally if they pass background checks and pay their taxes.\nFundamentally, Trump has aligned with forces who want less immigration into the country, while Biden has embraced the belief that immigrants make the U.S. better.\nHealth care and prescription drugs The contrast: Biden wants to extend Affordable Care Act provisions and empower Medicare to negotiate more prescription drugs; Trump has aggressively criticized the ACA but not offered a health care plan.\nThe contrast: Biden wants to extend Affordable Care Act provisions and empower Medicare to negotiate more prescription drugs; Trump has aggressively criticized the ACA but not offered a health care plan. Biden, who was vice president when the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, sees it as a cherished achievement to protect and strengthen. The law, also known as \"Obamacare,\" which has extended coverage to 45 million people through subsidies, insurance mandates and a Medicaid expansion, continues to face conservative opposition.\nSeparately, Biden has touted a provision in his party-line Inflation Reduction Act that empowers Medicare to negotiate lower prices for 10 prescription drugs. He said he wants to boost that to 50 if he is re-elected, with the goal of $200 billion in savings.\nTrump spent his four years as president fighting unsuccessfully to repeal and unravel the law — through legislation and executive action and endorsing lawsuits to wipe it out. In November, Trump called for revisiting plans to \"terminate\" the ACA. He has recently sought to downplay that and insists he only wants to improve the law. But he has not offered a health care plan. Many of his GOP allies in Congress still favor repealing or undoing the ACA, including a budget by the Republican Study Committee, which boasts about 80% of the House GOP conference as members, including Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana.\nTaxes The contrast: Trump's 2017 tax cuts expire at the end of next year, and he has called for extending them; Biden has called for raising taxes on families earning over $400,000 to fund various priorities.\nThe contrast: Trump's 2017 tax cuts expire at the end of next year, and he has called for extending them; Biden has called for raising taxes on families earning over $400,000 to fund various priorities. A series of Trump tax cuts, which Republicans passed on a party-line basis in 2017, expire at the end of 2025. Congress and the winner of the election will decide what happens to them.\nIn a recent private speech to wealthy donors, Trump said his policies include \"extending the Trump tax cuts\" if he is elected, according to a Trump campaign official. That would preserve lower rates across the income spectrum, with the biggest benefits for top earners.\nBiden has attacked that law as a giveaway to the wealthiest Americans, vowing to make \"big corporations and the very wealthy finally pay their fair share.\" He has backed a corporate tax rate hike from 21% to 28% and said that \"nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny in federal taxes.\" Biden is also calling for a $3,600-per-child tax cut for families, an $800 average tax break for \"front-line workers\" and a 25% minimum tax on billionaires, according to a newly released campaign plank.\nThe expiration of the Trump tax cuts will restore the unlimited federal deduction for state and local taxes, which Republicans had capped at $10,000 in the 2017 law. Republicans broadly support preserving the cap, with some exceptions, while most Democrats want to lift it.\nJudges and the Supreme Court The contrast: Their track records tell a clear story. Trump has picked young conservative judges to serve on the federal bench, while Biden has picked liberals with a focus on professional and personal diversity.\nThe contrast: Their track records tell a clear story. Trump has picked young conservative judges to serve on the federal bench, while Biden has picked liberals with a focus on professional and personal diversity. One of the clearest contrasts is what kinds of judges Trump and Biden would pick for lifetime appointments on the federal courts. A simple way for voters to think about it is whether they prefer new judges with the conservative views of Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump's first Supreme Court pick, or with the liberal views of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, Biden's (so far only) high court pick.\nAs president, Trump nominated young conservative judges who will serve for generations. Biden has focused on finding judges with diverse backgrounds and résumés, including more civil rights lawyers and public defenders.\nPerhaps the biggest question is whether a Supreme Court vacancy will open up in the next four years. The presidential election winner and the party that controls the Senate would fill it.\nTrade The contrast: Trump is pushing a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports; Biden's White House opposes that, saying it would raise inflation.\nThe contrast: Trump is pushing a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports; Biden's White House opposes that, saying it would raise inflation. Trump, long a skeptic of U.S. trade deals, has proposed to impose a 10% tariff on all imported goods if he returns to the White House. He recently told Fox News that it could be 60% — or potentially 'more than that' — on imports of Chinese goods.\nBiden opposes that idea. In a memo over the weekend, the White House slammed the idea of \"across-the-board tariffs that would raise taxes and prices by $1,500 per American family,\" without naming Trump; it referred to an estimate by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, that Trump's 10% tax on imports could cost an average American household $1,500 per year.\nBiden, instead, has sought to boost domestic manufacturing with major federal investments in semiconductors and electric vehicles.\nForeign policy and NATO The contrast: Biden favors Ukraine aid, while Trump is skeptical of it; Biden supports NATO and a traditional view of American power, while Trump has criticized NATO and voiced some isolationist views.\nThe contrast: Biden favors Ukraine aid, while Trump is skeptical of it; Biden supports NATO and a traditional view of American power, while Trump has criticized NATO and voiced some isolationist views. The clearest example of the foreign policy differences between the two concerns the fate of Ukraine, which is running low on ammunition and says it needs U.S. assistance to continue holding off Russia's aggression. Biden is an ardent proponent of helping Ukraine, while Trump has poured cold water on U.S. aid to Ukraine and successfully pressured House Republicans to block it since they took the majority in January 2023.\nAnd that points to a deeper divide: Biden is an outspoken supporter of the NATO alliance as a bulwark against adversaries like Russia and China and of preserving the post-World War II order. Trump has dialed up his criticisms of NATO and aligned with a growing isolationist wing in the U.S. that wants to be less involved in global affairs. Trump recently said that as president, he 'would encourage' Russia 'to do whatever the hell they want' to member countries who are 'delinquent' in their dues.\nSahil Kapur",

            "excerpt": "The new rule makes 'crystal clear that everyone can access schools that are safe, welcoming and that respect their rights,' Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said.",
            "summary": "The rights of LGBTQ students will be protected by federal law and victims of campus sexual assault will gain new safeguards under rules finalized Friday by the Biden administration.\nThe new provisions are part of a revised Title IX regulation issued by the Education Department, fulfilling a campaign pledge by President Joe Biden. He had promised to dismantle rules created by former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who added new protections for students accused of sexual misconduct.\nNotably absent from Biden's policy, however, is any mention of transgender athletes.\nThe administration originally planned to include a new policy forbidding schools from enacting outright bans on transgender athletes, but that provision was put on hold. The delay is widely seen as a political maneuver during an election year in which Republicans have rallied around bans on transgender athletes in girls' sports.\nInstead, Biden is officially undoing sexual assault rules put in place by his predecessor and current election-year opponent, former President Donald Trump. The final policy drew praise from victims' advocates, while Republicans said it erodes the rights of accused students.\nThe new rule makes 'crystal clear that everyone can access schools that are safe, welcoming and that respect their rights,' Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said.\n'No one should face bullying or discrimination just because of who they are, who they love,' Cardona told reporters. 'Sadly, this happens all too often.'\nBiden's regulation is meant to clarify schools' obligations under Title IX, the 1972 women's rights law that outlaws discrimination based on sex in education. It applies to colleges and elementary and high schools that receive federal money. The update is to take effect in August.\nAmong the biggest changes is new recognition that Title IX protects LGBTQ students — a source of deep conflict with Republicans.\nThe 1972 law doesn't directly address the issue, but the new rules clarify that Title IX also forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. LGBTQ students who face discrimination will be entitled to a response from their school under Title IX, and those failed by their schools can seek recourse from the federal government.\nMany Republicans say Congress never intended such protections under Title IX. A federal judge previously blocked Biden administration guidance to the same effect after 20 Republican-led states challenged the policy.\nRep. Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina and chair of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, said the new regulation threatens decades of advancement for women and girls.\n'This final rule dumps kerosene on the already raging fire that is Democrats' contemptuous culture war that aims to radically redefine sex and gender,' Foxx said in a statement.\nThe revision was proposed nearly two years ago but has been slowed by a comment period that drew 240,000 responses, a record for the Education Department.\nMany of the changes are meant to ensure that schools and colleges respond to complaints of sexual misconduct. In general, the rules widen the type of misconduct that institutions are required to address, and it grants more protections to students who bring accusations.\nChief among the changes is a wider definition of sexual harassment. Schools now must address any unwelcome sex-based conduct that is so 'severe or pervasive' that it limits a student's equal access to an education.\nUnder the DeVos rules, conduct had to be 'severe, pervasive and objectively offensive,' a higher bar that pushed some types of misconduct outside the purview of Title IX.\nColleges will no longer be required to hold live hearings to allow students to cross-examine one another through representatives — a signature provision from the DeVos rules.\nLive hearings are allowed under the Biden rules, but they're optional and carry new limits. Students must be able to participate from hearings remotely, for example, and schools must bar questions that are 'unclear or harassing.'\nAs an alternative to live hearings, college officials can interview students separately, allowing each student to suggest questions and get a recording of the responses.\nThose hearings were a major point of contention with victims' advocates, who said it forced sexual assault survivors to face their attackers and discouraged people from reporting assaults. Supporters said it gave accused students a fair process to question their accusers, arguing that universities had become too quick to rule against accused students.\nVictims' advocates applauded the changes and urged colleges to implement them quickly.\n'After years of pressure from students and survivors of sexual violence, the Biden Administration's Title IX update will make schools safer and more accessible for young people, many of whom experienced irreparable harm while they fought for protection and support,' said Emma Grasso Levine, a senior manager at the group Know Your IX.\nDespite the focus on safeguards for victims, the new rules preserve certain protections for accused students.\nAll students must have equal access to present evidence and witnesses under the new policy, and all students must have equal access to evidence. All students will be allowed to bring an advisor to campus hearings, and colleges must have an appeals process.\nIn general, accused students won't be able to be disciplined until after they're found responsible for misconduct, although the regulation allows for 'emergency' removals if it's deemed a matter of campus safety.\nThe latest overhaul continues a back-and-forth political battle as presidential administrations repeatedly rewrite the rules around campus sexual misconduct.\nThe DeVos rules were themselves an overhaul of an Obama-era policy that was intended to force colleges to take accusations of campus sexual assault more seriously. Now, after years of nearly constant changes, some colleges have been pushing for a political middle ground to end the whiplash.\nThe Associated Press",

            "summary": "Last July, a town hall attendee in Salem, New Hampshire, asked Sen. Tim Scott if he 'believed he could swing the historically Democratic-supporting African American community.' Scott's response was guarded.\n'Maybe,' the then-presidential candidate replied. 'I'm a fairly conservative candidate. That does not necessarily bode well for my ability to persuade die-hard Democrats, Black or white or any other color.'\nBut now, with Scott in the middle of speculation about former President Donald Trump's pick for a 2024 running mate, the South Carolina senator is leaning into his ability to engage with the growing number of Black voters that polling data suggest are open to voting for Trump in this election.\nScott has launched a weekly series, 'America's Starting Five,' with other Black Republicans in Congress, in a bid both to make Black conservatives more visible and to reach Black voters. The series, which will discuss ' politics, race, and the 2024 election' and which Scott hopes to continue at least through the summer, is also a vehicle for him to lean into a skill set that could be an asset for Trump: his perceived ability to expand the party's tent.\n' politics, race, and the 2024 election' and which Scott hopes to continue at least through the summer, is also a vehicle for him to lean into a skill set that could be an asset for Trump: his perceived ability to expand the party's tent. 'Sen. Scott recognizes that he can draw people into the party, particularly Black men,' said a source familiar with the planning of the series. 'This is an effort to highlight that.'\nA composite analysis of NBC polling data from 2023 found that among Black voters, men under 50 years old gave by far the lowest ratings to President Joe Biden — and the highest ones to Trump, though a majority still viewed Trump negatively.\nStill, almost 40% of those voters said they'd vote for Trump over Biden in a general election, compared to no more than 15% in any of the other age and gender categories among Black voters, a split well outside the margin of error for those subgroups.\nThat's largely what's behind other recent surveys showing Trump garnering more support from Black voters than ever, cutting into Biden by double digits compared to the 2020 results, even though the president still leads among Black voters.\nA shift in tone Scott's willingness to focus on his race is a departure from the early days of his presidential campaign, when he was at times hesitant to lean too deeply into his identity, even as supporters encouraged him to highlight a factor they believed made him the most electable 2024 presidential candidate on the GOP side.\n'Here are four non-Black, Black people,' Scott said while leading a roundtable discussion alongside four other prominent Black Republicans in the first episode of his new series: Reps. Burgess Owens of Utah, Byron Donalds of Florida, John James of Michigan and Wesley Hunt of Texas.\nThe panelists were taking their turns dissecting a past misstep by Biden, and the focus of the group had turned to a 2020 interview he did with radio host Charlamagne tha God, during which Biden suggested that Black Americans who don't vote for him 'ain't really Black.'\n'The good news is in 2024, it looks like four out of 10 of us ain't Black enough for Joe Biden,' Scott continued.\nAs Scott's presidential campaign went on last year before he dropped out in November, his tune began to shift. He became more vocal not only about his appeal to the small but growing number of Black conservatives nationwide, but also how he was uniquely positioned to help the party make more inroads with voters of color, as arguably the most prominent Black Republican elected official in the country.\n'I believe that I create a red wave where we win back the Senate, we expand our majority in the House, and you do that by having the kind of candidate who — the literal truth of my life — destroys the lies of the radical left and creates a red wave,' Scott said at one of his final campaign stops in October.\nThat 'red wave,' in his view, would be fueled in part by his life story: A Black man from South Carolina, raised by a single mother in a low-income neighborhood, who went from 'cotton to Congress' in a single generation, as he often riffed during his events.\n'I have lived a similar experience to people who find themselves trapped in poverty, who are today growing up in single parent households, who are wondering whether the American dream can work for them,' Scott said.\nA valuable surrogate Trump seems aware of Scott's potential and has certainly worked to keep his former primary opponent close.\nIn addition to appearing alongside Trump at several campaign rallies in the waning days of the Republican primary, Scott was invited by Trump to attend and speak at his Mar-a-Lago fundraiser last week, which the campaign said netted $50 million across groups including Trump's main super PAC and other fundraising committees.\nA day before the South Carolina Republican primary, Scott accompanied Trump to the Black Conservative Federation's annual gala, where Trump was the recipient of the 'Champion of Black America' award. Scott was the only former Trump rival to appear at the event.\nAnd Trump has repeatedly said that Scott is better at campaigning on his behalf than he was campaigning for himself.\nThe Biden-Harris campaign appears skeptical that Scott — or whoever Trump ultimately selects as a running mate — will be successful in recruiting more Black voters to the Republican Party.\n'Regardless of who Donald Trump's running mate is, these are the facts: While he was president, Black unemployment and uninsured rates spiked, his encouragement of white nationalism divided the nation, and his botched Covid-19 response disproportionately left Black people dead,' said Jasmine Harris, the Biden campaign's Black media director. 'Black voters remain some of the most informed and engaged voters every election, and this November they will get behind Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who put Black Americans at the forefront of their administration's work.'\nNnamdi Egwuonwu",

Mike Johnson faces his most perilous moment yet as House speaker By Sahil Kapur House Speaker Mike Johnson faces the biggest threat to his gavel nearly six months into the job, with the walls closing in from both sides of his divided Republican Party on providing aid to U.S. allies.\nAfter wavering for months and exhausting his timeouts, he's finally calling the play: a trigger for separate votes on four bills — assistance for Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and a hodgepodge of other national security priorities important to Republicans.\nEach one will have a unique coalition, and that's the point.\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know In theory, Israel aid can pass with mostly Republicans, over progressive opposition. Ukraine aid — structured as a loan — can pass with mostly Democrats, over conservative opposition. The GOP opponents of assisting Ukraine can vote against it, and the GOP proponents of giving the country weapons to fend off Russian aggression finally get off Johnson's back.\nMeanwhile, Johnson's public Republican opposition just doubled: Rep. Thomas Massie announced Tuesday that he would co-sponsor Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to remove him as speaker. Massie said he's 'pretty certain' Johnson has more GOP opponents today than the eight who ousted Kevin McCarthy as speaker in October, though he didn't name names.\n'Mike Johnson is going for the Triple Crown here against our base. He has voted for an omnibus that spends more than Pelosi. He's put his finger on the scales to pass FISA without warrants. And now he's about to do Ukraine without protecting our own border,' Massie said. 'This will get called and he will lose the vote.'\nTwo votes may not seem like much, but after this Friday, Johnson will have a staggering one-vote majority. Two defections and Johnson loses — unless Democrats step in to rescue him and vote against a motion to vacate. That would be extremely unusual, but some centrist Democrats say they'd do it, especially if Johnson brings up Ukraine aid.\n'He's got to manage his politics. And if they try and kick him out as speaker, I'm going to vote to keep him,' said Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y.\nMassie said a Democratic rescue would ultimately do more harm than good to Johnson.\n'Then he goes further in the hole with Republicans,' Massie said. 'He becomes toxic to the conference. For every Democrat who comes to his aid he'll lose 2-3 more Republicans. … There's no sustainable solution where Democrats save him.'\nAnd that sums up Johnson's dilemma: He can't govern with his far-right rebels, but he can't hold on to his job without them. The same dynamic became too much for McCarthy to navigate. Today, Johnson has an even slimmer majority.\nStill, he recognizes that he can't be cowed by such threats or he becomes fully captured by the agitators. And this could be the last major piece of business until the 2024 election, when voters will redetermine the makeup of Congress.\n'I am not resigning. And it is in my view an absurd notion that someone would bring a vacate motion when we are simply here trying to do our jobs,' Johnson told reporters. 'I am not concerned about this. I am going to do my job.'\nFirst jurors are seated in Trump's hush money trial Donald Trump during jury selection on the second day of his trial at Manhattan Criminal Court on Tuesday. Curtis Means / Getty Images pool By Adam Reiss, Dareh Gregorian, Jonathan Allen and Lisa Rubin The first seven jurors were selected Tuesday in Trump's hush money trial amid a battle over prospective jurors' old Facebook posts and calls to 'lock him up' and a warning from the judge that the former president should not try to intimidate the panelists who will be deciding his fate.\n'I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom. I want to make this crystal clear,' Judge Juan Merchan told Trump and his lawyer Todd Blanche. The judge told Blanche that Trump had 'audibly' said something in the direction of a juror while she was '12 feet away from your client.'\nMerchan said he didn't know what Trump said, but that he'd been 'muttering' and 'gesturing' at the juror, and directed Blanche to talk to his client about his behavior. Blanche then whispered something into Trump's ear.\nThe incident underscores Trump's penchant for acting up in court and the problems his lawyers might have keeping him in check.\nThe drama came on the second day of jury selection. The jury is anonymous so their names weren't used in open court, but the panelists include a salesman, an oncology nurse, an IT consultant, a teacher and a software engineer.\nOverall, the quest to find a jury of 12 people and six alternates who could be 'fair and impartial' when it comes to the polarizing New York native and former commander-in-chief moved at a brisker pace compared to Monday.\nThe trial doesn't sit on Wednesdays, so the process will resume on Thursday.\nRead more on the second day of the Trump trial here →\nTrump needs a different type of swing voter in Manhattan Analysis by Steve Kornacki Trump's legal team argues that the former president faces 'real potential prejudice' in his hush money trial because of its venue: Manhattan, the bluest borough in one of the bluest big cities in America.\nWhether this could actually have any bearing on the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's ability to receive a fair trial is a matter of debate. But simply in terms of its political leanings, Manhattan's partisan bent is stark.\nAs a whole, New York City backed Joe Biden over Trump by a 76-23% margin in 2020. But of the five boroughs that comprise the Big Apple, it was Manhattan that produced Biden's most lopsided margins:\nEach of these boroughs features its own particular demographic and political mix. The lone red redoubt of Staten Island, for instance, has by far the smallest population and is more suburban in character, with considerable local support for secession from the rest of the city.\nThe other four boroughs are densely populated Democratic bastions. But even among these four, Manhattan stands out. Why is it a shade or two bluer than the others? A comparison of its demographics to those of the city as a whole reveals an explanation:\nSimply put, compared to New York City overall, Manhattan is whiter and wealthier and contains a much deeper concentration of white residents with college degrees. That's a demographic mix that, especially in the Trump era, has been political gold for Democrats.\nRegistered voters in Manhattan (one of the sources from which potential jurors are drawn) are more than 10 times more likely to be Democrats (72%) than Republicans (7%). Political engagement runs higher in Manhattan as well: While it accounts for 19.2% of the city's population, it represented 22.9% of all New York City votes cast in 2020.\nThe combination of its size, turnout level and partisan tendencies makes Manhattan one of the biggest single sources of Democratic votes anywhere in the country. To put this in perspective, the 603,040 votes Biden received in Manhattan in 2020 was larger than his total in 20 states.\nWhen it comes to his legal fate in Manhattan, Trump is going to need a very different kind of swing voter.\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump's campaign operation is requesting that any down-ballot candidates or Republican groups who use Trump's name, image or likeness in fundraising asks give a portion of the funds raised to Trump's main fundraising committee.\nAccording to a memo obtained by NBC News from a source who received it, Trump's co-campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita requested a split of \" a minimum of 5% of all fundraising solicitations to Trump National Committee JFC. This includes but is not limited to sending to the house file, prospecting vendors, and advertising.\"\n\"a minimum of 5% of all fundraising solicitations to Trump National Committee JFC. This includes but is not limited to sending to the house file, prospecting vendors, and advertising.\" The memo adds, \"Any split that is higher than 5% will be seen favorably by the RNC and President Trump's campaign and is routinely reported to the highest levels of leadership within both organizations.\"\nThe letter was sent on Monday and asked candidates and committees to adhere by the guidelines beginning Tuesday. Politico was first to report on the memo.\nBeyond the directive about splitting fundraising when using Trump's name, image and likeness to raise money, LaCivita and Wiles issued several additional guidelines for campaigns and committees using Trump for their own ends.\nThey forbid campaigns from \"speaking on behalf of President Trump ... questioning the readers' support of President Trump or tying their support to a financial contribution ... creating new memberships, clubs or rewards that are not authorized by the campaign ... impersonating President Trump or his campaign,\" and more.\ncampaigns from \"speaking on behalf of President Trump ... questioning the readers' support of President Trump or tying their support to a financial contribution ... creating new memberships, clubs or rewards that are not authorized by the campaign ... impersonating President Trump or his campaign,\" and more. Trump advisers have long sparred with groups raising money off his name without authorization, as other figures on the right sought to capitalize on the former president's appeal to small-dollar donors.\nThe memo comes as Trump's campaign and the RNC have trailed President Joe Biden's reelection campaign and the Democratic National Committee in fundraising.\nThe Trump campaign warned that digital vendors who disobey the directives in the menu will face consequences, including getting cut off from party business.\n\"Repeated violations will result in the suspension of business relationships between the vendor and Trump National Committee JFC. This includes list rental agreements,\" the memo reads. \"As the top Republican digital vendors, we ask that you inform your clients of these new guidelines, and to use your best judgment when mentioning President Trump.\"\nAlexandra Marquez",

            "excerpt": "84% of AAPI adults agree climate change exists, compared to 74% of the general U.S. population, new research says.",
            "summary": "Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in the United States are more likely than the overall adult population to believe in human-caused climate change, according to a new poll. It also suggests that partisanship may not have as much of an impact on this group's environmental views, compared to Americans overall.\nA recent poll from AAPI Data and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds 84% of AAPI adults agree climate change exists. In comparison, 74% of U.S. adults hold the same sentiment. And three-quarters of AAPI adults who accept climate change is real attribute it entirely or mostly to human activity. Among the general U.S. adult population surveyed in an AP-NORC poll in September, only 61% say humans are causing it.\nThe poll is part of an ongoing project exploring the views of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, whose views can usually not be highlighted in other surveys because of small sample sizes and lack of linguistic representation.\nScientists overwhelmingly agree that heat-trapping gases released from the combustion of fossil fuels are pushing up global temperatures, upending weather patterns and endangering animal species. Many scientific organizations have made public statements on the issue.\nIn terms of partisanship, the percentage of AAPI Democrats, 84%, who acknowledge climate change falls exactly in line with the share of Democrats overall in the September poll. The share of AAPI Republicans who believe there is a climate crisis is lower, but they somewhat outnumber Republicans in general, 68% versus 49%.\nAdrian Wong, 26, of Whippany, New Jersey, is registered as unaffiliated but leans Republican. A biology major in college, the Chinese American says the science behind climate change is indisputable.\n'I've probably done more or looked more into it than the average person has,' Wong said. 'It's to me clear that it's changing due to human activity, not natural shifts.'\nThere has been growing conflict within the Republican Party between those who insist climate change is a progressive-generated hoax and those — mostly younger generations — who say the issue cannot be ignored. GOP lawmakers, in general, refuse to consider measures like mandated lowering of carbon emissions. However, some consider that an untenable position long-term. American Conservation Coalition, the largest conservative environmental group in the nation, has said Republicans running for office cannot risk alienating people who care about climate change.\nWong is not surprised that AAPI conservatives like himself recognize that the climate is changing. He thinks they are more highly educated and more likely to be exposed to science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n'It wouldn't surprise me if they were more likely to have studied more and actually more likely to have studied in science and STEM-related fields rather than, say like, finance or something,' Wong said.\nWhile climate change is an afterthought to her parents, Analisa Harangozo, 35, of Alameda, California, worries a great deal about it. She has noticed a rise in 'crazy heatwaves and droughts and just like crazy weather in general' in the San Francisco Bay Area. She and her husband are teaching their sons — ages 7 and 4 — to take small steps to reduce their carbon footprint like composting, growing food and eating less meat. They're also trying to minimize their accumulation of household items.\n'I always second-guess myself, ‘Do I really need this?'' Harangozo said. 'Stuff will eventually end up in the landfill. So, we're really mindful with the products we buy, and whether or not they can be recycled or they're made from materials that are natural, like wood or what-not.'\nA registered independent with Democratic leanings, Harangozo is open to proposals from California Gov. Gavin Newsom and other state lawmakers to slash greenhouse gas emissions and invest in renewable energy.\n'I'm not knowledgeable enough to know what an attainable goal is,' she said. 'But, whatever it takes to actually make a difference, I'm all for it. I fully support.'\nKarthick Ramakrishnan, a public policy professor at the University of California, Riverside, and founder of AAPI Data, said the richness and detail of the data shows environmental groups need to consider reaching out to AAPI populations. They make up a relatively small share of the U.S. population — around 7%, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of 2021 census data — but their numbers are growing quickly.\n'Asian American and Pacific Islander voters are environmental voters,' Ramakrishnan said. 'Many of us still have an image in our minds of a particular kind of person maybe of a particular race, gender or age group. What we see here is across the board Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders care about the environment.'\nAsian American and Pacific Islanders may also have more of a stake in climate change because of connections to relatives abroad. China, considered one of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases alongside the U.S., vowed last year to reduce emissions. More Chinese companies are considering selling wind and solar power equipment in other countries. Around this time last year, Japan was preparing for another sweltering summer and risks of floods and landslides. That country has also pledged to curb emissions.\nHeavy rains swept across Pakistan last month, causing landslides and leaving over 36 people dead and dozens of others injured. In 2022, unprecedented rainfall and flooding in that country killed more than 1,700. In India, farmers are grappling with frequent cyclones and extreme heat. In southern India, the city of Bengaluru is seeing water levels running desperately low after an unusually hot February and March.\n'There's a fairly high level concern of what climate change means to low-income countries,' Ramakrishnan said. 'That sensitivity is either because people still have friends or family back in their home country or at least have some concern about what climate change does to other countries.'",

            "excerpt": "The senator has outrun other members of her party in rural areas before. This November, she'll have to manage being on a ballot with Donald Trump.",
            "summary": "REEDSBURG, Wis. — In rural Wisconsin, dairy farmer Randy Roecker is at a breaking point — and he blames it partly on President Joe Biden, so is planning to vote for Donald Trump for a third time this November.\n'Farmers are hurting like you wouldn't believe, and I myself, I am to the point of throwing up my hands and saying I'm done,' said Roecker, who owns and operates Roecker's Rolling Acres in Loganville and cited inflation as straining his business for the last two years.\nBut while he's planning to vote on booting the Democratic president, Roecker's also planning to vote to keep his Democratic senator, Tammy Baldwin.\n'I support her all the way. I mean, no question,' Roecker said. 'And everybody I know — the farmers — everybody says that she's great for Wisconsin agriculture.'\nBaldwin is bracing for a tough re-election race against likely Republican nominee Eric Hovde, a multimillionaire and bank owner who loaned $8 million of his own money to his campaign in the first quarter of the year, according to FEC filings. But she has the advantage of incumbency, and has used it to often outperform other statewide Democrats in rural counties, even as the party as a whole has lost significant ground in rural America in recent decades.\nBaldwin is already pouring more effort into rural campaigning this year as she prepares for the challenge of sharing the ballot with one of the forces driving GOP margins in rural areas sky-high. Unlike her first two races for the Senate, in 2012 and 2018, Donald Trump will be running this November, too.\n'In Wisconsin, in rural America, I think a lot of people vote straight-ticket, either Republican or Democrat,' said Roecker, who sits on the board of directors for the National Dairy Board, Foremost Farms USA and Dairy Management Inc. 'And, you know, like I said, I don't know how many people go down through there like I do and check her separate.'\nRoecker said he didn't know much about Baldwin's Republican opponent, but Hovde's campaign said it plans to work across the state to tell voters that Baldwin is a 'rubber stamp for the Biden administration.' A new Marquette University Law School poll out Wednesday showed Baldwin running a single point ahead of Biden among likely voters and 3 points ahead of the president among registered voters. The likely voter results showed Baldwin and Hovde tied, while she had a small lead among registered voters.\n'When Tammy Baldwin's in Washington ... she's voting like a Washington Democrat,' said Ben Voelkel, senior adviser for the Hovde campaign. 'And she's not, you know, the same person that goes around and campaigns and shows up, you know, every fifth year to campaign.'\nWisconsin Democrats' rural campaign push Late last month, Baldwin sat around a kitchen table with Roecker and others from the Farmer Angel Network for a 90-minute discussion about farmers' mental health. The event was part of the senator's 'Dairyland' tour through 19 counties, none of them among Wisconsin's five most populated counties.\n'I think that there has been a real opportunity for me to be a champion for issues that I might not hear about if I only was going to the population centers of the state,' Baldwin told reporters at a stop at the New Glarus Brewing Co.\nThe 'Dairyland' tour is one example of a concerted effort by Wisconsin Democrats to court the rural voters who have increasingly rejected the party over the last few elections — as Wisconsin will again play a huge role in determining which party wins the White House and controls Congress. Ben Wikler, chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, calls rural voters 'essential to the Biden coalition' in 2024.\n'There's no path to victory without organizing in rural Wisconsin and across the country, as well as suburbs, cities and small towns and big towns,' he said. 'In a state like Wisconsin, where four of the last six presidential elections came down to 1 percentage point, you can't write anyone off or take anyone for granted.'\nWisconsin GOP Chair Brian Schimming calls the Democrats' efforts in rural Wisconsin a 'fool's errand' and says the Republican Party plans to focus on the economy as a 'constant reminder of the failure of the [Biden] administration' when making its case to rural Wisconsin voters.\n'You don't talk your way out of that,' Schimming said, speaking about the current economic situation. 'I mean, you can talk till you're blue in the face, but when people leave your talk or turn off your television ad or put down their smartphone, and then pull into a convenience store and pay, you know, a dollar and a quarter more than they're paying for gas four years ago, they get it.'\nDemocrats have an uphill battle in the state's rural areas, as their statewide victories have increasingly relied on wider margins in the state's most densely populated metro areas.\n'They have lost huge swaths of the rural/outstate vote in this state, and they are not going to get them back by running Tammy Baldwin around. They're just not,' Schimming said. 'And it's a problem endemic for the whole party out there.'\nChanging coalitions When Baldwin won a second Senate term in 2018, the 'blue wave' midterm during Trump's presidency, she increased her statewide margin by over 5 points, but she won seven fewer counties than in 2012, though she got larger margins in heavily populated counties.\n'Look, in a state like Wisconsin, a 50/50 battleground state, it is — you don't have to win every county,' Baldwin said at the campaign stop in New Glarus. 'But it is really critical that we get folks out to vote, we have the discussions and up the turnout in every community that you can.'\nSimilarly, in 2022, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers slightly increased his margin of victory from four years before but won fewer of the state's 72 counties. Democrats also narrowly lost Wisconsin's rural 3rd Congressional District after longtime Democratic Rep. Ron Kind retired, with the seat going to Republican Derrick Van Orden by just under 4 points. Republicans have also controlled both the 7th and 8th districts in northern Wisconsin since the 2012 election.\n'My county voted for Obama twice. And it was after the second Obama election that it started to shift,' said Peggy Fullmer, chair of the Democratic Party in Marquette County, about an hour north of Madison. 'You know, then all of a sudden, it's been really red ever since.'\nDemocratic organizers in rural areas are feeling the pressure.\n'It's like pulling hen's teeth to get votes for Democrats in our areas,' said Linda Wilkins, chair of the neighboring Green Lake County Democratic Party.\n'Every Democratic vote makes a difference, and we get a few more each time in these extremely difficult red areas,' Wilkins said of the work of Democratic organizers in rural Wisconsin. 'And without our votes, they wouldn't win either.'\nBut Wilkins thinks it's time for the Biden campaign to visit rural Wisconsin. 'They need to go and visit them and not just go to Milwaukee and Madison,' she said. Biden made trips to Milwaukee and Madison in recent weeks, but he visited Superior in January. First lady Jill Biden visited the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin's reservation last October.\nJoni Anderson, vice-chair of the Adams County Democratic Party and a coordinator of Democratic efforts across several rural counties, said she wishes the state party would give more support to candidates who run in rural areas.\nWikler said the state party will soon announce its largest-ever investment in state legislative races.\n'This is something that I've been really listening to — the feedback from rural county parties and rural Democrats,' Wikler said. 'We want to make sure that when somebody's the Democratic nominee, wherever they live in Wisconsin, they have the backing of our state party.\"\nFor farmers like Roecker, showing up means a lot, but it's not everything.\n'They just can't show up at the farm and do a photo op, you know what I mean?' he said, adding that farmers feel like elected officials 'don't care what's going on out here' as long as there's food in the grocery store.\n'It's a shame when farmers are on food stamps themselves and they produce food for 155 other people. And that's how broken the system is here,' Roecker said.\nSarah Dean",

            "excerpt": "Graham was among the earliest opponents of the Iraq war, saying it diverted America's focus on the battle against terrorism centered in Afghanistan.",
            "summary": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Former U.S. Sen. and two-term Florida Gov. Bob Graham, who gained national prominence as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks and as an early critic of the Iraq war, has died. He was 87.\nGraham's family announced the death Tuesday in a statement posted on X by his daughter Gwen Graham.\n'We are deeply saddened to report the passing of a visionary leader, dedicated public servant, and even more importantly, a loving husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather,' the family said.\nGraham, who served three terms in the Senate, made an unsuccessful bid for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, emphasizing his opposition to the Iraq invasion.\nBut his bid was delayed by heart surgery in January 2003, and he was never able to gain enough traction with voters to catch up, bowing out that October. He didn't seek reelection in 2004 and was replaced by Republican Mel Martinez.\nGraham was a man of many quirks. He perfected the 'workdays' political gimmick of spending a day doing various jobs from horse stall mucker to FBI agent and kept a meticulous diary, noting almost everyone he spoke with, everything he ate, the TV shows he watched and even his golf scores.\nGraham said the notebooks were a working tool for him and he was reluctant to describe his emotions or personal feelings in them.\n'I review them for calls to be made, memos to be dictated, meetings I want to follow up on and things people promise to do,' he said.\nGraham was among the earliest opponents of the Iraq war, saying it diverted America's focus on the battle against terrorism centered in Afghanistan. He was also critical of President George W. Bush for failing to have an occupation plan in Iraq after the U.S. military threw out Saddam Hussein in 2003.\nGraham said Bush took the United States into the war by exaggerating claims of the danger presented by the Iraqi weapons of destruction that were never found. He said Bush distorted intelligence data and argued it was more serious than the sexual misconduct issues that led the House to impeach President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s. It led him to launch his short, abortive presidential bid.\n'The quagmire in Iraq is a distraction that the Bush administration, and the Bush administration alone, has created,' Graham said in 2003.\nDuring his 18 years in Washington, Graham worked well with colleagues from both parties, particularly Florida Republican Connie Mack during their dozen years together in the Senate.\nAs a politician, few were better. Florida voters hardly considered him the wealthy Harvard-educated attorney that he was.\nGraham's political career spanned five decades, beginning with his election to the Florida House of Representatives in 1966.\nHe won a state Senate seat in 1970 and then was elected governor in 1978. He was re-elected in 1982. Four years later, he won the first of three terms in the U.S. Senate when he ousted incumbent Republican Paula Hawkins.\nGraham remained widely popular with Florida voters — winning reelection by wide margins in 1992 and 1998 when he carried 63 of 67 counties. In that latter election, he defeated Charlie Crist, who later served as a Republican governor from 2007 to 2011.\n'He blew me out of the water, and I came to know even more so why during the course of the campaign,' Crist said Tuesday night. 'I learned to respect him even more than I already had, and love him for the good, decent man that he was.'\nCrist, who has since switched parties and most recently served as a U.S. representative, said Graham was an influence on him.\n'I always felt that when he was governor, that he was trying to govern for the people of Florida — not in any way political or partisan — and I took that to heart and tried to, in some small way, emulate it,' Crist said.\nHouse Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi called Graham 'a patriotic American' and thanked him for his 'distinguished public service.' She highlighted his work on the inquiry into 9/11 and said he 'bravely opposed entry into the war in Iraq.'\n'He brought his love for his family and for his state of Florida to the Senate, where he served with immense dignity and courage,' she said in a statement Tuesday.\nEven when in Washington, Graham never took his eye off the state and the leadership in Tallahassee.\nWhen Gov. Jeb Bush and the Republican-controlled Legislature eliminated the Board of Regents in 2001, Graham saw it as a move to politicize the state university system. He led a successful petition drive the next year for a state constitutional amendment that created the Board of Governors to assume the regents' role.\nDaniel Robert Graham was born Nov. 9, 1936, in Coral Gables, where his father, Ernest 'Cap' Graham, had moved from South Dakota and established a large dairy operation. Young Bob milked cows, built fences and scooped manure as a teenager. One of his half-brothers, Phillip Graham, was publisher of The Washington Post and Newsweek until he took his own life in 1963, just a year after Bob Graham's graduation from Harvard Law.\nGraham was president of the student body at Miami Senior High School and attended the University of Florida, graduating in 1959.\nIn 1966 he was elected to the Florida Legislature, where he focused largely on education and health care issues.\nGraham got off to a shaky start as Florida's chief executive, and was dubbed 'Gov. Jello' for some early indecisiveness. He shook that label through his handling of several serious crises.\nAs governor he also signed numerous death warrants, founded the Save the Manatee Club with entertainer Jimmy Buffett and led efforts to establish several environmental programs.\nGraham pushed through a bond program to buy beaches and barrier islands threatened by development and started the Save Our Everglades program to protect the state's water supply, wetlands and endangered species.\nGraham also was known for his 408 'workdays,' including stints as a housewife, boxing ring announcer, flight attendant and arson investigator. They grew out of a teaching stint as a member of the Florida Senate's Education Committee and then morphed into a campaign gimmick that helped him relate to the average voter.\n'This has been a very important part of my development as a public official, my learning at a very human level what the people of Florida expect, what they want, what their aspirations are and then trying to interpret that and make it policy that will improve their lives' said Graham in 2004 as he completed his final job as a Christmas gift wrapper.\nAfter leaving public life in 2005, Graham spent much of his time at a public policy center named after him at the University of Florida and pushing the Legislature to require more civics classes in the state's public schools.\nGraham was one of five members selected for an independent commission by President Barack Obama in June 2010 to investigate a massive BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that threatened sea life and beaches along several southeastern Gulf states.",

            "excerpt": "How moderate Democrats joined with old enemies on the left to stop their own friends in the center from challenging Joe Biden.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Once upon a time, before the multimillion-dollar negative campaigns and allegations of running 'a conspiracy to commit extortion, voter intimidation, and other criminal behavior,' they were friends. Good friends.\nThe people who run No Labels and Third Way, two of the most prominent centrist organizations in Washington, had all come up together in the small world of Clinton-era center-left politics.\nNancy Jacobson, an early Bill Clinton hire and the founder of No Labels, helped raise the initial money and secure the necessary political blessings to start Third Way. The think tank was co-founded by Jon Cowan, whom Jacobson viewed as something of a mentee. Cowan, now Third Way's president, even signed the ketubah (the Jewish wedding contract) at Jacobson's wedding to Mark Penn, whose firm conducts No Labels' polls.\nThen came the 2024 election — and No Labels' decision to try to field a bipartisan 'unity ticket' against both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, backed by a reported budget of $70 million. Third Way, which may be centrist but is firmly Democratic, viewed this as a misguided, no-hope effort that could only spoil the election for Biden and help to re-elect Trump, with potentially disastrous consequences.\n\"There were deep personal stakes and relationships,\" Cowan said.\nA centrist civil war broke out in the C-suites and steakhouses of Washington and Manhattan. Like so many insider conflicts, it was deeply personal. There were betrayal, a double agent, a secret team of political operatives, some very unlikely allies — and a decisive victory for one side that left the other seething and bitter.\nEven some people close to No Labels acknowledge the campaign against it largely succeeded in its mission: dissuading any potential candidates from joining its ticket. But the cost, they say, will be a gaping wound at the center of what's left of American centrism.\n\"What does Third Way go back to?\" asked former Rep. Max Rose, a moderate New York Democrat who spoke to NBC News at Jacobson's request. \"Because it doesn't seem logical that an organization that considers itself a centrist policy organization randomly makes war on another organization like this.\"\nOr as Holly Page, a longtime moderate Democratic strategist who has worked for both groups but ended up in No Labels' camp put it of Third Way: 'They sold out the center so they could get a seat at the table with [former Biden chief of staff] Ron Klain.\"\nNo Labels was so incensed by what Page referred to as the anti-No Labels campaign's \"little fraternity games\" that the group lodged a complaint with the Justice Department. In a letter and an indignant news conference, they accused their old friends and their new allies of violating anti-racketeering laws, typically used to prosecute the mafia, by engaging in an \"unlawful conspiracy to subvert Americans' voting rights.\" There is no sign the Justice Department took any action on the compliant.\nThird Way and its allies, meanwhile, believe they're the real moderates here. They forged an actual bipartisan coalition of groups spanning Republicans to progressives to support a moderate Democratic president and to stop Trump, few people's idea of a moderate, whom they note No Labels praised as a \"problem solver\" during his 2016 campaign.\nthey're the real moderates here. They forged an actual bipartisan coalition of groups spanning Republicans to progressives to support a moderate Democratic president and to stop Trump, few people's idea of a moderate, whom they note No Labels praised as a \"problem solver\" during his 2016 campaign. 'You're not building a pro-Biden coalition; it's an anti-Trump coalition,' said Sarah Longwell, a Republican strategist and publisher of the conservative website The Bulwark, who supported the anti-No Labels effort. 'They absolutely would subtract people who, when push comes to shove, will vote for Joe Biden.'\nSimilar beginnings go separate ways In many ways, Third Way was an unlikely marshal for a No Labels counterstrike.\nBoth have long been dismissed by the left as stodgy corporatists and crypto-Republicans, and Third Way and No Labels exist in overlapping social circles, draw from similar funders and promote a common ideology. Third Way's previous campaigns took on the left, like when it fought progressive challengers in House primaries and tried to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., from winning the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.\n'Everybody in the centrist donor universe knew No Labels was doing this ticket, and everybody knew we were leading the opposition. You were on one side or the other,' Cowan said. 'And on the other side were some of the wealthiest people in the country and they were very angry at us.'\nThird Way lost a board member who sided with No Labels, and its leaders received word from several other unhappy donors that they should not expect another cent.\nBut while Third Way is fundamentally a Democratic organ, Jacobson has fallen (or been pushed, depending on whom you ask) out of the party's ranks, and now, No Labels views itself as the only group righteous and innovative enough to think outside the red-blue divide.\nStill, that familiarity meant Third Way spoke enough of No Labels' language to understand it and the people funding it — and how to reach the potential candidates it tried to recruit.\nAnd Third Way's moderate credentials helped it pick off potential No Labels allies, from its affiliated members of Congress to New York Times columnist David Brooks — the first major voice to hoist the unity ticket flag, only to later lower it — to the Clintons, the first family of Democratic centrism.\nThe former president and secretary of state hardly needed convincing of the threat a third-party campaign posed to Biden — Hillary Clinton had partly blamed the Green Party for her 2016 loss. So over lunch last July at their home in Chappaqua, New York, the Clintons, each joined by a top aide, talked through strategy with Cowan and Third Way Vice President Matt Bennett and vowed to help privately through their networks, according to three sources familiar with the meeting.\nBill Clinton joined the anti-recruiting team working against No Labels, making personal appeals to two prominent No Labels targets — Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican — that a third-party candidate could not win.\n'Pearl Harbored' Jacobson expressed anger, dismay and a sense of betrayal about Third Way's actions. 'We were Pearl Harbored,' she told supporters on a call, first reported by Puck.\nBill Clinton's lobbying effort was part of a broader campaign, which included dozens groups and prominent figures from the left, the center and the anti-Trump right, built around Third Way's 'war room.'\nAs Bennett put it in the first large gathering of the group, they had to 'build the idea in the minds of the political elites and the people that they talk to ... that if you get involved with this ... you're really risking your entire reputation and your legacy.'\nThird Way identified a long list of potential No Labels targets and set about finding common friends and allies between the potential candidates and the anti-No Labels coalition — people who would be seen as credible messengers. No Labels said 30 candidates passed. And by the end, the opposing coalition says, it reached every name that surfaced.\nThird Way leaders worked the Democratic side of the aisle after securing the blessing of party leaders in the White House, on Capitol Hill and in the Democratic National Committee. Meanwhile, its anti-Trump GOP allies and a clandestine team of 10 to 20 Republican operatives worked to 'surround' potential candidates with appeals, including survey research commissioned from former Rep. Liz Cheney's pollster, which concluded that they could not win running with No Labels.\nEvery potential candidate got a message tailored to their pressure points — their financial needs, their legacies, their future political prospects — from credible figures like local business leaders, clergy and former aides.\nThe chief goal was to make it impossible for No Labels to deliver the kind of big-name ticket it had promised.\n\"This was elite-driven,\" Bennett said. \"We knew they had enough donors that we couldn't deny them money. But we also knew enough about their donors to know they would expect a high-level candidate with a certain stature and would not accept someone who was not obviously credible.\"\nTheir targets included highly publicized suspects like Manchin, Hogan and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, though they were particularly worried about Bill Haslam, the former governor of Tennessee, because he is a billionaire who could self-fund.\nUnlikely allies It wasn't just anti-Trump Republicans like the Lincoln Project and former Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol who joined Third Way's efforts to brush back No Labels. Mainstream Democrats like Klain and former Democratic Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama were joined by leaders on the left who were used to warring, not collaborating, with Third Way.\nLunching with Bennett and working with his group helped 'humanize' people she had viewed as 'an enemy,' said Melissa Byrne, a left-wing activist who has often sparred with moderate Democrats over issues like student debt.\nByrne stressed — 'print this in all caps, bold,' she said — that she will go to war again with Third Way over policy if and when the time comes.\nBennett and the executive director of the liberal group MoveOn, Rahna Epting, ended up working together closely, playing up an odd-couple routine in a series of meetings on Capitol Hill, in the media and even in a public debate against No Labels strategists.\n'Our partnership with Third Way to come together and stop No Labels may be surprising to some, but it is a testament to how high the stakes are to keep Trump out of the White House,' Epting said.\nMeanwhile, some Republicans joined a campaign run by Democrats thanks to a similar calculation: Despite their policy differences, they were united by opposition to Trump and a shared belief that a third-party candidate could be a decisive boon to him.\n\"If you want to go experiment with third-party stuff, go crazy — just not this year,\" said Rick Wilson, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project, another cornerstone of the anti-No Labels campaign.\nThe broad coalition even included a secret member from the most unlikely of sources: No Labels itself.\nNo Labels did its best to keep the names of its delegates, donors and potential candidates under wraps. But the anti-No Labels campaign felt it had a good idea what was going on behind the curtain, thanks to a No Labels delegate who had grown disillusioned and started leaking to the other side.\nThe turncoat, whom Cowan and Bennett would only say was an 'average citizen' who initially joined No Labels out of a sincere belief in its mission, 'was incredibly helpful to us and did so at some personal sacrifice and risk,' Bennett said.\nPeople familiar with No Labels' thinking did not dispute that they had a leaker and said they were unaware of who it might be.\nBut No Labels allies say these kinds of cloak-and-dagger tactics highlight the hypocrisy, as they see it, of supposed champions of democracy and voting rights opposing another party's ballot access.\n'It's just discouraging to see partisans and politicians protecting their turf,' said former Rep. Joe Cunningham, a Democrat from South Carolina who worked with No Labels.\nRose, the former New York congressman, said No Labels' presidential ticket was always a long shot, so its opponents' victory lap is just \"someone seeing where things were going anyway and trying to claim credit.\"\n\"No Labels considered something that didn't really have legs and made a pretty noble decision to not pursue it,' he said.\nWhile No Labels' 2024 push is over, third-party candidates are still in the campaign, especially another ex-Democrat who could affect Biden's chances in November: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Countering Kennedy, though, will be a very different kind of conflict, even as Third Way remains committed to battling Biden's third-party foes.\nThird Way turned out to be the right group for the job of taking down No Labels. Can they take down an outsider too?\nAlex Seitz-Wald",

            "excerpt": "American politics has largely been stuck in a narrow band of close division for most of the Biden era. New polling shows what could break it one way or the other.",
            "summary": "The good news for President Joe Biden in our new national NBC News poll is that it appears he's climbed out of the political hole he was in this winter: His overall approval rating is up 5 points from January, and he now trails former President Donald Trump by just 2 points among registered voters, down from a 5-point deficit three months ago.\nThe bad news for Biden is that his current political standing is back to where it was in the fall of 2023, when his re-election prospects were already on shaky ground.\nIt underscores an important point about 2024's presidential election with six months to go: The Biden-Trump contest has been remarkably stable — and remarkably competitive — with the movement coming within the margin of error.\nTake the two-way ballot between Biden and Trump, for example. Over the course of almost a year, Trump's percentage has been stuck between 45% and 47% of registered voters, matching his share of the popular vote in both the 2016 and the 2020 elections. Biden's percentage, meanwhile, has hovered between a high of 49% in the summer of 2023 and a low of 42% in January.\nOr look at Biden's approval rating, which has consistently been below 45% since the start of January 2023, and which hit a low of 37% in the first month of this year. It's now at 42% in our latest poll.\nOr look at the favorability ratings for both Biden and Trump, which are almost identical:\nBiden: 38% positive, 52% negative (minus 14 net rating)\nTrump: 38% positive, 53% negative (minus 15 net rating) Or take the names at the top of the ticket out of the equation and note the stable congressional preference in the poll. Right now, 47% prefer a GOP-controlled Congress in the new NBC poll, compared to 46% who want Democrats. The parties have been locked in that competitive position for years: The GOP number hasn't moved more than 2 points in either direction in NBC News polling since August 2021, while the Democratic number dipped outside that range just once.\nSo, despite all the news, developments and drama over the past year, this race has barely budged. And it's extremely close.\nBut the new NBC News poll also points to at least three potential wild cards that could upend this stability.\nThe first is Trump's criminal trial in New York. While his multiple criminal indictments and legal challenges helped him with Republican primary voters in 2023 and early this year, the NBC poll finds 50% of voters saying he's being held to the same standard as anyone accused of such a crime, versus 43% who believe he's being unfairly targeted.\nhelped him with Republican primary voters in 2023 and early this year, the NBC poll finds 50% of voters saying he's being held to the same standard as anyone accused of such a crime, versus 43% who believe he's being unfairly targeted. That majority saying Trump is being held to the same standard as anyone else is higher than the vote share Biden gets in the head-to-head matchup against the former president. Bottom line: The legal challenges don't seem to be a political winner for Trump with the general electorate — at least right now.\nAnother potential wild card is the third-party vote. For months, the conventional wisdom has been that the bigger the size of the third-party vote, the worse it would be for Biden. And that could still be the case, given that Trump's consistent 46% to 47% vote share becomes a winning percentage if the third-party vote is greater than 6%.\nYet, our NBC News poll shows independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hurting Trump more than he is hurting Biden at the moment.\nAnd a final wild card is the eventual turnout in the 2024 presidential race. As our poll finds, the level of high interest in this contest is at a nearly 20-year low, signaling that turnout in November could be significantly lower than it was in 2020.\nDoes that lower turnout help Trump, given that more Republicans have high interest (70%) than Democrats do (65%), according to the NBC News poll?\nOr does it help Biden, given that many of the voters who say they're supporting Trump are the ones who didn't participate in 2020 or in the 2022 midterms?\nThese are all reasons how a stable race can quickly become unstable — and unpredictable.\nMark Murray",

            "excerpt": "Trump is taking aim at Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as several recent polls show he may have more to lose from the independent's presence on the ballot.",
            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he's confident that independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will pull more votes away from President Joe Biden than from him — a net win for the Republican's candidacy.\n'He is Crooked Joe Biden's Political Opponent, not mine,' Trump wrote on Truth Social late last month. 'I love that he is running!'\nBehind closed doors, however, Trump is less sure. A Republican who was in the room with Trump earlier this year as the former president reviewed polling said Trump was unsure of how Kennedy would impact the race, asking the other people on hand whether or not Kennedy was actually good for his candidacy.\nAnd after mostly ignoring Kennedy early in his campaign, Trump has stepped up his efforts to brand the independent candidate as left-wing and make him Biden's problem, suggesting that he and allies are concerned about Kennedy's ability to attract Republican voters. In the same post in which he called Kennedy Biden's political opponent, Trump called Kennedy 'the most Radical Left Candidate in the race, by far,' someone who was 'a big fan of the Green New Scam' and 'other economy killing disasters.'\nIn a video monologue he posted to his social media page this month, Trump described Kennedy as being to Biden's left but said Kennedy has 'got some nice things about him' and 'I happen to like him.'\n'If I were a Democrat, I'd vote for RFK Jr. every single time over Biden because he's frankly more in line with Democrats,' Trump said, adding, 'I do believe that RFK Jr. will do very well. And I do believe he's going to take a lot of votes away from crooked Joe Biden.'\nTrump's increased focus on Kennedy comes as Democrats have increased their attention on third-party contenders, standing up super PACs and other anti-spoiler efforts meant to kneecap independent challengers who could pull from Biden and reduce the vote share Trump needs to get over the top this fall. And in defiance of earlier conventional wisdom about the 2024 race, new polling shows that right now Trump might have the most to lose with Kennedy on the ballot.\nAn NBC News national poll released Sunday found that Kennedy cut deeper into Trump's support than Biden's. The survey found that 15% of voters who picked Trump in a head-to-head matchup with Biden switched to choose Kennedy in a five-way ballot test, while just 7% of those who initially selected Biden in the head-to-head switched to Kennedy when third-party candidates were added.\nThat trend meant Trump went from leading Biden by 2 percentage points in a head-to-head survey to trailing him by 2 points when the race is expanded to five named candidates, including Kennedy. The survey's margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\nRepublican voters view Kennedy much more favorably than Democrats. The poll found that 40% of self-identified Republicans viewed Kennedy favorably, while 15% held negative views of the independent candidate. For Democrats, just 16% had positive views of Kennedy, while 53% expressed a negative view of him.\nThat's in part the result of conservative media and Trump allies heaping praise on Kennedy when he was initially running in the Democratic primary against Biden, as well as prior to this election cycle as Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, railed against the medical establishment and so-called social media 'censorship.'\nA Republican who worked on a door-knocking effort in an early state for a Trump primary opponent told NBC News that Kennedy often came up as the second choice among people who said they were backing Trump.\nA changing posture Trump himself has offered kind words for Kennedy in the past. During a June 2023 interview on the Howie Carr Show, Trump described Kennedy as 'a common sense guy.' Right-wing allies like Steve Bannon, Alex Jones and Roger Stone openly pined for Trump to pick Kennedy as his running mate.\nThe vibe is different now.\nThe pro-Trump PAC MAGA Inc. this month launched a 'Radical F---ing Kennedy' website dedicated to promoting the candidate's left-wing positions. Kennedy, meanwhile, has criticized Trump from the right, hitting him for taking advice from Dr. Anthony Fauci during the pandemic and for running up the deficit. He said another Trump term 'would be bad for the country.'\n'President Trump calls me an ultra-left radical,' Kennedy posted on X in response to the MAGA Inc. website. 'I'm soooo liberal that his emissaries asked me to be his VP. I respectfully declined the offer.' (Trump's campaign has denied that Kennedy was ever approached about being the former president's running mate.)\n'I am against President Trump, and President Biden can't win,' Kennedy's post continued. 'Judging by his new website, it looks like President Trump knows who actually can beat him.'\nOn the whole, there have been public surveys showing both major party candidates suffering more as a result of Kennedy's campaign. The dynamic also may change depending on which state is being surveyed — and which states feature Kennedy on the ballot in November, a battle that is still in progress.\n'Nobody has conducted more polls than I have on Kennedy and his place in the race — and continuously I have seen him draw equally from Biden and Trump,' said Jeremy Zogby, a managing partner at John Zogby Strategies who has polled for Kennedy's campaign. 'Sometimes a point or two towards one side in a poll, and vice versa in another poll. The fact remains Kennedy has crossover appeal among those disaffected within both parties,' like the 'double haters' who dislike both Biden and Trump.\nDemocrats have long worried that Kennedy's association with his famous father and uncles will win over some liberals who are fond of the family. Plus, Kennedy for years gained acclaim as an environmental activist and an anti-corporate crusader, two causes that have him finding common ground with Democratic voters.\nLast week, Biden held an event with Kennedy family members who touted the president and warned of the danger their relative's campaign posed. And on Monday, the Democratic National Committee announced it was launching billboards in Arizona depicting Kennedy as a pro-Trump spoiler candidate.\nA strategist working on the Democrats' anti-third party effort said the data shows Kennedy is clearly taking a slice from both major party candidates, as well as a portion of voters who wouldn't be open to voting for either Trump or Biden.\n'I think the data's moved a little bit over the last month-plus,' this person said. 'But it's all on the margins, it's tough to tell whether this is RFK appealing more to Trump voters, or some Trump voters just looking for an off-ramp, or both. Ditto on the Biden end — is this just reflecting the fact that Biden's ticked up a few points?'\nOne Trump ally said the presumptive GOP nominee should hold off on hitting Kennedy for now, arguing there will be time later this fall to go after him as 'too liberal for America' if these polling trends continue.\n'The second you start attacking him or even addressing him, you start giving credibility to and you start firming up those votes,' this person said, 'At the moment, he's irrelevant. As you get close and votes start hardening in terms of who people are voting for and when and why and how, then you've got to start making moves.'\nIn a statement, Trump's campaign railed against Kennedy's environmental positions and described him as 'no independent , ' while also hitting Democrats for challenging his efforts to get on the ballot.\n,' while also hitting Democrats for challenging his efforts to get on the ballot. 'RFK Jr. is an AOC lover and opposes really any human advancement, preferring that we all live in caves by candlelight, except of course supports charging stations for your $150,000 electric car that can only drive a few miles before dying just like his presidential campaign,' said Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director.\nTony Lyons, a co-founder of the pro-Kennedy super PAC American Values 2024 and the president of Skyhorse Publishing, said there will be a 'pendulum swinging back and forth' throughout the campaign that shows Kennedy at times being better for Trump and at other times boosting Biden's candidacy.\nLyons said Kennedy will soon be promoting a 30-minute infomercial posted online that aims to hit back on the attacks he's facing from his rivals.\n'The fascinating part of it is that Trump says he's ultra left-wing,' Lyons said. 'And Biden says that he's ultra right-wing.'\nAllan Smith Alex Seitz-Wald and Vaughn Hillyard contributed.",

            "excerpt": "NBC News' latest national poll shows Biden's numbers inching up as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., inflation and abortion all scramble the 2024 contest.",
            "summary": "The share of voters who say they have high interest in the 2024 election has hit a nearly 20-year low at this point in a presidential race, according to the latest national NBC News poll, with majorities holding negative views of both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\nThe poll also shows Biden trimming Trump's previous lead to just 2 points in a head-to-head contest, an improvement within the margin of error compared to the previous survey, as the president bests Trump on the issues of abortion and uniting the country, while the former Republican president is ahead on competency and dealing with inflation.\nAnd it finds inflation and immigration topping the list of most important issues facing the country, as just one-third of voters give Biden credit for an improving economy.\nBut what also stands out in the survey is how the low voter interest and the independent candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. potentially scramble what's been a stable presidential contest with more than six months until Election Day. While Trump holds a 2-point edge over Biden in head to head , Biden leads Trump by 2 points in a five-way ballot test including Kennedy and other third-party candidates.\n'I don't think Biden has done much as a president. And if Trump gets elected, I just feel like it's going to be the same thing as it was before Biden got elected,' said poll respondent Devin Fletcher, 37, of Wayne, Michigan, a Democrat who said he's still voting for Biden.\n'I just don't feel like I have a candidate that I'm excited to vote for,' Fletcher added.\nAnother poll respondent from New Jersey, who declined to provide her name and voted for Biden in 2020, said she wouldn't be voting in November.\n'Our candidates are horrible. I have no interest in voting for Biden. He did nothing. And I absolutely will not vote for Trump,' this voter said.\nDemocratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies, said that 'Americans don't agree on much these days, but nothing unites the country more than voters' desire to tune this election out.'\nThe poll was conducted April 12-16, and it comes during yet another turbulent time in American politics, including the beginning of Trump's criminal trial in New York, as well as new attacks and heightened tensions in the Middle East.\nAccording to the poll, 64% of registered voters say they have a high level of interest in November's election — registering either a '9' or a 10' on a 10-point scale of interest.\nThat's lower than what the NBC News poll showed at this same point time in the 2008 (74%), 2012 (67%), 2016 (69%) and 2020 (77%) presidential contests.\nThe question dates back to the 2008 election cycle. The lowest-ever level of high election interest in the poll during a presidential cycle was in March 2012 — at 59%. But it quickly ticked up in the next survey.\nThis election cycle, high interest has been both low and relatively flat for months, according to the poll.\nMcInturff, the Republican pollster, says the high level of interest in the poll has 'always been a signal for the level of turnout' for a presidential contest.\n'It makes it very hard for us to predict turnout this far in advance of November, but every signal is turnout will be a lower percentage of eligible voters than in 2020,' he said.\nBy party, the current poll shows 70% of self-identified Republicans saying they have high interest in the upcoming election, versus 65% of Democrats who say this.\nIndependents are at 48%, while only 36% of voters ages 18 to 34 rate themselves as highly interested in the election.\n'They just aren't low interest,' McInturff said of young voters. 'They are off-the-charts low.'\nBiden trims Trump's lead The poll also finds Trump narrowly ahead of Biden by 2 points among registered voters in a head-to-head matchup, 46% to 44% — down from Trump's 5-point advantage in January, 47% to 42%.\nThat movement, within the poll's margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, is consistent with what other national polls have showed in the Trump-Biden race.\nTrump's biggest advantages are among men (53% to 37%), white voters (54% to 37%) and white voters without college degrees (65% to 25%).\nBiden's top advantages are among Black voters (71% to 13%), women (50% to 39%) and Latinos (49% to 39%).\nThe poll shows the two candidates are essentially tied among independents (Biden 36%, Trump 34%) and voters ages 18-34 (Biden 44%, Trump 43%). One of the big polling mysteries this cycle is whether young voters have defected from Biden (as the NBC News poll has shown over multiple surveys), or whether Democrats have maintained their advantage among this demographic.\nWhen the ballot is expanded to five named candidates, Biden takes a 2-point lead over Trump: Biden 39%, Trump 37%, independent Robert F. Kennedy 13%, Jill Stein 3% and Cornel West 2%.\nAgain, that result between Biden and Trump is within the poll's margin of error.\nNotably, the poll shows a greater share of Trump voters from the head-to-head matchup supporting Kennedy in the expanded ballot compared with Biden voters, different than the results of some other surveys.\n(Read more here on how Kennedy's candidacy impacts the 2024 race, according to the poll.)\n(Read more here on how Kennedy's candidacy impacts the 2024 race, according to the poll.) The president's approval rating ticks up to 42% Additionally, the poll shows 42% of registered voters approving of Biden's overall job performance — up 5 points since January's NBC News poll, which showed Biden at the lowest point of his presidency.\nFifty-six percent of voters say they disapprove of the job he has done, which is down 4 points from January.\nBiden's gains over the past few months have come from key parts of his 2020 base, especially among Democrats and Black voters. But he continues to hold low ratings among Latinos (40% approval), young voters (37%) and independents (36%).\nbase, especially among Democrats and Black voters. But he continues to hold low ratings among Latinos (40% approval), young voters (37%) and independents (36%). 'The data across this poll show that Joe Biden has begun to gain some ground in rebuilding his coalition from 2020,' said Horwitt, the Democratic pollster. 'The question is whether he can build upon this momentum and make inroads with the groups of voters that still are holding back support.'\nBut McInturff, the GOP pollster, points out that the only recent presidents who lost re-election had approval ratings higher than Biden's at this point in the election cycle: George H.W. Bush (43%) and Donald Trump (46%).\nwho lost re-election had approval ratings higher than Biden's at this point in the election cycle: George H.W. Bush (43%) and Donald Trump (46%). 'President Biden has a precarious hold on the presidency and is in a difficult position as it relates to his re-election,' McInturff said.\nOn the issues, 39% of voters say they approve of Biden's handling of the economy (up from 36% in January); 28% approve of his handling of border security and immigration; and just 27% approve of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war (down from 29% in January).\nVoters gave Biden his highest issue rating on addressing student-loan debt, with 44% approving of his handling of the issue, versus 51% who say they disapprove.\naddressing student-loan debt, with 44% approving of his handling of the issue, versus 51% who say they disapprove. Biden leads on abortion and unity; Trump leads on inflation and competency The NBC News poll asked voters to determine which candidate they thought is better on several different issues and attributes.\nBiden holds a 15-point advantage over Trump on dealing with the issue of abortion, and the president is ahead by 9 points on having the ability to bring the country together — though this is down from Biden's 24-point advantage on this issue in the Sept. 2020 NBC News poll.\nTrump, meanwhile, leads on having the ability to handle a crisis (by 4 points), on having a strong record of accomplishments (by 7 points), on being competent and effective (by 11 points), on having the necessary mental and physical health to be president (by 19 points) and on dealing with inflation and the cost of living (by 22 points).\nInflation, immigration are the top 2024 issues As for inflation and the cost of living, it tops the list of issues in the poll, with 23% of voters saying they're the most important issue facing the country.\nThe other top issue concerning voters is immigration and the situation at the border (22%) — followed by threats to democracy (16%), jobs and the economy (11%), abortion (6%) and health care (6%).\nimmigration and the situation at the border (22%) — followed by threats to democracy (16%), jobs and the economy (11%), abortion (6%) and health care (6%). Additionally, 63% of voters say their family's income is falling behind the cost of living — essentially unchanged from what the poll showed in 2022 and 2023.\nAnd 53% of voters say the country's economy has not improved, versus 33% who say it has improved and Biden deserves some credit for it and another 8% who agree the economy has improved but don't give the president credit for it.\n'If I look back to when I had all three of my children in the house — we only have one child left in the house now, and we're spending more now than what we did when we had a family of five,' said poll respondent Art Fales, 45, of Florida, who says he's likely voting for Trump.\nBut on a separate question — is there an issue so important that you'll vote for or against a candidate solely on that basis? — the top issue responses are protecting democracy and constitutional rights (28%), immigration and border security (20%) and abortion (19%).\nIndeed, 30% of Democrats, 29% of young voters and 27% of women say they are single-issue voters on abortion.\n'I have a right to what I do with my body,' said poll respondent Amanda Willis, 28, from Louisiana, who said she's voting for Biden. 'And I don't believe that other people should have the ability to determine that.'\nOther poll findings With Trump's first criminal trial now underway, 50% of voters say the former president is being held to the same standard as anyone else when it comes to his multiple legal challenges. That compares with 43% who believe he's being unfairly targeted in these trials.\n52% of voters have an unfavorable view of Biden, while 53% share the same view of Trump.\nAnd Democrats and Republicans are essentially tied on congressional preference, with 47% of voters preferring Republicans control Congress and 46% wanting Democrats in charge. Republicans held a 4-point lead on this question in January. The NBC News poll was conducted April 12-16 of 1,000 registered voters nationwide — 891 contacted via cell phone — and the poll has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\nThe NBC News poll was conducted April 12-16 of 1,000 registered voters nationwide — 891 contacted via cell phone — and the poll has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\nMark Murray Sarah Dean",

'We know the law is correct and will use every available tool to defend it.'\nTuesday's ruling comes as the debate over whether transgender athletes should compete in sports that align with their gender identities continues to be a lightning-rod issue within the nation's culture wars.\nWest Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, signed the state's transgender sports bill into law in 2021, making West Virginia one of the first states to implement restrictions on trans athletes. Now, it is one of 24 states to have passed such legislation, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a think tank that tracks policies affecting the LGBTQ community. Temporary injunctions are blocking some of the laws, including those in Arizona, Idaho and Utah, according to MAP.\nProponents of the measures have argued that trans girls and women have biological advantages over cisgender girls and women, making their inclusion in girls' and women's sports unfair and potentially dangerous.\nIn his dissent in Tuesday's ruling, Judge G. Steven Agee appeared to agree.\n'By continuing to allow B.P.J.—and transgender girls like B.P.J.— to participate on girls' teams, the number of displaced biological girls will expand exponentially,' Agee wrote. 'Further, as the spots on teams become more limited, B.P.J. will prevent other biological girls from participating on the teams altogether, thereby denying them any athletic opportunity.'\nOpponents have framed the laws as a discriminatory restriction placed on trans people to deter them from playing sports.\nBecky Pepper-Jackson runs in Bridgeport, W.Va., in 2021.

            "excerpt": "The foreign aid package moved forward with the support of an extremely rare bipartisan coalition, with Democrats helping to carry the \"rule\" in committee and on the floor.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The House voted 316-94 to tee up votes on four separate bills that include aid to Ukraine and Israel, a good sign for the prospects of Congress approving U.S. funding for the two countries after months of delay and partisan fighting.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, facing intense opposition from right-wing members, received crucial help from Democrats to move forward with the votes. More Democrats (165) than Republicans (151) voted to pass the 'rule,' a procedural step to set up the votes.\nThe move tees up four House votes that are expected Saturday afternoon: one on Israel aid, another on Ukraine aid, another on Indo-Pacific security and a fourth bill that includes a bill designed to ban TikTok in the U.S. if it does not divest from its China-based owner, as well as various national security priorities. If they pass, the measures would be packaged together and sent to the Democratic-controlled Senate.\nTaken together, the foreign aid measures closely resemble the $95 billion national security package pushed by President Joe Biden. The Senate would have to pass it again, due to some differences with the version that passed the upper chamber in February.\n\"The world is watching what the Congress does. Passing this legislation would send a powerful message about the strength of American leadership at a pivotal moment,\" the White House budget office said in a statement Friday endorsing the House package. \"The Administration urges both chambers of the Congress to quickly send this supplemental funding package to the President's desk.\nThe House's move followed a vote of 9-3 in the Rules Committee late Thursday to send the bills to the floor for a final vote, with Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., breaking with Johnson to vote against it. But all four Democrats voted for the rule and rescued it, an extremely unusual move for the minority party.\n\"We only control one chamber, and I barely have control of that,\" Johnson said Thursday on Newsmax, explaining why he couldn't include GOP immigration measures in the package as some want. \"The Senate won't advance our legislation and the president won't sign it. ... I have a handful of my Republicans, at least, who will not advance a rule to bring that to the floor to combine it with the Ukraine and Israel funding. They won't do it. And so if I don't have Republican votes, that means we have to have Democratic votes.\nJohnson's decision to move forward with the bills comes as two of his members — Massie and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. — threaten to remove him as speaker. They and many other House conservatives oppose additional aid to Ukraine.\n'We'll see what happens. I'm going to do my job. I'm not deterred by threats,' Johnson said Friday. 'We're going to do the right thing and let the chips fall where they may.'\nBut Johnson, who opposed Ukraine aid last year before he became speaker, now says he believes it is \"critically important,\" based on the intelligence and briefings he has since gotten.\n'I think Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed,\" he told reporters earlier this week.\n\"I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,\" Johnson said, adding that his son is entering the Naval Academy this fall. \"This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is so many American families. This is not a game, this is not a joke.'\nThe fourth bill includes a provision to force China-based ByteDance to sell TikTok within nine months, which the president can extend to a year, or face a ban in the U.S. The provision, which has Senate buy-in as well as Biden's support, puts TikTok closer than ever to a prohibition in the country.\nDemocrats praised the move to proceed to House votes, highlighting their party's key role.\n\"It is vital that Congress act to send assistance to support Ukraine and fend off Russian aggression,\" Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., said on X. \"We may be in the minority, but we are not going to let that urgent mission fail. Democrats are doing what it takes to make sure Ukraine gets help.\"\nRep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., said Democrats were effectively in charge: \"We may be in the minority in the House right now, but @RepJeffries is essentially functioning as the real Speaker already. Rs couldn't get their own bills out of the committee they control so Ds had to help them.

            "summary": "RALEIGH, N.C. — The future of diversity, equity and inclusion staff jobs in North Carolina's public university system could be at stake after a five-person committee swiftly voted to repeal a key policy Wednesday.\nThe Committee on University Governance, within the University of North Carolina Board of Governors that oversees 17 schools, voted in less than four minutes to reverse and replace a policy related to DEI. The full board of 24 members is to vote on the matter again next month, and if approved, the repeal would take effect immediately.\nIf the policy is fully repealed, the UNC system could join other major universities in dismantling their diversity offices. Among the most notable, the University of Florida in Gainesville announced in a memo last month that it was scrapping its office and shifting its funding for faculty recruitment instead.\nUniversity of North Carolina Chapel Hill in 2023. Eros Hoagland / Getty Images file In Texas, universities saw major cuts in their diversity and inclusion staff in 2024 in compliance with a state ban signed into law last year. The state higher education board in Kansas was also to address a ban on diversity initiatives in hiring staff and accepting students Wednesday.\nAt least 20 states have seen Republican bill proposals seeking to limit diversity and inclusion programs in several public institutions such as universities.\nDiversity, equity and inclusion is defined by the American Psychological Association as a framework to guide 'fair treatment and full participation of all people,' especially those belonging to minority groups. It has become a recurring point of contention for conservatives who argue DEI programs are discriminatory.\nThe proposed policy change, first reported by The News & Observer of Raleigh, would impact a diversity, equity and inclusion regulation adopted in 2019. It defines the roles of various DEI positions — such as a system office diversity and inclusion liaison and diversity officers across the university system — and the establishment of a diversity and inclusion council made up of members representing each university, according to the policy.\nUnder the policy, the officers' responsibilities include assisting the chancellor with diversity policy and programming, in addition to facilitating training for students and staff.\nBut Andrew Tripp, senior vice president for the UNC System Office's legal affairs team, said the change would reaffirm 'the university's commitment to non-discrimination and institutional neutrality.'\nThe policy that could replace the existing regulation does not include the outlined responsibilities of DEI officers and liaisons, suggesting they may be eliminated. Other inclusion efforts such as tracking the university's diversity metrics and giving reports to university boards will continue, the replacement policy said.\nUNC-Chapel Hill — the system's flagship campus and whose website says has an office for diversity and inclusion with a 12-person staff — will review the policy change and work with the university system if implemented, spokesperson Kevin Best said in an emailed statement.\n'As the Board of Governors noted, equality of opportunity in education and employment is a long-standing commitment of the University of North Carolina as a core value in service to our vibrant and growing state,' Best said. 'As part of that mission, UNC-Chapel Hill will continue to welcome people from all walks of life with a variety of experiences and perspectives who come here to learn, work and live.'\nImmediately after the vote to repeal the diversity policy with no questions or discussion, the governance committee went into closed session, according to the agenda. Closed sessions are not subject to public record, according to state statutes.\nEfforts to dissolve university diversity efforts are a 'disservice' to students and create 'controversy and volatility,' former UNC System President Tom Ross said in a joint statement with Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper after the vote. Instead, Ross, who served as president from 2011 to 2016, said universities should celebrate diversity.\n'Republican legislative and university leaders who attack diversity at our public universities are failing in their duty to protect students while threatening our ability to recruit top scientists, researchers and innovators who power our economy,' Cooper said.\nHowever, conservative-leaning advocacy group Carolina Partnership for Reform said in a statement the new policy would 'go a long way toward rooting out DEI bureaucracies.'\nThe full UNC Board of Governors is scheduled to meet May 22-23 in Raleigh. Members of the board are elected to four-year terms by the state Senate and House of Representatives, which Republicans have controlled since 2011.\nRepublican House Speaker Tim Moore said fellow Republicans have expressed interest in taking up anti-DEI legislation in the session opening next Wednesday. He recently told reporters the legislature may allow the university boards to review their diversity policies first before introducing any bills.\n'It's still at the conversation stage,' Moore said.\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .",

            "summary": "High-profile rightwing influencers were briefed on House Speaker Mike Johnson's voter registration bill well in advance of its announcement in what appears to be a coordinated social media campaign meant to drum up support for the legislation, which is dead on arrival on the Senate.\nConservative influencers posted dozens of times before Johnson, R-La., publicly announced the bill alongside former President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, calling on Congress to pass the bill, which has not yet been filed, and offering policy details that are still not available to the public.\nThe legislation targets voting by non-citizens, which is already illegal and very rare. Johnson's appearance at Mar-a-Lago came at a time when his speakership is in a precarious position, with attacks from far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who has a significant social media following. Getting some public support and praise from Trump could give Johnson a bit of protection with the Republican base, as could drumming up support from conservative social media influencers.\nAt 3:50 p.m. ET on Friday, Ryan Fournier, the chair of Students for Trump who boasts a million followers on X, appears to have been the first to post the name of the bill and details of the legislation.\nJohnson's press conference was scheduled to begin at 4:30 p.m. ET on Friday but began just after 5 p.m. Neither the speaker nor his office would provide specifics on the legislation in advance of Friday's event when asked by NBC News, but his office confirmed Monday that background information about the bill had been sent in advance to conservative-leaning influencers.\nIn the hours leading up to Johnson and Trump's press conference, social media posters including Libs of TikTok, DC_Draino and EndWokeness promoted the legislation online. They all called the bill 'the SAVE Act,' though Johnson did not name it as such.\n\"PASS THE BILL,' wrote DC_Draino at 4:22 p.m., claiming the bill 'would require blue states to obtain proof of citizenship for voter registration.'\nOn X, EndWokeness wrote that the bill would add penalties for election officials registering noncitizens to vote.\nRep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, reposted EndWokeness's post at 4:40 p.m., saying he'd authored the bill. A spokesman for the Republican lawmaker said the bill has not yet been filed yet, but Roy posted a screencap of the first few lines of legislation ahead of Johnson's speech.\nhas not yet been filed yet, but Roy posted a screencap of the first few lines of legislation ahead of Johnson's speech. The bill is dead on arrival, with Democrats controlling the U.S. Senate. Johnson said Friday, though, that simply putting the bill to a vote would be \"interesting.\"\n\"When we put this bill on the floor, you're going to see a record vote by Republicans and Democrats,\" he said. \"They're going to have to go on record, do you believe that Americans and Americans alone should be the ones who vote in American elections? We're about to find out their answer.\"\nIt is illegal for non-citizens to vote in state and federal elections, though some municipalities allow non-citizen voting in local elections only.\nChrissy Clark, a conservative influencer who contributes to Turning Point USA, appears to have been one of the individuals who received early information about the legislation.\n'Speaker Mike Johnson just dropped information about the SAVE Act, which basically its only goal is that only U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections — what a concept,' Clark said in a video posted more than 20 minutes before Johnson would begin speaking.\nClark's post included numerous details about the bill that were not yet public.\n'The whole message that he's trying to portray is you should be required to provide proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration. That doesn't necessarily mean a state-issued ID,' she said in the produced short video, which was posted on TikTok and X.\nClark's post is tagged with the hashtag #partnership, a tag some influencers use to disclose they have been paid for a post. Clark did not respond to an emailed request for comment, and Johnson's office did not respond to a request for comment on paying influencers.\nAnother conservative-leaning Twitter and TikTok account, Ding News, posted a produced video about the \"common sense SAVE Act\" at 4:11 p.m., nearly an hour before the press conference took place. An email sent to Ding News was not returned.\nAnother conservative influencer, Isabella DeLuca, posted about the legislation at 5:07 p.m., at the same minute when the press conference began.\n\"Speaker Johnson just introduced the SAVE Act, a pivotal measure to fortify our democracy and save our elections,\" DeLuca wrote on Twitter.\nLast month, DeLuca was arrested on Jan. 6 charges, with the FBI saying she climbed into the Capitol through a broken window and helped hand a table out a window that was used to assault police officers. Her Twitter account had been set to private earlier in the day, before her post about Johnson's bill.\n\"America's democracy hinges on the integrity of our elections,\" the Jan. 6 defendant wrote.\nRyan J.

            "summary": "The ad war is heating up in the Arizona Senate race, with both sides launching digital attacks this week foreshadowing the battleground campaign to come.\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee launched an attack ad on Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego Thursday, after Gallego hit the Republican frontrunner, Kari Lake, with his own ad earlier this week. And it's just the appetizer in a campaign expected to run up one of the costliest tabs of any Senate contest across the country.\nNeither campaign or party is running attacks on TV right now. But the early themes previewed in digital ads, which can be released with much less expense, are likely to show up throughout the campaign.\nGallego's online jab slammed Lake for flip-flopping her stance on the state's 1864 abortion ban, rolling back tape showing the former TV anchor praising the law in 2022 during her unsuccessful bid for Arizona's governorship.\n'We have a great law on the books right now,' Lake said in the clip featured in Gallego's digital advertisement. 'I believe it's ARS 13-3603,' Lake goes on, leaving little doubt about which law she was referencing.\nThe NRSC's attack gets personal. 'Ruben Gallego walked out on his family, abandoning his newborn son, leaving his wife, and then marrying a D.C. lobbyist,' a female narrator says, calling him 'deadbeat dad Ruben Gallego.'\nGallego split from his then-wife, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, in 2016. The mayor has since endorsed the congressman in his bid for retiring independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema's seat.\nThe NRSC said its new ad will run across digital platforms and target female voters. 'Arizona women can't trust a man who divorced his wife when she was weeks away from having their child,' NRSC spokesperson Tate Mitchell said in a statement.\nWhile the online ad spending is dipping into negative territory, Gallego is already spending millions of dollars on positive statewide TV ads, introducing himself to voters as a Marine veteran who was raised by a single mother and voted in Congress to lower drug prices.\nGallego has spent nearly $3.8 million on TV ads so far this year, according to AdImpact, while Lake has spent about $30,000.\nGallego's not just outspending Lake — he's outraising her too. His campaign raised $7.5 million in the first quarter of 2024, while Lake's raised $3.6 million, according to recent Federal Election Commission filings. Gallego spent $4.4 million and ended the quarter with about $9.6 million in the bank, while Lake spent $2.2 million and ended the quarter with $2.5 million on hand.\nDuring a rally in Lake Havasu City over the weekend, Lake noted these spring splurges are just the beginning.\n'This is going to be an expensive race — $250 million is going to be spent in the U.S. Senate race in Arizona,' Lake predicted to the crowd.\nShe added, 'You guys are gonna get so sick of the TV ads, you're gonna want to, like, throw your TV off the balcony.'\nAlex Tabet",

Let us know\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know It underscores an important point: Despite all of the news, developments and drama over the past year, the Biden-Trump contest has been remarkably stable — and competitive — with any movement coming within the margin of error.\nTake the two-way ballot test. Over the course of nearly a year, Trump's percentage has been stuck from 45% to 47% of registered voters. Biden's percentage, meanwhile, has hovered from a high of 49% in the summer of 2023 to a low of 42% this January.\nOr take the names at the top of the ticket out of the equation and note the stable congressional preference. Right now, 47% prefer a GOP-controlled Congress in the poll, compared to 46% who want Democrats. The parties have been locked in that competitive position for years: The GOP number hasn't moved more than 2 points in either direction in NBC News polling since August 2021, while the Democratic number dipped outside that range just once.\nBut the latest NBC News poll also points to at least three potential wild cards that could upend this stability.\nTrump's trial: While Trump's multiple criminal indictments and legal challenges helped him with Republican primary voters in 2023 and early 2024, the NBC poll finds 50% of voters saying he's being held to the same standard as anyone accused of such a crime, versus 43% who believe he's being unfairly targeted.\nTrump's trial: While Trump's multiple criminal indictments and legal challenges helped him with Republican primary voters in 2023 and early 2024, the NBC poll finds 50% of voters saying he's being held to the same standard as anyone accused of such a crime, versus 43% who believe he's being unfairly targeted. Third party-candidates: For months, the conventional wisdom has been that the bigger the size of the third-party vote, the worse it would be for Biden. And that could still be the case, given that Trump's consistent 46% to 47% vote share becomes a winning percentage if the third-party vote is greater than 6%. Yet the poll shows Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hurting Trump more than Biden at the moment.\nThird party-candidates: For months, the conventional wisdom has been that the bigger the size of the third-party vote, the worse it would be for Biden.

Turnout: The level of high interest in this contest is at a nearly 20-year low, signaling that turnout in November could be significantly lower than it was in 2020. Does that lower turnout help Trump, given that more Republicans have high interest (70%) than Democrats do (65%)? Or does it help Biden, given that many of the voters who say they're supporting Trump ended up not participating in the 2020 or 2022 elections?\nTurnout: The level of high interest in this contest is at a nearly 20-year low, signaling that turnout in November could be significantly lower than it was in 2020.

These are all ways a stable race could quickly become unstable — and unpredictable.\nRead the full story here →\nTrump trial, day 5: The prosecutors lay out their case By Katherine Doyle More than a year after securing an indictment, New York prosecutors on Monday for the first time laid out their case against Donald Trump in a courtroom, weaving a story they say will prove that the former president, along with his 'fixer' and a tabloid publisher, conspired to cover up hush money payments.\n'This case is about a criminal conspiracy. Trump orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election,' said Matthew Colangelo, a lawyer with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office. 'Then he covered up that criminal scheme by lying in his New York business records over and over and over again.'\nThe prosecution detailed allegations of a sensational tabloid scheme to 'catch and kill' stories that could have proved damaging to Trump, a plan, the DA's office said, that was elicited with Trump's blessing and that he was directly implicated in.\nHere's what else happened on the fifth day of trial:\nThe ‘Access Hollywood' tape emerges: Prosecutors have argued that when the 'Access Hollywood' tape surfaced during the 2016 campaign, it triggered the worry that led Trump and his allies to try to keep Stormy Daniels quiet, setting off the hush money payments.\nThe ‘Access Hollywood' tape emerges: Prosecutors have argued that when the 'Access Hollywood' tape surfaced during the 2016 campaign, it triggered the worry that led Trump and his allies to try to keep Stormy Daniels quiet, setting off the hush money payments. Judge Juan Merchan has ruled that prosecutors can't play the tape for jurors, but that government lawyers can read from the transcript. And before opening statements were over, prosecutors did just that. Colangelo quoted the tape to the jury, including Trump saying: 'I just start kissing them … when you're a star, they let you do anything.'\nTrump faces a full jury for the first time: Merchan warned the full panel of 12 jurors and six alternates that they must guard carefully against outside bias as they listen to evidence in the case. While jurors may tell their employers that they are among the small group of New Yorkers who will judge Trump, they must not talk about it. Instead, as they listen to the evidence and render a verdict, they must avoid all news related to the case and not research the details or anyone involved.\nTrump faces a full jury for the first time: Merchan warned the full panel of 12 jurors and six alternates that they must guard carefully against outside bias as they listen to evidence in the case.

After hearing six different proceedings involving 13 different determinations brought by the prosecution, Merchan said he had 'greatly curtailed' the prosecution's ability to elicit evidence, including ruling out two full prior cases.\nRead more here →\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

            "excerpt": "With the chamber evenly divided, Democratic wins would restore the party's trifecta of power in the battleground state.",
            "summary": "Voters in Michigan will head to the polls Tuesday for a pair of state House special elections that will determine partisan control of the chamber.\nIn the race for the open seat in the 13th state House District — which encompasses a large part of the city of Warren, within purple Macomb County — Democrat Mai Xiong, a member of the Macomb County Board of Commissioners, is running against Republican Ronald Singer, who ran for the seat unsuccessfully in 2022. The seat, which leans Democratic, became vacant last fall when the incumbent Democrat, Lori Stone, resigned after she won an election to be the mayor of Warren.\nIn the race for the open seat in the 25th state House District — which includes, within Wayne County, some of the western suburbs of Detroit, like Westland and Sheldon — Democrat Peter Herzberg, a Westland City council member, is running against Republican Josh Powell, a U.S. Army veteran. The seat, which also leans Democratic, became vacant last fall when the incumbent Democrat, Kevin Coleman, resigned after winning an election to be the mayor of Westland.\nThe winner of each race will only serve the remainder of their predecessors' two-year terms through the end of 2024.\nPrior to the two lawmakers' resignations, Democrats had held a two-seat advantage in the state House. Their departures created a 54-54 tie in the chamber. Democrats also hold the governorship and the state Senate in Michigan, meaning that a pair of victories would again provide the party with a trifecta in state government.\nBoth districts heavily lean Democratic: In 2022, Stone won her seat with 67% support, while Coleman received 63% of the vote. But the races could still serve as a referendum on the Democratic trifecta — and on the long list of policy moves they made with it. Led by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, over the past two years Michigan Democrats have enacted laws protecting abortion rights, boosting union rights, combatting gun violence and expanding LGBTQ protections.\nFueled by continued success across the country on the issue of abortion, Democrats in the state have largely made the races about reproductive rights.\nXiong and Herzberg have emphasized their support for reproductive rights and the litany of moves made by the Democratic Legislature protecting them. Powell has said he opposes all abortion care 'without exception' and has suggested he'd try to repeal the state's abortion protections, while Singer has focused his campaign on economic issues.\n'It's significant,' Michigan Democratic state House Speaker Joe Tate said, referring to the role abortion rights is playing in both of the special elections. 'It's large — and for good reason.'\n'It's top of mind for voters,' he added.\nThe Democratic candidates have also run heavily on the accomplishments that the party achieved during its trifecta, betting that voters in these two districts within the pivotal presidential battleground will reward that list of progressive policies.\n'Michigan is a shining example of what Democrats do in leadership,' said Abhi Rahman, a spokesperson for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee — the national Democratic Party arm in charge of funding candidates for state legislative races — which invested about $48,000 in the pair of races.\n'Fundamental freedoms are at stake in Michigan,' he said. 'The Democratic trifecta is at stake.'\nDemocrats have enjoyed a solid record in special state legislative elections in recent months.\nIn February, Democrats won a state House special election in Pennsylvania, preserving the party's narrow majority in the closely watched battleground state. And last month, the Democratic candidate in a special election for a state House seat in Alabama won after she made in vitro fertilization and abortion rights central to her campaign.\nAdam Edelman",

            "summary": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Sunday maintained that she plans to follow through with an effort to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson if he doesn't resign following the chamber's passage of a $95 billion package that includes foreign aid to Ukraine.\n'Mike Johnson's leadership is over. He needs to do the right thing to resign and allow us to move forward in a controlled process,' Greene, R-Ga., said during an interview on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" 'If he doesn't do so, he will be vacated.'\nAsked whether she plans to move forward with her motion to vacate Johnson, Greene said, 'It's coming regardless of what Mike Johnson decides to do.\"\nReached for comment about the House's changing posture toward a motion to vacate, Johnson's office directed NBC News to recent remarks from the speaker, which included Johnson saying on Saturday that he doesn't walk around the Capitol \"being worried about a motion to vacate.\"\n\"I have to do my job. We did. I've done here what I believe to be the right thing, and that is to allow the House to work its will,\" he told reporters Saturday. \"And as I've said, you do the right thing and you let the chips fall where they may, and I'll continue to do that.'\nJohnson is facing backlash from hard-right members of his party after he joined Democrats on Saturday to pass a critical foreign aid package that included $60.8 billion of aid to Ukraine. Republican Reps. Paul Gosar of Arizona and Thomas Massie of Kentucky have signed onto the motion to vacate, which Greene authored but has not yet brought to the floor as a privileged resolution.\nIf the motion is brought to the floor, the three Republican votes supporting it could be enough for passage if they are joined by all Democrats in the chamber. But some House Democrats have signaled that they plan to vote to save Johnson.\nRep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., a moderate who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on Sunday blasted Greene's effort to oust Johnson when asked about her criticism of the foreign aid package.\n'What Marjorie Taylor Greene and what Thomas Massie and what Paul Gosar are trying to accomplish by removing the speaker of the house in this very moment after October 7 would only embolden China, it would only embolden Russia, [and] it would only embolden Iran,' Moskowitz said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a progressive who serves a member of the House Armed Services Committee, on Sunday said he would protect Johnson's job if members of his far-right flank go through with their threat to oust him.\n'I'm a progressive Democrat and I think you would have a few progressive Democrats doing that. And I disagree with Speaker Johnson on many issues and I've been very critical of him, but he did the right thing here,' Khanna said in an interview on ABC News' 'This Week,' referring to Johnson bringing the foreign aid package to the floor. 'And he deserves to keep his job till the end of this term.'\nThe shift from Democrats is noteworthy given their lockstep support of the motion to vacate that led to the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy last October, which ultimately resulted in Johnson getting the gavel. Members made efforts to remove speakers in previous congressional terms, but no motion ever reached the floor for a vote.\nSummer Concepcion Julie Tsirkin, Rebecca Kaplan and Kyle Stewart contributed.",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The House is poised to vote Saturday on a quartet of bills that would authorize new U.S. aid to Israel and Ukraine, alongside security assistance for the Indo-Pacific and a bill that would force TikTok's parent company to sell it or be banned in the U.S.\nThe chamber is scheduled to vote in the afternoon on the four bills in succession, one day after a rare and extraordinary bipartisan coalition teed up the votes, with more Democrats (165) than Republicans (151) voting for the 'rule' to proceed to the measures.\nThe bills are expected to pass and then go to the Senate for approval as soon as in the next few days. Taken together, they include the $95 billion aid package championed by President Joe Biden, with some changes from the version passed by the Senate two months ago.\nHolding the vote represents an act of defiance by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., against an outspoken faction of conservative rebels who oppose Ukraine funding and pushed him not to bring it to a vote. Three of them — Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. — have threatened to oust him as speaker. The passage of the bill may bring Greene one step closer to forcing a vote to remove him.\nAfter months of wavering, Johnson sided with Biden, Democrats and the Republicans who believe that helping Ukraine fend off Russian aggression is essential to U.S. national security interests, citing briefings he has received and warning: 'Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed.'\n'I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,' Johnson told reporters, noting that his son will enter the Naval Academy this year. 'This is a live-fire exercise for me as it is so many American families. This is not a game, this is not a joke.'\nAhead of the vote, former President Donald Trump issued a confusing statement that sympathized with both the pro- and anti-Ukraine aid factions of the GOP without taking a clear position.\nApart from the three aid bills, the fourth measure includes a policy to force the China-based ByteDance to sell TikTok within nine months — which the president could extend to a year — or face a nationwide ban. The policy, which lengthens the time frame for a sale from an earlier House bill, has Senate buy-in along with Biden's support, putting TikTok closer than ever to a ban in the U.S.\nIf they pass, the bills are expected to be packaged together and sent to the Senate, which will have to vote on the whole legislation to send it to Biden's desk to sign into law. It's unclear when that will happen, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are outspoken proponents of the foreign aid provisions in the package.\n'I hope that President Biden will soon have on his desk long-awaited funding to support our friends in Ukraine and Israel and the Indo-Pacific, and aid for innocent civilians in need of humanitarian aid in Gaza and around the world,' Schumer said before the House vote, cautioning that Ukraine's hopes against Russia would diminish without additional U.S. weapons to defend themselves.\nLate Friday, Schumer said the Senate was working to get unanimous agreement to move quickly to vote on the foreign aid legislation. 'We are working on an agreement for consideration of the supplemental,' he said on the Senate floor.\nMcConnell said earlier this week: 'Here's the political reality: If you think the fall of Afghanistan was bad, the fall of a European capital like Kyiv to Russian troops will be unimaginably worse, and if stalled American assistance makes that outcome possible, there's no question when the blame will land, on us.'\nSahil Kapur Rebecca Kaplan and Frank Thorp V contributed.",

            "summary": "Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the Republican National Committee announced a massive 'election integrity' operation on Friday, promising to deploy 100,000 volunteers and attorneys to battleground states to 'protect the vote and ensure a big win' in November.\nIn a press release, officials said they wanted the volunteers and lawyers to monitor logic and accuracy testing, early voting, ballot tabulation, mail ballot processing and Election Day voting, as well as post-election canvasses, audits, and recounts. The release suggests they may intend to recruit poll workers, too.\n'Having the right people to count the ballots is just as important as turning out voters on Election Day,' Trump said in the release..\n\"The RNC is hiring hundreds of election integrity staff across the map — more than ever before because our Party will be recruiting thousands of more observers to protect the vote in 2024. These campaign officials in states are tasked with recruiting, training, and when possible, shifting poll watchers and poll workers day in and day out,\" added RNC co-chair Lara Trump.\nPoll watching is a normal part of elections — both parties do it — but experts warn that unruly operations can be a problem. And as Trump and his allies continue to make false claims about the 2020 election, some experts worry that empowering these sort of observers at polling sites could hamper normal election operations or intimidate voters.\nThe GOP release notes they plan to work with \"passionate grassroots coalitions who are deeply invested in fighting voter fraud.\"\nThe planned operation would double the RNC's promised 50,000-person operation from 2020, though some experts said both numbers figures were aspirational and unrealistic. The RNC did not respond to a request for data on how many people had volunteered or been staffed in recent elections.\n'I've actually run a program like this with real people,' said Justin Levitt, a former advisor in the Biden White House on democracy issues who has previously worked in the Department of Justice on voting issues. 'We did really well and got multiple tens of thousands.'\nRecruiting individuals in particular to monitor for voter fraud, he said, is even harder than staffing poll workers.\n'They're recruiting people to stand there and watch for something that's not going to happen. Can you please show up and watch, wait for the UFO for 15 hours?' he said.\nMarc Elias, a leading Democratic election lawyer, agreed the 100,000 number was unrealistic, but said he was still concerned about the plans.\n\"I think they are going to have a massive voter suppression operation and it is going to involve very, very large numbers of people and very, very large numbers of lawyers,\" he said. \"I think we need to take the RNC literally and seriously — except on their numbers.\"\nLauren Groh-Wargo, executive director of Fair Fight PAC, the political advocacy arm of the Georgia voting rights group of the same name, said the effort would harm election administration.\n'The Republican National Committee's new voter suppression unit is just the latest version of their cynical playbook to divide and intimidate voters and steal American's voices by building an operation based on the lie of voter fraud,' she said in a statement.\nUntil 2018, the RNC's poll watching plans were limited by a consent decree, which required it seek court approval to prove that any poll watching work wasn't discriminatory.\nThat decree was put into place after Democrats sued and accused the RNC of sending armed, off-duty police officers to patrol the polls in minority neighborhoods in 1981. The decree required them to seek prior court approval for poll watching operations, but expired at the end of 2017 after 35 years.\nPoll observers are a normal and beneficial part of the election process when they are well trained and do not interfere with administrators work, said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, a group that helps support election officials. An army of 100,000 would present a different dynamic, he said, but noted that election workers are prepared to handle unruly observers if they appear.\n\"They will protect the right of their voters to vote free of intimidation. If observers are acting any way contrary to voters interests or interfering with poll workers, they will be dealt with under the laws of the state,\" he said.\nJane C. Timm",

            "summary": "An editor for National Public Radio resigned Wednesday just days after he inflamed the ongoing culture war about mainstream media with an essay about what he considers the news outlet's liberal leanings.\nUri Berliner, who was a senior business editor, wrote an essay for the right-leaning online publication The Free Press in which he said he believes NPR is losing the public's trust.\nNPR, a nonprofit radio network, has an 'absence of viewpoint diversity,' he wrote in the essay, which was published April 9. It 'has always had a liberal bent,' but now an 'open-minded spirit no longer exists within NPR,' he wrote.\nThe essay triggered a wave of scrutiny of NPR from conservatives, some of whom responded to it with calls to defund the news organization, which receives federal funding through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. NPR says on its website that federal funding is 'essential' to NPR but that 'less than 1% of NPR's annual operating budget comes in the form of grants from CPB and federal agencies and departments.'\nUri Berliner in 2017. JP Yim / WireImage file In a resignation statement on X, Berliner briefly elaborated on the reason for his departure, which came days after NPR reported that it had suspended him for five days without pay following the op-ed's release.\nNPR's chief business editor, Pallavi Gogoi, had told Berliner about its requirement to secure approval before he appeared in outside media, according to NPR's report.\n'I don't support calls to defund NPR,' Berliner wrote. 'I respect the integrity of my colleagues and wish for NPR to thrive and do important journalism. But I cannot work in a newsroom where I am disparaged by a new CEO whose divisive views confirm the very problems at NPR I cite in my Free Press essay.'\nBerliner did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. A representative for NPR said it 'does not comment on individual personnel matters.'\nBerliner's essay gained traction on X, with many conservatives homing in on his thoughts about NPR's political makeup. He wrote: 'In D.C., where NPR is headquartered and many of us live, I found 87 registered Democrats working in editorial positions and zero Republicans. None.'\nHe also criticized NPR's coverage, or lack thereof, of certain stories, such as the Mueller report, Hunter Biden's laptop, the origins of Covid-19 and systemic racism following the murder of George Floyd.\nHigh-profile supporters of Berliner's essay, including former President Donald Trump and X owner Elon Musk, shared criticism of NPR and its CEO, Katherine Maher.\n'NO MORE FUNDING FOR NPR, A TOTAL SCAM! EDITOR SAID THEY HAVE NO REPUBLICANS, AND IS ONLY USED TO ‘DAMAGE TRUMP.' THEY ARE A LIBERAL DISINFORMATION MACHINE. NOT ONE DOLLAR!!!' Trump wrote on Truth Social on April 10.\nMusk wrote on X that the 'head of NPR hates the Constitution of the USA' in response to a clip of Maher discussing the challenges in fighting disinformation and honoring the First Amendment right to free speech.\nMeanwhile, some journalists at NPR pushed back against Berliner's accusations.\n'Morning Edition' co-host Steve Inskeep shared his take in a post on his Substack newsletter, saying he believes Berliner failed to 'engage anyone who had a different point of view.'\n'Having been asked, I answered: my colleague's article was filled with errors and omissions,' he wrote, adding, 'The errors do make NPR look bad, because it's embarrassing that an NPR journalist would make so many.'\nNPR's chief news executive, Edith Chapin, also denied Berliner's assessment of the newsroom in a memo to staff members, according to NPR.\n'We're proud to stand behind the exceptional work that our desks and shows do to cover a wide range of challenging stories,' she wrote. 'We believe that inclusion — among our staff, with our sourcing, and in our overall coverage — is critical to telling the nuanced stories of this country and our world.'\nMaher also said Monday in a statement to NPR: 'In America everyone is entitled to free speech as a private citizen. What matters is NPR's work and my commitment as its CEO: public service, editorial independence, and the mission to serve all of the American public.

Welcome to Sunday, it's Meet the Press.\nANNOUNCER:\nFrom NBC News in Washington, the longest-running show in television history. This is Meet the Press with Kristen Welker.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nGood Sunday morning. We begin with our brand new NBC News poll and the headline President Biden is closing the gap with former President Trump. Trump leads Biden by two points in a head-to-head matchup, 46 to 44%. Biden has narrowed that deficit against Trump from 5 points in January. And when third party candidates, including Robert F. Kennedy, are included, Biden leads by two points, 39 to 37%. The president's job approval has also ticked up to 42%, up five points from January. The last time we've seen a five-point increase for an incumbent president in their re-election year was Bill Clinton in 1996. There are still troubling numbers in the poll for Biden. He trails Trump by 22 points on dealing with inflation and the cost of living. All of it comes amid a major foreign policy development. Six months after the president delivered an Oval Office speech pleading for wartime aid for Ukraine, $61 billion dollars in new funding finally passed on Saturday 311 to 112.\n[START TAPE]\nREP. MARC MOLINARO:\nThe bill is passed.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nA moment of bipartisanship in a Congress primarily defined by its dysfunction. 101 Republicans and 210 Democrats voted in favor. But more Republicans, 112, opposed it. Congress also passed new aid for Israel and Taiwan, along with a measure to force TikTok parent company ByteDance to sell the app. New aid for Ukraine came only after Republican Speaker Mike Johnson, who once opposed it, did an about-face and put his job on the line to get it through, amid threats from three far right Republicans to oust him.\n[START TAPE]\nSPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON:\nIf we turn our backs right now, the consequences could be devastating.\nREPORTER:\nYou're being asked to resign, will you?\nSPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON:\nNo, listen, I – I – as I've said many times I don't walk around this building being worried about a motion to vacate. I have to do my job. We – we did. I've done here what I believe to be the right thing and that is to allow the house to work its will and as I've said you do the right thing and you let the chips fall where they may.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThe Pentagon has said it has a massive infusion of military aid for Ukraine ready to go. It comes as Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said that without this support, we will have no chance of winning. Ukraine's top military commander issued a bleak assessment of the army's positions on the eastern front, saying they have worsened significantly in recent days. And the top American military commander in Europe told members of Congress that Russia will soon be able to fire ten shells for every Ukrainian shell.\n[START TAPE]\nGEN. CHRISTOPHER CAVOLI:\nIf one side can shoot and the other side can't shoot back, the side that can't shoot back loses.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nJoining me now is the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. President Zelenskyy, welcome back to Meet the Press.\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nGood morning, and greetings to you.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, President Zelenskyy, it is an historic morning. I want to get your reaction to this major news, the House approving $61 billion in aid to Ukraine. It's expected to pass through the Senate. But you have been asking for this aid for six months. In that time, you have run out of ammunition. You've suffered setbacks on the battlefield. Will you get this aid in time to make a difference?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nYeah, it's been so important. And we'd like to say thanks to the Congress for the bipartisan support. And we'd like to say thanks to Speaker Johnson and President Biden. Indeed, it is so important, the support from the United States of America. Of course, we need the support of the American people because, of course, the political decisions depend on the public opinion. And this aid will strengthen Ukraine, and send the Kremlin a powerful signal that it will not be the second Afghanistan. The United States will stay with Ukraine, will protect the Ukrainians, and they will protect – they will protect democracy in the world. This is the show of leadership and strength of the United States. And I think, indeed, now we've reached this important moment. For half a year we've been waiting and I would like to say thanks to all the team on my side and on the U.S. side, the team who did everything so that we would get this positive vote. And today, we definitely need this aid. And Kristen, we really need to get this to the final point. We need to get it approved by the Senate. And then we want to get things as fast as possible so that we get some tangible assistance for the soldiers on the front line as soon as possible, not in another six months, so that they will be able to move ahead.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou know, you said this week, President Zelenskyy, that Ukraine would have 'no chance of winning' without more U.S. support. And I guess the question is can Ukraine now win this war? Or is the United States merely giving you enough aid to prolong this war?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nThank you. I think this support will really strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine. And we will have a chance for victory if Ukraine really gets the weapon system which we need so much. We - thousands of soldiers need so much, and this aid should not be just spread into layers all over, but it has to end up in tangible weapon systems. Some really crucial weapon systems which are hard to get. The long-range artillery and I really appreciate that it mentions ATACMs, long-range weapons. And it's important because we need long-range weapons to not lose people on the front line. Because we have – we have casualties because we cannot reach that far. Our weapons are not that long-range. So we need it, and air defense. This is crucial. These are the priorities now.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, as you know, this aid was held up for half a year because there is fierce opposition to sending war aid to Ukraine, particularly amongst some Republicans. How long should Americans be expected to fund the war in Ukraine?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nThe Americans are not funding the war in Ukraine. They foremost protect freedom and democracy all over Europe. And Ukraine is fighting, and Ukraine is sending its best sons and daughters to the front line and this reduces the price for all Europe, for all NATO. It reduces the price for everyone, including the U.S. as the leaders in NATO. U.S. army now does not have to fight protecting NATO countries. Ukrainians are doing that. And it's only the ammo that the civilized world is providing. And I think it's a good decision. That is why we do need to keep supporting. While Ukraine stands, there's no direct war between U.S. or NATO and Russian aggression. So Ukraine is still fighting, and Ukraine is protecting all the others.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nBut President Zelenskyy, can you give Americans a sense of the timeline? Will you still need as much aid this time next year? Or do you think you can turn the corner on Russia? What's the timeline?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nWell, it depends on when we actually get weapons on the ground, as you said it Kristen. If we get it in half a year. Well, we've had the process to hold for half a year. And we had losses in several directions. The losses in men, in equipment. In the east it was very difficult. And we did lose the initiative there. Now we have all the chance to stabilize the situation and to overtake the initiative. And that's why we need to actually have the weapon systems. When we get it, when we have it in our arms, then we do have the chance to take this initiative and to move ahead to protect Ukraine. But giving U.S. specific timeline of the war, well, it depends on how soon we get this aid. There are so many variables, so many factors. And sometimes when we protect the important line, you retreat because you don't have enough forces and equipment. And then retaking the climb would take two or three times more. And I'm not saying that this is how it's going to end up. But things are possible, and I can give you an example with F-16. It's a great example. The decision to supply F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, we've had it a year ago. One year ago, we got the positive response. Ukraine should receive these fighter jets, so that not only air defense could protect the sky, but we also have more than jets. A year has passed. We still don't have the jets in Ukraine. So it's very difficult to do any forecast. I would like us to be open and very, very specific. From the moment we get our hands on these weapon systems, well, from that moment, we can talk about the timeline.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, Ukrainian intelligence suggests that the Kremlin is preparing for a major offensive in the coming months. You have said by your own account that they are prepared to outgun you ten to one in fire power by some estimations. Will you be ready for that offensive?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nWe are preparing. The personnel is preparing. The soldiers are engaged in training. And I don't want to repeat myself, but we are waiting for the weapon systems because we want to have the brigades fully equipped. Some of them are exhausted. We need to replace them. But these new brigades, they have to have the equipment. Russia wants to mobilize 300,000 people by June 1st. We are getting ready for this. By May 9th, Russia expects that in the east of Ukraine they will take Chasiv Yar city. I visited the region recently. I talked to the soldiers. The soldiers say that they lack equipment. They need to fight Russian reconnaissance drones, which essentially guide the artillery and we need artillery shells. I hope we will be able to stay, and the weapons will come on time, and we will repel the enemy and then we'll break the plans of the Russian Federation with regards to this full-scale offensive.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nI want to ask you, President Zelenskyy, about reports of a lack of morale. Some 650,000 men who are eligible to fight, we are told, have fled Ukraine. You have lowered the draft eligible age, but you've resisted a full call-up of all Ukrainian men. What do you say to young men who don't want to fight, who don't want to risk their lives in this war for their country?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nThis war is the war for the sake of all of us. This is our land. We don't have another place to go. And the citizens of Ukraine understand that. Of course, there are people who don't want to, are not ready. But we do have this mobilization campaign. We do have the draft. We do have a strong army. And we can be frank. In Russia, of course they have more people and people are forced there. So, for example, if someone in Russia is deserting the battlefield, they just shoot them on sight. We cannot do that because we have the democratic values, believe in the democratic country. So, to be frank, in Ukraine we have a lot of people who are ready to protect the motherland. But of course the motivation, the morale can go down, especially when they go to the front line and they see that, well, there are no shells. There is no equipment. That's why the aid from the states is so important. And people need to be trained by professional people and they need to have the equipment to be used so that they have this so people, not only on the training field, but also on the actual battlefield. And then, indeed, they can show the performance on the front line. This is very important.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy –\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\n– And then the morale will go high. And then they will indeed defend the motherland.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThe Washington Post is reporting that Donald Trump has said privately he could end Russia's war in Ukraine by pressuring Ukraine to give up some territory like Crimea, like the Donbas region. What is your reaction and realistically speaking do you see this war ending in a negotiation with Russia.\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nLet's just say that, well, I'm a president of a country at war. And rumors and different hearsay, I don't believe that. When Trump comes here and would tell me their formula of peace, then I would be able to provide the response. At the moment, I know that, well, things Putin wants to show, they cannot happen.And I'm sure that people who know him well, they know. But you can never trust Putin. It's impossible. So the strategy of ending the war should be based not on the words which Putin says or some other people from his entourage say, but on something very specific. Something – something very tangible in Ukraine that is independent and democratic. And I'm confident that everyone is interested in that. All the political leaders in the U.S., they are also interested to have Ukraine independent and sovereign and democratic. It's of interest for both the Republicans and the Democrats.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, back in February Donald Trump encouraged Putin to invade NATO countries that he doesn't believe are contributing enough to defense spending. What kind of a message do you think that sends to the world?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nWell, I don't know the details of that speech. I know for sure if Ukraine fails, then Putin – then Putin definitely will invade the Baltic countries. Why? Not because there's some interesting idea, strategy, but because Putin wants to return the influence of the Soviet Union. And he really wants to retake the force to war. He wants to retake all former Soviet republics and now independent states. Whether they are in the NATO or not, he doesn't care. That is why this is his strategy. Of course, after the Baltic states, also Poland and parts of Germany would also –\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, big picture. Germany's top military official has warned that Putin could be ready to attack NATO countries in as soon as five years, following up on what you're saying. How big of a threat do you see Putin to the West?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nI think he does want to go further. As I said, he wants to reinstate Soviet Union and the Soviet – the Soviet bloc. And they do that in terms of information, misinformation. They just drive different political groups and democracies. Not only Europe, in Latin America, in Africa, they have the influence everywhere. And they do this to split the world. So the risk is high. I think this German diplomat said that it's not even about the wish of Putin, but it's that if Putin is not stopped, then Putin is ready to attack NATO. Even look at the sheer size of the army and the weapons that they have. So we have to be ready to stop him now. Because the froze in conflicts, well, we've seen that in Georgia. We've seen that in other countries. So if we give the big pause to Putin, if we freeze the war right where we are, this will enable him because all his industry will start working not for the war in Ukraine, but will start working for the war against NATO.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, you are not just a president. You are also a father. You have survived multiple assassination attempts. Tens of thousands of your fellow citizens have been killed and injured. Millions have left their homes. Have you ever lost hope?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nYou can never lose hope. You can never lose hope. You can never lose freedom. You can never lose independence. Otherwise, you just lose everything. You lose your state. You lose your security for your children, for – all the children in Ukraine are my children. I will then lose everything. And I have to show the example. If I lose hope, well, my children would lose their future independent country. And then we would lose Ukraine as – as the nation. It's not only about the territory. It's about ourselves, our identity. So we cannot lose hope. We've had different moments, some very cruel. There were moments of challenge. And I'm sure in the history of the United States they also had many moments when the people of the U.S. had to fight for their independence. We remember the period of struggling, when many people lost hope. Or some people emigrated to France. But some people raised the banner, the United States, the banner of independence. And some people were skeptical on both sides of the ocean, in Europe too. But people didn't give up. And I think, well, you got the independent country. And the world got this great democracy. So we cannot lose hope either.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, thank you for being here on this monumental morning. We really appreciate your perspective and having a chance to talk to you. When we come back, Steve Kornacki is here with the results of our latest NBC News poll.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. For more on the NBC News poll, I'm joined by National Political Correspondent Steve Kornacki to break down the numbers. A lot of headlines here, Steve.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nAbsolutely, Kristen. I think the biggest headline, this. Let's give you the bottom line. Donald Trump does lead Joe Biden 46% to 44% in our poll. But this is a tightening from our last poll. You could see three months ago Donald Trump had a five-point lead against the current president. That five-point lead, now down to two points, so there is progress here for Biden in the last three months.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nComing after the State of the Union, and he's had a campaign blitz.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nYeah, and the Democratic primaries, such as they were, coming to an end. Perhaps there's Democrats rallying around Biden, too. Also, I think not coincidentally, this slight improvement here for Biden tracks with a slight improvement in his job approval rating. It now sits at 42%. Again, go back to our last poll, look at this. He was in all-time-low-for-him territory last time around. Now up back over 40%, the highest Biden's job approval has been in our poll since last spring. So, again, these are encouraging signs for Joe Biden; although, broader picture here, this 42% approval rating, history says probably by itself not enough. He's probably going to need more because put this in some context here: these are other recent presidents. At this point in their reelection campaigns, where were their approval ratings? Again, you see Biden's 42%. One thing that jumps out: they were all higher than Joe Biden. The other thing, the two presidents on this list who did not win reelection of course: Donald Trump four years ago, he was at 46%; and back in 1992 George H.W. Bush, he was at 43%. Biden below both of those. The last time Biden's been at this level, 46%, you've got to back to the start of 2023. The last time he was higher than that, you've got to go back to the summer of 2021, his first year as president. So Biden has some work to do on that front. And also troubling for the Biden campaign, the erosion of public confidence on a number of critical fronts. We asked voters in this poll about a number of leadership characteristics here. \"Which candidate would be better?\" There are two, only two, where Biden has the edge over Trump. Abortion, we've talked about this one, seen this for a long time here.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThat's a big one.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nIt is. Certainly, that's the biggest Biden advantage in this poll. And then bringing the country together, Biden you see performing better than Trump. But I think the headline here is you add those two numbers together, you're not even close to 100. That means a lot of voters think neither candidate is better on that. And then on every other front here, we talk about the erosion for Biden and now, you start to see it. Look at these numbers. Trump advantages on all of these traits.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd I stop here because competent and effective, that was President Biden's, the crux of his campaign pitch back in 2020.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nAnd we actually polled this question in 2020, and it was basically the exact opposite. It was Biden with about a ten-point advantage over Trump and, again, same with handling of crisis. Biden had the edge over Trump. And how about this? It's the former president, the current president. We don't really see matchups like this. Well, now we can measure it. Who has the strongest record as president? And, again, Trump outpacing Biden on that front. And, again, you've got to mention this one, too. \"Necessary mental and physical health.\" We asked this four years ago, it was a wash. It's now a clear liability for Joe Biden. So these are all troubling numbers for Biden, but it's not to say there aren't warning signs for Donald Trump in this poll either.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, Trump and his campaign are hoping a third-party candidate might give them a little bit of a boost, but our poll shows it's a little bit murkier than that.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nThat's the thing, because, again, we show a 46-44 race here for Donald Trump. Again, all those liabilities for Biden, Trump only ahead two. What the Trump folks have been hoping is RFK, third-party candidates, they gobble up some votes and Trump doesn't need to get to 50%. But look what happens when we add RFK's name to the mix. Suddenly, we have a new leader. Joe Biden, 39%; Donald Trump, 37%. There's Kennedy getting 13%. In other words, we're seeing by a better than 2:1 margin, it's Trump voters who are flipping over to Kennedy in this scenario, not Biden voters. You see it right here. 15% of Trump voters, when we add RFK's name to the mix, they go to RFK. Only 7% of Biden voters. There's a big change right there.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nDefies conventional wisdom. There's no doubt about that.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nAbsolutely. I think we haven't seen this in other polls. And one final note, Kristen, as well, is the question of enthusiasm. And I thought this really jumped out here. The most engaged voters, those who voted in 2020, voted in the midterm elections, those folks are voting for Biden by nine points. Where Trump's strength is, why he leads Biden, it's voters who don't typically turn out in many elections. Didn't vote in '20, didn't vote in '22, they are with Trump by more than 20 points. And the warning sign for Trump in relying on this kind of voter is this: we are seeing the lowest level of –\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWow.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\n– interest since we started asking this question back in 2008. \"Are you very interested in the election?\" Sixty-four percent, that's lower than any other time at this point where we have polled this before. So, again, lower interest. Maybe those voters who in the polls are saying they're for Trump, are we sure they're going to actually vote in November? The Trump campaign better hope so.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWe'll have to see if that ticks up if we get closer to Election Day. Steve Kornacki, thank you so much for being here.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nYou got it.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWe really appreciate it. When we come back, the jury will hear opening statements in Donald Trump's first criminal trial. What impact will it have on voters? The panel is next.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. The panel is here: NBC News chief Washington correspondent Andrea Mitchell; Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher; and Matt Gorman, former senior communications advisor for Tim Scott for America. Andrea, I have to start with you. There's a lot to unpack. Let's start with President Zelenskyy. What were your key takeaways from our conversation?\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nThat he's really worried about the surge – the Russian surge in what we expect to be May, June, July. This six months was critical. They had a really good chance of winning, before the six months of no aid from the U.S., the weapons that only the U.S. can provide. And after six months, they can lose. They can lose, if the weapons don't get there soon enough. So now it's supply chain. He pointed out that the F-16s are still not there, and they were approved a year ago. And talking to Ukrainian officials, and you heard him today, they need the long-range weapons. They still don't have the ATACMS, those long-range missiles. They're supposedly in the package, the administration is deciding. Ukrainian officials say they've got to get them because the Russian launches, the artillery launches, not only do they have the ammo – they don't have the ammo, they don't have the manpower, Ukraine doesn't have any more – but Russia has that huge advantage, 10:1 in artillery, but they can't take that artillery out, because they don't have the long-range missiles. U.S. has been really worried about not letting them fire into Russian territory. The Ukrainians tell me they really want to, but they do have that restriction. They have restrictions that, frankly, are not placed on Israel. And they're watching Israel getting, you know -- despite all the controversy over Gaza, Israel has the support that Ukraine doesn't have. And I also think that it was really interesting that he ducked the two questions you asked about Donald Trump. He knows this is a close election. And the bottom line is he knows that Donald Trump has said that Ukraine can be forced at the negotiating table to give territory up to Russia. By next November, if Donald Trump is elected, I think it's all possible that Ukraine can still lose this war, despite their great spirit.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, I'm so glad that you bring up two points: One, that he did choose his words very carefully on Donald Trump; and the factor of Israel, the fact that Ukraine is so concerned, Matt Gorman, that the world has forgotten about them as attention has turned to the Middle East, to what's happening in Gaza. And of course, House Speaker Mike Johnson really at the center of the battles for more aid for Ukraine and Israel. Both were approved yesterday, but there's so much opposition within his own party, three conservative Republicans threatening to oust him over this. But it seemed like the temperature was turned down a little bit, yesterday. What is your assessment? How in jeopardy is his job?\nMATT GORMAN:\nIn the short term, not as much as I think people think. The real threat to Mike Johnson isn't now; it's November, it's post-election. Republicans are going to choose their leaders for the next Congress. They'll already have to choose a Senate leader. I think, until then, Democrats and Republicans will cobble together a majority on a motion to vacate, if it comes up. And I think Republicans want to hold on until then. Let's face it: also, too, no one really wants to be speaker right now, other than Mike Johnson. I thought it was notable that Steve Scalise and Tom Emmer voted with Johnson; notable who didn't, Elise Stefanik. If a successful move is going to be made, it's not until November.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYeah. Only member of the Republican leadership who did not vote for it. Cornell, let's talk about this poll: President Biden narrowing the gap with former President Trump, not a big surprise. But what stood out to you in the crosstabs?\nCORNELL BELCHER:\nWhat stands out to me is – well, first of all, great interview, by the way, groundbreaking interview. Spot on. What stood out to me is – surprise, surprise – polls are closing. And polls continue to shrink and get tighter and tighter because that's what happens in this country. And if you go back to our polling, go back to our polling back in October of last year, Donald Trump was at 46%. What is he, throughout all our NBC polling? He's at 46%. What is he at right now? At 46%. Donald Trump, what did he get in the last election? He got 46%. His support stays solid. Where I'm worried about or where I see you can see growth here is, I think Donald Trump is at his ceiling, and Biden is close to his floor. Where he's off most? He's off most among young voters. He is – and the other part about this is the enthusiasm, which I think is really the headline, is that if these young voters aren't enthusiastic and they don't show up and break for Biden big, that's how Trump wins.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAndrea, pick up on that point, because this is all going on against the backdrop of Donald Trump in court for his first criminal trial this week.\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nYet, the fact is we don't know how that is going to play. Up until now, these legal cases have only helped him fundraising, made him, you know, tell people he's a victim, energized his base. And so he's risen in the polls with every indictment. Now, we're going to see him really powerless. The judge has been very effective. And how they handle the gag order is yet to be seen, while Joe Biden is campaigning. The problem for Joe Biden and the Democrats is it's is crowding out – the trial is crowding out the trial, is crowding out everything else. So Joe Biden goes out and does major policy things, the steel tariffs in Pennsylvania, everything else that he's doing. Student loans is breaking through, a lit bit. But everything else is crowded out. And it's the Trump story. And that's what happened in 2016 to Hillary Clinton. And that could be replicated this year. I think it's really – I think the enthusiasm issue and the young voter issue is critical. And as long as this war in Gaza goes on, this is going to be a problem with young voters because they have off ramp. That off ramp is RKF Jr. And I know your poll shows that RKF Jr. would hurt Trump more than Biden, hypothetically, and it's very early in polling, you know, to say who, but I know the White House is more afraid of –\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nIs jittery, yeah.\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nThe family certainly is because it was very hard for those siblings to come out and do that. They only did it because they think he really hurts them, Joe Biden, more than Donald Trump.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nMatt Gorman, what about all of that?\nMATT GORMAN:\nYeah. Look, I was encouraged because when I was going into the trial, I was nervous that all the talk was going to be simply coming from Trump, his message was going to be about himself and the trial. I was surprised, going in the bodega, I thought it was smart, it leaned into issues like immigration, the migrant crisis, and crime that are winning issues, as we saw in the poll, for Republicans and Trump. He needs to continue to do that, get a message that's not just about himself, while he's sitting in the courtroom.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nHow does the courtroom optics play, Cornell?\nCORNELL BELCHER:\nAndrea, you're spot on about him – about him dominating the news, but it's negative news, right? This is different –\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nThat's a very good point.\nCORNELL BELCHER:\nAnd he doesn't look strong. He looks - he looks weak there. And so, to a certain extent, I don't –I don't mind if he's in court every day, dominating the news, because it's negative news.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nOkay. All right. Great conversation. We covered a lot of ground, but thank you.\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nCongratulations on a great interview.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThank you, Andrea. Thank you, all. When we come back, as the athletes prepare for the Summer Olympics in Paris, we look back on the U.S. decision to boycott the games after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Our Meet the Press Minute is next.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. We have officially crossed the 100-day mark to the 2024 Olympics, as Paris prepares to host the competition, this summer. But the Olympics are not just about sports; they've also made history. The United States led an international boycott of the 1980 games in Moscow to protest the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. President Jimmy Carter announced his historic decision right here on Meet the Press.\n[START TAPE]\nPRES. JIMMY CARTER:\nNeither I know the American people would support the sending of an American team to Moscow with Soviet invasion troops in Afghanistan. I'll send a message today to the United States Olympic Committee, spelling out my own position, that unless the Soviets withdraw their troops, within a month, from Afghanistan, that the Olympic games be moved from Moscow to an alternate site or multiple sites, or postponed, or canceled. If the Soviets do not withdraw their troops immediately from Afghanistan within a month, I will not support the sending of an American team to the Olympics.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd you can watch the Paris Olympics this summer on NBC and streaming on Peacock. When we come back, presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin joins me for our Meet the Moment conversation with lessons from the past, as America's democracy is being tested once again.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. As she likes to say, Doris Kearns Goodwin has spent most of her career writing about dead presidents, immersing herself in their papers, diaries and letters in an attempt to being them back to life. In a new book, \"An Unfinished Love Story,\" the presidential historian turns that same attention to her marriage. Before his death, she opened more than 300 boxes of documents and memorabilia with her husband Richard Goodwin, who served as a speechwriter for President John F. Kennedy: a time capsule of their life in the 1960's. In her twenties, Doris was chosen to be a White House fellow for President Lyndon Johnson, one of only three women out of the 16 fellows selected, and developed a loyalty and closeness to President Johnson which has lasted her entire life. I sat down with Doris for a Meet the Moment conversation on her new book and the resilience of America, even in turbulent times.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou have typically written presidential biographies. This is a biography to some extent of your husband, and it is also a love story. What was the process like of writing this book as compared to all of your other incredible works?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nWell, I was so used to writing about presidents who had archives, and I would want to talk to them. I knew them so well, because it took me so long to write those books, longer to write the book about World War II than the war to be fought, longer to write about the Civil War than twice the Civil War. And I would always ask them questions, and they never answered me. So this time, I had this guy, my guy, right across the hall from me in the same study, and I was able to talk to him. And he could answer my questions. And he had an archive – a mini archive of what presidents have – memos, diaries, letters. He just had saved everything in 300 boxes and finally decided when he turned 80 to open them. And what it really opened was a door to the 1960s, a decade that I'd lived in but I was able to learn through him starting at the beginning with John Kennedy, ending with Bobby Kennedy's death and the Democratic Convention.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou talk about the fact that after your husband passed, it was a struggle for you to finish this project that was a labor of love. You write, \"I found myself edging toward a commitment to finish the project influenced by headlines announcing divisions between Black and white, old and young, rich and poor, divisions that made it increasingly evident that the momentous issues emanating from the '60s remain the unresolved stuff of our everyday lives.\"\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nYeah, I think that's what really decided me. I knew if I were going to work on it, it was going to take years. My books take so long, so it was a huge commitment, and I was going to be writing as an historian, not simply as somebody writing about my husband. And so, once I realized that the '60s really had a message to the people today, and I believe that's so. Because we look at the '60s in a sad way because it ended with the riots, it ended with anti-war violence, it ended with Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy being killed. But when you start at the beginning, it was a decade in which young people in particular were powered by the conviction they could make a difference. And they joined the Peace Corps. The people who were in the Freedom Rides and the sit-ins, in the marches against segregation, marches for the vote. The beginning of the women's movement is there, the gay rights movement. It's a time when the air is filled with that belief that if you work together, you can change the government.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, when you look across the political spectrum, do you see leaders right now who are meeting this moment where so many people wonder if our democracy will stay intact?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nI mean, I don't know that we're fighting it the same way we need to be. This is one of the most perilous moments, and there are people obviously in local areas. There are people in states. There are some people in Washington. But the overall sense is, sometimes we've become too much of spectators watching what's happening to ourselves. And – and one of the things Dante said is that \"The lowest place in Hell are for those people in a moral crisis who remain neutral or remain silent.\" We are in a moral crisis right now, and that's what history – I always feel so – so positive about what history can teach us, because we've lived through really hard times before. And these are hard times, however, and it won't get better unless we act, unless we take seriously our citizen responsibilities and use the qualities of character that we need to bring into politics.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nHow afraid, how concerned are you that January 6th could happen again?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nWell, because we're not remembering it correctly. That – that – what history – I was so certain as an historian, and I was on television saying, \"This is going to change public sentiment.\" Just as certain things happened in the '50s that made people understand in the '60s that slavery had to be ended, public sentiment finally got changed. I thought it had, but everything is so breaking news today, and one thing tops on another. I thought the summer after January 6th when the hearings took place, that would change public sentiment. But I still think in the end that the majority of the people understood what happened in that election. I think the majority of people are for the basic values that we're talking about right now for democracy. And it's just a matter of them speaking out and recognizing that it is in danger, and it's up to us. It's not up to somebody else, it's up to us to save it.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd the Republican nominee has yet to accept the results of the last election. Within the context of this conversation and your concerns about the nation's democracy, how much of a threat do you think the democracy is facing right now, and do you think the country can survive this threat?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nWell, I think the real threat is when the Republican – former President says that \"if he doesn't win, he won't accept the results of this next election,\" which means that we may have a recurring battle for who's really – who's really elected each time we do this. And that's a real problem. I mean, all the candidates, when you look at the ones who lost, it's really hard to lose, and every single one was able to say, as – as Carter did, \"I promised I'd never tell you a lie. This hurts, it really hurts.\" Or Al Gore working on that concession speech that my husband was honored enough to help him on, where he talked about the fact, \"The law of the land has said that this election is lost. I don't agree with it, but I must do it.\" And Hillary Clinton say, \"We not only believe in the transition of power, we cherish it.\" I looked at all those, and it just makes you so proud of each one of those candidates who had been through an election. They'd lost it, they'd let down their constituents, and they were able to make that transfer of power. And it's an essential part of our democracy that has to happen this next November.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAs we sit here today, how concerned are you that it may not happen?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nI am concerned that it may not happen, but I somehow think if the majority of the people come out who have different values from that and they vote, voting is absolutely essential. It's the premium value. As Lyndon Johnson said, \"It's the – it's the one thing that all the rest of our democracy depends on.\" And what is democracy? You throw a candidate out or you call him in. You either want him to come in, or you want to throw him out. We have to be able to do that. And I think, if the majority comes out to vote, and the majority never comes out in enough numbers to vote, not only young people. They've made a big difference in 2020, 2018, 2022, and they're saying now that they may not vote if they're not happy with either candidate. Again, if they only could know what we felt like in the '60s when we felt we were making a difference, you feel larger. You feel a sense of – of exhilaration, the word you used earlier. And I just hope they feel that this election could turn on them, and the uncommitted people and the undecided people have to come out and vote, and we have to just take the results of the election. That doesn't mean we know how it's going to happen, but if the overwhelming majority vote, then somehow maybe it won't be as close as we think it is going to be. And then we'll have a clear-cut choice.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nI hear so much optimism in your voice still.\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nYes, I think I was born that way, and I think it's the only way we can live. I mean, it sometimes may sound naïve. I remember thinking what I was feeling when I was at the Civil Rights march, that we're going to change America. Maybe we didn't change America completely, but we made huge changes at that time. And if you have optimism, at least you have the confidence that if you act, something will happen. And it may take a long time, as – as Martin Luther King talked about, \"the arc of the universe,\" all that stuff takes a long time, but it moves toward justice. And I do believe that.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThank you, Doris Kearns Goodwin for this incredible conversation.\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nThank you. I'm so glad to have been with you.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell that's all for today, thanks for watching. We'll be back next week, because if it's Sunday it's Meet the Press.",

Trump's trial: A ‘freak show' on the outside and solemn on the inside By Jonathan Allen Inside a courthouse nestled between Tribeca and Chinatown on Monday morning, former President Donald Trump's lawyers argued with the district attorney's office over procedures for a hush-money case that could send an ex-commander in chief to prison for the first time in American history.\nJudge Juan Merchan advised lawyers that he was getting a little annoyed by the 'minutia.' With a pool of 500 prospective jurors waiting, he wanted to get started with the process of picking 12.\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know The judge also delivered Trump his 'Parker warnings,' including that he could be jailed for contempt if he is absent without leave at any point during the trial. Trump, betraying little emotion, said he understood.\nOutside, in a sun-filled park across the street, peculiarity reigned over pedantry.\nA smattering of pro-Trump demonstrators — some wearing costumes, others carrying signs, one temporarily lowering the top of her dinosaur-themed one-piece before writhing on the ground in performative ecstasy — lent their support to the presumptive Republican nominee.\nThe presence of high-profile gawkers accentuated the carnival-like nature of the gathering: The Daily Show's Jordan Klepper, former Republican gubernatorial candidate Andrew Giuliani and filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, a daughter of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n'I never miss a freak show,' the younger Pelosi, a longtime resident of nearby Greenwich Village, said.\nThe unlikely tandem of Klepper and Giuliani provided a clear window into a series of truths about this trial: The charges are at once the least consequential of the set pending against Trump and as fundamental to democracy as the question of whether special treatment — either targeting or protection — can be avoided in the case of such a powerful figure.\nAt times during the lengthy proceedings, the former president suggested disinterest or exhaustion by closing his eyes.\nMost of the jurors sat quiet and expressionless. Merchan emphasized his desire to shield their identities from the public, going so far as to warn the rival legal teams not to reproduce lists of their names. More than half of them were dismissed when they raised their hands to say they could not be impartial in this trial.\nOne dismissed prospective juror was overheard in a hallway saying, 'I just couldn't do it.'\nFinding 12 adults with no particular feelings about Donald J. Trump, and the will to sit through a multi-week trial, is no easy feat. That process will continue inside Merchan's court. For the rest of the world, the 'freak show' rolls along on the outside.\nRead more →\nWhere public opinion stands on Trump's trial — for now Analysis by Mark Murray It's unclear how the criminal trial into the hush money charges against Trump will ultimately play out, but recent national polling gives us a good idea where voters stand on the matter.\nAt least for now.\nSizable majorities say the charges against Trump are serious: 64% of voters said the charges that Trump falsified business records concerning the payment of hush money to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election are very or somewhat serious, according to an April Reuters/Ipsos poll.\nSizable majorities say the charges against Trump are serious: 64% of voters said the charges that Trump falsified business records concerning the payment of hush money to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election are very or somewhat serious, according to an April Reuters/Ipsos poll. Yet that's smaller than the share of voters who believed the charges in the other criminal cases are serious — such as trying to overturn the 2020 election results (74%), pressuring Georgia state officials to overturn the 2020 election (72%) and illegally removing classified documents (69%).\nA recent New York Times/Siena College poll also found 58% of registered voters saying the hush-money charges are 'very' or 'somewhat' serious, including 30% of self-identified Republicans.\nViews about Trump's guilt are divided along party lines: But the same NYT/Siena poll showed a smaller share of voters (46%) believing that Trump should be found guilty in the hush-money case, while 36% said he should be found not guilty; another 18% say they didn't know or refused to answer.\nViews about Trump's guilt are divided along party lines: But the same NYT/Siena poll showed a smaller share of voters (46%) believing that Trump should be found guilty in the hush-money case, while 36% said he should be found not guilty; another 18% say they didn't know or refused to answer. And look at the results by party:\nDemocrats: 84% guilty, 6% not guilty, 10% didn't know\nRepublicans: 13% guilty, 71% not guilty, 16% didn't know\nIndependents: 40% guilty, 35% not guilty, 25% didn't know\nNotice how those independents are right down the middle, with a sizable number not having an opinion. The general election ballot slightly shifts if Trump is found guilty: Finally, the January 2024 national NBC News poll showed a slight shift in the horse race between Trump and President Joe Biden when voters are asked about their opinions *if* Trump is ultimately convicted of a crime.\nThe general election ballot slightly shifts if Trump is found guilty: Finally, the January 2024 national NBC News poll showed a slight shift in the horse race between Trump and President Joe Biden when voters are asked about their opinions *if* Trump is ultimately convicted of a crime. In the original ballot test, Trump was ahead of Biden by 5 points among registered voters, 47% to 42%, which was within the poll's margin of error.\nBut when voters were asked — on the survey's final question — about their ballot choice if Trump is convicted of a crime, Biden jumped ahead of Trump by 2 points, 45% to 43%.\nThat's a 7-point swing.\nA caveat about that hypothetical, however: It assumes voters would see a conviction is fair and square. But as we all know, Trump has already spent months trying to cast the prosecution as unfair and politically motivated.\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

            "summary": "House Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday unveiled a plan to advance foreign aid to Israel, Ukraine and Tawain in separate bills and move a fourth piece of legislation wrapping other Republican national security priorities together.\nThose GOP priorities would include implementing a loan-lease program for Ukraine aid, which would lend Ukraine money backed by seized Russian assets, and imposing more sanctions on Iran.\nJohnson's outlined the plan in remarks to reporters after what he described as a 'fruitful and productive' GOP conference meeting Monday evening. The speaker did not mention a ban on TikTok, but other lawmakers leaving the meeting appeared to believe that could be included in the package. He indicated funding levels for the national security bills will be about the same as those proposed in the Senate supplemental aid package.\nJohnson said Ukraine aid was the most 'controversial' piece in the GOP conference, but stressed that the majority of the bill would go toward replenishing American munitions — and therefore would be good for American jobs.\n'Every member ultimately will be able to vote their own conscience on all of these matters, and everyone have an opportunity to weigh in and bring the amendments that they think are suitable,' Johnson said.\n'We will follow the germaneness rules of the House of course and the regular rules with regard to amendments,' he added. 'But I think the final product will be something that everybody can take confidence in because they got to vote their district and vote their conscience.'\nJohnson said he intends to allow members to read the text of the legislation for 72 hours before bringing the bills to the floor. If the text is released Tuesday, as Johnson said he hopes, that could mean the House might not vote on the four separate bills until Friday afternoon or evening. The House is currently scheduled to leave Thursday afternoon and be in recess next week, but that could change.\nJohnson said it was the will of the GOP conference to vote on the foreign aid pieces separately and that he would prefer to send each bill individually to the Senate, but no final decision has been made on whether to package them together.\nHouse Republicans had mixed reactions to Johnson's plan, with many moderates expressing their support.\n'We need to get aid, I don't care procedurally how we do it,' Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., said.\nRep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y., called Johnson's plan 'thoughtful' and 'an appropriate Democratic process.'\n'It's the right way in which the House should function, and quite frankly, I think America should see this,' Molinaro said.\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said members were 'excited\" to hear they would get to vote this week and hopefully the House would pass the bills.\nMeanwhile, some on the far-right flank of Johnson's caucus expressed opposition to his plan.\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who filed a \"motion to vacate' to oust Johnson, said she is 'firmly against the plan' right now and that people would be angry about it.\n'I think it's another wrong direction for Speaker Johnson,' she said. Greene added that she hasn't decided whether to force a vote on her motion to remove Johnson, but said she doesn't believe he will remain in the spot in the next Congress if the GOP maintains the majority.\nJohnson, for his part, said when asked whether he could survive a motion to vacate after bringing the bills to the floor that he doesn't \"spend my time worrying about motions to vacate.'\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., argued that if the House passes the supplemental bills that Johnson proposed, it should wait to transmit them until the Senate takes up bills focused on energy and the border.\n'It doesn't make for a really precise soundbite, but there is a legislative mechanism by which we can take up these votes but then not transmit the bills until the Senate takes some action,' Gaetz said. 'That's a way to leverage the Senate into taking action on our drilling agenda and on our border agenda.'\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good, R-Va., said he supports Johnson's plan for separate aid bills but said GOP leadership will be 'terribly disappointed' if border security isn't tied into the supplemental aid.\n'Republican leadership promised that we would utilize the supplemental process to fight for border security,' Good said. 'So I think they're going to be terribly disappointed if we don't do that.'\nRep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., also warned that he would walk back his support on Johnson's supplemental if it lacks border security provisions.\n'Border security is the No. 1 issue in the country. And for this town to be totally focused on Ukraine while they continue to ignore our southern border is atrocious, and it's a slap in the face of the American people,' Donalds said.\nRebecca Kaplan Kyle Stewart Syedah Asghar Summer Concepcion",

            "summary": "LAKE HAVASU CITY, Ariz. — Arizona GOP Senate hopeful Kari Lake told supporters they can \"strap on a Glock\" to be prepared for the intensity of the 2024 campaign and urged military and law enforcement veterans to be \"ready,\" as her race heats up in a key battleground state.\n'We need to send people to Washington, D.C., that the swamp does not want there,' Lake said toward the end of a Sunday speech to a crowd of Arizonans in Mohave County. 'And I can think of a couple people they don't want there. First on that list is Donald J. Trump; second is Kari Lake.'\nShe described standing up to the 'swamp' in Washington, saying: 'They can't bribe me, they can blackmail me. That's what they don't want me in Washington, D.C. And that's exactly what President Trump wants me they're fighting with him.'\n'He's willing to sacrifice everything I am. That's why they're coming after us with lawfare, they're going to come after us with everything. That's why the next six months is going to be intense. And we need to strap on our — let's see. What do we want to strap on?' Lake asked as some in the crowd chuckled. 'We're going to strap on our, our seat belt. We're going to put on our helmet or your Kari Lake ball cap. We are going to put on the armor of God. And maybe strap on a Glock on the side of us just in case.'\n'We're not going to be the victims of crime,' Lake continued. 'We're not going to have our Second Amendment taken away. We're certainly not going to have our First Amendment taken away by these tyrants.'\nEarlier in the roughly 30-minute remarks, Lake gave another warning about the period between now and Election Day.\n'The next six months are going to be difficult. If you are not ready for action, and I have a feeling with as many veterans and former law enforcement, active law enforcement' — Lake paused to ask for a show of hands — '… you guys are ready for it,' Lake said to her supporters. 'It's going to be a crazy run, the next six months. This is the moment we have to save our country.'\nLake's campaign declined to comment when asked to clarify the point of her remarks and whether she was implying there might be political violence in the next six months.\nWhile Lake didn't explicitly warn of political violence, that's how one of her supporters took her rhetoric.\n'They're gonna do everything they can to disrupt the election, whether it's another pandemic, whether it's going to be inciting the civil war,' said Geenee Roe, 63, when asked about Lake's speech afterward. The event included a raffle of an AR-15-style rifle.\nNBC News asked the Lake Havasu City resident, who plans to vote for Trump and Lake in 2024, if she believed another American civil war is a concrete possibility.\n'The signs are all there,' said Roe, who believes the political left is trying to push the MAGA movement into trouble. 'Saying the MAGA people are bad, that we incite riots — and the whole J6 thing that happened, that was all a setup for sure,' said Roe, referencing the debunked conspiracy theory that the Jan. 6 Capitol riot was a ploy to frame Trump and his supporters.\nLake's comments came in Arizona's northwest Mohave County, which broke for Trump with 75% of the vote in the 2020 presidential election. The Senate hopeful is setting her sights on an even larger margin in 2024.\n'If Mohave County shows up 100% or close to it, they can't cheat their way out of this in Maricopa County, no matter what they do,' Lake said, leaning on a signature talking point.\nLake has continually rejected the 2020 election results, which saw President Joe Biden narrowly defeat Trump in Arizona, and the 2022 election results, which saw her bid for governor fail by a slightly wider margin. Court cases and other reviews of the results have not found evidence of fraud or malfeasance affecting the election results. And in March, Lake decided not to contest her liability in a defamation suit brought by a Republican election official in Maricopa County.\nStephen Richer, the Maricopa County recorder, who plays a key role in election administration, filed a defamation claim against Lake in June alleging that she 'repeatedly and falsely accused' him of causing her electoral defeat in the race for governor won by Democrat Katie Hobbs. Lake's legal team recently filed a default judgment motion that indicated she was not challenging her culpability. She instead will argue against damages in the case.\nShe continued questioning the integrity of Maricopa County's election results on Sunday.\n'You all know what goes on in Maricopa County. I mean, you know that you know, the garbage that they're pushing down there,' Lake said of Arizona's most populous county, where Richer and the Republican-controlled board of supervisors run local elections.\n'We're gonna need all these counties outside of Maricopa County to show up, and I'm counting on Mohave County to lead the way,' Lake said.\nAlex Tabet",

The current minimum target is 2%.\n'They also discussed the war between Russia and Ukraine, the conflict with Israel in the Middle East, and many other topics having to do with getting to world peace,' the campaign said.\nAfter their dinner Duda said it was 'a friendly meeting in a very nice atmosphere.'\nTrump, who is on trial in New York over accusations that he covered up a 'hush money' payment to pornographic actress Stormy Daniels, is likely to face a tight race against President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November presidential election.\nDuda is in New York to attend the United Nations, and will travel on to Canada on Friday.",

Man on terror watchlist was dropped by migrant monitoring program When an Afghan national on the FBI terrorist watchlist was arrested last week after having spent nearly a year in the U.S., immigration officials said he had been enrolled in a program that tracked his location via ankle monitor, mobile app or telephone. But the man's participation in the monitoring program, known as Alternatives to Detention, lasted only a little over two weeks. Mohammad Kharwin is believed to have then spent 10 months in the U.S. without any kind of monitoring system.\nNow experts say the case raises questions about how migrants who may pose a security threat are vetted and tracked in the U.S. It also raises questions about the Alternatives to Detention, which has seen funding cuts from Republicans in Congress who oppose it, forcing ICE to drop migrants from being monitored.\nHomeland security correspondent Julia Ainsley, who broke the story last week, explains the latest developments .\nexplains the latest developments. Johnson eyes a weekend vote on foreign aid bills House Speaker Mike Johnson rolled out three bills to provide assistance to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan, with the hopes of holding final votes on Saturday. The bills will be a major test for Johnson, as he faces a deeply divided GOP and serious threats to his leadership from two right-wing representatives.\nThe biggest sticking point will be funding for Ukraine. Already, several Republicans have said they will not approve any more aid for Kyiv. In order for that funding to pass, a significant share of Democrats will be required to carry that measure over the finish line.\nAlso expected to come up this weekend through an amendment process is the House-passed bill to ban TikTok in the U.S. unless the company divests from its China-based owner. Meanwhile, House Democrats want Johnson to consider a Senate-passed foreign aid package instead, saying it's the best path to getting a bill on Biden's desk.

Trump on trial tests his political wherewithal — and American resolve Mary Altaffer / AP Pool file The country has never seen anything quite like the made-for-the-screen trial set to start this morning in New York: Donald Trump, a former president and the current Republican Party nominee for the presidency, faces a jury in a criminal trial.\nTrump is charged with 34 counts of first-degree falsifying business records. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleges that Trump 'repeatedly and fraudulently falsified New York business records to conceal criminal conduct that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election.'\nAt the heart of the case are allegations of various sex scandals that prosecutors say Trump tried to suppress with the help of his former lawyer Michael Cohen and top executives in charge of the National Enquirer.\nTrump has been branding himself as a political prisoner.

            "summary": "Sen. Tom Cotton on Tuesday doubled down on comments urging people delayed by traffic stemming from pro-Palestine demonstrations to \"forcibly remove\" some protesters who are blocking streets.\n\"Absolutely, I support people, if they're blocked by traffic, by pro-Hamas vigilantes in the street, they should get out of their cars, they should move them to the side of the road, and they should let traffic continue,\" Cotton, R-Ark., told NBC News on Tuesday.\nWhen asked whether he was calling for violence against protesters, Cotton said he wasn't.\n\"I'm saying that if people are trying to get to work or pick up their kids from school or take a sick kid to the doctor, and you have pro-Hamas vigilantes blocking the streets, they should get out and move those people off the streets,\" Cotton said. 'The police will get there eventually. But a lot of damage will be done in the meantime.\"\nA day earlier, Cotton had urged people delayed by traffic stemming from pro-Palestine demonstrations to \"take matters into [their] own hands.\"\n'I encourage people who get stuck behind the pro-Hamas mobs blocking traffic: take matters into your own hands to get them out of the way. It's time to put an end to this nonsense,' Cotton wrote on X on Monday night.\nThe Arkansas Republican also referred to the demonstrators blocking the Golden Gate bridge as 'criminals' during a Fox News interview on Monday and suggested that they would have been treated differently had the protest happened his home state.\n'If something like this happened in Arkansas, on a bridge there, let's just say I think there'd be a lot of very wet criminals that have been tossed overboard — not by law enforcement, but by the people whose road they're blocking,' Cotton said.\n'And if they glued their hands to a car or the pavement, well, it'd probably be pretty painful to have their skin ripped off, but I think that's the way we'd handle in Arkansas,' he added.\nThe comments came after protests over the war in Gaza closed down San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge for roughly five hours earlier in the day. A total of 26 people were arrested and several people were charged with conspiracy because of the coordinated protest, according to NBC Bay Area.\n'You can protest any which way you want. But it is unlawful to block a roadway and to prevent people from getting to work, emergency personnel from getting to help people. You can't do it,' said California Highway Patrol Chief Don Goodbrand.\nDemonstrations were also held in other cities nationwide, such as Chicago and New York City.\nKate Santaliz Zoë Richards",

            "summary": "Jury selection is expected to continue Tuesday morning in the case of the People of the State of New York v. Donald Trump — the first criminal trial of a former president ever.\nThe quest to find a jury of 12 people and six alternates got off to a slow start Monday, as more than half of the 96 potential jurors summoned to the Manhattan courtroom said they couldn't be \"fair and impartial\" when it comes to Trump, the polarizing New York native and former commander-in-chief.\nTrump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, is required to be in attendance for the trial, which is projected to last six to eight weeks. He has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to a porn star during the closing days of the 2016 presidential election. The low-level felony is punishable by up to four years in prison.\nTrump complained after court Monday that Judge Juan Merchan wouldn't let him skip court May 17 to attend his son's high school graduation, though Merchan has yet to actually rule on the request, saying he would do so later.\nTrump's attorney Todd Blanche also asked whether Trump could be excused on April 25, the date the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear his arguments about presidential immunity stemming from the federal election interference case against him. Merchan rejected that request after Blanche told him, \"We shouldn't be here at all right now.\"\n\"You don't believe you should be here right now?\" the outraged judge responded. \"He's required to be here. He's not required to be at the Supreme Court.\"\nThe issues were some of the several raised by lawyers for both sides in court Monday that resulted in the jury selection process' not beginning until the afternoon. Only nine potential jurors answered questions from Merchan's 42-question form — which included several questions about their political affiliations and views about Trump himself — before the end of the court day.\nTrump's eyes were closed during part of Monday's proceedings when Merchan was reading the potential jurors his instructions — creating speculation about whether he was asleep or just deep in thought.\nThe remaining jurors from the first pool will continue answering questions Tuesday morning before prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office and Trump's attorneys ask follow-up questions.\nAfter that, they'll move on to the next pool of 96. Merchan has estimated the process will take one to two weeks.\nAdam Reiss Dareh Gregorian\nPage 2",

            "excerpt": "Analysis: Trump's lawyers battled over the 'minutia\" while supporters and detractors argued over the purpose of the trial.",
            "summary": "Inside a courthouse nestled between Tribeca and Chinatown on Monday morning, former President Donald Trump's lawyers argued with the district attorney's office over procedures for a hush-money case that could send an ex-commander in chief to prison for the first time in American history.\nJudge Juan Merchan advised lawyers that he was getting a little annoyed by the \"minutia.\" With a pool of 500 prospective jurors waiting, he wanted to get started with the process of picking 12.\nThe judge also delivered Trump his \"Parker warnings,\" including that he could be jailed for contempt if he is absent without leave at any point during the trial. Trump, betraying little emotion, said he understood.\nOutside, in a sun-filled park across the street, peculiarity reigned over pedantry.\nA smattering of pro-Trump demonstrators — some wearing costumes, others carrying signs, one temporarily lowering the top of her dinosaur-themed one-piece before writhing on the ground in performative ecstasy — lent their support to the former president and presumptive Republican nominee.\nThe presence of high-profile gawkers accentuated the carnival-like nature of the gathering: The Daily Show's Jordan Klepper, former Republican gubernatorial candidate Andrew Giuliani and filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, a daughter of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\"I never miss a freak show,\" the younger Pelosi, a longtime resident of nearby Greenwich Village, said.\nThe unlikely tandem of Klepper and Giuliani provided a clear window into a series of truths about this trial: the charges are at once the least consequential of the set pending against Trump and as fundamental to democracy as the question of whether special treatment — either targeting or protection — can be avoided in the case of such a powerful figure.\nSensing an opportunity, Giuliani, the son of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, agreed to talk on camera with Klepper, a master of man-on-the-street interviews that leave the subjects looking foolish. After all, the coin of the realm in Trump's domain is defending the big guy in tough, televised interviews.\nBut the younger Giuliani, a former Trump White House official in his own right, was worried enough about the outcome — and aware enough of the art of video editing — that he asked an associate to make his own recording of the full interview.\nAdditional cameras seldom provide additional protection, and this case was no exception. Pelosi couldn't help but watch the scene unfold.\nKlepper wasn't interested in the high-stakes trial inside. Many Democrats are more exercised about the other charges Trump faces — he's been indicted in federal and Georgia courts for efforts to overturn the 2020 election and in another federal court over allegations that he illegally retained classified documents.\nWhat Klepper wanted to know — with Andrew Giuliani amounting to a stand-in for his father — was whether Trump's rhetoric would lead to violence. The former president recently said in a fundraising email that \"all hell\" would break loose at his trial. Before the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, Trump told supporters \"if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.'\nAndrew Giuliani noted that the crowd outside the courthouse was definitively peaceful. Then, he went further.\n\"I was in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, as well,\" Andrew Giuliani said. \"I was with President Trump. I remember him talking about peacefully protesting.\"\nThat was the gotcha moment Klepper was waiting for.\n\"Some people were talking about peaceful protest,\" Klepper said. \"Some people also on Jan. 6 were talking about ‘trial by combat.' Do you know anybody who was talking about that?\"\nIt was Rudy Giuliani who had called for \"trial by combat\" at the Trump rally preceding the sacking of the Capitol. His son declined to identify him. The interview turned more, well, combative after that.\n\"Oh, funny guy,\" Andrew Giuliani said with disdain, \"let's get a brain in there.\"\nAlmost lost in the exchange was the message Andrew Giuliani wanted to deliver: that Democrats are trying to take Trump \"off the campaign trail,\" which amounts to \"the death of our Constitutional republic.\"\nLike most satire, Klepper's interview was revealing.\nIt served as a reminder that the hush-money trial has much less to do with whether Trump is fit to serve as president than the election-interference and classified-documents cases — even though it carries with it the grave potential consequence of a major-party nominee being convicted of a crime during the stretch run of a presidential campaign.\nconvicted of a crime during the stretch run of a presidential campaign. Trump's critics argue that his push to silence porn actress Stormy Daniels amounts to an illegal benefit to his own 2016 campaign. He should not be above the law, they contend, just as his allies argue he has been unjustly targeted for political purposes.\nThe spur-of-the-moment on-camera exchange between Andrew Giuliani and Klepper, two figures deeply engaged with American politics, also reflected and underscored the degree to which the right and left talk past each other.\nNeither suggested that the trial is important because it will determine whether Trump committed crimes.\nKlepper tried to sidestep that question. Andrew Giuliani used the trial as a foil for the argument that Trump is being persecuted.\nIt could be easy to forget, amid the onlookers, that the jurors will render a decision as simple and prosaic as whether one man broke the law by falsifying documents and as consequential as whether a former president, and current candidate, should be held accountable.\nRepublican strategist Matthew Bartlett, who was not at the trial, said the political landscape may not change based on the outcome.\n\"At the end of the day, I'm not sure this trial about a transaction from 2016 will have a superseding effect on what voters want for policy and a vision for the future of the country,\" he said.\nOutside the first day of the trial smacked of a Ringling Brothers production. Inside the courtroom, just across Centre Street, the solemn nature of the work ahead was evident.\nWhen the first group of 96 prospective jurors passed through metal detectors and into the courtroom around 2:30 p.m., filling every available seat, Trump twisted his neck to take a look. He later stood and turned to acknowledge them when he was named as the defendant.\nAt times during the lengthy proceedings, the former president suggested disinterest or exhaustion by closing his eyes.\nMost of the jurors sat quietly and expressionless. Merchan emphasized his desire to shield their identities from the public, going so far as to warn the rival legal teams not to reproduce lists of their names. More than half of them were dismissed when they raised their hands to say they could not be impartial in this trial.\nOne dismissed prospective juror was overheard in a hallway saying, \"I just couldn't do it.\"\nFinding 12 adults with no particular feelings about Donald J. Trump, and the will to sit through a multi-week trial, is no easy feat. That process will continue inside Merchan's court. For the rest of the world, the \"freak show\" rolls along on the outside.\nJonathan Allen",

He said if Biden 'gets his way' people would be facing 'colossal' tax increases. He included no information about his 2023 tax filing.\nBiden and his wife earned four-fifths of their income from their jobs as U.S. president and teacher at Northern Virginia Community College, respectively. Joe Biden drew a $400,000 wage, while Jill Biden earned $85,985 from her job teaching English at Northern Virginia Community College.\nThe additional income was drawn from interest on investments, pensions and a corporate entity that collects the couple's book royalties. Most of the increase of income relative to 2022 was from interest paid on one of the couple's bank accounts, according to the tax return.\nThe proportion of Joe Biden's income that went to federal taxes was roughly equal to the prior year.\nBiden plans to deliver a speech on tax policy from his Scranton, Pennsylvania, birthplace on Tuesday that is expected to include a call for the wealthy to pay higher rates. Pennsylvania is expected to be one of the most closely contested 2024 election states in November.\nThe president's return also showed that Biden donated $20,477 to charity, roughly 3.3% of their income, with the beneficiaries including several churches and public health groups like the Epilepsy Foundation and the Fraternal Order of Police.\nBiden's running mate Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, also released a tax return showing $450,380 income for 2023, federal taxes of $88,570 and charitable donations of $23,026.",

            "excerpt": "The speech in Florida is part of a series of Biden campaign events trying to nationalize the issue of state abortion limits.",
            "summary": "President Joe Biden will on Tuesday deliver a speech in Florida denouncing that state's new six-week abortion ban and other efforts to restrict abortion access across the country, according to Biden campaign aides who shared details of the trip first with NBC News.\nAt the event, which is scheduled to take place in Tampa about one week before the state law is set to go into effect, the president will talk about the 'the stakes of this election for reproductive freedom across the entire country.'\nBiden will also tie Florida's restrictions on the procedure to other consequences of Roe v. Wade being overturned in 2022, including the Arizona state Supreme Court decision last week which upheld a near-total abortion ban dating from 1864, according to the aides.\n'From Arizona to Florida, more and more Americans are seeing up close the devastating impact of Trump overturning Roe v. Wade,' Morgan Mohr, senior advisor for reproductive rights for the Biden-Harris campaign, said in a statement. 'While Donald Trump continues to brag about unleashing these extreme and dangerous bans, President Joe Biden is running to restore reproductive freedom. Since the overturning of Roe, whenever reproductive rights have been on the ballot, they have won, and this November will be no different.'\nThe event is significant for Biden: While voicing full support for abortion access, he has often looked to Vice President Kamala Harris to be the administration's most prominent voice on the issue. Since the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturned the federal right to abortion, Harris has held more than 80 events across 20 states focused on reproductive freedom, including delivering a speech last week in Arizona criticizing the ban in that state and tying in former President Donald Trump's role allowing abortion restrictions to take place.\nOn Tuesday, though, Biden will take center stage on the issue. The president is expected to attack Trump for saying he is proud of appointing the Supreme Court justices who made overturning Roe v. Wade possible, as well as for other comments related to recently enacted state abortion bans. Biden is also expected to say that if re-elected, Trump and his allies will enact a federal abortion ban, though Trump has recently claimed he would not do so, saying instead that he wanted the issue left to the states.\nMeanwhile, the Biden-Harris campaign has been hammering Republicans as more and more states restrict abortion. The campaign has rolled out emotional ads focused on the issue and has used women impacted by the abortion restrictions as campaign surrogates across the country.\nBiden's trip to Tampa is part of the campaign's broader effort to nationalize the fallout and the conversation around state abortion bans. The campaign sees Florida's abortion ban as especially salient because, once in effect, the six-week ban will impact the entire Southeast, given that many women have previously traveled to Florida from states with stricter abortion bans to get abortions.\nYamiche Alcindor",

            "excerpt": "On the first day of the trial, Trump's campaign raised $1.6 million in small-dollar donations, a campaign official told NBC News.",
            "summary": "Donald Trump emerged from a Manhattan courtroom Monday ready for a fight.\nAfter day one of a trial that has Trump facing 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to a porn star, the former president stood in front of reporters ready to unleash a grievance-laced tirade that, at times, did not totally reflect reality but guaranteed he would continue to dominate the headlines even from court.\nHis immediate focus was Judge Juan Merchan's decision to not yet rule on whether Trump can attend his son Barron's May 17 high school graduation. Merchan did not say Trump could not go, but rather he was not yet ready to rule on the matter. Specifics aside, however, it gave Trump just enough to paint the picture for his supporters of a biased judge blocking a loving father from seeing his son's graduation.\n'My son is graduating high school, and it looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation,' Trump told the assembled group of reporters.\nIt's emblematic of how Trump has tried to control the narrative — an instinct that has defined his political career — even while stuck in a camera-less Manhattan courtroom. The judge has ordered Trump to attend court hearings in person, so it's a predicament he will find himself in at least four days a week for the foreseeable future as President Joe Biden continues to run a more traditional presidential campaign.\nThe false claim a judge was not allowing him to attend his son's graduation spread like wildfire in the conservative ecosystem, a conflagration helped by some of his top supporters with huge followings. Kari Lake called Merchan 'heartless & cruel.' Piers Morgan used a New York Post column to call the-decision-that-was-not 'disgusting.' Donald Trump Jr. called it 'pure evil.'\nFor millions of Trump supporters, the half-truth became the truth and a cause celebre for those eagerly looking to maintain the belief that the entire legal fight is an attempt by Democrats to get Trump locked up.\nThose sorts of distortions and fights about nearly every aspect of the trial dominated the first week, which focused on jury selection.\nIt was often reality versus Trump's version of it.\nThere were reports Trump may have fallen asleep in court, where cameras are not allowed in these types of cases. He responded forcefully on Truth Social that 'I was PRAYING not sleeping!!!'\nTrump had a misunderstanding about the jury selection process. It led him to post on Truth Social that the process is another example of 'ELECTION INTERFERENCE!'\nAnd Trump has broadly used a torrent of Truth Social posts and media interviews to paint a picture of both Merchan and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg as biased and out to get him, a sentiment that has been taken as gospel and amplified by conservative media.\nIn fundraising text messages, Trump has also told supporters that he left the courtroom, which at no point during the week happened except during scheduled court recesses or when court was over for the day.\n'I JUST STORMED OUT OF COURT!' read a fundraising text message from Trump's campaign. 'They think I'm finished, but I'LL NEVER SURRENDER!'\nTrump also tried to raise political cash off the claim that he has been blocked from attending Barron's graduation.\n'THEY ARE FORCING ME TO SKIP MY SON'S GRADUATION,' Trump's campaign texted. 'I'LL BE IN COURT.'\n'Heartless thugs,' it continued.\nThe trial-focused fundraising efforts have been breaking through the noise.\nOn the first day of trial, Trump's campaign raised $1.6 million in small-dollar donations, a campaign official told NBC News. Trump raised that much online on only three days in the first three months of 2024, according to a recent campaign finance filing from WinRed, the Trump campaign's online donation platform. Each of those three days came toward the end of March.\n\"Crooked Joe Biden and the Democrat's entire strategy to defeat President Trump is to confine him to a courtroom and unconstitutionally silence him throughout this sham Biden trial,\" said Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. \"Polling shows the American people see right through the Stalinist tactics employed by Crooked Joe and his allies.\"\n\"President Trump and his team will continue fighting for truth in the courtroom, while working to earn votes on the campaign trail,\" she added.\nMuch of the nation's attention is focused on the historic nature of an ex-president on trial, a saturation that has helped Trump continue his unmatched ability to get and retain attention regardless of the specific situation — which, in this case, is being stuck in court facing unflattering revelations about his personal life and accusations about trying to hide the information to get elected.\n'I don't think any of it matters. He totally rewrote the rules,' said a longtime Republican operative granted anonymity to speak freely about Trump's week-one performance. 'There are between 75-80 million people who will vote for him because he is a scrappy fighter. Working class folks see him as a billionaire bubba.'\nThe entire episode sets up a split screen of a former president mired in legal fights and stuck in court and an incumbent president checking all the boxes of what would be considered a traditional presidential campaign. Biden has a significant fundraising advantage and continues to hold in person campaign rallies, most recently a swing through Pennsylvania, including events in his hometown of Scranton, where he attacked Trump on a range of issues — but noticeably did not mention his legal woes. Biden's campaign has previously said it would avoid directly taking shots at Trump's legal problems to try and avoid the perception of a weaponized Justice Department.\nBeyond fundraising text messages, Trump's political operation has continued to work in the background. On Wednesday — the trial's off day — Trump had dinner with Polish President Andrzej Duda at Trump Tower in New York, and on Saturday, he is set to hold a rally in North Carolina, a key swing state.\nTrump has also installed top allies to lead the Republican National Committee, which has generally been focused on the more basic types of political blocking-and-tackling as the presidential nominee is likely to be stuck in courtrooms for most of the 2024 election cycle. Including the current trial, Trump faces four separate criminal indictments and a handful of civil lawsuits, some of which will continue to play out through November.\n\"We are getting a lot of data being shared with us to help us register and engage voters,\" an RNC member said.\nTrump has also used post-trial campaign stops to attract attention, including a Tuesday visit to a New York bodega. Trump at times tried to use the stop to focus on the rising cost of consumer goods and crime, which have been two policy themes of his presidential campaign, but the focus inevitably turned to his trial.\nTrump was asked what he thought about the seven jurors who had been selected as of Wednesday — the full 12-member jury was chosen Thursday — and he was blunt that the outcome would drive his assessment.\n'I'll let you know in about two months,' Trump said of the trial's likely timeline.\nMatt Dixon",

            "excerpt": "The vote, which must be certified, marks United Auto Workers' first successful organizing drive of an automaker outside of Detroit's Big Three.",
            "summary": "The United Auto Workers said late Friday that Volkswagen employees in Chattanooga, Tennessee, have overwhelmingly voted to join the union — marking a major milestone for the labor organization and its first successful organizing drive of an automaker outside of Detroit's Big Three.\nUnion organizing passed with 73% of the vote, or 2,629 workers, in support for the UAW, according to results posted by the UAW's main lawyer. A total of 3,620, or roughly 84%, of the more than 4,300 eligible Volkswagen workers voted in the election, the union said. Seven ballots were challenged and three were voided.\n'In a historic victory, an overwhelming majority of Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga, Tennessee, have voted to join the UAW,' the union said in a release Friday night before official results were released by the National Labor Relations Board, or NLRB. 'While votes continue to be tallied, the outcome is clear: Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga are the first Southern autoworkers outside of the Big Three to win their union.'\naThe NLRB still must certify the result, but barring any unexpected issues or challenges, the company is required to bargain in good faith with the union. The talks can be direct or go first through a mediator.\nUAW leaders and supporters are expected to use the win as a launching point for the union's unprecedented organizing campaign of 13 automakers in the U.S. following major contract wins last year with General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis.\nUAW President Shawn Fain and others saw this week's vote as the union's best shot at organizing the Volkswagen plant following the strikes and record contracts at the Detroit automakers. Those agreements included significant wage increase, reinstatement of cost-of-living adjustments and other benefits.\nThe successful organizing drive comes days after six Republican governors of Southern states, including Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, released a joint statement condemning the UAW's push to organize in their states.\n'We have worked tirelessly on behalf of our constituents to bring good-paying jobs to our states. These jobs have become part of the fabric of the automotive manufacturing industry. Unionization would certainly put our states' jobs in jeopardy — in fact, in this year already, all of the UAW automakers have announced layoffs,' the statement said.\nThe UAW previously failed to organize the Volkswagen plant in 2014 and 2019 as it faced greater outside political pressure and worker opposition. Workers rejected union membership by just 833 to 776 votes five years ago.\nThe union will now set its sights on negotiating with Volkswagen. It will also look to an anticipated organizing vote of Mercedes-Benz workers at an SUV plant in Vance, Alabama.\nWorkers at the facility earlier this month filed NLRB paperwork for a formal election to join the UAW. The vote for 5,200 workers will occur from May 13 through May 17, the NLRB announced Thursday.\n'The first thing you need to do to win is to believe that you can win,' Fain told Mercedes-Benz workers last month. 'That this job can be better. That your life can be better. And that those things are worth fighting for. That is why we stand up. That's why you're here today. Because deep down, you believe it's possible.'\nFain previously vowed to move beyond the Big Three and expand to the 'Big Five or Big Six' by the time its four-and-a-half-year contracts with the Detroit automakers expire in 2028.",

            "summary": "China said it 'firmly opposes' the U.S. investigation into its maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries, calling the move a 'mistake on top of a mistake.'\nIn an official statement late Wednesday, China's ministry of commerce said the U.S. provides hundreds of billions of dollars in 'discriminatory' subsidies to its domestic industries, 'yet accuses China of adopting so-called ‘non-market practices.''\n'In fact, the development of China's industries is the result of companies' technological innovation and active participation in market competition,' the Chinese ministry said.\nOn Wednesday, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative initiated a probe into China's maritime, logistics and shipbuilding industries, alleging that Beijing used 'unfair, non-market policies and practices' to dominate these sectors. Under the Trade Act of 1974, Section 301 seeks to address unfair foreign government practices impacting U.S. commerce.\n'By launching a new Section 301 investigation, the U.S. is making a mistake on top of a mistake,' the Chinese ministry said.\nBeijing called on the U.S. to 'respect multilateral rules' and vowed to 'take all necessary steps to resolutely defend its rights and interests.'\nThe investigation comes after five national labor unions launched a petition on March 12 requesting the U.S. to probe the policies and practices of China's maritime, logistics and shipbuilding sectors.\nU.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Katherine Tai has pledged to launch a 'full and thorough investigation into the unions' concerns.'\n'The allegations reflect what we have already seen across other sectors, where [China] utilizes a wide range of non-market policies and practices to undermine fair competition and dominate the market, both in China and globally,' she said, according to the USTR statement.\nPresident Joe Biden has also called on the USTR to triple tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports, in a bid to protect American industries.\n'Chinese policies and subsidies for their domestic steel and aluminum industries means high-quality U.S. products are undercut by artificially low-priced Chinese alternatives produced with higher emissions,' the White House said in a statement.\nIn an address to union workers in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, Biden accused China of 'cheating' in its steel trade practices.\n'They're not competing. They're cheating,' he said, adding that 'we've seen the damage here in America.'\n'The bottom line is that I want fair competition with China, not conflict.'\nDeborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Asia-based Hinrich Foundation, said the Section 301 investigation could be more significant than Biden's call for tariff increases on Chinese steel and aluminum imports.\nThe total amount of Chinese steel into the U.S. market is less than 1%, Elms told CNBC's 'Capital Connection' on Thursday.\nShe said the launch of a Section 301 investigation on shipbuilding 'is becoming more of an issue potentially.'\n'Now, that could be much more significant because it sets up the stakes for further retaliation by the U.S. against China, and then potentially by China against the U.S.,' Elms said.\n'As we head into a very tight election season, both parties [Democrats and Republicans] are competing in the U.S. to see who could be toughest on China.'\nSheila Chiang, CNBC",

            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump is poised to receive an additional 36 million shares of Trump Media Tuesday — an 'earnout' bonus worth more than $1.25 billion, at Monday's price.\nTrump Media, which owns the Truth Social app, was trading at around $35 per share mid-day Monday.\nBut that price is twice the $17.50 benchmark minimum share price, which the DJT ticker has to hit by the close of trading Tuesday, for Trump to become eligible for the extra so-called earnout shares.\nThat earnout is contingent on the benchmark being hit for 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period, beginning March 25. Tuesday is the 20th day and it is very unlikely that DJT will fall below the benchmark price by the end of that day.\nTrump Media's share price was down about 1.8% as of 12:17 p.m. ET\nThe 36 million additional for Trump would be added to the 78.75 million shares he already owns, as the company's majority shareholder.\nWhen the earnout shares are added to his existing stock, Trump's total stake in Trump Media would be worth more than $4 billion on paper, at $35 a share.\nTrump Media has the power to issue a total of 40 million earnout shares, as part of the merger deal that combined it with a publicly traded shell company, Digital World Acquisition Corp.\n'Assuming the full issuance of the Earnout Shares, President Donald J. Trump will receive 36,000,000 Earnout Shares,' the company said in a securities filing. The filing suggests that some, if not all, of the remaining shares will be issued to Trump Media's executive officers as part of an incentive plan.\nTrump was in a New York City courtroom Monday, listening to opening statements in his criminal hush money trial. Court resumes on Tuesday for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\nThe merged company, whose full name is Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., began public trading under the DJT ticker on March 26, at an opening price of $70.90 per share.\nThat price rose to a high of nearly $80 that day, briefly giving the company a market capitalization of more than $9 billion. This was despite having reported a 2023 net loss of $58 million, and just $4.1 million in revenue.\nBut since then, Trump Media's share price has plunged. By the close of trading on April 15, the share price had fallen nearly 68% from its opening price.\nThe stock price rose sharply last week. But as of Monday, Trump Media shares were still trading around 50% lower than the price they debuted at last month, erasing billions of dollars in market capitalization for the company.\nEven with a much lower stock price, Trump is almost certain to receive all of his earnout shares.\nThat's because the threshold share price at which Trump will receive all 36 million of his earnout shares was set at $17.50. The last time the stock traded at that price was in January, before the Securities and Exchange Commission greenlighted DWAC and Trump Media's plans to merge.\nIt remains to be seen if the issuance of the earnout shares to Trump will affect the share price of Trump Media.\nAny shares that Trump owns are subject to a lock-up provision that prevents him from selling them in the six months following the merger's closing date.\nWhile Trump Media's board could amend that provision, to date, it has not taken any steps to do so.\nCNBC asked a company spokeswoman about the expected triggering of Trump's earnout shares.\nShe replied, 'With more than $200 million in the bank and zero debt, Trump Media is fulfilling all its obligations related to the merger and rapidly moving forward with its business plan.'\nDan Mangan, CNBC",

Many Democrats cheered on the House floor and waved Ukrainian flags.\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who had warned that his country would lose the war without U.S. funding, said that he was grateful for the decision of U.S. lawmakers.\n'We appreciate every sign of support for our country and its independence, people and way of life, which Russia is attempting to bury under the rubble,' he wrote on social media site X.\n'America has demonstrated its leadership since the first days of this war. Exactly this type of leadership is required to maintain a rules-based international order and predictability for all nations,' he said.\nThe Ukrainian president noted that his country's 'warriors on the front lines' would feel the benefit of the aid package.\nOne such 'warrior' is infantry soldier Oleksandr, fighting around Avdiivka, the city in the Donetsk region that Ukraine lost to Russia in February after months of intense combat.\n'For us it's so important to have this support from the U.S. and our partners,' Oleksandr told The Associated Press. He did not give his full name for security reasons.\n'With this we can stop them and reduce our losses. It's the first step to have the possibility to liberate our territory.'\nAmmunition shortages linked to the aid holdup over the past six months have led Ukrainian military commanders to ration shells, a disadvantage that Russia seized on this year — taking the city of Avdiivka and currently inching towards the town of Chasiv Yar, also in the Donetsk region.\n'The Russians come at us in waves — we become exhausted, we have to leave our positions. This is repeated many times,' Oleksandr said. 'Not having enough ammunition means we can't cover the area that is our responsibility to hold when they are assaulting us.'\nOther Western leaders lauded the passing of the aid package.\n'Ukraine is using the weapons provided by NATO Allies to destroy Russian combat capabilities. This makes us all safer, in Europe & North America,' NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg wrote on X.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that 'Ukraine deserves all the support it can get against Russia.'\nIn Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the approval of aid to Ukraine 'expected and predictable.'\nThe decision 'will make the United States of America richer, further ruin Ukraine and result in the deaths of even more Ukrainians, the fault of the Kyiv regime,' Peskov was quoted as saying by Russian news agency Ria Novosti.\n'The new aid package will not save, but, on the contrary, will kill thousands and thousands more people, prolong the conflict, and bring even more grief and devastation,' Leonid Slutsky, head of the Russian State Duma Committee on International Affairs, wrote on Telegram.\nThe whole aid package will go to the U.S. Senate, which could pass it as soon as Tuesday. President Joe Biden has promised to sign it immediately.\nThe Associated Press",

            "excerpt": "The committee's findings were based on interviews with 26 whistleblowers and a review of 4,000 pages of CIA documents.",
            "summary": "The House Intelligence Committee found the CIA botched its response to reports of sexual assault and harassment inside the agency, with victims forced to navigate a process marked by 'confusion and disorder,' according to an investigation by lawmakers.\nEmployees who reported sexual assault and harassment saw 'little to no accountability or punishment for the perpetrators,' the committee's report said.\nThe process for reporting sexual assault and assessment at the CIA was marked by 'confusion and disorder,' victims were reluctant to come forward as they could not remain anonymous, staff members lacked training to identify cases, and the agency had an 'inconsistent approach' with law enforcement agencies, said the committee's bipartisan report, which was released Monday.\n'Over the course of the investigation, the Committee discovered that CIA failed to handle allegations of sexual assault and harassment within its workforce in the professional and uniform manner that such sensitive allegations warrant,' it said.\nThe CIA did not dispute the committee's findings. A spokesperson said it has taken a number of steps to improve how it responds to sexual assault complaints and praised a new law that allowed the agency to expand the office handling sexual misconduct cases.\n'We are absolutely committed to fostering a safe, respectful workplace environment for our employees and have taken significant steps to ensure that, both by bolstering our focus on prevention and strengthening the agency's handling of these issues when they arise,' the spokesperson said in a statement.\nThe House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence launched an investigation into the CIA's response to sex-related offenses after a female employee approached lawmakers in January 2023 alleging she had been sexually assaulted and harassed. After she came forward, more than 20 other employees followed, saying they had suffered sexual assaults and harassment.\nThe unnamed employee's case led to her CIA colleague's conviction in state court for misdemeanor assault and battery.\nThe CIA later terminated the female employee, who had reported being sexually assaulted in a stairwell at the agency and who accused the CIA of trying to discourage her from filing a criminal complaint. Her lawyer claimed it amounted to unlawful retaliation, but the CIA strongly rejected the allegation.\nAs a result of the reports of sexual assault and harassment, lawmakers passed legislation last year designed to fix gaps in how the CIA handles sexual assault cases, requiring it to set up a standard sexual misconduct investigation procedure and annual reports to Congress.\nKevin Carroll, the lawyer for the unnamed employee, said that the House committee's report was 'excellent' and that it vindicated his client and other female employees who raised concerns over the issue.\n'This investigative report and the legislation it spurred have their origin in the bravery of a young female trainee with the integrity to speak truth to power at the cost of her own CIA career to try and prevent other agency women from suffering as she did,' Carroll said.\nThe Republican chair of the committee, Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, and the ranking Democrat, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, said in a joint statement that they would keep up efforts to track how the agency handles sexual misconduct.\n'For more than a year, the House Intelligence Committee has investigated the responsiveness of the Central Intelligence Agency to personnel who have survived sexual assault and sexual harassment. We heard directly from whistleblowers who courageously shared their stories in order to push for change and accountability,' the two lawmakers said.\n'Our Committee has put in place significant legislative reforms to address failures, and we will continue to monitor progress to ensure there is no slippage in the Agency's commitment to addressing sexual assault and harassment, ' Turner and Himes said.\n' Turner and Himes said. The CIA's Office of Inspector General also is conducting a 'special review' of the issue.\nThe House committee's report was based on interviews with 26 whistleblowers, 15 briefings from CIA officials and a review of 4,000 pages of CIA documents, according to the committee. The report said the committee also benefited from cooperation by the CIA, which it said has shown 'an eagerness to effectively prevent and respond to sexual assault and harassment instances.'\nDan De Luce",

            "summary": "Columbia University's president strongly denounced antisemitism during a Congressional hearing Wednesday, saying after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, 'the world changed, and so did my focus.'\n'Antisemitism has no place on our campus, and I am personally committed to doing everything I can to confront it directly,' President Nemat 'Minouche' Shafik told the Republican-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce. 'Israel was brutally attacked by Hamas terrorists and very soon it became clear that these horrific events would ignite fear and anguish across our campus.'\nShafik faced questions on her handling of antisemitism on campus after the Oct. 7 attack alongside two members of Columbia's Board of Trustees and the head of the university's antisemitism task force. She faced particular scrutiny for how the university handled faculty members who made comments about Hamas that were perceived as antisemitic.\nRep. Tim Walberg, R-M.I., grilled Shafik about Joseph Massad, a tenured professor in Columbia's Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies department who published comments in October calling Hamas' attack a 'stunning victory.'\n'I do condemn his statement. I am appalled by what he said,' Shafik responded. 'He has been spoken to.'\nThe hearing became particularly heated when Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., pressed Shafik on why Massad is still listed on Columbia's website as the chair of the academic review committee.\n'Do you have my commitment that he will be removed as chair today?' Stefanik asked Shafik, who said she would get back to Stefanik with the facts.\nStefanik also questioned Shafik about Mohamed Abdou, a visiting professor at the Middle East Institute at Columbia. She referred to an Oct. 11 post on Facebook in which Abdou wrote, 'Yes, I'm with the muqawamah (the resistance) be it Hamas and Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad but up to a point.'\nWhen asked about consequences, Shafik said Abdou 'will never work at Columbia again.'\nMinouche Shafik's testimony came after she declined a December request, citing scheduling conflicts. Tom Williams / CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images Her appearance in Congress came months after declining to testify at a December hearing, citing scheduling conflicts.\nThat hearing saw testimonies from the presidents of the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who all drew intense scrutiny for their responses to questions regarding antisemitism and hate speech on campus. Penn and Harvard's presidents have since resigned.\nWhen Shafik and her colleagues were asked by Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-OR, whether calling for the genocide of Jewish people violates Columbia's rules — the same question posed to Harvard, MIT and Penn's presidents — all answered 'yes.' She also asked Shafik about the chants 'by any means necessary' and 'intifada,' which Shafik said were distressing.\nAhead of her hearing, Shafik published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal about what she planned to speak about in Congress.\n\"Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, I have spent the most of my time addressing its aftershocks,\" Shafik wrote. \"It is hard to describe how difficult this has been, especially on a large, diverse urban campus with students from all over the world and a long tradition of political activism.\"\nThe university is currently being sued by five Jewish students and two student organizations after it suspended the student groups Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace last November. In March, Shafik confirmed that a \"number\" of Columbia students were suspended after allegedly participating in an unauthorized panel called \"Resistance 101\" that featured speakers who supported Hamas.\nEmi Tuyetnhi Tran",

            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday ripped the jury selection process for his historic New York criminal trial, the day after the first seven jurors were selected out of a pool of nearly 100 people.\nPosting about the hush money trial on its scheduled off-day, Trump — who has repeatedly accused the judge in the case of being biased against him — suggested incorrectly that he should be entitled to unlimited strikes of potential jurors in his criminal case.\n'I thought STRIKES were supposed to be 'unlimited' when we were picking our jury? I was then told we only had 10, not nearly enough when we were purposely given the 2nd Worst Venue in the Country,\" he wrote in a post on Truth Social, before decrying the criminal cases against him as \"election interference\" and part of a \"witch hunt.\"\nUnder New York law, each side does have an unlimited number of strikes 'for cause,' but the judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan, can decide whether or not that cause is worthy of a strike.\nbut the judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan, can decide whether or not that cause is worthy of a strike.\nThe two sides are also entitled to a limited number of \"peremptory strikes\" — potential jurors they can dismiss. Because Trump is charged with a Class E felony, which is a lower-level felony, he and prosecutors are entitled to 10 peremptory challenges each. (The number goes up to 20 for defendants facing the highest level of felony charge, Class A.)\nWhile the judge has dismissed scores of potential jurors in the case who said they could not be impartial or had scheduling conflicts, he's only dismissed two \"for cause\" in the two days since jury selection began. One was a person who'd written \"lock him up\" of Trump in a 2017 social media post. The judge denied some other Trump \"cause\" dismissal requests, including a woman who'd posted on Facebook about celebrating Joe Biden's 2020 election win.\nTrump's attorney Todd Blanche then used one of his peremptory challenges to have the woman removed.\nBy the end of the day Tuesday, both Trump and prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office had used six of their 10 challenges, meaning they only have four each left for the remaining jurors.\nTwo potential jurors the DA's office used its strikes on were people who said they'd read Trump's book \"The Art of the Deal.\"\nTrump is required to attend the trial, which is expected to last as long as eight weeks and take place every weekday except Wednesday and holidays. The rigorous trial schedule will limit his ability to join in-person campaign events as part of his presidential bid — something the former president has complained about repeatedly. NBC News reported last month that Trump plans to leverage his legal issues for political gain by falsely blaming President Joe Biden.\nJury selection is scheduled to resume Thursday morning with a pool of an additional 96 prospective jurors. Once a full 12-person jury has been selected, the two sides then pick alternate jurors.\nMerchan appeared hopeful Tuesday that jury selection will be done by the end of the day Friday. He told the seven jurors who have been selected to return Monday morning for opening statements, while also cautioning the date could change.\nTrump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to a porn star during the closing days of the 2016 presidential election.

Autopsy for ‘Unabomber' Ted Kaczynski details cancer, depression before death John Youngbear / AP file An autopsy report for Ted Kaczynski, the domestic terrorist known as the 'Unabomber,' shows that he was diagnosed with rectal cancer and 'was noted to be depressed' before his death last year at the age of 81. The report, obtained 10 months after his death by suicide, offers new details into Kaczysnki's health and final months and raises questions about whether his death was preventable.\nKaczynski was diagnosed with rectal cancer in March 2021, and he received biweekly chemotherapy until March 2023, medical examiners said. About a month before Kaczynski's death, an oncologist noted that he 'appeared depressed.' On June 10, 2023, Kaczynski attempted suicide, and later died at a hospital.\nWhether Kaczynski's depression resulted in a suicide watch is unclear. But given Kaczynski's status within the federal prison system, one expert says 'it's somewhat surprising' he was able to end his life. Read the exclusive story here.\nRead the exclusive story here. Boeing whistleblower doubles down ahead of Senate hearing A Boeing whistleblower is expected to testify before a U.S. Senate subcommittee today about his concerns with the company's 787 Dreamliner, which he said is unsafe to fly and could 'drop to the ground' midflight unless problems are addressed.

            "summary": "Four days into the first criminal trial of a president, Donald Trump was showing signs of frustrations.\nHe had listened to scores of New Yorkers express less-than-favorable opinions about him, was restricted in what he could say in court and had even been told to sit down by the judge.\n'Sir, can you please have a seat,' said Juan Merchan, the soft-spoken judge who is presiding over Trump's hush money trial, when the former president thought Friday's proceedings were over and got up to leave.\nAs Trump returned to the defense table, Merchan thanked him.\nTrump exited the room minutes later looking weary and promising to testify at the trial, which he slammed as a 'witch hunt.'\nHis comments capped a week that was filled with power reversals and accusations turned upside down.\nTrump, who prosecutors say used hush money payments to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, is attempting to make a parallel case in the court of public opinion.\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday, the presumptive Republican nominee for president groused that 'instead of being in Pennsylvania or Georgia, or North Carolina or lots of other places today, I'm sitting in a courthouse all day long,' adding that process 'will go on for another four or five weeks.'\nThe trial is expected to last as many as six weeks.\nTrump, who is required to be in court for the duration of the trial, also accused the district attorney's office of waging interference in the 2024 presidential election on behalf of President Joe Biden by 'keeping me off the campaign trail.'\nHe went on to argue that he was 'not allowed to speak' after the judge said he must curtail his social media attacks against potential witnesses in the case, and later told supporters in a fundraising email that he was 'FULLY GAGGED.'\nMuch of Friday's drama unfolded outside the courthouse, where a man set himself on fire in a park facing the court. He was taken to a hospital after police extinguished the flames.\nIn the courtroom, Trump sat at the defense table as prospective jurors were asked questions aimed at sussing out their ability to be impartial.\nOne alternate juror was excused for anxiety, which she believed would hamper her ability 'to be completely fair.' Another was questioned about a social media post referencing the former president, saying, 'I do believe he's the devil.'\n'I don't recall posting that,' the man said, before being dismissed.\nTrump had taken a particular interest in the man, who had volunteered for the campaign of his 2016 Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.\nSocial media posts made the case for dismissing several other potential jurors, even after they said they could judge Trump fairly.\nA retired New York high school teacher said he could 'absolutely' be fair and impartial, but was compelled to answer questions about excavated social media posts that revealed in 2017 he had attended 'a massive anti-trump rally,' according to the caption of a picture in which he had tagged himself online.\nHe was excused.\nBy Friday afternoon, Merchan had seated a full 12-person jury and assigned six alternates. All 18 will meet for the first time on Monday morning, when opening statements are set to get underway.\nTrump's defense team looked noticeably downcast during the afternoon's proceedings, with attorney Susan Necheles slumped back into her seat, arms crossed until addressing the judge late in the day. Lead attorney Todd Blanche was seated next to Trump, and the two sat watching and occasionally whispering to one another.\nAfter Merchan said he would not consider a motion on presidential immunity and other motions, Blanche insisted there was still more to discuss.\n'This sounds suspiciously like the 10 minutes we spent arguing this on Monday … with no new facts, no new application of the law,' Merchan responded.\n'There's nothing else to re-argue,' he added as the first week of the trial came to a close. 'We're going to have opening statements Monday morning. This trial is starting.'",

            "excerpt": "The D.EA. is investigating international criminal organizations that are operating illegal marijuana grows in about 20 states, including Maine.",
            "summary": "PORTLAND, Maine — The high electricity consumption of a home, its cardboard-covered windows and odor of marijuana drew law enforcement's attention to an illicit grow operation off the beaten path in rural Maine.\nThe bust of the home with a hidden grow operation and seizure of nearly 40 pounds of processed marijuana marked the latest example of what authorities describe as a yearslong trend of foreign nationals to exploit U.S. state laws that have legalized cannabis for recreational or medical use to produce marijuana for the illicit markets in the U.S.\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration is investigating international criminal organizations that are operating illegal marijuana grows in about 20 states, including Maine, Attorney Garland Merrick Garland told the Senate Appropriations Committee this week, in response to a question raised by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.\nFederal law enforcement officials said there currently are about 100 illicit grow operations in Maine, like the one in Passadumkeag, about 60 miles north of Bangor, and about 40 search warrants have been issued since June.\nIn Passadumkeag, Xisen Guo, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in China, has been accused of transforming the house into a high-tech, illicit grow operation, according to court documents unsealed this week.\nHe was ordered held without bail Friday on federal drug charges, making him the first person to be charged federally in such a case in Maine. A detention hearing is scheduled for Monday.\nThe Internal Revenue Service and Department of Homeland Security, along with the FBI and DEA and local law enforcement, are working together to get to the bottom of the illicit grow operations in Maine, Garland said.\nThe state legalized adult consumption of marijuana, but growers must be licensed by the state. The Maine Office of Cannabis Policy said Guo was operating an unlicensed operation, according to court documents.\nThe illicit grow operations across the U.S. began cropping up several years ago. In 2018, U.S. authorities arrested a Seattle woman, conducted raids and seized thousands of marijuana plants during an investigation of an operation with Chinese ties. Oklahoma officials learned straw owners in China and Mexico were running illegal operations after marijuana was legalized by the state for medical purposes in 2018.\nThe legality of marijuana consumption and cultivation in those states tends to provide cover for illegal grow operations, which may draw less attention, officials said. The marijuana is then trafficked in states where it's illegal.\nIn Maine, U.S. Attorney Darcie McElwee said thwarting illegal growing operations with international connections is a priority for law enforcement, 'and we will continue to marshal every tool at our disposal in this effort as appropriate.'\nLaw enforcement officials know the tell-tale signs.\nPolice zeroed in on the Passadumkeag operation in part because of the home's utility bills reviewed by deputies. After the home was purchased for $125,000 cash, the electricity use went from about $300 a month to as high as nearly $9,000, according to court documents.\nThat's consistent with heat pumps, costly lighting and other gear needed to grow marijuana, investigators said. The home owner, a limited liability company, upgraded the electric capability to double what is found in a typical Maine home, according to documents.\nGuo's attorney didn't immediately return a call from The Associated Press. Two others who were at the home at the time of the police raid in February were released and not charged.\nMcElwee said law enforcement — from local and county police to the FBI and DEA — are starting to make headway with 'dozens of operations' shuttered over the last several months.\n'The possible involvement of foreign nationals using Maine properties to profit from unlicensed marijuana operations and interstate distributions makes it clear that there is a need for a strong and sustained federal, state and local effort to shut down these operations,' she said.\nLaw enforcement officials also continue to investigate who is directing the operations and where the profits are going, she said.\nThe Associated Press",

            "summary": "The Biden administration sent about 50 Haitians back to their country on Thursday, authorities said, marking the first deportation flight in several months to the Caribbean nation struggling with surging gang violence.\nThe Homeland Security Department said in a statement that it 'will continue to enforce U.S. laws and policy throughout the Florida Straits and and the Caribbean region, as well as at the southwest border. U.S. policy is to return noncitizens who do not establish a legal basis to remain in the United States.'\nAuthorities didn't offer details of the flight beyond how many deported Haitians were aboard.\nThomas Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data, said a plane left Alexandria, Louisiana, a hub for deportation operations, and arrived in Cap-Haïtien, Haiti, after a stop in Miami.\nMarjorie Dorsaninvil, a U.S. citizen, said her Haitian fiancé, Gerson Joseph, called in tears from the Miami airport Thursday morning to say he was being deported on a flight to Cap-Haïtien with other Haitians and some from other countries, including the Bahamas.\nJoseph lived in the U.S. more than 20 years and has a 7-year-old U.S. citizen daughter with another woman. He had a deportation order dating from 2005 after losing an asylum bid that his attorney, Philip Issa, said was a result of poor legal representation at the time. Though Joseph wasn't deported previously, his lawyer was seeking to have that order overturned.\nJoseph was convicted of theft and burglary, and ordered to pay restitution of $270, Issa said. He has been detained since last year.\nDorsaninvil said her fiancé has 'nobody' in Haiti. 'It is devastating for me. We were planning a wedding and now he is gone,' she said.\nMore than 33,000 people fled Haiti's capital in a span of less than two weeks as gangs pillaged homes and attacked state institutions, according to a report last month from the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration. The majority of those displaced traveled to Haiti's southern region, which is generally peaceful compared with Port-au-Prince, which has an estimated population of 3 million and is largely paralyzed by gang violence.\nHaiti's National Police is understaffed and overwhelmed by gangs with powerful arsenals. Many hospitals ceased operations amid a shortage of medical supplies.\nThe U.S. operated one deportation flight a month to Haiti from December 2022 through last January, according to Witness at the Border. It said deportation flights were frequent after a camp of 16,000 largely Haitian migrants assembled on the riverbanks of Del Rio, Texas, in September 2021 but became rare as fewer Haitians crossed the border illegally from Mexico.\nHaitians were arrested crossing the border from Mexico 286 times during the first three months of the year, less than 0.1% of the more than 400,000 arrests among all nationalities. More than 150,000 have entered the U.S. legally since January 2023 under presidential powers to grant entry for humanitarian reasons, and many others came legally using an online appointment system at land crossings with Mexico called CBP One.\nHomeland Security said Thursday that it was 'monitoring the situation' in Haiti.' The U.S. Coast Guard repatriated 65 Haitians who were stopped at sea off the Bahamas coast last month.\nHaitian Bridge Alliance, a migrant advocacy group, urged a halt in deportation flights to Haiti, saying Thursday that the U.S. was 'knowingly condemning the most vulnerable, who came to us in their time of need, to imminent danger.'\nWith Republicans seizing on the issue in an election year, the Biden administration has emphasized enforcement, most notably through a failed attempt at legislation, after record-high border arrests in December. Arrests for illegal crossings dropped by half in January and have held pretty steady since then after Mexico stepped up enforcement south of the U.S. border. Biden says he is considering executive action to halt asylum at the border during times when illegal crossings reach certain thresholds.\nThe Associated Press",

            "excerpt": "Biden's latest environmental announcements come as he is working to energize young voters for his reelection campaign.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is marking Earth Day by announcing $7 billion in federal grants for residential solar projects serving 900,000-plus households in low- and middle-income communities. He also plans to expand his New Deal-style American Climate Corps green jobs training program.\nThe grants are being awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency, which unveiled the 60 recipients on Monday. The projects are expected to eventually reduce emissions by the equivalent of 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and save households $350 million annually, according to senior administration officials.\nBiden's latest environmental announcements come as he is working to energize young voters for his reelection campaign. Young people were a key part of a broad but potentially fragile coalition that helped him defeat then-President Donald Trump in 2020. Some have joined protests around the country of the administration's handling of Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\nSenior administration officials said young Americans are keenly invested in the Biden climate agenda and want to actually help enact it. The Climate Corps initiative is a way for them to do that, the officials said.\nSolar is gaining traction as a key renewable energy source that could reduce the nation's reliance on fossil fuels, which emit planet-warming greenhouse gases. Not only is it clean, but solar energy can also boost the reliability of the electric grid.\nBut solar energy can have high costs for initial installation, making it inaccessible for many Americans — and potentially meaning a mingling of environmental policy with election-year politics.\nForty-nine of the new grants are state-level awards, six serve Native American tribes and five are multi-state awards. They can be used for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens.\nBiden is making the announcement at northern Virginia's Prince William Forest Park, about 30 miles southwest of Washington. It was established in 1936 as a summer camp for underprivileged youth from Washington, part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps to help create jobs during the Great Depression.\nBiden used executive action last year to create the American Climate Corps modeled on Roosevelt's New Deal. He is announcing Monday that nearly 2,000 corps positions are being offered across 36 states, including jobs offered in partnership with the North American Building Trades Unions.\nBiden has often used Earth Day as a backdrop to further his administration's climate initiatives. Last year, he signed an executive order creating the White House Office of Environmental Justice, meant to help ensure that poverty, race and ethnic status do not lead to worse exposure to pollution and environmental harm.\nHe has tried to draw a contrast with GOP congressional leaders, who have called for less regulation of oil production to lower energy prices. Biden officials counter that GOP policies benefit highly profitable oil companies and could ultimately undermine U.S. efforts to compete with the Chinese in the renewable energy sector.\nBiden will use his Virginia visit to discuss how 'a climate crisis fully manifest to the American people in communities all across the country, is also an opportunity for us to come together,' said White House National Climate Adviser Ali Zaidi.\nHe said the programs can 'unlock economic opportunity to create pathways to middle-class-supporting careers, to save people money and improve their quality of life.'\nThe awards came from the Solar for All program, part of the $27 billion 'green bank' created as part of a sweeping climate law passed in 2022. The bank is intended to reduce climate and air pollution and send money to neighborhoods most in need, especially disadvantaged and low-income communities disproportionately impacted by climate change.\nEPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe said she was 'looking forward to these funds getting out into the community, giving people skills, putting them to work in their local communities, and allowing people to save on their energy bills so that they can put those dollars to other needs.'\nAmong those receiving grants are state projects to provide solar-equipped roofs for homes, college residences and residential-serving community solar projects in West Virginia, a non-profit operating Mississippi solar lease program and solar workforce training initiatives in South Carolina.\nThe taxpayer-funded green bank has faced Republican opposition and concerns over accountability for how the money gets used. EPA previously disbursed the other $20 billion of the bank's funds to nonprofits and community development banks for clean energy projects such as residential heat pumps, additional energy-efficient home improvements and larger-scale projects like electric vehicle charging stations and community cooling centers.\nThe Associated Press",

            "summary": "No one will ever accuse former President Donald Trump of being woke. But over a few hours Monday, he transformed from a disinterested observer at his own hush-money trial — eyes shut at times — to a highly attentive defendant-in-chief.\nMaybe it was the chance to stare the full jury in the eyes, which he did when they sat in their box — against the wall to his right — and when they entered and exited the courtroom. Perhaps it was onetime ally and alleged co-conspirator David Pecker testifying against him from a dozen or so feet away. Or, it could just have been that all the talk was finally about him — after jury selection and arguments on legal points last week.\nSitting in a wood-paneled courtroom seemingly designed to induce sleep — like a 1950s junior high school or any branch office of a state's Department of Motor Vehicles — Trump leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes at the start of the fifth day of his trial. But after Judge Juan Merchan dispensed with rote procedural matters, including a long set of instructions for jurors, Trump began to focus more intently on the other key players in the room.\nHe stared straight ahead during prosecutor Matthew Colangelo's opening statement, willfully refusing to look at an adversary who previewed the case for the jury. Trump conspired with one-time \"fixer\" Michael Cohen and former tabloid publisher David Pecker to stop pornographic-film actress Stormy Daniels from publicly accusing him of having an affair with her, Colangelo alleged.\n\"Then he covered up … that scheme by lying in his New York business records,' Colangelo said, adding that the full set of actions amounted to \"an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of a presidential election\" and \"conceal that illegal election fraud.'\nNo one could snooze through that.\nMerchan, chin between his thumb and forefinger, twisted his seat toward the jury box and shifted his gaze — ping-pong style — from jurors to prosecutor as he rocked back and forth lightly in his chair.\nTrump finally recast his eyes once Colangelo turned the floor over to defense lawyer Todd Blanche for his opening statement. Trump isn't just a former president or the Republican nominee for president in 2024, Blanche said as he aimed to frame his client as a peer of the jurors.\n'He's also a man,\" Blanche said. \"He's a husband. He's a father. He's a person, just like you and just like me.'\nAs his own lawyer spoke, it was unclear at times from the closed-circuit telecast inside the courtroom when Trump looked at jurors and when he looked at Blanche. The head-on frame of Trump didn't include the jury box. But viewed from behind, the shifting angle of his profile showed that he split time between focusing on the jury and on Blanche.\nFor most of the day, his mouth was drawn in a familiar and serious expression that betrayed no emotion, even as his lawyer began to tear down Cohen's credibility with the jury.\n'I submit to you that he cannot be trusted,' Blanche said of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to lying to Congress when he was still in Trump's good graces.\nBlanche also countered the prosecution with more than a testament to Cohen's checkered history with the truth and Trump's membership in the clubs of man, father, husband and humanity.\n\"The story that you just heard\" from prosecutors, he said, \"you will learn is not true, and at the end of this trial there will be plenty of reasonable doubt.\" For Trump to be convicted, all 12 jurors must decide that he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\nWithout any doubt, Monday, his interest grew as Pecker took the stand as the prosecution's first witness. The former chief of American Media is a central figure because, prosecutors allege, he agreed to help by promoting bad stories about Trump's 2016 opponents, running articles praising Trump and, most importantly, helping Trump silence those who would tell negative tales about him.\nPecker did not get through much of his testimony before Merchan adjourned the trial for the day. The Passover holiday and a juror's need for emergency dental work conspired to force the pause.\nBut as Pecker testified, Trump leaned forward into the defense table, spoke animatedly with lawyer Emil Bove and furiously scribbled notes on a piece of paper that he shared with Bove and Blanche. His entire demeanor had changed over the course of a day, hinting that he plans to be an active participant in his trial going forward.\nIn a courthouse hallway, Trump ripped into prosecutors for pursuing the trial.\n'It's a case as to bookkeeping, which is a very minor thing in terms of the law, in terms of all the violent crime,' he said. \"It's very unfair...I should be allowed to campaign.\"\nProsecutors say a campaign — the 2016 version — compelled him to pay hush money to Daniels and then cover it up with fictitious records.\nNow, the sleeping giant is awake.\nJonathan Allen",

            "summary": "A man set himself on fire Friday outside of a New York City courthouse at about the same time that jury selection had just been completed for former President Donald Trump's historical criminal trial inside.\nA spokesperson for the NYPD said the man, identified as Max Azzarello of Florida, was in critical condition. He appears to have had pamphlets describing a conspiracy involving cryptocurrency that he threw around before setting himself ablaze, police said.\nThe incident, which took place shortly after 1:30 p.m. ET inside an area set aside for demonstrators, came amid an intense day inside the courtroom that resulted in two jurors breaking down in tears and three being excused after expressing anxiety about being on the case.\n\"We have our full panel,\" Judge Juan Merchan declared after they added the last of the six alternates who will serve alongside the panel of 12 jurors, paving the way for opening statements in the first-ever criminal trial of a former president to begin Monday. The 12 and one alternate had been chosen by the end of the day Thursday.\nThe five alternates who were ultimately selected Friday include an unemployed married woman who's into art and described herself as not political, an audio professional, a contract specialist, a clothing company executive and a construction company project manager. It took four days of jury selection to find the 18 jurors.\nTrump took to social media after the jury was selected to complain the judge is \"'railroading' me, at breakneck speed, in order to completely satisfy his 'friends'.\"\nThe day began with the judge calling up the 22 remaining potential jurors from the previous pool of 96 to answer questions designed to indicate whether they could be fair and impartial about the divisive real estate mogul and presumptive Republican nominee for president.\nof 96 to answer questions designed to indicate whether they could be fair and impartial about the divisive real estate mogul and presumptive Republican nominee for president.

Brendan McDermid / Pool via Getty Images The first of those potential jurors was dismissed after she said she didn't think she could be fair. 'I have really, really bad anxiety and people have found out where I am,\" she told the judge. A short time later, two other potential jurors were dismissed after each told the judge that upon further reflection, \"I don't think I can be impartial.\"\nOther potential jurors included a married father who said he listens to a podcast called \"Order of Man,\" which is described on Apple's website as discussions about \"reclaiming what it means to be a man.\" Some past guests of the podcast include people who've been outspoken in their support of Trump and were highly critical of the civil fraud case New York Attorney General Letitia James brought against the former president. The man, an audio specialist, was chosen as one of the alternates.\nAnother potential juror was a married fund manager who said he'd done \"get-out-the-vote\" work for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Trump's 2016 presidential opponent. Trump and his attorney Todd Blanche passed notes back and forth while that juror was speaking. He was later dismissed after being asked about a 2020 Facebook post where he apparently called Trump 'the devil and a sociopath.'\nTrump appeared most interested in jurors whose answers offer ambiguity around their personal political views. When one prospective juror said they were a Fox News viewer, Trump cocked his head, then quickly conferred with his lawyer, Todd Blanche.\nAnother potential juror was a woman who became emotional as she disclosed she'd served two years in prison on drug-related charges, but said she could be \"fair and impartial.\"\nDuring a morning break, Merchan — who'd chided reporters on Thursday for disclosing too much information about potential jurors — said the woman had shared \"very personal things about her life\" and was \"very brave.\" 'I just wanted to encourage the press to please be kind. Please be kind to this person,' the judge said. He later dismissed her, saying she needed a certificate of release to be qualified for service going forward. On her way out, she cheerfully called out, \"Good luck!\"\nFollowing that juror's departure, the DA's office began its individual questioning of the jurors. One woman, who'd disclosed that her father is lifelong friends with Trump ally turned critic Chris Christie, broke down in tears when prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked her an innocuous question about the burden of proof in the case. \"I feel so nervous and anxious right now. I'm sorry,\" she responded, bursting out into tears. \"I thought I could do this,\" she said, adding \"I wouldn't want someone who feels this way to judge my case.\" She was dismissed.\nHoffinger's questioning was followed by Trump attorney Susan Necheles, who asked a potential juror who'd started their own business how she would assess a witness's credibility. The woman then asked to speak to the judge, saying she was \"getting anxiety and self-doubt' from Necheles's line of questioning. She was dismissed.\nNecheles later asked another woman — who previously said she was a victim of sexual assault — whether she would hold it against Trump that women outside this case have accused Trump of sexual assault. She said she would not have a problem setting those accusations aside but the judge ultimately excused her, saying, \"It's best to err on the side of caution.\"\nAnother man said he has some differences from Trump on his policies but thinks he's 'usually awesome.' He was not chosen for the jury.\nOn his way into court in the morning, Trump again complained the case against him is \"unfair,\" and that the partial gag order preventing him from lashing out at witnesses, prosecutors, court staffers and jurors is not \"constitutional.\" \"Everyone else can say whatever they want about me. They can say anything they want. They can continue to make up lies and everything else. They lie. They're real scum. But you know what? I'm not allowed to speak,\" he told reporters.\nProsecutors this week asked the judge to fine Trump and hold him in contempt for social media posts that they said violate the gag order. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Tuesday..\nThe main panel of 12 is made up of seven men and five women, including two lawyers, a teacher, a retired wealth manager, a product development manager, a security engineer, a software engineer, a speech therapist and a physical therapist. The foreman — the juror who essentially acts as the leader and spokesperson for the panel — is a married man who works in sales and gets his news from The New York Times, MSNBC and Fox News.\nThe lone alternate selected Thursday is a woman who works as an asset manager.\nLater in the day, Merchan held what's known as a Sandoval hearing. That's a type of hearing designed to let defendants know the scope of questions they could face from prosecutors on cross-examination so they can make informed decisions about whether to take the witness stand in their own defense.\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office disclosed in a court filing that it would like to ask Trump about several items, among them the $464 million civil judgment against him and his company for fraud, the total $88 million verdicts and liability findings for sexual abuse and defamation in lawsuits brought by writer E. Jean Carroll and a number of other adverse court rulings over the past few years.\nTrump has denied wrongdoing in all the cases and is appealing the fraud judgment and the Carroll verdicts.\nProsecutors said they want to be able to bring those findings up 'to impeach the credibility of the defendant' if he takes the witness stand.\nDiscussing the findings in the fraud case, prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told the judge it was \"hard to think of something that is more squarely in the wheelhouse' for the DA to ask Trump about \"than a finding by a judge of persistent and repeated fraud and illegality.\"\nTrump's attorney Emil Bove countered that prosecutors shouldn't be able to breach the topic at all because Trump's appeal is still pending. He made similar arguments over the DA's contention that they should be allowed to ask about a judge's finding that he was untruthful on the witness stand during the fraud trial and had violated a gag order in the case.\n'Is it your position that because a case is being appealed or might be appealed, that therefore it can not be used?\" Merchan asked the lawyer. \"Not necessarily,\" Bove replied.\nThe judge said he'd issue his ruling on the dispute on Monday morning.\nTrump said last week he 'absolutely' plans to testify, but he is under no obligation to do so.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records and faces up to four years in prison if he is convicted.\nBragg alleges that Trump falsified records to hide money he was paying his former lawyer Michael Cohen to reimburse him for $130,000 he paid adult film actor Stormy Daniels near the end of the 2016 presidential campaign. Daniels has claimed she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. Trump has denied that he slept with Daniels, but he has acknowledged repaying Cohen.\nThe DA's office also alleges that as part of a scheme to boost Trump, National Enquirer publisher American Media Inc. paid $150,000 to model and actor Karen McDougal, who appeared in Playboy magazine and claimed that she had a nine-month affair with Trump before he was elected president 'in exchange for her agreement not to speak out about the alleged sexual relationship,' according to a statement of facts filed by Bragg.\nTrump has also denied having a sexual relationship with McDougal.\nAdam Reiss Lisa Rubin Dareh Gregorian Katherine Doyle contributed.",

            "excerpt": "A series of early-1900s Supreme Court rulings included discriminatory language and helped ensure that people in U.S. territories would not have the same rights as other Americans.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — A mostly Democratic group of lawmakers are among those launching a renewed push for the Justice Department to condemn racist Supreme Court rulings from a century ago that shaped a legal landscape in which people living in U.S. territories were essentially treated as second-class citizens.\nCivil rights groups and professional legal associations are also joining the effort targeting the so-called \"Insular Cases,\" beginning with a letter sent to the Attorney General Merrick Garland this week.\nLawmakers, including members of the Senate and House of Representatives, are also holding a press conference Wednesday to bring attention to the issue.\nAmong the 43 lawmakers signing the new letter are Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the ranking member of House Judiciary Committee.\n\"Today, the Department of Justice has the opportunity to redress this historic error by unequivocally rejecting the discriminatory and racist doctrine of territorial incorporation established by the Insular Cases ,\" the lawmakers wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by NBC News.\n,\" the lawmakers wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by NBC News. Two Republicans who serve as their territories' delegates in Congress, James Moylan of Guam and Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon of Puerto Rico, also signed on. The other signatories are all Democrats.\nThe Insular Cases were a series of rulings issued in the 1900s soon after the U.S. had acquired Puerto Rico and other territories in which the court said people in those jurisdictions did not have all the constitutional rights of those living in the mainland.\nJustice Henry Billings Brown in a 1901 case referred to territories as lands 'inhabited by alien races' who might not abide by 'Anglo-Saxon principles.' Five years earlier, Brown had authored the notorious Plessy v. Ferguson ruling, which endorsed racial segregation.\nIn a separate opinion in the 1901 case, Justice Edward Douglass White said the U.S. had the right to acquire 'an unknown island, peopled with an uncivilized race,' without having to confer full constitutional protections. Several further rulings developed the theory that certain rights but not others applied to people in territories.\nTo date, the Supreme Court itself has not been receptive to pleas that it officially distance itself from the insular cases. Only two of the nine justices, conservative Neil Gorsuch and liberal Sonia Sotomayor, have expressed concerns about the precedents remaining on the books.\nIn a 2022 opinion, Gorsuch suggested the court take up a case in which the Insular Cases could be reversed, saying they include \"ugly racial stereotypes\" and that their flaws are 'as fundamental as they are shameful.'\nLater in 2022, the court declined to take up a case concerning the rights of American Samoans that could have given the justices the opportunity to address the matter.\nCivil rights groups and some lawmakers have previously asked the Justice Department to abandon reliance on the cases. The department has made some statements distancing itself from the rulings but has not expressly repudiated them.\nIn a March court filing, for example, Justice Department lawyers wrote that the government agreed with critics that \"aspects of the Insular Cases' reasoning and rhetoric, which invoke racist stereotypes, are indefensible and repugnant.\"\nNeil Weare, co-director of an advocacy group called Right to Democracy that has taken aim at the Insular Cases, said the Justice Department \"continues to take a step in the right direction but has fallen short of unequivocally condemning the Insular Cases.\"\nThe new letter would be followed by other actions, which could include new legal filings, he added.\nRep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., who is ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee and helped organize the letter, said in a statement that the Justice Department should \"go further and unequivocally reject these racist decisions, much as it has for other Supreme Court opinions that relied on racist stereotypes that do not abide by the Constitution's command of equality and respect for rule of law.\"\nThere is precedent for such an action, with the Justice Department in 2011 issuing an \"admission of error\" for its role in the 1944 Supreme Court ruling in a case called Korematsu v. United States, which upheld the interment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.\nThe Supreme Court in 2018 officially repudiated Korematsu, with Chief Justice John Roberts saying it was \"gravely wrong on the day it was decided.\"\nA Justice Department spokesman had no immediate comment on the new letter.\nThere are five U.S. territories: Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands. Puerto Rico, with about 3 million residents, is by the far the largest by population.\nLawrence Hurley",

            "excerpt": "The proceedings mark the first time a former president has stood trial on criminal charges. Trump is facing 34 counts of felony falsification of business records.",
            "summary": "Donald Trump will make history Monday as the first former president to stand trial on criminal charges, a watershed moment for American politics, the presidential election and Trump himself.\nTrump — the presumptive Republican nominee for president — is required to be present for the entire trial, which could last as long as eight weeks. He's pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records, a low-level felony punishable by up to four years in prison. The trial kicks off Monday with jury selection.\nThe charges relate to Trump's first run for president, in 2016. Prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office allege he took part in a scheme with his then-lawyer Michael Cohen and the publisher of the National Enquirer to suppress scandalous stories about him in the run-up to Election Day.\nOne of those stories involved porn star Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. Trump has denied the claim, and Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 in October 2016 to keep quiet about the allegation. After he was elected, Trump repaid Cohen in payments recorded as legal fees at his company —documents the DA alleges were falsified to keep the hush money payments secret.\nTrump has maintained he didn't do anything wrong and derided the case as being part of a politically motivated 'witch hunt' against him, a claim he's used to galvanize his supporters and rake in millions of dollars in fundraising for his campaign.\nThe criminal case was the first of four brought against Trump in four different jurisdictions and is the only case definitively set to go to trial before the election.\nBecause Trump is required to be in court four days a week (the trial does not take place on Wednesdays), his ability to campaign in person is limited to times the court is not in session. But as he did during his previous New York trials, Trump is likely to speak publicly during breaks and after court adjourns for the day.\nThe start of the trial comes despite numerous last-ditch efforts by Trump to delay it, including by filing appeals accusing Judge Juan Merchan of having a conflict of interest because his daughter's media firm does work for Democratic candidates, arguing the judge's partial gag order against him is 'unconstitutional,' and claiming that it's impossible for him to get a fair trial in Manhattan given the huge amount of pretrial publicity surrounding the case.\nThe DA's office countered in a court filing that 'given the sheer size of New York County, it is absurd for [Trump] to assert that it will be impossible or even impractical to find a dozen fair and impartial jurors, plus alternates, among more than a million people.'\nThe jury selection process is expected to take one to two weeks. Two sources with direct knowledge of the situation told NBC News that 6,000 jurors have been called to the Manhattan criminal courts this week — 2,000 more than in a typical week.\nMerchan announced a methodical system of whittling down the large jury pool to 12 jurors and six alternates who can be 'fair and impartial' about the deeply polarizing Trump.\nEighteen jurors will be put in the jury box at a time and each one in succession will read out loud their answers to a series of 42 questions. The questions include inquiries about what news sources they follow, whether they've ever attended any Trump rallies or anti-Trump protests, and whether they've ever supported the QAnon movement or antifa.\nThe form does not ask about party affiliation, political contributions or voting history, but the judge said answers to those questions 'may easily be gleaned from the responses to other questions.' After the 42 questions are answered, prosecutors can ask the jurors a series of follow-up questions, and then Trump's attorneys can ask their own follow-ups.\nMerchan warned both sides 'not to seek to expand the degree of intrusion beyond what is relevant and has already been approved,' and rejected a request from Trump's attorneys that jurors be asked whether they 'like' the former president.\n'Such questions are irrelevant because they do not go to the issue of the prospective juror's qualifications,' he wrote in an order made public on April 8. 'The ultimate issue is whether the prospective juror can ensure us that they will set aside any personal feelings or biases and render a decision that is based on the evidence and the law,' the order said.\nThe trial will have an anonymous jury, meaning the jurors' identities and addresses will not be made public. The judge said the move was necessary because of 'a likelihood of bribery, jury tampering, or of physical injury or harassment of juror(s).'\nWhile the trial is the first criminal trial involving a former president, it's the fourth trial in New York involving Trump as a defendant since he left office. He was sued twice by writer E. Jean Carroll for sexual abuse and defamation and he and his company were accused of fraud in a civil case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. The verdicts against him in the three cases — all of which he is appealing — total about $550 million.\nAdam Reiss Dareh Gregorian Zoë Richards contributed.",

            "summary": "When an Afghan national on the FBI terrorist watchlist was arrested last Thursday after having spent nearly a year in the U.S., immigration officials said he had been enrolled in a program that tracked his location via ankle monitor, mobile app or telephone.\nBut the man's participation in the monitoring program, known as Alternatives to Detention, lasted only a little over two weeks, NBC News has learned.\nMohammad Kharwin, 48, is believed to have then spent 10 months in the U.S. without any kind of monitoring system, according to sources familiar with his case.\nThe national terrorist watchlist indicates Kharwin is a member of Hezb-e-Islami, or HIG, an Afghanistan-based political and paramilitary group that the U.S. has designated a terrorist organization.\nHIG was responsible for attacks in Afghanistan that killed at least nine American soldiers and civilians from 2013 to 2015. The group is not seen as a top threat in terms of attacks inside the U.S.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security Department officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nNBC News reported last week that Customs and Border Protection agents first arrested Kharwin on March 10, 2023, near San Ysidro, California, after he crossed the Mexico-U.S. border illegally.\nAt the time, Customs and Border Protection agents did not have complete information about Kharwin and could not confirm that he was on the terrorist watchlist. So he was treated like other low-threat migrants coming into the U.S.\nWhen border agents released him, Kharwin was referred to Alternatives to Detention, run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. Kharwin was enrolled in the tracking program on March 12, 2023, and then taken out of it on March 28, 2023. It is not clear why he was dropped from the program.\nRoughly a year later, ICE agents arrested Kharwin in February after the FBI passed information to them indicating that Kharwin had potential terrorist ties. But when Kharwin appeared in court, ICE prosecutors did not share some classified information with the immigration judge that purportedly showed Kharwin's ties to a terrorist group, two U.S. officials said.\nProsecutors argued that Kharwin should be detained without bond because he posed a flight risk, but they did not say he was a national security risk, according to sources familiar with the case. The judge ordered Kharwin released on $12,000 bond.\nSeveral hours after NBC News broke the news last Thursday that Kharwin remained in the U.S., he was arrested in San Antonio and taken into ICE custody, according to a Homeland Security spokesperson.\nExperts said Kharwin's case raises questions about how migrants who may pose a security threat are vetted and tracked inside the U.S.\nIt also raises questions about the Alternatives to Detention program, which the Biden administration has vastly expanded as a way to keep tabs on hundreds of thousands of migrants in the U.S. awaiting immigration court proceedings.\nRepublicans in Congress, who oppose the program, have cut funding to it, forcing ICE to drop migrants from being monitored, often as soon as they make their first check-ins at ICE offices.\nIn February 2023, NBC News reported that Homeland Security officials said they would have to begin cutting migrants from Alternatives to Detention because Congress had not provided adequate funding.\nIt is not clear how ICE determines which migrants to drop from the program. The Homeland Security Department can also work with other law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, to gather intelligence and learn the whereabouts of migrants.\nA Homeland Security official told NBC News that many migrants who are determined to be low flight risks are not kept in Alternatives to Detention until their court dates, which could be a year or more into the future.\nAn estimated 183,901 migrants have been in Alternatives to Detention for an average of 554 days, according to data provided by Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse for immigration data. At the time Kharwin was dropped from the program, 281,613 migrants had been in the program for an average of 429 days.\nA source familiar with the program who spoke on condition of anonymity defended it and said Alternatives to Detention is 'the only way to track an individual through GPS technology.' The source added, 'Otherwise, you're relying on people to show up on their own accord.'\nAlternatives to Detention began in 2004, during the Bush administration. According to the Homeland Security Department, the number of migrants absconding from the program has 'dropped dramatically' in recent years, and enrollment in Alternatives to Detention increases the chances that immigrants show up for their immigration court hearings.\nImmigration advocates praise the program as a more humane and less costly way for the government to keep tabs on migrants awaiting hearings. Republicans in Congress have pressed Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for not filling all beds in ICE detention facilities, instead.\nIt is rare for migrants crossing the southern border to be on the terrorist watchlist.\nAn NBC News analysis found that the percentage of migrants on the terrorist watchlist as a proportion of the total number of Customs and Border Protection encounters across all U.S. borders was slightly lower during the Biden administration than during the Trump administration. It remained an average of 0.02% during the Biden administration, lower than the 0.05% under former President Donald Trump.\nJulia Ainsley",

            "summary": "Trump Media is making a point of telling its shareholders how to prevent their stock from being loaned to short sellers — who bet the price of the shares will drop.\nThe short-selling-prevention tips posted Wednesday on Trump Media's website come as its DJT stock has sharply fallen in price since it began being public trading on March 26 — and as short sellers have taken a keen interest in the owner of the Truth Social app despite relatively high fees to finance such trades.\nTrump Media's share price rose sharply on Wednesday, by more than 15%, its closing price of $26.40 was still a whopping 63% lower than the price it opened at on March 26.\nThe stock slumped by 20% last week alone, and then plummeted by more than 18% on Monday and another more than 14% on Tuesday.\nThe share price Wednesday was nearly 46% lower than its closing price on April 1, the same day Trump Media disclosed it had booked a $58 million loss for 2023, with just $4.1 million in revenue for that year.\nFormer President Donald Trump is by far the biggest shareholder in Trump Media, owning nearly 60% of its shares. And his 78.75 million shares could soon grow by 36 million shares if DJT's price stays above $17 per share in the coming days due to an earnout provision in the merger deal that took the company public.\nBut Trump, who is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and Trump Media since late March seen billions of dollars in share value evaporate from share price declines.\nOn Wednesday, following two straight days of sharp price drops, the company included a supplement to its frequently asked questions list on its website, which it detailed in an 8-K filing on Thursday morning with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe supplement offers detailed instructions to shareholders on: ' How do I prevent my shares from being loaned for a short interest position?'\nShort selling is the practice of borrowing shares of a company's stock, and then quickly selling those shares for a certain amount of money. The short seller then waits, hoping that the share price will drop over some period of time, so that they can then repurchase the same number of shares and give them back to the lender, pocketing the difference between what they first sold the shares for as profit after paying brokers' fees.\n'For long-term shareholders who believe in the Company's future, the Company is highlighting the following actions you can take with your brokerage firm to prevent the lending of your shares for short selling,' Trump Media said in its supplement to its FAQ Wednesday.\nThe tips include holding DJT shares in a cash account at a brokerage firm as opposed to a margin account, 'opting out of any securities lending program,' moving Trump Media shares to the company's designated transfer agent, and transferring shares to a bank and 'holding them in your retirement account.'\nThe instructions include a helpful form letter that shareholder can send to their brokers.\nThe letter says: 'Please accept this written instruction to make sure that the following securities are held in my cash account only and accordingly are not available for any stock loan activities.'\n'I hereby expressly opt-out of any securities lending programs and instruct you to not loan out any of my shares,' the letter says, before a section that the sender can fill out with their number of shares.\nA spokeswoman for Trump Media did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new instructions regarding preventing short selling.\nShort selling is particularly risky because it is markedly different than a 'long position' in a stock — in which a person can only lose the amount of money they paid for shares if their price falls to zero.\nIn contrast, a short position in a stock can in theory see its price rise without stopping, leaving the short seller responsible for paying exponentially more money to buy back the shares to return to the lender.\nTrump Media in its update FAQ nodded to that risk in noting that brokerage firms loan shares 'to sophisticated and institutional investors' to do short sales. Brokers often insist that customers who do short sales with them are experienced investors, and have sufficient cash or collateral on hand that can insure that if the short trade goes bad they can cover their losses.\nTrump Media also pointed out that lending shares to short sellers can earn brokerage firms 'an alternative source of revenue.'\n'If the price of the stock in fact decreases, then the brokerage firm and the sophisticated and institutional investors will have made a profit, while the ultimate retail investor has not,' Trump Media told its shareholders.'\nOnly about 5 million shares of DJT have been available to short out of more than 136 million company shares. And much of the 5 million shares were already locked up in short positions earlier this month.\nBut Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, told CNBC in early April, 'What I'm hearing on the Street is that if [an amount] of stock becomes available, shorts are taking it down.'\nDan Mangan, CNBC",

            "excerpt": "Neil Makhija, a county commissioner in a key Pennsylvania county, recently held a Voter Hall of Fame to inspire more people to get out and vote.",
            "summary": "NORRISTOWN, Pa. — Neil Makhija is on a mission.\nNeil Makhija is on a mission. As the county commissioner in charge of elections here in Pennsylvania's Montgomery County, he is determined to get as many people out to vote in November as he can. It's a big part of the reason he campaigned for the job.\n'I'm probably one of the first people to run for a county commissioner seat in Pennsylvania because of the role of administering elections,' said Makhija, 37, a Democrat who took office in January and previously taught election law at the University of Pennsylvania.\n'When this seat opened up, I thought this is a real place where we can make a difference, protect voting rights and really set the standard in Pennsylvania and for the country,' he added.\nBut to get more people to vote, Makhija realized he would need to get creative.\nThat's why on a Thursday in April, Makhija had gathered 16 Montgomery County voters at the county commissioner's office to present them with leather-bound certificates honoring a lifetime of civic duty.\nIt was the first Montgomery County Voter Hall of Fame.\nAfter official county business wrapped, Makhija and his two fellow commissioners stood in front of the room's imposing wooden desk to greet the honorees, who were found by combing through the county and state electoral records for voters who had cast ballots in the last 50 consecutive general elections. Makhija polled the room about how long they'd been voting. The oldest honoree had been voting since 1956.\n'Anybody got 1956 beat? This is like an auction,' Makhija joked.\nAs a photographer captured the moments, the honorees posed at the front of the room with the commissioners and their new certificates.\nThe mood was celebratory, but the mission behind the ceremony was serious.\nCentral to Makhija's efforts is understanding what makes people like honorees Alan and Rosemary Hinkle tick. The couple has voted in every election since 1972, when Alan was 21 and Rosemary was 18.\n'I think it's so important that in the midst of everything that's happening in politics, where people are cynical or disillusioned, that we actually recognize the people who are so committed to the system,' Makhija said.\nHe said he hopes that initiatives like the Hall of Fame will not only inspire other voters to turn out, but also inspire him to come up with new ways to make voting more accessible. According to NBC News polling going back to 2008, election enthusiasm is at an all-time low for a presidential contest.\nPennsylvania clinched the White House for Joe Biden in 2020 — thanks in large part to places like Montgomery County, a largely white, highly educated, wealthy suburb of Philadelphia that trends blue. Biden was able to expand his margin of victory in Philadelphia's surrounding counties — Montgomery, Bucks, Chester and Delaware — by more than 100,000 votes over what Democrat Hillary Clinton earned in 2016, offsetting gains former President Donald Trump made in the state's smaller counties.\n'We're the most courted voters in the whole country,' Makhija said. 'I think reminding people in our communities that we set the direction of the country will make a difference.'\nMakhija isn't just battling a lack of enthusiasm for the two candidates; he's also contending with a firehose of disinformation about the entire electoral system, just as so many other election workers are across the country.\nTrump has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that mail-in voting is a vehicle for widespread voter fraud. The former president also continues to push the baseless theory that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n'When you see them cheating, you get out there and start screaming,' Trump said at a rally in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, last weekend. 'The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020, and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election of 2024.'\nMakhija said claims like that cause 'fear and cynicism by design,' and he worries that it will cause voters of both parties to skip the ballot box in November.\n'When you challenge the whole system, people will rethink their participation,' he said.\nStill, Makhija expects the Republican nominee to continue to sow doubt about the validity of mail-in ballots, despite attempts from local GOP officials to embrace mail-in and early voting to match what's been an advantage for Democrats in recent years.\nTo that end, he's trying to build trust in the early voting system that will span across party lines. He's aiming to literally meet voters where they are by expanding election satellite offices for people who need to 'cure' their ballots — the process of allowing voters to fix their mail ballots with technical issues, such as an incorrect date or a missing signature, that otherwise may not be counted on Election Day. Makjiha also hopes to establish a mobile unit that would travel around the county to help people resolve any mistakes they made on their mail-in ballots.\n'Instead of throwing out their votes, we'll be trying to help voters cure ballots with technical errors for about 2,000 people in the last two weeks of the election,' he said.\nIn battleground Pennsylvania, every one of those votes will count — something Montgomery County's Hall of Fame inductees know all too well.\nThe Hinkels aren't sure which way they'll vote yet — but they say they are 'absolutely' decided on one thing: They'll be casting ballots in 2024.\n'If you don't want other people making the decision for you,' Rosemary Hinkle said, 'then you have to participate.'",

Today, the search continues for five more alternate jurors. And then the first week of the former president's criminal trial will come to a close. Looking back, the ways Trump tried to control the narrative are clear. On Monday, Trump stood in front of reporters ready to unleash a grievance-laced tirade that, at times, did not totally reflect reality. He fixated on Judge Juan Merchan's decision to not yet rule on whether Trump can attend his son Barron's high school graduation next month. The key words to keep in mind are 'not yet.'\nBut Trump painted a picture for his supporters of a biased judge blocking a loving father from seeing his son's graduation. The disdain toward Merchan from Trump's supporters was swift.\nThen there were arguments about whether Trump fell asleep at one point and about jury selection rules. Those sorts of distortions and fights about nearly every aspect of the trial dominated the first week — and earned him $1.6 million in small-dollar donations.

Staff Pick: A regional reproductive care void on both sides of the border A growing number of American women are seeking abortion care in Mexico, and they're navigating a medley of laws that, like the U.S., vary according to Mexico's different states. My colleague Albinson Linares and I dug into some of these laws . What we found is that most Mexican border states ban elective abortions, despite a Supreme Court ruling last year that decriminalized the procedure nationwide. Add Arizona's recent ruling on an 1864 law that will ban most abortions in the state, and women on both sides of the border could soon find themselves in a remote and politicized region with little reproductive care. — Isabela Espadas Barros Leal, associate editor\ndug into some of these laws.

For a half century, the small city of Metropolis, Ill., has marketed itself as the \"Home of Superman.\" Now a fiery clash over its public library is testing its reputation for welcoming outsiders. Bryan Birks for NBC News April 18, 2024, 7:18 PM UTC METROPOLIS, Ill. — The pastor began his sermon with a warning. Satan was winning territory across America, and now he was coming for their small town on the banks of the Ohio River in southern Illinois. 'Evil is moving and motivated,' Brian Anderson told his congregation at Eastland Life Church on the evening of Jan. 13. 'And the church is asleep.' But there was still time to fight back, Anderson said. He called on the God-fearing people of Metropolis to meet the enemy where Satan was planning his assault: at their town's library. A public meeting was scheduled there that Tuesday, and Christians needed to make their voices heard. Otherwise, Anderson said, the library would soon resemble a scene 'straight out of Sodom and Gomorrah.' Warning that evil was coming for Metropolis, Brian Anderson, a pastor, told his congregation on Jan. 13 that \"the church needs to wake up.\" Eastland Life Church via YouTube The pastor's call to action three months ago helped ignite a bitter fight that some locals have described as 'a battle for the soul' of Metropolis. The dispute has pitted the city's mayor, a member of Eastland Life Church, against his own library board of trustees. It led to the abrupt dismissal of the library director, who accused the board of punishing her for her faith. And last month, it drew scrutiny from the state's Democratic secretary of state, who said the events in Metropolis 'should frighten and insult all Americans who believe in the freedom of speech and in our democracy.' Similar conflicts have rocked towns and suburbs across the country, as some conservatives — convinced that Democrats want to sexualize and indoctrinate children — have sought to purge libraries of books featuring LGBTQ characters and storylines. Republican state legislatures have taken up a wave of bills making it easier to remove books and threatening librarians with criminal charges if they allow minors to access titles that include depictions of sex. To counter this movement, Illinois Democrats last year adopted the first state law in the nation aimed at preventing book bans— which ended up feeding the unrest in Metropolis. Under the law, public libraries can receive state grant funding only if they adhere to the Library Bill of Rights, a set of policies long promoted by the American Library Association to prevent censorship. Constructed of bronze rather than steel, a 15-foot Superman statue draws thousands of tourists to Metropolis every year. Bryan Birks for NBC News Many longtime residents were stunned when these national fissures erupted in Metropolis, a quirky, conservative city of about 6,000 people that has a reputation for welcoming outsiders. Because of its shared name with the fictional city from DC Comics, Metropolis has for the past half century marketed itself as 'Superman's hometown.' Tens of thousands of tourists stop off Interstate 24 each year to pose beneath a 15-foot Superman statue at the center of town, to attend the summertime Superman Celebration, or to browse one of the world's largest collections of Superman paraphernalia at the Super Museum. 'Where heroes and history meet on the shores of the majestic Ohio River,' the visitor's bureau beckons, 'Metropolis offers the best small-town America has to offer.' But lately, the pages of the Metropolis Planet — yes, even the masthead of the local newspaper pays homage to Clark Kent — have been filled with strife. Unlike in comic books and the Bible, the fight in Metropolis doesn't break along simple ideological lines. Virtually everyone on either side of the conflict identifies as a Christian, and most folks here vote Republican. The real divide is between residents who believe the public library should adhere to their personal religious convictions, and those who argue that it should instead reflect a wide range of ideas and identities. Meetings of the Metropolis library board used to draw a resident or two, tops. In the months since Anderson's call to action, the board's meetings have been standing room only. Bryan Birks for NBC News During his sermon in January and in the months since, Anderson has cast his congregation and their God as righteous defenders of Metropolis — and the Library Bill of Rights and its supporters as forces of evil. If Christians didn't take a stand, Anderson warned, there would soon be an entire children's section at the library 'dedicated to sexual immorality and perversion.' And before long, he said, the town would be hosting 'story hour with some guy that thinks he's a girl.' Anderson, who is also a member of the Metropolis City Council, then asked his followers to confirm that they were ready to join him in the fight for decency. 'Amen?' the pastor said. The congregation called back in unison: 'Amen.' Three days later , Rhonda James pulled up to the Metropolis Public Library and was surprised to find nearly every parking spot filled. In her 12 years volunteering on the library's board of trustees — including seven years as its president — James couldn't recall more than a few residents attending one of the monthly meetings. But when she walked inside on the evening of Jan. 16, about 50 people were waiting in the basement meeting room. 'Oh, hi,' James said nervously as she made her way to the front. 'I wasn't expecting you all.' Rhonda James, Metropolis library board president, said she and her fellow members tried to address community concerns about the library's director without stirring controversy. Bryan Birks for NBC News James, who'd grown up attending a Baptist church and has hosted a Bible study at her home the past 20 years, didn't know why the crowd had gathered. She suspected it had something to do with the tension that had been quietly building between the nine-member board of trustees — which is appointed by the mayor and charged with overseeing the library's operations — and the library's director, Rosemary Baxter. Baxter, who did not respond to interview requests, had taken the job in 2021 and quickly earned praise in the community for developing fun and engaging children's programs. But in recent months, the board had been fielding complaints from residents who said Baxter, a devout Christian, was injecting her religious beliefs into the library's operations. Baxter had acknowledged praying aloud with children at the library's after-school program, which she told the board she did with the permission of parents. She'd put up a nativity display on the library lawn for Christmas and invited a man dressed as Santa to read the Bible to children. Board members had been pressing Baxter for months to produce a list of book removals and purchases after learning that the library had sold or donated about 15,000 books in recent years, shrinking the overall collection by about a third. The children's section of the library now had eight versions of the Bible, but only a single picture book about Halloween. Explaining the discrepancy at a public meeting, Baxter said she only removed titles that hadn't been checked out in several years, then cited her belief in Scripture. 'God said he did not give us a spirit of fear,' Baxter said, alluding to the scary themes sometimes found in Halloween books. 'Why would I want to instill that on anyone?' 'We are here to serve and to honor God,' Rosemary Baxter said of her work for the Metropolis Public Library. WPSD But the people now crammed inside the library weren't there to talk about Baxter or her book selections. Instead, they said they'd come to oppose the board's plan to adopt the Library Bill of Rights, which they believed would bring drag queen story hour to Metropolis, as Anderson had warned. 'We are concerned our values may be undermined,' said Jim Duncan, a pastor speaking on behalf of an alliance of local faith leaders. James glanced around at her fellow trustees, most of whom, she said, looked as confused as she was. 'Drag queens in libraries,' James told the crowd, 'has never come before this board.' The Library Bill of Rights, which includes a pledge to provide reading materials representing 'all points of view,' does not deal with library programming. Plus, James explained, the board had already adopted the Library Bill of Rights more than a decade ago, long before the new law that made it a requirement for state grant funding. The vote that night was merely to adopt an updated version of the policy that included an additional clause about protecting patrons' privacy. The explanation seemed to appease at least a few residents — but not everyone. Seated alongside the board, Baxter, the library director, argued against the Library Bill of Rights. The Metropolis Public Library didn't need state funding, she said. In fact, she'd never applied for any state grants during her tenure. 'There are grants we can get,' Baxter said, 'where we don't have to barter with Satan in order to get the funding.' On the shore of the Ohio river in southern Illinois, Metropolis is far closer — both geographically and culturally — to the cities of Nashville, Tenn., and St. Louis., Mo., than it is to Chicago. Bryan Birks for NBC News Ford Loverin, one of the trustees who'd clashed with Baxter in recent months — and the only openly gay library board member — was stunned. The library, he responded, should be 'accepting and tolerant' of everyone's views. Loverin, a practicing Lutheran and retired child therapist, had moved from California to Metropolis with his husband five years earlier after falling in love with the town's eccentric charm. He especially enjoyed spending time at the small library, housed in a red-brick building constructed in 1915 with seed money from the steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie. These days, the library's budget runs around $350,000, funded by city taxes and revenue from a local riverfront casino. In past years, Loverin said, the Metropolis library has relied on state grants to close shortfalls or fund capital improvements. 'I don't think,' he said, 'we need to be in a position where we throw public funds away.' \"I almost laughed,\" Ford Loverin said of the claim that the library board wanted to host a drag queen story hour. \"I thought, 'Oh, my God, in Metropolis? Really? Are you kidding me?'\" Bryan Birks for NBC News In the end, James and Loverin joined four other members in voting 6-2 to adopt the updated Library Bill of Rights. As she headed to her car afterward, James held tight to her library binder. Inside, she carried a resignation letter that she'd planned to present to the board that night. The owner of a local day spa, James had been feeling run down after spending much of her free time that year caring for her elderly mother, who'd entered the final stages of multiple sclerosis. She had decided she no longer had the time or energy to continue serving on the board. But after seeing the backlash brewing, James decided to keep the resignation letter tucked away. Later, when she told her father about her decision to stay and fight, James said he laughed. 'You're like Jonah,' he said, referring to the Old Testament Bible story. 'You tried to jump ship, and you got swallowed by a whale.' Anderson, the Eastland pastor and Metropolis city councilman, wasn't appeased by the board's assurances on drag performances. He wrote a scathing op-ed in the Metropolis Planet and preached about the library controversy nearly every weekend, warning that 'Satan has made a move in our community' and that 'darkness is coming after us.' The Metropolis Planet has covered every twist and turn of the fight over the town's library. Bryan Birks for NBC News On Feb. 18, Anderson taught from the Book of Nehemiah, telling the story of the Jewish prophet who worked to rebuild the walls around Jerusalem in the 5th Century B.C. Metropolis, Anderson said, was also in need of protection. Not physical barriers, he said, but spiritual. 'Do you think we need safety from the powers of darkness?' Anderson asked his congregation. 'I don't know if you realize it, but our enemy hates us.' Anderson then motioned to some children sitting in the front row. 'These children that you see here,' Anderson said, 'the enemy hates them. And the enemy wants to kill them.' Anderson's apocalyptic warnings were motivating more than just his followers. The county Democrats, a small but vocal group in Metropolis, joined with some moderate conservatives and began staging protests, voicing support for the library board and demanding that it diversify the library's collection. Responding to a call from county Democrats, residents show their support for the library board and the Library Bill of Rights. Charity Blanton / WPSD As clips of Anderson's sermons spread, some conservative Christian leaders distanced themselves. Duncan, the Baptist minister who'd come to the board in January to voice concerns about drag queen story hour, said he'd changed his position after learning more. 'I wanted nothing more to do with this situation,' Duncan wrote in an email to NBC News. 'I believe the church has no place attempting to privatize a public library. We should not push our own convictions on others.' Anderson declined to be interviewed. Glenn Coram, pastor of Immanuel Baptist Church in Metropolis, said he also opposed efforts to portray the library as a site of spiritual warfare. \"All they're doing is saying, 'If somebody wants a book in the library, we'll give it to him,'\" Glenn Coram, a pastor, said of the Metropolis library board. \"How hard is that?\" Bryan Birks for NBC News Coram, like most Baptist ministers, believes that homosexuality is a sin. But he doesn't think a public library should refuse to carry children's picture books depicting same-sex couples. 'I'm not one of these people who looks at Harry Potter and thinks that it's going to make your kids into witches,' Coram said. And he doesn't believe Christians should try to impose their views on others, which he called a violation of church-state separation. 'They're seeing their mission,' Coram said, 'as establishing the kingdom of God in Metropolis through the government.' Glenn Coram said that he preaches the gospel of Jesus Christ at Immanuel Baptist, but that he does not believe his personal convictions should determine what other people can read at the library. Bryan Birks for NBC News On Feb. 21 , Baxter, the embattled library director, appeared alongside Anderson and another local pastor on the 'Greg Dunker Show,' a local conservative talk radio program. Baxter defended her decision to donate or sell thousands of books, which she said she did to make room for additional children's programming. Those removals, she said, were not 'an attempt to pull any specific thing.' She acknowledged, however, that some parents had complained about children's picture books with depictions of LGBTQ characters and that she shared their concerns. 'They get to the end, and there's a surprise ending with same-sex marriages, same-sex parenting,' Baxter said. 'And they're like, ‘I don't want this.'' Baxter also elaborated on her refusal to apply for state grants. She had chosen instead, she said, to rely on God to provide. 'We don't need to live by the regulations and the rules of this state,' Baxter said. 'We are here to serve and to honor God.' By then, some members of the library board had had enough. Richard Kruger, a longtime lawyer and concerned citizen, had advised them that Baxter's blending of religion and government service was inviting a civil rights lawsuit. In 52 years practicing law in Metropolis, Richard Kruger said he's never seen the community more divided. Bryan Birks for NBC News A week later, the board went into a closed session and presented Baxter with an ultimatum: If she wanted to keep her job, she needed to sign a performance improvement plan. It stipulated that she would abide by the Library Bill of Rights, seek state grant funding and discontinue praying aloud with children and other religious activities at the library. Baxter refused to sign and began to criticize the board. Voices were raised, according to three members. After a few minutes, James, the board president, slammed her fist on the table. 'This is not up for debate, Rosemary,' she said. 'Either sign it, or don't.' Baxter stood up and left. Minutes later, the board came out of closed session. By a vote of 5-3, they terminated Baxter's employment. Baxter's departure left the library in turmoil. Four employees resigned soon after, and the board got to work picking up the pieces. They brought on a former library employee to serve as interim director and embarked on top-to-bottom reviews of the library's catalog and finances. 'Our focus,' James said, 'is making sure our library is strong and healthy and there to serve everyone.' Then, on March 19, the story of Baxter's firing was picked up by Blaze Media, a national conservative outlet. In a column titled, 'A librarian's faithful service is silenced by a secularist takeover,' conservative talk radio host Steve Deace interviewed Baxter and Anderson and reported that both had come under fire for their Christian beliefs. Deace presented the local saga as a warning that evil forces were now coming for small-town America and blamed the problems in Metropolis, in part, on 'a California transplant who is living with another man,' referring to Loverin, the library board member. Three days later, Metropolis Mayor Don Canada — who in 2021 had appointed Anderson, his pastor, to an open seat on the City Council — took a stand of his own. In letters addressed to James and two other board members, Canada announced that he'd 'lost faith in the Board in its current state.' As a result, he was removing James and two others who'd voted to terminate Baxter. Metropolis Mayor Don Canada said the library board is in need of a \"fresh start.\" City of Metropolis Canada declined to be interviewed, writing in an email, 'I have no comment on the Library or the Library board.' In an interview with Deace, Canada said he removed the members because 'we need a fresh start.' The mayor's decision shocked some residents and drew a rebuke from Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias, a Democrat who also serves as the state librarian. 'Retaliating against local library trustees, who are dedicated to serving their community and assisting children in learning, is unacceptable,' Giannoulias wrote. The mayor's action was not only controversial; it also appeared to be improper. At a City Council meeting three days later, a local lawyer who previously served as a Metropolis city attorney explained that, under Illinois law, the mayor cannot unilaterally remove political appointees. He is required to level charges against board members he wants removed and seek approval from the City Council. Heeding that advice, the council voted to table the dismissals. Later, one of the board members targeted for removal resigned, creating a vacancy for the mayor to fill. In an email this week to NBC News, Canada said he planned to put off a decision on whether to replace the other two board members until this summer. While the members wait to learn their fate, the fighting has some questioning their future in Metropolis. Loverin said he feels tense when strangers approach him in public, afraid that one of the people who has accused him of pushing an anti-Christian agenda might confront him. 'I love the people here, but I don't want to be in a place where I feel intimidated,' he said. 'But then it's like, ‘Well, I'm kind of letting them win.' And I don't want to do that.' Some residents see the library fight as a test of what type city Metropolis is going to be moving forward — and who's welcome. Bryan Birks for NBC News Leaving has also crossed James' mind. She lies awake some nights, worried about what her critics might do to harm her or her family if they truly came to view her as a tool of Satan out to 'kill' children. She thinks about the phrase etched in stone at the foot of the Superman statue in the center of town — Truth, Justice, The American Way — and wonders if some of her neighbors have lost sight of what those words really mean. But through the darkness, she's also seen good from the people of Metropolis. She's watched Democrats and Republicans, Christians and nonbelievers, march together in defense of what they describe as free speech and democracy. Those moments have helped restore her faith, James said. 'There's hope for this little town.'

Bryan Birks for NBC News On Feb. 21 , Baxter, the embattled library director, appeared alongside Anderson and another local pastor on the 'Greg Dunker Show,' a local conservative talk radio program.\nOn Feb. 21, Baxter, the embattled library director, appeared alongside Anderson and another local pastor on the 'Greg Dunker Show,' a local conservative talk radio program. Baxter defended her decision to donate or sell thousands of books, which she said she did to make room for additional children's programming. Those removals, she said, were not 'an attempt to pull any specific thing.' She acknowledged, however, that some parents had complained about children's picture books with depictions of LGBTQ characters and that she shared their concerns.\n'They get to the end, and there's a surprise ending with same-sex marriages, same-sex parenting,' Baxter said. 'And they're like, ‘I don't want this.''\nBaxter also elaborated on her refusal to apply for state grants. She had chosen instead, she said, to rely on God to provide.\n'We don't need to live by the regulations and the rules of this state,' Baxter said. 'We are here to serve and to honor God.'\nBy then, some members of the library board had had enough. Richard Kruger, a longtime lawyer and concerned citizen, had advised them that Baxter's blending of religion and government service was inviting a civil rights lawsuit.\nIn 52 years practicing law in Metropolis, Richard Kruger said he's never seen the community more divided. Bryan Birks for NBC News A week later, the board went into a closed session and presented Baxter with an ultimatum: If she wanted to keep her job, she needed to sign a performance improvement plan. It stipulated that she would abide by the Library Bill of Rights, seek state grant funding and discontinue praying aloud with children and other religious activities at the library.\nBaxter refused to sign and began to criticize the board. Voices were raised, according to three members.\nAfter a few minutes, James, the board president, slammed her fist on the table.\n'This is not up for debate, Rosemary,' she said. 'Either sign it, or don't.'\nBaxter stood up and left.\nMinutes later, the board came out of closed session.\nBy a vote of 5-3, they terminated Baxter's employment.\nBaxter's departure left the library in turmoil. Four employees resigned soon after, and the board got to work picking up the pieces.\nBaxter's departure left the library in turmoil. Four employees resigned soon after, and the board got to work picking up the pieces. They brought on a former library employee to serve as interim director and embarked on top-to-bottom reviews of the library's catalog and finances.\n'Our focus,' James said, 'is making sure our library is strong and healthy and there to serve everyone.'\nThen, on March 19, the story of Baxter's firing was picked up by Blaze Media, a national conservative outlet. In a column titled, 'A librarian's faithful service is silenced by a secularist takeover,' conservative talk radio host Steve Deace interviewed Baxter and Anderson and reported that both had come under fire for their Christian beliefs.\nDeace presented the local saga as a warning that evil forces were now coming for small-town America and blamed the problems in Metropolis, in part, on 'a California transplant who is living with another man,' referring to Loverin, the library board member.\nThree days later, Metropolis Mayor Don Canada — who in 2021 had appointed Anderson, his pastor, to an open seat on the City Council — took a stand of his own.\nIn letters addressed to James and two other board members, Canada announced that he'd 'lost faith in the Board in its current state.' As a result, he was removing James and two others who'd voted to terminate Baxter.\nMetropolis Mayor Don Canada said the library board is in need of a \"fresh start.\" City of Metropolis Canada declined to be interviewed, writing in an email, 'I have no comment on the Library or the Library board.' In an interview with Deace, Canada said he removed the members because 'we need a fresh start.'\nThe mayor's decision shocked some residents and drew a rebuke from Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias, a Democrat who also serves as the state librarian.\n'Retaliating against local library trustees, who are dedicated to serving their community and assisting children in learning, is unacceptable,' Giannoulias wrote.\nThe mayor's action was not only controversial; it also appeared to be improper.\nAt a City Council meeting three days later, a local lawyer who previously served as a Metropolis city attorney explained that, under Illinois law, the mayor cannot unilaterally remove political appointees. He is required to level charges against board members he wants removed and seek approval from the City Council.\nHeeding that advice, the council voted to table the dismissals. Later, one of the board members targeted for removal resigned, creating a vacancy for the mayor to fill. In an email this week to NBC News, Canada said he planned to put off a decision on whether to replace the other two board members until this summer.\nWhile the members wait to learn their fate, the fighting has some questioning their future in Metropolis.\nLoverin said he feels tense when strangers approach him in public, afraid that one of the people who has accused him of pushing an anti-Christian agenda might confront him.\n'I love the people here, but I don't want to be in a place where I feel intimidated,' he said. 'But then it's like, ‘Well, I'm kind of letting them win.' And I don't want to do that.'\nSome residents see the library fight as a test of what type city Metropolis is going to be moving forward — and who's welcome. Bryan Birks for NBC News Leaving has also crossed James' mind.\nShe lies awake some nights, worried about what her critics might do to harm her or her family if they truly came to view her as a tool of Satan out to 'kill' children. She thinks about the phrase etched in stone at the foot of the Superman statue in the center of town — Truth, Justice, The American Way — and wonders if some of her neighbors have lost sight of what those words really mean.\nTruth, Justice, The American Way — and wonders if some of her neighbors have lost sight of what those words really mean. But through the darkness, she's also seen good from the people of Metropolis. She's watched Democrats and Republicans, Christians and nonbelievers, march together in defense of what they describe as free speech and democracy.\nThose moments have helped restore her faith, James said.\n'There's hope for this little town.'\nMike Hixenbaugh",

Tammy Baldwin fights to maintain appeal in Wisconsin's Trump country By Sarah Dean REEDSBURG, Wis. — Dairy farmer Randy Roecker is at a breaking point — and he blames it partly on President Joe Biden, so is planning to vote for Donald Trump for a third time this November.\n'Farmers are hurting like you wouldn't believe, and I myself, I am to the point of throwing up my hands and saying I'm done,' said Roecker, who cited inflation as straining his business for the last two years.\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know But while he's planning to vote on booting the Democratic president, Roecker's also planning to vote to keep his Democratic senator, Tammy Baldwin.\n'I support her all the way. I mean, no question,' Roecker said. 'And everybody I know — the farmers — everybody says that she's great for Wisconsin agriculture.'\nBaldwin is bracing for a tough re-election race against likely Republican nominee Eric Hovde, a multimillionaire and bank owner, in the evenly divided Wisconsin, one of a handful of states that will determine which party controls the Senate. But she has the advantage of incumbency, and has often outperformed other statewide Democrats in rural areas, even as the party as a whole has lost significant ground in those regions in recent decades.\nBaldwin is already pouring more effort into rural campaigning this year as she prepares for the challenge of sharing the ballot with one of the forces driving GOP margins in rural areas sky-high. Unlike her first two races for the Senate, in 2012 and 2018, Donald Trump will be running this November, too.\nLate last month, Baldwin sat around a kitchen table with Roecker and others from the Farmer Angel Network for a 90-minute discussion about farmers' mental health. The event was part of the senator's 'Dairyland' tour through 19 counties, none of them among Wisconsin's five most populated counties.\n'I think that there has been a real opportunity for me to be a champion for issues that I might not hear about if I only was going to the population centers of the state,' Baldwin told reporters at a stop at the New Glarus Brewing Co.\nRead more →\nWhy you shouldn't discount voters' interest in RFK Jr. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Mario Tama / Getty Images Analysis by Chuck Todd What happens when an electorate wants change but there's no obvious change candidate on the ballot?\nThis question popped into my head after I watched one of the fascinating monthly focus groups organized by Rich Thau, the president of the research group Engagious, with the latest edition convening Pennsylvania voters who voted once for either Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton and once for Donald Trump.\nThe headline-grabber for this month's check-in was the surprising level of interest in Robert F. Kennedy Jr. among these swing voters. In some ways, this shouldn't be a surprise. These voters are by definition not hard partisans, and they certainly aren't pleased with either major party, as they've been comfortable voting against both of them over the last two elections.\nAs I wrote months ago, there was always going to be a moment in this campaign cycle when both major parties had finished their nominating processes and selected Biden and Trump — and yet the public wasn't satisfied with that outcome. We are at that moment.\nWith no mainstream third-party alternative available for now, that vacuum is being filled by Kennedy. For many voters, one can tell, he's simply a famous name filling a void. You can hear the lack of knowledge many of these Pennsylvania voters had about Kennedy other than his name, and those who knew something about him knew only a few things. Moreover, it was clear that his best asset was the fact that his last name was neither Trump nor Biden.\nWatching the initial interest in Kennedy's candidacy among these voters serves as a reminder that there was a powerful opportunity for a true potential unity ticket — not one that professed 'centrism' per se, but one that promised to take a partisan timeout for four years and attempt to focus on hard choices to solve hard problems, like immigration.\nBut given the stakes of this election, it has also been clear to me that while an opening exists with the true middle-of-the-road or less partisan crowd, the lane is very narrow. And unless partisans from one or both parties also wanted an alternative, there really wasn't a path to victory.\nBut there is a path to relevancy.\nRead more from Chuck here →\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

One prospective juror professed Trump 'totally guilty' in an interview outside the courthouse on Monday. A day later, that person, an American history teacher, was struck from a rapidly winnowing pool of more than 500 New Yorkers.\nLawyers excavated ancient social media posts; asked jurors to explain inconsistent answers; and tried to strike from the pool candidates they feared could spell danger for their case.\nAt one point, the judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan, warned Trump that he should not try to intimidate potential jurors.\nTrump is defending himself against 34 felony counts of falsifying business records for his alleged role in arranging a hush-money payment to a porn star during the 2016 presidential election. The former president has denied all charges.\nAs Trump's attorneys closely watched each juror, Todd Blanche, his lead attorney, took handwritten notes. Some of the answers prompted a smile. Trump, for his part, mostly looked straight ahead.\nBy the numbers The selection process started with 96 jurors in the first batch. By Tuesday, more than half were excused after saying they could not be fair or impartial. That left 34. From there, 18 were sat in the jury box and winnowed down to six. And then another six brought in, who were reduced to one.\nSeven jurors, including a former waiter, an oncology nurse, an attorney, an IT consultant, a teacher, and a software engineer, were seated by the late afternoon in a process that took two days. Merchan appeared optimistic a jury of 12 New Yorkers and likely six alternates could be sat by the end of the week. The trial resumes on Thursday and Friday.\nHe told the selected jurors to plan to return Monday at 9:30 a.m., signaling the likelihood that the selection process will be over by then.\nWhere jurors get their news TikTok.

'I don't generally read the emails,' she said before she was stuck.\nAnother juror said he reads the New York Times and New York Daily News and used social media. 'I do Google. I do X,' he said.\nJurors were asked if they read the New York Times, or watched CNN as the lawyers queried the pool to get a better sense of their knowledge of the charges against Trump in New York and his other legal cases, and what they think of them.\nSeveral jurors professed not to consume much news at all, including one lawyer who explained that his wife is not a fan.\nwife is not a fan. Another, a teacher and Harlem native said she does not pay attention to politics or the media. She said she does not have strong opinions but that, as a person of color, she has friends with strong opinions on Trump. But she did share one, praising the former president as a person 'who speaks his mind.'\n'I'd rather that than someone who's in office who you don't know what they're thinking,' she said.\nWhen Blanche asked the group if they were familiar with the other charges facing Trump, she appeared to be the sole juror not to raise her hand. She was seated on the jury.\nAnother juror professed to have been away through February and March, living on a lake without wifi. 'Knowing this was going to happen, I really tried not to hear about this case and I blocked the news,' this person said. She was struck by Trump's lawyers.\nSocial media One juror said she doesn't tweet and quit Twitter after two days. Another said her Facebook page and the political materials posted to it weren't representative of her views and that she had sought to remove it. One man, a resident of Hells Kitchen but originally from Mexico, said he could not be held responsible for the views of his Facebook friends. 'Feelings are not facts,' he insisted.\n'Feelings are not facts,' he insisted. At one point, Merchan apologized for causing potential offense as he read political memes about Trump, including one about a group of Thai boys who were trapped in a cave in 2018. Another meme shared by one juror included side-by-side photos of Trump and former President Barack Obama with a caption reading, 'I don't think this is what they meant when they said orange is the new black.'\nIt wasn't clear whether jurors had written every post themselves or reposted others. But the materials were cause for Trump's lawyer to press the jurors repeatedly—including over Facebook posts from Occupy Democrats that one woman claimed not to be responsible for and said she did not know how to remove.\nImpartiality tests The defense scoured the internet, unearthing comments from prospective jurors that showed hostility to Trump or ran contrary to what they told the court in questionnaires.\nSpeculation over seemingly non-partisan events — such as a post about an Election Day celebration in the city in 2020, a Democratic stronghold — became the basis for queries that sought to probe any stronger biases that could sway a juror one way or another.\nOther commentary was more overt. 'Republicans projected to pick up 70 seats in prison,' one potential juror had posted.\nThat person said she lost sleep last night over whether she could judge the case fairly, Blanche said, explaining how the prosecution and defense had 'a fair bit of colloquy' with her.\nBut he argued that while the post may be dated, it still mattered. 'The evidence at trial is going to be six years old,' he said.\n'The evidence at trial is going to be six years old,' he said.

            "summary": "More than a dozen members of the Kennedy family will endorse President Joe Biden for a second term Thursday, passing over family member Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Biden campaign announced.\nThe Kennedy family has stepped up its involvement in the Biden campaign, working to lift Biden's odds as Democrats worry that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s bid could pose a spoiler risk that could hand the election to former President Donald Trump.\nFormer Rep. Joseph Kennedy III, the independent candidate's nephew, said in an interview that he believes his uncle's 'candidacy poses a threat to the country that I love and the values that I hold.'\n'I believe that his candidacy is likely to divert support away from President Biden and end up increasing support for Donald Trump,' he said.\nThe 15 Kennedy family members making the endorsement include the candidate's siblings Rory Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, Joseph Kennedy II, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Christopher Kennedy and Maxwell Kennedy Sr.\nThis endorsement has been 'months in the making,' according to a source familiar with the Biden campaign's planning, who added that family members came forward to 'do something to show they're united by the president.\"\nJoseph Kennedy III, who serves in the Biden administration as special envoy to Northern Ireland, said the family endorsement is intended to blunt third-party support that could 'siphon votes' from the president.\n'We want to be able to make that case not just for the risk that Bobby's candidacy shows, but because of who Joe Biden is, what Joe Biden has done and what Joe Biden will do with four more years in office,\" he said.\nJoseph Kennedy III acknowledged 'challenging' feelings involved in the endorsement, while noting that 'it's something we believe has to be done.'\n'Bobby knows that we stand by him as a family member, while also being able to clearly communicate that his candidacy poses a risk to the country that we love,' the younger Kennedy said.\nThe family members will formally make their endorsement at an event in Philadelphia with a speech by the candidate's sister Kerry.\n\"We can say today, with no less urgency, that our rights and freedoms are once again in peril,\" she will say, according to prepared remarks sent by the Biden campaign. \"That is why we all need to come together in a campaign that should unite not only Democrats, but all Americans, including Republicans, and independents, who believe in what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.\"\nAccording to excerpts of prepared remarks, Kerry Kennedy will directly attack Trump and invoke her father, Robert F. Kennedy. The prepared remarks do not appear to mention her brother, though only an excerpt of the prepared speech was shared with news outlets.\n\"I can only imagine how Donald Trump's outrageous lies and behavior would have horrified my father, Robert F. Kennedy, who proudly served as Attorney General of the United States, and honored his pledge to uphold the law and protect the country,\" she will say before going on to compare Biden to her father.\nAfter the speech, Biden and members of the Kennedy family will hold a campaign event, where Biden will be introduced by Joseph Kennedy III.\nFamily members will also make calls to voters and knock on doors, according to the campaign.\nMembers of the Kennedy family have praised Biden and boosted images of family members posing with him, such as a St. Patrick's Day photo depicting three generations of the Kennedy family with him.\nLikewise, Biden describes Robert F. Kennedy as a political hero \"who inspired him early in his career to leave corporate law to become a public defender, and then go on to run for public office,\" the Biden campaign said. Biden also has a bust of the elder Kennedy, who was attorney general in his brother John's administration, in the Oval Office.\nSome members of the family have been more direct in their criticism of Robert Kennedy Jr., such as when Stephen Kennedy Smith referred on social media to what he called his cousin's \"misguided stands on issues, his poor judgement, and tenuous relationship with the truth.'\nRory Kennedy said in an MSNBC interview this month: \"I love my brother, and it pains me to come out against him. But I am very concerned with the stakes in this election.\"\n\"I'm concerned that his campaign and running for office as an independent is going to lead to Trump's election,\" she added.\nRobert Kennedy Jr. responded to family members' criticism of his campaign this month, telling CNN's Erin Burnett, \"I don't know anybody in America who's got a family who agrees with them on everything.\" He has reiterated that he loves his family and that he understands \"why they don't like me running.\"\nThe campaign is intentionally keeping the event to immediate family members, such as several of the candidate's siblings, a member of the large political family said.\n'This event is only going to involve the immediate RFK family so that Bobby can't fall back on his claim that he ‘has big family ... and we aren't all going to agree,'' the family member said, referring to how RFK Jr. has previously deflected questions about his family's criticisms of his campaign.\n'The message is crystal clear that Bobby's own brothers and sisters are endorsing the president,' the person added.\nJoseph Kennedy III was sympathetic to the security concerns that his uncle has raised regarding his denied request for Secret Service protection. The younger Kennedy said he was not aware of the specific threat assessments, but 'I would want my uncle, just like anybody else that's running for office, to make sure that they have the safety and security that they need to be able to run a campaign.'\nPolling indicates that Biden and Trump are headed for a neck-and-neck race — and a high-profile third-party candidate, such as Kennedy, could further shake up both candidates' prospects. If the presidential election were held in March and the candidates were Biden, Trump and Kennedy, Kennedy would get about 16% of the vote, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.\nKelly O'Donnell Megan Lebowitz Nnamdi Egwuonwu contributed.",

            "excerpt": "The agenda is heavy on economics and lighter on cultural issues, carrying echoes of FDR's New Deal. It omits some issues that lack Democratic consensus, like \"Medicare for All.\"",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Top House progressives will unveil a sweeping agenda Thursday to lay down a marker for the policies they'll push next year if Democrats win the 2024 election, from a higher minimum wage and strengthening antitrust laws to new federal benefits for seniors on Social Security and parents raising kids.\nThe Congressional Progressive Caucus agenda, first shared with NBC News, doubles as a blueprint of political advice for how it believes President Joe Biden can win over progressives and young voters who are uninspired by his re-election bid ahead of a rematch with former President Donald Trump.\n'If the progressive base is not excited and enthusiastic — and if they don't feel like we are trying to earn their votes and that they are important — then I think the horrific idea of a second Donald Trump presidency could become reality,' Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the progressive caucus chair, said in an interview. 'We cannot afford to let that happen. And we won't.'\nThe seven-point agenda is heavily focused on economics and lighter on cultural issues, carrying echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. It begins with provisions to boost the federal minimum wage to $17 per hour by 2028 and pass the PRO Act to strengthen unions, as well as other provisions, such as guaranteeing overtime pay. It includes policies to reduce the cost of living — by capping child care costs at 7% of income for all families; expanding Social Security benefits by closing tax loopholes; adding dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare; and enacting a series of policies to protect renters and make housing more affordable.\n2028 and pass the PRO Act to strengthen unions, as well as other provisions, such as guaranteeing overtime pay. It includes policies to reduce the cost of living — by capping child care costs at 7% of income for all families; expanding Social Security benefits by closing tax loopholes; adding dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare; and enacting a series of policies to protect renters and make housing more affordable. 'It's really about worker power and raising wages and lowering costs for poor people, middle-class Americans and the working people across this country,' Jayapal said.\nThe five other planks are investments in education, including universal pre-K and kindergarten; aggressive clean energy standards to tackle climate change; 'making our democracy work' with federal voting rights mandates, Washington, D.C., statehood and elimination of the Senate filibuster; taking on corporations and monopolies; and 'advancing justice' though abortion rights, pro-LGBTQ measures, pro-immigrant policies and setting national policing standards.\nThe agenda is also notable for what's not included. 'Medicare for All,' a rallying cry of the left for years, is excluded. Foreign policy issues like Israel and Gaza, which have sparked fiery pro-Palestinian protests across the country, are also kept out. Jayapal said that's partly because the caucus decided to make it a domestic-issue-only blueprint and partly out of pragmatism — to focus more on unifying issues for Democrats and steer clear of the ones that divide them.\n'The way we came to this agenda is to say that we were going to put into this agenda things that were populist and possible ... and affected a huge number of people,' she said. 'We haven't taken a position on particularly Israel and Gaza in the progressive caucus, and so that's not on here.'\nA supermajority of the 103 lawmakers in the caucus weighed in on the agenda, and 98% supported it, a spokesperson said.\nMuch of the agenda will have no realistic chance of passage unless Democrats sweep control of the White House, the House and the Senate this fall. And Jayapal emphasized that, in addition, Democrats would need 50 senators ready to pierce the 60-vote filibuster rule to get around likely GOP opposition. That would be a herculean task, as Democrats face a daunting map in 2024 Senate races, defending a slew of seats in purple and red states.\n'We are assuming that this is an agenda for a Democratic president with a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House,' Jayapal said.\nProgressives have had a rough two years, having been marginalized after Republicans took control of the House and steered the agenda rightward. Biden has broken with the left on issues like tougher asylum laws and crime. Some prominent Democrats, like Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, have eschewed the 'progressive' label as conservatives have found success in associating it with the left's most divisive ideas. Gallego, who is running for the Senate in his purple state, quietly left the progressive caucus. The caucus recently missed an opportunity to elect one of its members to a rare open Senate seat in deep-blue California, with two of them running and losing.\nStill, Jayapal said she believes that if Democrats win the 2024 elections, the progressive caucus will be well-positioned to advance the ideas in its new agenda, as it did with it opening bid that shaped two of Biden's signature laws, the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act. She has sought to institute changes to make the caucus more cohesive. It recently raised its dues for members.\nSome of the provisions in the new agenda represent items in Biden's 'Build Back Better' agenda that were left on the cutting room floor because of the thin majorities. Others could spark intraparty disagreements, including a far-reaching liberalization of the immigration system with a path to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally. Yet other pieces resemble popular causes that progressives want Biden to get behind, like expanding Social Security and legalizing marijuana.\n'We have to excite our base. We have to show them what the path forward is — not just say, ‘This is the most important election of your life, and we expect you to vote.' I don't think that's going to turn people out. And so I think this agenda, really, speaks to the needs of poor people, working people, progressives across the country who want us to make that case to them,' Jayapal said. 'We are not seeing the momentum that we would like to see. We're going to have a tough election. ... We know we're going to have to put together that progressive coalition. And I think this is the thing that allows us to say, ‘Look, here's what we're fighting for.''\nSahil Kapur",

After the first 96 prospective jurors were brought into a New York courtroom, Judge Juan Merchan asked if any of those assembled could not be 'fair and impartial.' More than half raised their hands and were excused from serving on the jury.\nThe jury selection process got off to a slow start because lawyers from both sides spent much of the day arguing over some of the more sensational evidence in the case. Prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office want to use material — including the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, headlines from the National Enquirer from the 2016 GOP presidential primary and the timing of Trump's alleged affair with another woman — to show why Trump was eager to bury negative stories about him during the 2016 presidential election.\nMerchan said prosecutors could use a transcript of the 'Access Hollywood' tape but not the tape itself. He also greenlit the request to show jurors Enquirer headlines and said he would allow testimony about the alleged affair.\nTrump, who spent much of the day seated at the defense table flanked by his attorneys, called the case 'an assault' on the nation and repeatedly attacked the prosecution for waging 'election interference.' Merchan said Trump must be in the courtroom for every day of the trial and warned that the former president risks jail time if he disrupts the proceedings.

Israel and Iran's longstanding conflict comes into full view Israel's war Cabinet convened yesterday to weigh its options for responding to Iran's unprecedented drone and missile attack.

However, the U.S. assessment is based on conversations between American and Israeli officials that happened before Iran fired more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel on Saturday night, and the U.S. officials stressed that they have not been briefed on Israel's final decision .

In the eyes of some foreign policy hawks, the attacks could be perceived as a grave provocation that demands a furious rejoinder. Other analysts have warned that if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decides to hit back hard, it could plunge the wider Middle East into war.\nWhile Israel and Iran have been enemies since the late 1970s, the bitter conflict has long been confined to secret assassinations, audacious cyberattacks, nuclear sabotage and war-by-proxy.

NBC News found that at least 150 paid 'Premium' subscriber X accounts and thousands of unpaid accounts have posted or amplified pro-Nazi content on X in recent months, often in apparent violation of X's rules. The paid accounts posting the content all consistently posted antisemitic or pro-Nazi material. Examples included praise of Nazi soldiers, sharing of Nazi symbols and denials of the Holocaust.\nThe findings are the latest evidence of a flourishing Nazi network on X under Musk's ownership, where Nazi sympathizers are brought in from dark corners of the internet to a massive platform where they can pay to amplify their content.

How Trump has hobbled his legal team before the first witness is even called at his historic trial By Laura Jarrett For the better part of the last year, former President Donald Trump has sought to turn what would ordinarily amount to significant legal trouble into a political asset.\nFour indictments and one mugshot later, he's successfully managed to dodge any dip among his supporters. Yet now that he stepped into a no-frills Manhattan courtroom this week for the start of his first criminal trial, the legal downside of his political strategy has come into sharp view.\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know The rules of criminal procedure don't change, no matter the defendant, even for a former president. And the courtesies and customs recognized between seasoned prosecutors and defense lawyers begin to break down, if not completely collapse.\nIn a telling moment near the end of a long day in court Thursday, Trump's lead attorney, Todd Blanche, asked if he could get the names of the first three witnesses the prosecution intends to call. That's a routine and reasonable request. But the prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, rebuffed him.\nWhy? Because 'Mr. Trump has been tweeting about the witnesses,' Steinglass said. 'We're not telling them who the witnesses are. I'm sorry.'\nJudge Juan Merchan, who has been the subject of his own wave of attacks from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, then said: 'I can't fault the People for that.'\nThe issue came up again late Friday afternoon, and the prosecution agreed to turn over the name of the first witness to the defense on Sunday. But the implication remains: Trump's legal team is facing a distinct strategic disadvantage with less time to plan cross-examinations of the state's witnesses. In other words, instead of being able to focus all weekend on prioritizing the expected testimony of just a few witnesses, all are up for grabs.\nAnd it's all because Trump has been railing against multiple witnesses online, and has only ramped up his vitriol in recent days, notwithstanding a court order directing him not to do so.\nThis is the year the legal and political lives of Trump have been on a collision course. The only difference is, now the side that's feeling the burn is his own team.\nTrump trial latest: Jury selection completed during a tense day inside and outside the courtroom By Adam Reiss, Lisa Rubin and Dareh Gregorian Opening statements are set to begin next week in Trump's criminal trial after the final members of the jury were seated Friday, following a dramatic day in which two prospective jurors broke down in tears, an appeals court judge rejected the former president's request for a stay, and a man set himself on fire in front of the New York City courthouse.\n'We're going to have opening statements on Monday morning. This trial is starting,' Merchan said towards the end of the day, after successfully seating the remaining five alternate jurors that were needed.\nThe case — the first-ever criminal trial of a former president — will be heard by a panel of 12 jurors and a total of six alternates. It's expected to last roughly six weeks.\nThe five alternates ultimately selected Friday include an unemployed married woman who's into art and described herself as not political, an audio professional, a contract specialist, a clothing company executive and a construction company project manager. It took four days of jury selection to find the 18 jurors.\nAround the same time the judge declared 'we have our full panel' inside the courtroom in the early afternoon, a man set himself on fire outside the courthouse. A spokesperson for the NYPD said the man was in critical condition. He appears to have had pamphlets describing a conspiracy involving cryptocurrency that he threw around before setting himself ablaze, police said.\nRead more from the fourth day of the Trump trial here →\nVolodymyr Zelensky and Joe Biden in 2023 in Washington, D.C. Drew Angerer / Getty Images file A pivotal moment for Biden, Ukraine and Congress By Kristen Welker A pivotal moment has arrived for President Joe Biden, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and House Speaker Mike Johnson.\nCan the GOP-led House pass the aid Ukraine says it needs in its two-year-old war against Russia?\nIf it does, is it already too late to help?\nHow much longer does Ukraine need assistance?\nAnd how much is riding on the outcome of the 2024 election, given Trump's past opposition to this aid?\nThese are among the questions that I plan to ask Zelenskyy on Sunday when I interview him on 'Meet the Press.'\nThe congressional fight for Ukraine aid has also underscored an important point about the Biden presidency: It's been largely defined — and unsettled — by events overseas.\nIt began with the botched and deadly U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021.\nThen there was Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.\nAnd then came the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack in Israel, which has led to a six-month war.\nJust in the past week, we saw Iran launch missile strikes and drones at Israel, while Israel responded Thursday night by carrying out what appears to be a limited response inside Iran.\n'We don't want to see this escalate. ... We're not looking for a wider war with Iran. ... I think, you know, the coming hours and days will tell us a lot,' National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told me last Sunday.\nHow foreign affairs has defined Biden's presidency has carried over with Russia's invasion of Ukraine — and with the current congressional drama over whether the U.S. will continue to provide Ukraine with the funding it needs.\nAll of it creates a fraught backdrop as the 2024 race heats up.\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

            "summary": "Homeless shelter providers in Massachusetts are raising concerns as lawmakers move to pass legislation that would limit stays to nine months for the first time in the 40-year history of the state's \"right to shelter\" law.\nMassachusetts is the only state to provide families and pregnant women with a right to shelter, which has existed since 1983. But the system has come under historic strain due to an influx of migrant families and a growing number of Massachusetts families displaced under an increasingly unaffordable housing market, public officials and community leaders say. According to the Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless, a little over half of the current 7,500 families in the state's emergency shelter system are those who recently came to the state as refugees or migrants.\nAccording to the Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless, a little over half of the current 7,500 families in the state's emergency shelter system are those who recently came to the state as refugees or migrants. 'The shelter system is being overwhelmed, and we cannot, as a provider, we cannot handle it,' said Mark DeJoie, CEO of Centerboard, one of the largest emergency shelter providers in the state.\nThe Massachusetts House of Representatives passed a new spending bill in March outlining a nearly billion-dollar plan to address the shelter crisis. Shortly after, the Senate passed a new version, requiring leaders from the chambers to enter negotiations to work out their differences. Both bills would impose a nine-month limit on emergency shelter stays, but the sticking points include what kind of extensions could be given to families and how the proposals would be funded.\nRep. Aaron Michlewitz, chair of the House Ways and Means committee, which is involved in the negotiations, said he believes a resolution can be reached on the proposals' differences, adding that Massachusetts' system would still be more generous than most states if it adopts a time limit of nine months for stay.\n'It's still one of the most generous, it is probably the most generous program in the country, in terms of what it provides,\" Michlewitz said. While some other major cities like Chicago and New York allow only short stays in their shelter systems, \"we're talking months here in Massachusetts,' he said.\nShelter directors hope that the legislation will include meaningful extensions past the initial nine months for struggling families, as the average length of stays for families in the system is nearly twice as long, about 16 months, according to the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities, which oversees the state's emergency shelter program.\n'There are many families who are in shelters for a much longer period of time than 14 months and it has nothing to do with people's willingness to leave shelter. It's about the ability to leave,' said Shiela Moore, CEO of Hildebrand Family Self-Help Center, Inc., a shelter provider in the Boston area.\nHildebrand currently houses about 140 families in its Cambridge units, which include both apartment-style units and larger, congregant houses wherein families receive a room and share bathrooms, kitchens and living spaces with other families. Moore said more than 80 families have been there for nine months or longer.\nIn October, Gov. Maura Healey, a Democrat, capped the number of shelter units at 7,500, saying it was necessary because continuing to expand the shelter program would be 'unsustainable.'\nMaura Healey during a news conference in Boston on Jan. 31. Steven Senne / AP file The cap comes after a jump in families qualifying for shelter. The Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities said that there were just about 3,000 families in the state system in March 2022. One year later, the system housed just under 4,000 families. By April of this year, the shelters supported about 7,500 families, with more than 3,500 of them staying in the system's traditional units and the rest in hotels. There are an additional 736 families on a waiting list for emergency shelter as of earlier this month.\nShelter leaders say the influx of migrant families has put stress on an already struggling system.\n'There's an immigration and a human crisis,' DeJoie, of Centerboard, said. 'Our shelter system was never ever built to handle both of those. We do shelter, but the crisis that's come to our front door, we weren't equipped for that.'\nDeJoie added that it's imperative that the federal government steps in to help support the unique needs of migrant families, including obtaining the federal authorization necessary for migrants to apply for jobs in the U.S.\n'We, Massachusetts and all the other places around the country, can't do this without federal government support. It's just — it's impossible,' he said.\nElizabeth Sweet, the executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy (MIRA) Coalition, said the federal government must improve its system for granting work permits to migrant families — a process that in some cases can take as long as a year or more, officials say. She added that many of the families in Massachusetts' shelter system are there because they can't start seeking work opportunities until they are approved to do so.\n'The new immigrants don't want to be staying in hotels and motels,' Sweet said. 'They don't want to be dependent on state-run shelters. They want to be working in jobs and be self-sufficient.'\n'For many, many of these folks, they're waiting some months for when they arrive to when they actually can even start looking for work,' she added.\nWhen asked about the lack of action by lawmakers in Washington on immigration issues, U.S. Rep. Stephen F. Lynch, D-Mass., emphasized the disfunction in Congress over a bipartisan border security bill that was abruptly scuttled by Senate Republicans.\nThe bill, which would impose stricter immigration and asylum laws, collapsed in February following criticism from key GOP lawmakers and Donald Trump.\n'Personally, I would welcome the opportunity to vote on a sensible and bipartisan measure to tighten restrictions at the border,' Lynch said in the statement. 'I believe the Senate has come up with a workable draft that could work with some tweaks, and I think we have the votes for that. Unfortunately, there are some who would rather campaign on the issue than fix it.'\nWhile shelter leaders are concerned about the possibility of families being forced out before they have someplace new to go, they support the lawmakers' efforts to find ways to address the situation as the system continues to buckle.\nDanielle Ferrier, CEO of Heading Home, a major shelter provider headquartered in Boston whose 350 units are currently fully occupied, said there needs to be 'some kind of guardrails' on the system to keep it from spiraling out of control.\n'We have to come up with something that seems like it's as reasonable as can be, as fiscally responsible and sustainable and as humane,' she added.\nFerrier said she would not be supportive of the original bill passed by the state's House, which would allow families only one three-month extension in state shelters after the initial nine months have run out. After that, if they couldn't find housing, families would essentially be put out onto the street, she said. Instead, Ferrier would back a time limit that would include multiple extensions for families who were trying to leave the system but were unable.\n'What I believe is having a very clear nine months and then a waiver process where we can say, look, that family almost has an apartment. We're not going to kick them out today. We're going to make sure they get that apartment, right?' Ferrier said.\n'You have to create the room for the system to flex to be humane and to work,' she added.\nMoore echoed Ferrier's sentiments, saying she understood something needed to be done to address the burdens on the system, but families should not be abandoned in the process.\n'I'm very clear and I'm a realist, we all have budgets to manage,' Moore said. 'But I'm hoping that the legislation will be nimble enough to make adjustments that are needed to keep people from falling through the cracks.'\nKyla Guilfoil",

            "excerpt": "Jury selection could stretch for days.",
            "summary": "Donald Trump — now a former president on trial — has sought to turn his legal peril into a boost for his presidential campaign, animating his supporters and attempting to sow doubt about the motives of his opponents.\nBut facing 34 counts of felony charges, Trump argued on the historic first day of his New York hush money trial that he is the victim of a criminal justice system weaponized against him.\nHe called it 'an assault' on the nation. And as the presumptive Republican nominee for president, repeatedly attacked the prosecution for waging \"election interference.\"\nIt is 'why I'm very proud to be here,' Trump said.\nThe former president intends to be involved at every level, to the extent possible, from court conferences to the jury selection process, his defense attorney Todd Blanche said.\n'President Trump wants to be present at everything,' said Blanche.\nFor much of the day, Trump was seated at the defense table flanked by his attorneys. At times, his voice could be heard in the back of the courtroom, though not what he was saying. Other moments saw Trump shut his eyes — drawing speculation about whether he was still awake, or lost in thought.\nHere is what happened during Monday's proceedings:\nJury selection About 500 New Yorkers arrived for day one of Trump's criminal trial over hush money payments for a process that will take days — and could take weeks — as the court works to weed out jurors who could be swayed by strong biases, or stealth jurors, who may be hiding theirs.\nQuestions like, 'Are you, or have you ever been a member of groups like the Oath Keepers, or ‘3 percenters,'' another far-right group, are used to narrow the pool. Other questions, say about a prospective juror's hobbies or educational background, are a less overtly political way to gauge a juror's potential fairness.\nBy the time the judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan, said he was ready to begin jury selection, about two hundred Manhattanites were in the courthouse waiting to find out if they would be selected.\nTrump was seated at the defense table as the first batch of 96 jurors were brought into the courtroom, filling the pews behind him. Their names, and those of any other prospective jurors, must be kept secret — except to the defense and prosecution.\nSpeaking to his lawyer, Trump gestured with his hands as Merchan discussed the handling of jury pool names. The defense and prosecution each received a copy of the potential jurors' names, which Merchan has said cannot in any way be duplicated and must be returned to the court. They also receive a copy of juror numbers.\nIt can be an intimidating process. More than half of prospective jurors from the first batch of 96 — at least 50 — were excused after saying they could not be fair and impartial. A further nine were excused when asked by the judge if there were other reasons for which they could not serve.\nHalf of the remaining pool of about 34, were called to start voir dire, where they would be queried by both parties, including on their media consumption habits. Trump appeared to track the process closely, reading along as it got underway.\nWitnesses Trump allegedly told his former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen to send porn star Stormy Daniels hush money during his run for president in 2016, a claim that is now at the center of the charges in this case. Prosecutors say this was part of a scheme to suppress negative stories about Trump in the lead-up to election day, which they argue should be charged as election interference.\nTrump has denied the charges, but prosecutors say he is going after those he claims are attacking him, including key witnesses in the case — and has made this a tactic.\n'The defendant himself has publicly embraced the public strategy of going after his perceived enemies,' prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said.\nDefending Trump, Blanche said the former president is the one facing attack by witnesses against him.\n'He is responding to salacious, repeated, vehement attacks by these witnesses,' Blanche said.\nInside the courtroom, large monitors showed a closed-circuit feed of the judge, defense and prosecution tables.\nIn court, Merchan read through a list of possible witnesses, name-checking members of Trump's family, including his children Donald Trump, Jr. and Ivanka Trump, wife Melania, and son-in-law Jared Kushner. The judge named longtime associates of Trump, such as Kellyanne Conway, Dan Scavino, and Rudy Giuliani, his bodyguard Keith Schiller, and White House aides John McEntee, Hope Hicks, and Madeleine Westerhout.\nThe risk of jail time Trump, who must be in the courtroom for every day of his criminal trial, has decried the case as a 'persecution like never before,' and on Monday while standing outside the courtroom argued that it constitutes 'an attack on a political opponent.'\nMerchan warned Trump that he risks jail time if he disrupts the trial, which will continue in his absence. Already, prosecutors are seeking to impose thousands of dollars in fines for three alleged violations of a gag order, including this morning.\nIf he fails to show up, a warrant could be issued for his arrest, an obligation that his campaign lambasted as 'Banana Republic tactics.'\nIt is a 'case that should never have been brought,' Trump said.\nThe trial could drag on for weeks, rerouting to New York a presidential campaign that otherwise could be making overtures to voters in some of the states Trump will need to win in November.\nHe resumed his criticism as the day came to a close, airing among his grievances a ruling by Merchan barring him from attending arguments at the Supreme Court on the question of whether he is entitled to presidential immunity, which he has raised in another of his criminal cases.\n'This is about election interference,' Trump said outside of the courtroom.\nHe lashed out on social media as well, posting articles on Truth Social that dismissed the case against him as 'politically driven' and reposting support from a range of defenders.\nLike in his other cases, Trump did not shy away from leveraging his latest legal entanglement for a campaign boost.\nA fundraising text message went out at the same time, thundering how he would 'never surrender.' Trump's fundraising has surged during moments of potential legal peril, delivering him a much-needed financial and messaging boost as he navigates the challenges of another White House run.\nOn the first day of his trial, Trump made the court case his pitch.\n'I JUST STORMED OUT OF COURT!' he hammered in the message. 'They think I'm finished but I'LL NEVER SURRENDER.'\nAdmissible or not? As prosecutors played evidence to the court that Trump's lawyers argued should not be admissible, Trump, seated at the defense table, watched along on a monitor. This included an excerpt from Trump's deposition in the E. Jean Carroll case where he defended his lewd comments in an \"Access Hollywood\" tape that surfaced in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, and remarks from a campaign rally late in that election cycle, where he showed concern over what he said were false accusations.\nJurors should know Trump's exact words, prosecutors argued. They also displayed tweets they said were evidence of Trump's pressure campaign on Cohen not to cooperate with prosecutors.\nMerchan reinforced a ruling that the \"Access Hollywood\" could not played to the jury — though it could be discussed — and barred prosecutors from introducing the deposition video about it.\nWhen prosecutors asked to introduce evidence about allegations of Trump's coordination with the National Enquirer to 'catch and kill' stories potentially devastating to his 2016 campaign, Trump's attorney dismissed it as a 'sideshow.' The judge ruled that it would be admissible.\nIn a win for the defense, Merchan denied a request by prosecutors to bring in other allegations against Trump of sexual assault. 'Complete hearsay,' he called them.\nMerchan gave Trump a twenty-four-hour deadline to enter final exhibits into evidence. 'You have 24 hours,' Merchan ordered. \"Whatever you don't identify in the next 24 hours, you will be precluded from using.'\nWhat's next? Merchan said he would wait to hear arguments next week on whether Trump violated his gag order by posting social media comments about witnesses in the case.\nLast week, Trump said he would \"absolutely\" testify in the trial, and tomorrow, the judge will conduct a hearing designed to ensure that this decision is well-informed. Known as a Sandoval hearing, it will delve into what could come up under cross-examination when Trump is on the witness stand.\nMerchan rejected a request that Trump be excused next Thursday in order to attend the Supreme Court's arguments on the immunity claim.\nIn another of his cases, Trump has argued to push back two filing deadlines on the basis that his attorneys will be overloaded with the New York trial over the coming six weeks. The request shows how the trial has become the latest opportunity for Trump's team to stall forward momentum on the legal charges against him.\nKatherine Doyle",

            "excerpt": "Abortion is at the center of President Joe Biden's re-election campaign — an improbability for a politician who long expressed his personal discomfort with the practice.",
            "summary": "The issue has been particularly fraught for Biden, an 81-year-old steeped in Catholic teachings and reliant on religious faith to cope with unthinkable tragedy: the deaths of two children and his first wife, Neilia.\n'One of the things that carried him through his numerous difficulties is his Catholic approach of giving yourself to the Lord,' said Ted Kaufman, a longtime Biden confidant and his former Senate chief of staff.\nOn a human level, Biden has never fully overcome his misgivings about abortion. That's evident even in the language he occasionally uses. Two years ago, talking to reporters before he boarded Air Force One, Biden referred to the procedure as aborting 'a child' rather than a fetus, a clue about the point at which he believed life began.\nStill, his stance is that he won't impose his personal views on Americans who believe differently. In 1974, the year he said in an interview that Roe. v. Wade went 'too far,' he also voiced opposition to a constitutional amendment to ban abortion, albeit with some ambivalence, a hometown news report at the time shows.\nA column in the Morning News of Wilmington in January 1974 said Biden told a group of anti-abortion activists: \"I am not sure my stand against such a constitutional amendment is right, nor am I sure the anti-abortionist stand is right, but right now I think I am more right than you are.\"\nLauren Hitt, a campaign spokesperson, said in a prepared statement: 'Joe Biden has opposed abortion bans since the 1970s. As a senator, he voted repeatedly to protect Roe, and as President, he has used his full executive authority to fight back on extreme MAGA attacks on reproductive freedom.'\nBiden described the tensions between faith and policy last year at a Maryland fundraising event.\n'I happen to be a practicing Catholic,' he said. 'I'm not big on abortion. But guess what? Roe v. Wade got it right.'\nA look at his record shows that his path has had its share of starts and stops. As a senator in 1982, he voted in a committee meeting in favor of a constitutional amendment that would have given states the power to restrict abortion if they chose, effectively overturning Roe v. Wade.\nAt the time, Biden said his aim was to push the vote to the Senate floor, where it would finally be resolved. The measure never got that far, and when it came up again the next year, he voted against it.\nIn 2019, as the Democratic front-runner for the presidential nomination, he reversed his long-held position in favor of the so-called Hyde Amendment banning federal funding for abortions.\nThat about-face came at head-spinning speed. One day, his campaign said he supported the Hyde Amendment; the next day, amid blowback from fellow Democrats, he dropped that position. He justified the switch by saying he could no longer support the policy because Republicans were restricting access to abortion in poor neighborhoods.\n'Joe Biden is an Irish Catholic kid from Scranton,' said John Carr, founder of the Initiative on Catholic Life and Social Thought at Georgetown University. 'He seems to stay with Catholic orthodoxy until he thinks the political or other costs are too high.'\nBiden recognized early on that his nuanced position — wary of abortion at his core, accepting of abortion rights in the public square — was bound to cause him grief. He told fellow Sen. Abe Ribicoff of Connecticut in 1973 that his stance would most likely please no one, according to his 2007 memoir, 'Promises to Keep.'\nThat proved prescient.\nIn Biden's first year as president, conservative Catholic bishops argued that he shouldn't receive communion given his backing of abortion rights. He met privately with Pope Francis at the Vatican in October of that year, and afterward he said the pope had assured him that communion shouldn't be withheld.\nKathleen Sebelius, who was health and human services secretary in President Barack Obama's administration, said in an interview that she sympathized with Biden's predicament.\n'I'm born and raised Catholic and went to Catholic schools for 17 years of my life,' said Sebelius, a former governor of Kansas. 'I understand this issue. I've been called out by the archbishop. I was ordered not to take communion.\n'I've been on the personal side of this and the political side of this, and I understand the struggle that those of us who are raised in a faith community and then live in a political world deal with,' she added. 'It's not easy. I think Nancy Pelosi [the former House speaker, who is also Catholic] understands that. I think Joe Biden understands it. It's not a simple choice.'\nWhatever Biden's journey, most advocates say they now have full confidence that he is a reliable champion of abortion rights. When Biden left the Senate in 2009, he had a 100% rating from what was then called NARAL Pro-Choice America, a group promoting abortion access.\n'Biden is not the same man as he used to be when it comes to abortion rights,' said Ilyse Hogue, former president of the organization. 'I don't think he's been hiding his agenda just to win a second term and then secretly plans to turn around and become this anti-choice guy. I'm not worried about it at all.'\nSome still don't believe Biden goes far enough to promote reproductive rights.\nRenee Bracey Sherman, founder and a co-executive director of We Testify, an abortion rights advocacy group, said Biden should use his megaphone to remove the stigma tied to abortion instead of airing his personal doubts. She pointed to recent surveys indicating that 6 in 10 Catholics support abortion rights.\n'He's the president of the United States; he's not the pope of the United States,' Bracey Sherman said. 'I'm sorry, he's allowed to have his personal feelings. But at the end of the day, he is the president, and he is supposed to defend the Constitution and people in this country who need abortions.'\nBracey Sherman said her organization reached out to the Biden administration multiple times offering to bring Catholics who have had abortions into the White House to share their stories — but has yet to hear back.\n'He makes it seem as though he's the one who's following the Catholic teachings,' she said. 'But what about the rest of the Catholics in America who do support access to abortion and have abortions?'\nElections are a choice. Even Biden detractors say they're fully aware that the only realistic alternative at this point is Trump, whom they view as an extremist on the issue.\nAbortion looks to be one of Trump's glaring vulnerabilities. He has boasted about his role in overturning Roe v. Wade through his appointment of three conservative Supreme Court justices during his single term.\n'There is a fundamental question and a fundamental difference between the president and Donald Trump and their belief on whether the Constitution affords women a right to choose. Donald Trump does not; Joe Biden does,' said Kate Berner, a former Biden White House official.\nTrump recently said abortion decisions should be left to the states after he was criticized that he has been murky about what he believes. Even so, he sought to dissociate himself from a recent state court ruling in Arizona upholding a 19th century law imposing a near-total abortion ban.\nDisavowing Arizona's strict anti-abortion measure isn't so easy for Trump. The reason it can take effect springs directly from the votes of conservative Supreme Court justices whom Trump worked to install.\n'The fact is that he announced he was going to stack the court with justices who could be counted on to overrule Roe v. Wade,' said Laurence Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor emeritus. 'He succeeded in that. They did it. That led to the revival of laws like Arizona's, even if Trump says: ‘Oops, I'm sorry that's the consequence. It doesn't make me look good politically.''\nBiden was at the White House last Sunday, dealing with the fallout from Iran's attack on Israel. When he's in Washington on the weekends, he'll often attend services at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Georgetown, the church frequented by the nation's first Catholic president, John F. Kennedy. A Black Lives Matter banner hangs from a fence outside.\nBiden wasn't in the pews that day; he was attending a virtual meeting with U.S. allies about the Iranian attack.\nThe Rev. Patrick Earl led the Mass and greeted congregants at the doorway afterward. He said in an interview that Biden is a 'good presence' during services, recalling how he once left his seat to congratulate a boy's family celebrating his First Communion.\nEarl said he understood Biden's position, even if it conflicts with church teaching.\n'As the political leader of a very varied country, you can't just say, ‘You've got to believe as I believe,'\" he said. \"You just can't.\"\nPeter Nicholas Natasha Korecki",

It ultimately passed 366-58, with 37 Democrats and 21 Republicans voting against the aid and seven members absent.\nIf Biden signs an Israel aid package, as he intends to, \"that heartless decision could mark the point of no return for what remains of the White House's relationship with the American Muslim community and other Americans opposed to the genocide in Gaza,\" said Council on American-Islamic Relations' government affairs director Robert McCaw in a statement.\n'The administration is already at its lowest point in its relationship with the American Muslim community,' McCaw said.\nFor others, it's too late.\nThe rift between the president and Muslim American voters is unlikely to be repaired \"unless the president can undo what has been done for the past six months\" in Gaza, said Osama Abu Irshaid, the executive director for Americans for Justice in Palestine Action.\nAbu Irshaid, who lives in Virginia, cast a ballot for Biden in 2020 but is not planning to vote for Biden nor former President Donald Trump in November, he said.\nMore than 33,000 people in Gaza have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Gazan health ministry. About 1,200 people in Israel were killed during the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, according to the Israeli government, and more than 240 people were taken hostage. More than 100 hostages remain in Gaza, though it is unclear how many are alive.\nThe aid package, which now heads to the Senate for likely passage next week, would mark a significant boost of U.S. support for Israel, though the U.S. has already sent weapons to the country since the start of its war with Hamas. Democratic lawmakers have been increasingly critical of arms support to Israel as well. Earlier this month, more than three dozen members of Congress — including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. — signed a letter asking the White House to \"reconsider your recent decision to authorize the transfer of a new arms package to Israel.\"\nProgressive Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., is among the lawmakers who voted against the Israel aid Friday. She said that she and her colleagues were working to \"make sure that we don't send more weapons\" to Israel as part of the aid package.\n\"Just because we authorize it doesn't mean it has to be sent immediately,\" she said.\nBiden praised the House's passage in a statement after the vote, urging the Senate to \"quickly send this package to my desk so that I can sign it into law.\"\n\"This package will deliver critical support to Israel and Ukraine; provide desperately needed humanitarian aid to Gaza, Sudan, Haiti, and other locations impacted by conflicts and natural disasters around the world; and bolster security and stability in the Indo-Pacific,\" the president said in the statement.\nIn a close election, anger at Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war could be key in swing states that the president won in 2020 by a slim margin.\nBiden flipped Michigan, which has a sizable Arab American population, winning the state by about 154,000 votes in 2020. In 2016, Trump won the state by about 11,000 votes. But during the 2024 presidential primary, more than 100,000 Michiganders cast ballots for uncommitted, many as an act of protest.\nBut the relatively tiny proportion of uncommitted delegates — just 0.008% of the Democratic delegates awarded so far — points to uncertainty about the movement's impact on the November general election. While Biden has more than 3,000 delegates, only 26 have been designated \"uncommitted.\"\nBiden also flipped Arizona in 2020 by a tight margin, beating Trump by just over 10,000 votes.\nAhmed Ewaisha, the chairman of the Arizona Muslim Alliance, said he was \"very excited\" about Biden in 2020. Now, he serves as the co-chair of the Abandon Biden campaign in the crucial swing state. Ewaisha said he's \"definitely concerned\" about Trump, adding that he \"would never, ever support Trump at all.\"\nStill, he said he wanted to vote against Biden as punishment for the president's policies toward Israel and Gaza.\nIn a statement, a Biden campaign official said that 'the President believes making your voice heard and participating in our democracy is fundamental to who we are as Americans.'\n'He shares the goal for an end to the violence and a just, lasting peace in the Middle East,' the official continued. 'He's working tirelessly to that end.'\nSeparately, a White House official pointed to the administration's numerous meetings with state, local and interfaith leaders, as well as outreach to Muslim, Arab and Palestinian communities.\nBiden administration officials have also traveled to Michigan and Illinois to meet with Arab American and Muslim community leaders.\n'White House officials have had more than 100 conversations with leaders at the local and state level concerning the conflict and humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza,' the official said.\nAyah Ziyadeh, the advocacy director for Americans for Justice in Palestine Action, said she voted for Biden in 2020 and tried \"to convince everybody to vote for him.\"\nNow, her organization is working alongside other groups on an American Muslim election task force, which she said will guide how she votes in November. The task force recommendations are expected in a month or two, she said.\nWhen criticizing Biden's response to the war, she said that she doesn't know \"that anything can change my views because I've had to watch six months of genocide against my people.\"\nAs the war progressed, Biden has increasingly sharpened his rhetoric against Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli military's tactics.\nAfter an Israeli air strike killed aid workers in Gaza, Biden said he was \"outraged and heartbroken\" and argued that \"Israel has also not done enough to protect civilians\" and aid workers.\nSimilarly, Biden expressed support for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's public rebuke of Netanyahu.\nThe New York Democrat roundly criticized Israel's prime minister and called for new elections in the country. Later, Biden said that Schumer \"made a good speech, and I think he expressed a serious concern shared not only by him but by many Americans.\"\nWhile several Muslim American organizations are critical of Biden's policies toward Israel, organizers are contemplating how their November votes could impact Trump's prospects for regaining the Oval Office.\nIn the early days of his 2016 campaign, Trump released a policy plan calling for \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" In October of last year, he called for expanding travel bans from several Muslim-majority countries and barring potential refugees from Gaza from entering the U.S.\nHowever, several Muslim American organizers say that the onus is on Biden to regain their votes to avoid handing the election to the former president.\n\"We don't think it's on us. It's on Biden,\" Abu Irshaid said. \"If our votes and the votes of people who support the Palestinian human rights are so important, then Biden should be listening.\"\nActivist Linda Sarsour echoed his sentiments, arguing that \"trying to explain that Joe Biden is better right now during a genocide is not a talking point that lands within our communities.\"\nSarsour is the executive director of the Muslim grassroots organization MPower Change and an organizer for the campaign to vote uncommitted to protest Biden. She said she voted for the president in 2020.\n\"There is no community in this country that knows that Donald Trump is worse than we know him,\" she said, referring to the travel ban on Muslim-majority countries.\nSalam Al-Marayati, president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, voted for Biden in 2020 \"because I really care about our democracy. I saw what Trump was doing.\"\nHe said he has not yet decided how he will vote in November. His organization has not decided whether to make an endorsement for the presidential election, adding that some feel that \"it's not worth endorsing anyone.\"\n\"My concern is that you have a candidate for president who cannot do any more public events for fear of protest, who will not be able to galvanize his own party because it is fractured and is not listening to his own base in his own party,\" Al-Marayati said.\nBiden continues to do public events, although he has faced anti-war protesters interrupting his speeches. At an event in March, he conceded that pro-Palestinian protesters who interrupted his remarks \"have a point.\"\n\"We need to get a lot more care into Gaza,\" he said after the protesters, who called for care in Gaza, were escorted out.\nMegan Lebowitz",

The Supreme Court will consider that question today when it weighs the constitutionality of multiple ordinances enacted by an Oregon town. An appeals court ruling said that several of the ordinances in the city of Grants Pass are prohibited under the Constitution's Eighth Amendment, which bars cruel and unusual punishment. The city ordinances in question bar sleeping or camping on publicly owned property, including sidewalks, streets, bridges and city parks. The key issue in the case is punishment, which can include fines of up to several hundred dollars and exclusion orders that bar people from public property.\nBut advocates for the homeless argue that the ordinances punish people for existing when they don't have anywhere else to go and do nothing to address the underlying issue of housing shortages. Local officials in major cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix are closely watching the case and hoping justices overturn the appeals court ruling .\njustices overturn the appeals court ruling.

But if there's going to be change, it could take several years for the business to renegotiate the way money flows. Last year, the WNBA was projected to make $180 million to $200 million for the 2023 season, according to a Bloomberg News report. That compares with about $10 billion for the NBA in the season ending in 2022, the most recent year for which data is available.\nThe WNBA's lower revenue is a key reason for the pay disparity between the leagues and why rookies, including Clark, will earn a base salary of just $76,000 this season.\n‘Harold and Kumar' helped weed out stereotypes Justine Goode / NBC News; Alamy / Getty This year marks the 20th anniversary of ' Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle ,' one of the only mainstream movies of its decade to star two Asian American leads, hitting theaters across the country.\nHarold & Kumar Go to White Castle,' one of the only mainstream movies of its decade to star two Asian American leads, hitting theaters across the country.

            "summary": "LAS VEGAS — A conference for a far-right sheriffs group this week drew a parade of felons, disgraced politicians, election deniers, conspiracy theorists and, in the end, a few sheriffs.\nThe Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, or CSPOA, met in Las Vegas' Ahern Luxury Boutique Hotel conference center to publicly counter reports of extremism within the group and set a course for the coming election — one that involves sheriffs' investigating what they claim, despite a lack of evidence, is rampant voter fraud.\nThe group sees sheriffs as the highest authority in the U.S., more powerful than the federal government, and it wants these county officers to form posses to patrol polling places, seize voting machines and investigate the Democrats and foreign nations behind what they claim is a criminal effort to rig the vote by flooding the country with immigrants who vote illegally.\nCritics of the group — including voting rights advocates and extremism researchers — fear the CSPOA's new focus will amount to interference and legitimize disinformation about U.S. elections.\nBut the event Wednesday, which starred MAGA celebrities speaking to a half-empty audience made up of few actual sheriffs, pointed to just how fringe the group's ideas are — and how what once seemed like a movement on its way into the mainstream has lost political pull.\nThe conference opened a little behind schedule; the Pledge of Allegiance was delayed when organizers couldn't find a flag. After he searched the conference center's rooms, Tom Hamner, a Colorado man who served over two years in prison for the felony 'interfering with law enforcement' on Jan. 6, 2021, came forward with the scarf from his wife's neck. It wasn't exactly a flag, but it was emblazoned with stars and stripes.\n'That'll work!' emcee Alex Newman, an Epoch Times contributor, said before he led the crowd of dozens in the pledge. A smooth jazz rendition of 'The Star-Spangled Banner' followed, sung by a Las Vegas man awaiting trial on multiple felony charges who is accused of fraudulently posing as a certified firearms instructor.\nI sat with a small group of reporters at a table marked 'reserved,' a section Newman and other presenters pointed to throughout the day when they invoked, in Donald Trump's style, the 'fake media.'\nWe, along with candidates and elected officials, were admitted gratis. Others paid $49 for the day, which included breakfast, a box lunch and a 'pizza party.' Sponsors staffed booths advertising unofficial Trump merchandise, supplements, prepper gear and various patriot-themed swag.\nCSPOA's finances aren't public. It charges for events like this conference, offers a $99 yearly subscription for access to weekly webinars and solicits donations. It has also provided training sessions in nearly a dozen states, where police and sheriffs earn continuing education credits toward professional requirements. Last year, the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement ended the practice in the state.\nTo the extent that the 13-hour day was structured, it was broken roughly in two: the first half dedicated to the issue of encroaching federal power and the second to election denial and conspiracy theories.\nThe morning's sessions were the group's bread and butter. Former Arizona sheriff Richard Mack founded the CSPOA in 2011 to advocate for the belief that sheriffs — who generally operate independently with little to no oversight and are accountable only to voters — are the ultimate arbiters and enforcers of the Constitution and must act as a check on tyrannical federal power.\nIts early focus was on gun laws and other tea party pet causes, including immigration, the Affordable Care Act and attention-grabbing standoffs between ranchers and the Bureau of Land Management. 'The greatest threat we face today is not terrorists,' Mack's website read in 2012. 'It is our own federal government.'\nAfter two terms as sheriff in an Arizona border county, Mack lost re-election. He sought elected office multiple times but failed in bids for sheriff of a different county, governor and seats in the U.S. House and Senate.\nThere are no public rolls today, but Mack claims 10% of the country's 3,000 sheriffs are members, along with 10,000 ordinary citizens.\nWednesday's event drew a little over 100 people by midmorning. Attendees took notes, nodded along and offered somber 'Amens' and boisterous 'Nos!' when called for.\nJared Bosley, a farmer in South Dakota, told of his fight with the state over a pipeline company surveying his land without his permission. Two convicted Jan. 6 rioters said they were 'political prisoners.' Former Rep. Steve King of Iowa, his legacy a history of racist remarks, railed against the World Health Organization, the World Economic Forum and 'ringleader' George Soros. Another disgraced former congressman, Steve Stockman of Texas, sobbed as he shared his story of serving time in a federal prison for fraud and sobbed again when he got to the part where Trump commuted his 10-year sentence.\nThe supportive crowd felt like 'a warm bath,' Stockman said, his arms stretched toward heaven.\nRichard Fleming, a cardiologist who in 2009 pleaded guilty to felony charges of health care and mail fraud, gave a lengthy presentation alleging the Covid vaccines were bioweapons. Radio show host Wayne Allyn Root thundered into the microphone promoting the 'great replacement,' a racist conspiracy theory. 'They want to replace American citizens who love this country,' Root bellowed.\nIt was nearly lunchtime when the first active sheriff spoke. Bob Songer, a CSPOA board member and the sheriff of Klickitat County, Washington, said he enforces only laws he determines to be constitutional and talked about his 'posse,' a group of 150 armed community volunteers he relies on for tasks like hunting cougars and courtroom security and keeps at the ready, as a potential militia. He offered a copy of his posse plan to sheriffs in the audience.\nDuring the break, as CSPOA volunteer Kenneth Hall sang an original song, 'I Back the Sheriff,' to the music of the Bob Marley tune, I asked Mack why there weren't more sheriffs at his conference. Mack said that didn't matter.\n'There's several candidates,' Mack said, noting the political signs littering the room. He said he hoped to draw a 'new generation' of sheriffs, but, pointing to 78-year-old Songer, he added, 'there's one, and he's one of the best sheriffs in America!'\nIndeed, there are politicians — or would-bes — who see the constitutional sheriffs group as an important bloc of support. Twenty or so candidates for local office in the crowd from Nevada, Utah, Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Georgia and Idaho spent the morning shaking hands and passing out cards.\nIt's a model that has proven effective. Trump depended on support from sheriffs in the White House and continues to rely on them at campaign events, as he did in 2016 and 2020. At a presentation in Grand Rapids, Michigan, this month, a half-dozen uniformed sheriffs stood in the background decked out in gold stripes and braided ropes as Trump railed against immigration and stood before a sign that read 'Stop Biden's Border Bloodbath.'\nAfter lunch, former sheriff Glenn Hamilton, who lost his 2022 re-election bid in Sierra County, New Mexico, regaled the audience with the time he deputized an entire church congregation to permit a gathering in violation of the governor's Covid rules. Hamilton referred to 'this old tool that's in our box called Posse Comitatus. Who's ever heard of this?' he asked.\nThe Posse Comitatus movement in the 1970s and '80s held up the county sheriff as the only true law enforcement officer and urged vigilantism through local posse groups. Latin for 'power of the county,' Posse Comitatus was preached and popularized by white supremacist William Potter Gale, but it dissolved in the wake of a spate of violence and highly publicized prosecutions.\nThe CSPOA has recently sought to distance itself from that history, the kind of messaging that may have resonated with not only tea partiers but also anti-government groups and militias and caused national hate tracking groups and Mack's Republican political opponents to label him a far-right extremist.\nMack and CSPOA leaders have consistently decried the label, but their ties with extremist organizations are well-documented. Mack was a keynote speaker at the first national conference for the far-right Oath Keepers in 2009 and sat on the militia group's board until at least 2015. The CSPOA's current CEO since 2022, Sam Bushman, operates Liberty News Radio, which has syndicated programs hosted by white supremacists. Bushman has hosted Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes on his show, 'Liberty RoundTable,' over a dozen times, including after the attack on the Capitol, for which Rhodes is serving an 18-year sentence for seditious conspiracy.\nA frustrated and defiant Bushman said it was that kind of negative publicity that had most likely caused the conference's biggest speaker, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, to bail. Without notice, Bannon hadn't shown up, he said. Bannon didn't respond to a request for comment.\nWith Bannon out, the biggest star was Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser and retired three-star general who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI but was pardoned by Trump. After he promoted a new film about himself that would be released the next day, Flynn took photos with attendees near the stage. Seeing an NBC News photographer, Flynn demanded to know whom he worked for, and when he identified himself, Flynn became incensed and yelled, 'You're a liar!' The organizers then moved Flynn to a room walled off by curtains and two guards.\nThe CSPOA has always been considered a fringe movement, but the pandemic offered a boost. Constitutional sheriffs were suddenly a viable solution to what a growing slice of the GOP saw as tyrannical lockdown orders, mask requirements and vaccination mandates. Similar constitutional sheriffs organizations began to pop up, including Pinal County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Lamb's Protect America Now and a pro-Trump think tank, the Claremont Institute's Sheriffs Fellowship.\nThe 2020 election offered another opportunity. Pushing unfounded claims of a stolen election, the CSPOA collaborated with True the Vote, the Texas-based election conspiracy theorist group behind '2000 Mules,' a widely panned and debunked film that claimed to reveal widespread ballot drop-box fraud.\nMack called the film a 'smoking gun,' and at its 2022 conference, the CSPOA called upon its members to launch investigations. But results have been lackluster.\nThe most notable investigation came from Barry County, Michigan, Sheriff Dar Leaf, who partnered with a pro-Trump lawyer bent on overturning Michigan's election results. Leaf's investigation, which has involved seizing election equipment and grilling local clerks, has seemingly only impeded a criminal case against three Trump supporters indicted last year on state charges related to their alleged tampering with voting machines. Leaf hasn't been charged with a crime.\nOnstage, Leaf, bespectacled and boyish, was giddy. The investigation had faced setbacks, he acknowledged, but he believed there would soon be justice.\n'I'm getting goose-bumpy here,' Leaf said. Later, he told me he didn't pay any attention to the criticism from state election and law enforcement officials or from the media: 'I just keep my head down.'\nAs the day wore on at the conference, the rails began to wear.\nTina Peters, a former Mesa County, Colorado, clerk facing multiple criminal charges related to a suspected security breach of her county's election system in 2021, and fresh off a home confinement for obstructing government administration in a separate case, took the stage wearing a large white lei. She is fighting the latest charges, with a trial scheduled for this summer. She had recently been to Hawaii, she said, and she offered a slideshow of photographic evidence that she suggested proved the recent deadly wildfires were the result of an intentional laser attack.\nAs Mike Lindell, MyPillow's founder and a sponsor of the CSPOA event, spoke — election denial and his prowess with the media and in business were his main topics — a blond woman in a robin's egg suit jacket walked up behind me and handed me a note: 'I would like to give you some first hand info that will be helpful to you reaching a conclusion on election fraud in NV.' The note passer, Susan Proffitt, later told me that the room was full of operatives, 'and they are doing their best to destroy us.'\nPizza was put out on long tables under heat lamps. The audience, halved from the morning, milled about. A couple of women took off their high heels. Several small groups were forming around the bar. There was still an awards ceremony, and Mack and Bushman had planned a news conference, though by the time it started the members of the media had gone.\nAs I left, I checked in with a man who had been sitting in the back, watching attentively. Jeffrey Kadlowec, a local architect, hadn't heard of CSPOA before and wasn't sure what to expect. 'I thought it would be more about law enforcement,' he said excitedly. 'I didn't expect it to be so, so radical.'\nBrandy Zadrozny",
