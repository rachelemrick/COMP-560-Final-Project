            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump's campaign operation is requesting that any down-ballot candidates or Republican groups who use Trump's name, image or likeness in fundraising asks give a portion of the funds raised to Trump's main fundraising committee.\nAccording to a memo obtained by NBC News from a source who received it, Trump's co-campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita requested a split of \" a minimum of 5% of all fundraising solicitations to Trump National Committee JFC. This includes but is not limited to sending to the house file, prospecting vendors, and advertising.\"\n\"a minimum of 5% of all fundraising solicitations to Trump National Committee JFC. This includes but is not limited to sending to the house file, prospecting vendors, and advertising.\" The memo adds, \"Any split that is higher than 5% will be seen favorably by the RNC and President Trump's campaign and is routinely reported to the highest levels of leadership within both organizations.\"\nThe letter was sent on Monday and asked candidates and committees to adhere by the guidelines beginning Tuesday. Politico was first to report on the memo.\nBeyond the directive about splitting fundraising when using Trump's name, image and likeness to raise money, LaCivita and Wiles issued several additional guidelines for campaigns and committees using Trump for their own ends.\nThey forbid campaigns from \"speaking on behalf of President Trump ... questioning the readers' support of President Trump or tying their support to a financial contribution ... creating new memberships, clubs or rewards that are not authorized by the campaign ... impersonating President Trump or his campaign,\" and more.\ncampaigns from \"speaking on behalf of President Trump ... questioning the readers' support of President Trump or tying their support to a financial contribution ... creating new memberships, clubs or rewards that are not authorized by the campaign ... impersonating President Trump or his campaign,\" and more. Trump advisers have long sparred with groups raising money off his name without authorization, as other figures on the right sought to capitalize on the former president's appeal to small-dollar donors.\nThe memo comes as Trump's campaign and the RNC have trailed President Joe Biden's reelection campaign and the Democratic National Committee in fundraising.\nThe Trump campaign warned that digital vendors who disobey the directives in the menu will face consequences, including getting cut off from party business.\n\"Repeated violations will result in the suspension of business relationships between the vendor and Trump National Committee JFC. This includes list rental agreements,\" the memo reads. \"As the top Republican digital vendors, we ask that you inform your clients of these new guidelines, and to use your best judgment when mentioning President Trump.\"\nAlexandra Marquez",

            "excerpt": "But behind every scowl, whisper or even yawn, Trump's team sees a clear message the presumptive GOP nominee has the opportunity to get across: Defiance.",
            "summary": "Donald Trump has spent most of his adult life seeking the limelight. Inside a frigid New York City courtroom this week, a closed-circuit camera provided arguably the brightest light he's stood before.\nNot even during his jaw-dropping presidency nor at his raucous rallies has Trump's every move been so meticulously tracked as during his initial appearances in Manhattan for the start of his hush money trial. Every smirk, turn, stare and scoff he made in the courtroom was chronicled by reporters and blasted out to the world to offer even a glimpse or small insight into how he was handling developments in the case — the first criminal trial ever involving a former president.\nBut behind every scowl, whisper or, yes, even yawn, Trump's team sees a clear message the presumptive GOP nominee has the opportunity to get across: Defiance. The aim? Convince the American people that the 34 counts of falsifying business records he faces are a sham to harm his electoral odds this fall.\n'President Trump proved he will remain defiant in the face of this unprecedented political lawfare, and it is clear that his support from the American people will only grow as they watch Joe Biden, [Manhattan District Attorney] Alvin Bragg, and the Democrats putting on this bogus show trial six months before the election,' said Karoline Leavitt, a Trump spokesperson.\nThe central thesis of the charges, as Bragg alleges, is that Trump falsified records to conceal that he reimbursed his former lawyer Michael Cohen for the $130,000 paid to adult film actor Stormy Daniels just prior to the 2016 presidential election — a move made to preemptively silence her from alleging that she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. (Trump denies sleeping with Daniels but has acknowledged repaying Cohen, who pled guilty in 2018 to federal campaign finance charges related to the payment).\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to the charges and, if convicted, could face up to four years in prison.\nMost of the week's court proceedings featured jury selection, with Trump listening as prospective jurors were questioned about their media diet, opinions on Trump's presidency and ability to judge him fairly. Some were even pushed on past social media posts, such as one possible alternate juror who was questioned about a 2020 social media post where he called Trump 'the devil and a sociopath.' (He was dismissed.)\nIn Manhattan, a New York City borough he lost by 70 points in 2020, Trump didn't find many of the jurors' answers satisfactory, and at multiple points stared down individuals. Nevertheless, a full jury and alternate jurors were selected, with Trump's ears perking up when candidates referenced watching Fox News or otherwise making comments he viewed favorably.\nHe crossed his arms Friday, muttering to an attorney seated beside him when one prospective juror described him as seemingly 'very selfish and self-serving.' But Trump smiled when the prosecution noted to jurors that some witnesses they will call 'have what you might consider to be some baggage.'\nTrump was admonished by Judge Juan Merchan in court Tuesday for his behavior toward the prospective jurors, with Merchan telling Trump and his lawyer Todd Blanche: 'I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom. I want to make this crystal clear.'\nMerchan said he heard Trump say something in the direction of a juror and that he had been 'muttering' and 'gesturing' toward her.\nBut nothing from the week garnered more attention than Trump looking as if he was dozing off, closing his eyes for extended periods, prompting speculation he had fallen asleep. This was not a single occurrence, he sat with his eyes closed at least once every day he was in court.\nTrump ignored a hallway questions about whether he was napping, but did post to his Truth Social platform on Friday that the trial, which could go on for weeks, 'is a Long, Rigged, Endurance Contest, dealing with Nasty, Crooked People, who want to DESTROY OUR COUNTRY.'\nBiden's campaign seized on the possible snooze, poking fun at Trump. The campaign seemed to take particular pleasure in calling him 'Sleepy Don,' after years of Trump, 77, jabbing Biden, 81, as 'Sleepy Joe.'\nIn a statement, Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer took a dig at Trump for appearing to get some shut-eye but otherwise did not address the former president's actions in court, instead touting the sitting president's tour of Pennsylvania this week — pointing to his rally with steelworkers and stops at popular Keystone State convenience chains Sheetz and WaWa.\n'Our campaign and the president are focused on the American people — not Donald Trump's trials and tribulations,' Singer said. 'We're also not sleeping on the fact that campaigns are won by the candidate who remains focused on fighting for the American people — not distracted by their own grievances or pursuit of revenge and retribution.'\n'We are proud of the week we had,' Singer continued, 'you'll have to ask the Trump campaign if they are proud of theirs.'\nBut Trump's campaign sees the spotlight on his court appearances as a boon, expressing optimism that the difficult jury selection process will wake up voters to the overarching points Trump and allies have made about the case against him: That it's illegitimate. What's more, the endless media coverage Trump received this week eclipsed Biden's much-heralded trip across a key battleground state this week, another win in team Trump's eyes.\nTrump has been able to be more voiceful outside of court, posting to his Truth Social platform his belief that he is being 'railroaded' or lamenting the case as 'ridiculous' when addressing the press this week. (He also echoed concerns from others of how 'freezing' the courtroom was.)\n'Donald Trump has made clear that the Bragg indictment is politically motivated,' Garrett Ventry, a Trump-aligned GOP strategist, said. 'His stone coldness in court shows his defiance to the case, and his creative press gaggles outside of court enforce that strategy. Never before have a presidential candidate successfully turned indictments into bumps in the polls, until Trump.'\nThere have been reminders that Trump is not able to act the same inside court as out. At one point on Thursday, Trump pulled out his phone while seated at the defense table and appeared grumpy after his attorney told him to put it away.\nUltimately, much of the proceedings have been mundane. That same day, Trump yawned as Merchan read through jury instructions. For the most part, Trump appears resigned to his new reality: Court appearance after court appearance for weeks to come.\nAllan Smith Katherine Doyle and Natasha Korecki contributed.",

            "excerpt": "The president's re-election campaign, meanwhile, was sending out some thinly veiled jabs about the former president's legal woes.",
            "summary": "As he kicked off a series of events in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania on Tuesday, President Joe Biden freely ripped into his nemesis.\nFrom his hometown, Scranton, Biden chided Donald Trump about his past tax plan for giving tax breaks to billionaires and his comments about Social Security. He joked about Trump's personal financial predicament. He accused Trump of ballooning the federal debt, razzed him for suggesting that injecting bleach could battle Covid-19 and called him ' Donald Herbert Hoover Trump.'\n'Donald Herbert Hoover Trump.' What Biden didn't do is touch the lowest-hanging fruit of all — the fact that at the same time, Trump was sitting in a New York City courtroom, the first president or former president in history to stand criminal trial.\nAs eventful as the trial commencement has been and as salacious as the details of Trump's case are — involving paying off a porn star to evade political reprisal — Biden didn't budge from his longtime practice of steering clear of any specific talk about Trump's legal predicaments. Though he has nibbled around the edges from time to time, Biden doesn't delve into the indictments Trump faces even, it seems, when a criminal trial is actually underway.\nAt the same time, Biden's campaign was having a field day with memes coming out of the trial, ribbing Trump for possibly having nodded off in court. It also put out a news release this week titled: 'After Stormy Abortion Ban Coverage, Trump Poll Memo Attempts to Hush Panic.'\nIt tried to capture the onslaught of rough media Trump faced after last week's Arizona Supreme Court decision that cleared the way for a near-total ban on abortion in the state, while playing off of porn star Stormy Daniels and 'hush money,' the oft-repeated shorthand for the charges he faces.\nThe campaign seemed to relish poking fun at Trump, calling him 'Sleepy Don,' turning the tables on his onetime nickname for Biden, 'Sleepy Joe.' But beyond that, the campaign, like Biden, evaded actual commentary on the charges themselves. The White House did the same. Asked whether Biden was being briefed or was watching Trump's courtroom happenings, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre shifted and laid out Biden's itinerary in Pennsylvania.\n'The president is going to Pennsylvania today, and he's going to do a three-stop tour,' she said before the event. 'He's going to focus on how he's continuing to help the American people.'\nThere is an inherent danger for Biden in getting too close to the criticism of Trump's indictments. Trump has repeatedly told his supporters that the array of court charges he faces is akin to election interference and accused Biden of persecuting him. Celebrating criminal charges against Trump could play into that narrative.\nA Biden campaign official said the recent references to Daniels were a creative way to get out a broader message about abortion. As for picking at Trump for falling asleep, the official said that's consistent with the campaign's highlighting Trump's gaffes and that, in this case, it was too good to pass up.\n'It's smart of the president to continue doing what he's doing, which is talk about his positive vision for the American people,' said Brandon Weathersby, a spokesman for American Bridge 21st Century, the key opposition research group for Biden.\nHis group, in the meantime, is rapidly responding to the trial, highlighting 'chaos' surrounding Trump.\n'With Donald Trump being in court just the last few days, we've seen a lot of chaos. He's intimidating jurors. He's getting reprimanded by the judge. He's going on rants on social media,\" Weathersby said, pointing to the split screen with Biden, who was out campaigning and laying out his platform. 'Right now he's doing the job. He looks like a president.'\nOn Tuesday, against a backdrop that read 'Tax Fairness for All Americans' Biden, 24 hours after Tax Day, laid out a tax plan he said would benefit the middle class and working-class people. It would expand the child tax credit, he said, and add a minimum tax for billionaires. At the same time, he vowed he wouldn't raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year.\nBut he was far from sparing about Trump, seeming to take joy in a string of snarky comments.\nHe bashed Trump, saying he cut taxes only for the wealthy.\n'I have to say if Trump's stock in Truth Social, his company, drops any lower, he might do better under my tax plan than his,' Biden joked to the Scranton crowd.\nHe had the supporters clapping and laughing at another point when he told a story about being confronted by someone who complained about not feeling the benefits of the economy. He was, however, setting up a joke at Trump's expense.\n'Just the other day a defeated-looking guy came up to me and asked if I could help. He was drowning in debt,' Biden said. Then he delivered the punchline: 'I said, ‘I'm sorry, Donald, but I can't help you.''\nIt was a line Biden had used in private events but hadn't said publicly before.\nBiden is to spend the next two days traversing Pennsylvania in a series of events, including in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.\nNatasha Korecki",

            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump is poised to receive an additional 36 million shares of Trump Media Tuesday — an 'earnout' bonus worth more than $1.25 billion, at Monday's price.\nTrump Media, which owns the Truth Social app, was trading at around $35 per share mid-day Monday.\nBut that price is twice the $17.50 benchmark minimum share price, which the DJT ticker has to hit by the close of trading Tuesday, for Trump to become eligible for the extra so-called earnout shares.\nThat earnout is contingent on the benchmark being hit for 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period, beginning March 25. Tuesday is the 20th day and it is very unlikely that DJT will fall below the benchmark price by the end of that day.\nTrump Media's share price was down about 1.8% as of 12:17 p.m. ET\nThe 36 million additional for Trump would be added to the 78.75 million shares he already owns, as the company's majority shareholder.\nWhen the earnout shares are added to his existing stock, Trump's total stake in Trump Media would be worth more than $4 billion on paper, at $35 a share.\nTrump Media has the power to issue a total of 40 million earnout shares, as part of the merger deal that combined it with a publicly traded shell company, Digital World Acquisition Corp.\n'Assuming the full issuance of the Earnout Shares, President Donald J. Trump will receive 36,000,000 Earnout Shares,' the company said in a securities filing. The filing suggests that some, if not all, of the remaining shares will be issued to Trump Media's executive officers as part of an incentive plan.\nTrump was in a New York City courtroom Monday, listening to opening statements in his criminal hush money trial. Court resumes on Tuesday for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\nThe merged company, whose full name is Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., began public trading under the DJT ticker on March 26, at an opening price of $70.90 per share.\nThat price rose to a high of nearly $80 that day, briefly giving the company a market capitalization of more than $9 billion. This was despite having reported a 2023 net loss of $58 million, and just $4.1 million in revenue.\nBut since then, Trump Media's share price has plunged. By the close of trading on April 15, the share price had fallen nearly 68% from its opening price.\nThe stock price rose sharply last week. But as of Monday, Trump Media shares were still trading around 50% lower than the price they debuted at last month, erasing billions of dollars in market capitalization for the company.\nEven with a much lower stock price, Trump is almost certain to receive all of his earnout shares.\nThat's because the threshold share price at which Trump will receive all 36 million of his earnout shares was set at $17.50. The last time the stock traded at that price was in January, before the Securities and Exchange Commission greenlighted DWAC and Trump Media's plans to merge.\nIt remains to be seen if the issuance of the earnout shares to Trump will affect the share price of Trump Media.\nAny shares that Trump owns are subject to a lock-up provision that prevents him from selling them in the six months following the merger's closing date.\nWhile Trump Media's board could amend that provision, to date, it has not taken any steps to do so.\nCNBC asked a company spokeswoman about the expected triggering of Trump's earnout shares.\nShe replied, 'With more than $200 million in the bank and zero debt, Trump Media is fulfilling all its obligations related to the merger and rapidly moving forward with its business plan.'\nDan Mangan, CNBC",

Trump's trial: A ‘freak show' on the outside and solemn on the inside By Jonathan Allen Inside a courthouse nestled between Tribeca and Chinatown on Monday morning, former President Donald Trump's lawyers argued with the district attorney's office over procedures for a hush-money case that could send an ex-commander in chief to prison for the first time in American history.\nJudge Juan Merchan advised lawyers that he was getting a little annoyed by the 'minutia.' With a pool of 500 prospective jurors waiting, he wanted to get started with the process of picking 12.\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know The judge also delivered Trump his 'Parker warnings,' including that he could be jailed for contempt if he is absent without leave at any point during the trial. Trump, betraying little emotion, said he understood.\nOutside, in a sun-filled park across the street, peculiarity reigned over pedantry.\nA smattering of pro-Trump demonstrators — some wearing costumes, others carrying signs, one temporarily lowering the top of her dinosaur-themed one-piece before writhing on the ground in performative ecstasy — lent their support to the presumptive Republican nominee.\nThe presence of high-profile gawkers accentuated the carnival-like nature of the gathering: The Daily Show's Jordan Klepper, former Republican gubernatorial candidate Andrew Giuliani and filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, a daughter of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n'I never miss a freak show,' the younger Pelosi, a longtime resident of nearby Greenwich Village, said.\nThe unlikely tandem of Klepper and Giuliani provided a clear window into a series of truths about this trial: The charges are at once the least consequential of the set pending against Trump and as fundamental to democracy as the question of whether special treatment — either targeting or protection — can be avoided in the case of such a powerful figure.\nAt times during the lengthy proceedings, the former president suggested disinterest or exhaustion by closing his eyes.\nMost of the jurors sat quiet and expressionless. Merchan emphasized his desire to shield their identities from the public, going so far as to warn the rival legal teams not to reproduce lists of their names. More than half of them were dismissed when they raised their hands to say they could not be impartial in this trial.\nOne dismissed prospective juror was overheard in a hallway saying, 'I just couldn't do it.'\nFinding 12 adults with no particular feelings about Donald J. Trump, and the will to sit through a multi-week trial, is no easy feat. That process will continue inside Merchan's court. For the rest of the world, the 'freak show' rolls along on the outside.\nRead more →\nWhere public opinion stands on Trump's trial — for now Analysis by Mark Murray It's unclear how the criminal trial into the hush money charges against Trump will ultimately play out, but recent national polling gives us a good idea where voters stand on the matter.\nAt least for now.\nSizable majorities say the charges against Trump are serious: 64% of voters said the charges that Trump falsified business records concerning the payment of hush money to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election are very or somewhat serious, according to an April Reuters/Ipsos poll.\nSizable majorities say the charges against Trump are serious: 64% of voters said the charges that Trump falsified business records concerning the payment of hush money to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election are very or somewhat serious, according to an April Reuters/Ipsos poll. Yet that's smaller than the share of voters who believed the charges in the other criminal cases are serious — such as trying to overturn the 2020 election results (74%), pressuring Georgia state officials to overturn the 2020 election (72%) and illegally removing classified documents (69%).\nA recent New York Times/Siena College poll also found 58% of registered voters saying the hush-money charges are 'very' or 'somewhat' serious, including 30% of self-identified Republicans.\nViews about Trump's guilt are divided along party lines: But the same NYT/Siena poll showed a smaller share of voters (46%) believing that Trump should be found guilty in the hush-money case, while 36% said he should be found not guilty; another 18% say they didn't know or refused to answer.\nViews about Trump's guilt are divided along party lines: But the same NYT/Siena poll showed a smaller share of voters (46%) believing that Trump should be found guilty in the hush-money case, while 36% said he should be found not guilty; another 18% say they didn't know or refused to answer. And look at the results by party:\nDemocrats: 84% guilty, 6% not guilty, 10% didn't know\nRepublicans: 13% guilty, 71% not guilty, 16% didn't know\nIndependents: 40% guilty, 35% not guilty, 25% didn't know\nNotice how those independents are right down the middle, with a sizable number not having an opinion. The general election ballot slightly shifts if Trump is found guilty: Finally, the January 2024 national NBC News poll showed a slight shift in the horse race between Trump and President Joe Biden when voters are asked about their opinions *if* Trump is ultimately convicted of a crime.\nThe general election ballot slightly shifts if Trump is found guilty: Finally, the January 2024 national NBC News poll showed a slight shift in the horse race between Trump and President Joe Biden when voters are asked about their opinions *if* Trump is ultimately convicted of a crime. In the original ballot test, Trump was ahead of Biden by 5 points among registered voters, 47% to 42%, which was within the poll's margin of error.\nBut when voters were asked — on the survey's final question — about their ballot choice if Trump is convicted of a crime, Biden jumped ahead of Trump by 2 points, 45% to 43%.\nThat's a 7-point swing.\nA caveat about that hypothetical, however: It assumes voters would see a conviction is fair and square. But as we all know, Trump has already spent months trying to cast the prosecution as unfair and politically motivated.\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

            "summary": "Donald Trump emerged from a Manhattan courtroom Monday ready for a fight.\nAfter day one of a trial that has Trump facing 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to a porn star, the former president stood in front of reporters ready to unleash a grievance-laced tirade that, at times, did not totally reflect reality but guaranteed he would continue to dominate the headlines even from court.\nHis immediate focus was Judge Juan Merchan's decision to not yet rule on whether Trump can attend his son Barron's May 17 high school graduation. Merchan did not say Trump could not go, but rather he was not yet ready to rule on the matter. Specifics aside, however, it gave Trump just enough to paint the picture for his supporters of a biased judge blocking a loving father from seeing his son's graduation.\n'My son is graduating high school, and it looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation,' Trump told the assembled group of reporters.\nIt's emblematic of how Trump has tried to control the narrative — an instinct that has defined his political career — even while stuck in a camera-less Manhattan courtroom. The judge has ordered Trump to attend court hearings in person, so it's a predicament he will find himself in at least four days a week for the foreseeable future as President Joe Biden continues to run a more traditional presidential campaign.\nThe false claim a judge was not allowing him to attend his son's graduation spread like wildfire in the conservative ecosystem, a conflagration helped by some of his top supporters with huge followings. Kari Lake called Merchan 'heartless & cruel.' Piers Morgan used a New York Post column to call the-decision-that-was-not 'disgusting.' Donald Trump Jr. called it 'pure evil.'\nFor millions of Trump supporters, the half-truth became the truth and a cause celebre for those eagerly looking to maintain the belief that the entire legal fight is an attempt by Democrats to get Trump locked up.\nThose sorts of distortions and fights about nearly every aspect of the trial dominated the first week, which focused on jury selection.\nIt was often reality versus Trump's version of it.\nThere were reports Trump may have fallen asleep in court, where cameras are not allowed in these types of cases. He responded forcefully on Truth Social that 'I was PRAYING not sleeping!!!'\nTrump had a misunderstanding about the jury selection process. It led him to post on Truth Social that the process is another example of 'ELECTION INTERFERENCE!'\nAnd Trump has broadly used a torrent of Truth Social posts and media interviews to paint a picture of both Merchan and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg as biased and out to get him, a sentiment that has been taken as gospel and amplified by conservative media.\nIn fundraising text messages, Trump has also told supporters that he left the courtroom, which at no point during the week happened except during scheduled court recesses or when court was over for the day.\n'I JUST STORMED OUT OF COURT!' read a fundraising text message from Trump's campaign. 'They think I'm finished, but I'LL NEVER SURRENDER!'\nTrump also tried to raise political cash off the claim that he has been blocked from attending Barron's graduation.\n'THEY ARE FORCING ME TO SKIP MY SON'S GRADUATION,' Trump's campaign texted. 'I'LL BE IN COURT.'\n'Heartless thugs,' it continued.\nThe trial-focused fundraising efforts have been breaking through the noise.\nOn the first day of trial, Trump's campaign raised $1.6 million in small-dollar donations, a campaign official told NBC News. Trump raised that much online on only three days in the first three months of 2024, according to a recent campaign finance filing from WinRed, the Trump campaign's online donation platform. Each of those three days came toward the end of March.\n\"Crooked Joe Biden and the Democrat's entire strategy to defeat President Trump is to confine him to a courtroom and unconstitutionally silence him throughout this sham Biden trial,\" said Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. \"Polling shows the American people see right through the Stalinist tactics employed by Crooked Joe and his allies.\"\n\"President Trump and his team will continue fighting for truth in the courtroom, while working to earn votes on the campaign trail,\" she added.\nMuch of the nation's attention is focused on the historic nature of an ex-president on trial, a saturation that has helped Trump continue his unmatched ability to get and retain attention regardless of the specific situation — which, in this case, is being stuck in court facing unflattering revelations about his personal life and accusations about trying to hide the information to get elected.\n'I don't think any of it matters. He totally rewrote the rules,' said a longtime Republican operative granted anonymity to speak freely about Trump's week-one performance. 'There are between 75-80 million people who will vote for him because he is a scrappy fighter. Working class folks see him as a billionaire bubba.'\nThe entire episode sets up a split screen of a former president mired in legal fights and stuck in court and an incumbent president checking all the boxes of what would be considered a traditional presidential campaign. Biden has a significant fundraising advantage and continues to hold in person campaign rallies, most recently a swing through Pennsylvania, including events in his hometown of Scranton, where he attacked Trump on a range of issues — but noticeably did not mention his legal woes. Biden's campaign has previously said it would avoid directly taking shots at Trump's legal problems to try and avoid the perception of a weaponized Justice Department.\nBeyond fundraising text messages, Trump's political operation has continued to work in the background. On Wednesday — the trial's off day — Trump had dinner with Polish President Andrzej Duda at Trump Tower in New York, and on Saturday, he is set to hold a rally in North Carolina, a key swing state.\nTrump has also installed top allies to lead the Republican National Committee, which has generally been focused on the more basic types of political blocking-and-tackling as the presidential nominee is likely to be stuck in courtrooms for most of the 2024 election cycle. Including the current trial, Trump faces four separate criminal indictments and a handful of civil lawsuits, some of which will continue to play out through November.\n\"We are getting a lot of data being shared with us to help us register and engage voters,\" an RNC member said.\nTrump has also used post-trial campaign stops to attract attention, including a Tuesday visit to a New York bodega. Trump at times tried to use the stop to focus on the rising cost of consumer goods and crime, which have been two policy themes of his presidential campaign, but the focus inevitably turned to his trial.\nTrump was asked what he thought about the seven jurors who had been selected as of Wednesday — the full 12-member jury was chosen Thursday — and he was blunt that the outcome would drive his assessment.\n'I'll let you know in about two months,' Trump said of the trial's likely timeline.\nMatt Dixon",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The policy contrasts between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are sharpening as the general election campaign gets fully underway.\nBut what does the choice represent for ordinary voters and the economic and cultural issues they care about? A rematch between the Democratic incumbent and his Republican predecessor may feel uninspiring to many voters, but the policy stakes are enormous for tens of millions of Americans — and the world.\nHere are seven big issues at stake in the 2024 election.\nAbortion The contrast: Biden favors federal abortion protections; Trump opposes them. Trump supported nationwide restrictions on abortion as president but now downplays the need for a federal ban, as Republicans are divided over the issue. Biden does not support federal limits.\nThe contrast: Biden favors federal abortion protections; Trump opposes them. Trump supported nationwide restrictions on abortion as president but now downplays the need for a federal ban, as Republicans are divided over the issue. Biden does not support federal limits. Biden has championed the Women's Health Protection Act, a bill to protect abortion rights in all 50 states under federal law and prohibit medically unnecessary hurdles to accessing the procedure. He has asked voters to send him a Democratic Congress that supports legal abortion to achieve that.\nTrump has boasted that he \"broke Roe v. Wade\" by picking three of the five Supreme Court justices who overturned it, delivering on a four-decade goal of the GOP. More recently, Trump has openly fretted that the backlash may cost him and his party the election. Last week, Trump said the issue should be left to states, a shift from his support for nationwide restrictions when he was president. His new stance has drawn pushback from GOP allies, like Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and anti-abortion-rights advocates, who say that he is wrong and that Republicans should not be deterred from their long-standing goal of enacting some nationwide abortion limits.\nSome Republicans downplay the prospects of federal abortion restrictions' passing Congress, even if they win full control. Biden and his allies are telling voters to look at the GOP's long history of championing federal restrictions and not their recent rhetoric.\nImmigration The contrast: Trump has promised a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration and tougher executive actions; Biden is asking Congress to give him more tools to manage an overwhelmed border and create new legal pathways to immigrate to the U.S.\nThe contrast: Trump has promised a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration and tougher executive actions; Biden is asking Congress to give him more tools to manage an overwhelmed border and create new legal pathways to immigrate to the U.S. Trump has called existing border laws an existential threat to the U.S., saying migrants are 'poisoning the blood of our country' and bringing new 'languages.' His campaign website says: 'President Trump will shut down Biden's border disaster. He will again end catch-and-release, restore Remain in Mexico, and eliminate asylum fraud. In cooperative states, President Trump will deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement to assist with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals.'\nAfter having rescinded some of Trump's policies, Biden has recently shifted to support stricter immigration laws as the system remains overwhelmed. He championed a bipartisan bill to raise the bar for gaining asylum, grant more U.S. resources to process asylum claims and turn away migrants who do not qualify, and empower the president to temporarily shut down the border if migration levels hit certain triggers. (Republicans blocked the bill in the Senate amid lobbying by Trump, who wants to use the border as an election issue.) Biden has also endorsed the U.S. Citizenship Act, which would grant a pathway to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally if they pass background checks and pay their taxes.\nFundamentally, Trump has aligned with forces who want less immigration into the country, while Biden has embraced the belief that immigrants make the U.S. better.\nHealth care and prescription drugs The contrast: Biden wants to extend Affordable Care Act provisions and empower Medicare to negotiate more prescription drugs; Trump has aggressively criticized the ACA but not offered a health care plan.\nThe contrast: Biden wants to extend Affordable Care Act provisions and empower Medicare to negotiate more prescription drugs; Trump has aggressively criticized the ACA but not offered a health care plan. Biden, who was vice president when the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, sees it as a cherished achievement to protect and strengthen. The law, also known as \"Obamacare,\" which has extended coverage to 45 million people through subsidies, insurance mandates and a Medicaid expansion, continues to face conservative opposition.\nSeparately, Biden has touted a provision in his party-line Inflation Reduction Act that empowers Medicare to negotiate lower prices for 10 prescription drugs. He said he wants to boost that to 50 if he is re-elected, with the goal of $200 billion in savings.\nTrump spent his four years as president fighting unsuccessfully to repeal and unravel the law — through legislation and executive action and endorsing lawsuits to wipe it out. In November, Trump called for revisiting plans to \"terminate\" the ACA. He has recently sought to downplay that and insists he only wants to improve the law. But he has not offered a health care plan. Many of his GOP allies in Congress still favor repealing or undoing the ACA, including a budget by the Republican Study Committee, which boasts about 80% of the House GOP conference as members, including Speaker Mike Johnson, of Louisiana.\nTaxes The contrast: Trump's 2017 tax cuts expire at the end of next year, and he has called for extending them; Biden has called for raising taxes on families earning over $400,000 to fund various priorities.\nThe contrast: Trump's 2017 tax cuts expire at the end of next year, and he has called for extending them; Biden has called for raising taxes on families earning over $400,000 to fund various priorities. A series of Trump tax cuts, which Republicans passed on a party-line basis in 2017, expire at the end of 2025. Congress and the winner of the election will decide what happens to them.\nIn a recent private speech to wealthy donors, Trump said his policies include \"extending the Trump tax cuts\" if he is elected, according to a Trump campaign official. That would preserve lower rates across the income spectrum, with the biggest benefits for top earners.\nBiden has attacked that law as a giveaway to the wealthiest Americans, vowing to make \"big corporations and the very wealthy finally pay their fair share.\" He has backed a corporate tax rate hike from 21% to 28% and said that \"nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny in federal taxes.\" Biden is also calling for a $3,600-per-child tax cut for families, an $800 average tax break for \"front-line workers\" and a 25% minimum tax on billionaires, according to a newly released campaign plank.\nThe expiration of the Trump tax cuts will restore the unlimited federal deduction for state and local taxes, which Republicans had capped at $10,000 in the 2017 law. Republicans broadly support preserving the cap, with some exceptions, while most Democrats want to lift it.\nJudges and the Supreme Court The contrast: Their track records tell a clear story. Trump has picked young conservative judges to serve on the federal bench, while Biden has picked liberals with a focus on professional and personal diversity.\nThe contrast: Their track records tell a clear story. Trump has picked young conservative judges to serve on the federal bench, while Biden has picked liberals with a focus on professional and personal diversity. One of the clearest contrasts is what kinds of judges Trump and Biden would pick for lifetime appointments on the federal courts. A simple way for voters to think about it is whether they prefer new judges with the conservative views of Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump's first Supreme Court pick, or with the liberal views of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, Biden's (so far only) high court pick.\nAs president, Trump nominated young conservative judges who will serve for generations. Biden has focused on finding judges with diverse backgrounds and résumés, including more civil rights lawyers and public defenders.\nPerhaps the biggest question is whether a Supreme Court vacancy will open up in the next four years. The presidential election winner and the party that controls the Senate would fill it.\nTrade The contrast: Trump is pushing a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports; Biden's White House opposes that, saying it would raise inflation.\nThe contrast: Trump is pushing a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports; Biden's White House opposes that, saying it would raise inflation. Trump, long a skeptic of U.S. trade deals, has proposed to impose a 10% tariff on all imported goods if he returns to the White House. He recently told Fox News that it could be 60% — or potentially 'more than that' — on imports of Chinese goods.\nBiden opposes that idea. In a memo over the weekend, the White House slammed the idea of \"across-the-board tariffs that would raise taxes and prices by $1,500 per American family,\" without naming Trump; it referred to an estimate by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, that Trump's 10% tax on imports could cost an average American household $1,500 per year.\nBiden, instead, has sought to boost domestic manufacturing with major federal investments in semiconductors and electric vehicles.\nForeign policy and NATO The contrast: Biden favors Ukraine aid, while Trump is skeptical of it; Biden supports NATO and a traditional view of American power, while Trump has criticized NATO and voiced some isolationist views.\nThe contrast: Biden favors Ukraine aid, while Trump is skeptical of it; Biden supports NATO and a traditional view of American power, while Trump has criticized NATO and voiced some isolationist views. The clearest example of the foreign policy differences between the two concerns the fate of Ukraine, which is running low on ammunition and says it needs U.S. assistance to continue holding off Russia's aggression. Biden is an ardent proponent of helping Ukraine, while Trump has poured cold water on U.S. aid to Ukraine and successfully pressured House Republicans to block it since they took the majority in January 2023.\nAnd that points to a deeper divide: Biden is an outspoken supporter of the NATO alliance as a bulwark against adversaries like Russia and China and of preserving the post-World War II order. Trump has dialed up his criticisms of NATO and aligned with a growing isolationist wing in the U.S. that wants to be less involved in global affairs. Trump recently said that as president, he 'would encourage' Russia 'to do whatever the hell they want' to member countries who are 'delinquent' in their dues.\nSahil Kapur",

            "summary": "Donald Trump — now a former president on trial — has sought to turn his legal peril into a boost for his presidential campaign, animating his supporters and attempting to sow doubt about the motives of his opponents.\nBut facing 34 counts of felony charges, Trump argued on the historic first day of his New York hush money trial that he is the victim of a criminal justice system weaponized against him.\nHe called it 'an assault' on the nation. And as the presumptive Republican nominee for president, repeatedly attacked the prosecution for waging \"election interference.\"\nIt is 'why I'm very proud to be here,' Trump said.\nThe former president intends to be involved at every level, to the extent possible, from court conferences to the jury selection process, his defense attorney Todd Blanche said.\n'President Trump wants to be present at everything,' said Blanche.\nFor much of the day, Trump was seated at the defense table flanked by his attorneys. At times, his voice could be heard in the back of the courtroom, though not what he was saying. Other moments saw Trump shut his eyes — drawing speculation about whether he was still awake, or lost in thought.\nHere is what happened during Monday's proceedings:\nJury selection About 500 New Yorkers arrived for day one of Trump's criminal trial over hush money payments for a process that will take days — and could take weeks — as the court works to weed out jurors who could be swayed by strong biases, or stealth jurors, who may be hiding theirs.\nQuestions like, 'Are you, or have you ever been a member of groups like the Oath Keepers, or ‘3 percenters,'' another far-right group, are used to narrow the pool. Other questions, say about a prospective juror's hobbies or educational background, are a less overtly political way to gauge a juror's potential fairness.\nBy the time the judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan, said he was ready to begin jury selection, about two hundred Manhattanites were in the courthouse waiting to find out if they would be selected.\nTrump was seated at the defense table as the first batch of 96 jurors were brought into the courtroom, filling the pews behind him. Their names, and those of any other prospective jurors, must be kept secret — except to the defense and prosecution.\nSpeaking to his lawyer, Trump gestured with his hands as Merchan discussed the handling of jury pool names. The defense and prosecution each received a copy of the potential jurors' names, which Merchan has said cannot in any way be duplicated and must be returned to the court. They also receive a copy of juror numbers.\nIt can be an intimidating process. More than half of prospective jurors from the first batch of 96 — at least 50 — were excused after saying they could not be fair and impartial. A further nine were excused when asked by the judge if there were other reasons for which they could not serve.\nHalf of the remaining pool of about 34, were called to start voir dire, where they would be queried by both parties, including on their media consumption habits. Trump appeared to track the process closely, reading along as it got underway.\nWitnesses Trump allegedly told his former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen to send porn star Stormy Daniels hush money during his run for president in 2016, a claim that is now at the center of the charges in this case. Prosecutors say this was part of a scheme to suppress negative stories about Trump in the lead-up to election day, which they argue should be charged as election interference.\nTrump has denied the charges, but prosecutors say he is going after those he claims are attacking him, including key witnesses in the case — and has made this a tactic.\n'The defendant himself has publicly embraced the public strategy of going after his perceived enemies,' prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said.\nDefending Trump, Blanche said the former president is the one facing attack by witnesses against him.\n'He is responding to salacious, repeated, vehement attacks by these witnesses,' Blanche said.\nInside the courtroom, large monitors showed a closed-circuit feed of the judge, defense and prosecution tables.\nIn court, Merchan read through a list of possible witnesses, name-checking members of Trump's family, including his children Donald Trump, Jr. and Ivanka Trump, wife Melania, and son-in-law Jared Kushner. The judge named longtime associates of Trump, such as Kellyanne Conway, Dan Scavino, and Rudy Giuliani, his bodyguard Keith Schiller, and White House aides John McEntee, Hope Hicks, and Madeleine Westerhout.\nThe risk of jail time Trump, who must be in the courtroom for every day of his criminal trial, has decried the case as a 'persecution like never before,' and on Monday while standing outside the courtroom argued that it constitutes 'an attack on a political opponent.'\nMerchan warned Trump that he risks jail time if he disrupts the trial, which will continue in his absence. Already, prosecutors are seeking to impose thousands of dollars in fines for three alleged violations of a gag order, including this morning.\nIf he fails to show up, a warrant could be issued for his arrest, an obligation that his campaign lambasted as 'Banana Republic tactics.'\nIt is a 'case that should never have been brought,' Trump said.\nThe trial could drag on for weeks, rerouting to New York a presidential campaign that otherwise could be making overtures to voters in some of the states Trump will need to win in November.\nHe resumed his criticism as the day came to a close, airing among his grievances a ruling by Merchan barring him from attending arguments at the Supreme Court on the question of whether he is entitled to presidential immunity, which he has raised in another of his criminal cases.\n'This is about election interference,' Trump said outside of the courtroom.\nHe lashed out on social media as well, posting articles on Truth Social that dismissed the case against him as 'politically driven' and reposting support from a range of defenders.\nLike in his other cases, Trump did not shy away from leveraging his latest legal entanglement for a campaign boost.\nA fundraising text message went out at the same time, thundering how he would 'never surrender.' Trump's fundraising has surged during moments of potential legal peril, delivering him a much-needed financial and messaging boost as he navigates the challenges of another White House run.\nOn the first day of his trial, Trump made the court case his pitch.\n'I JUST STORMED OUT OF COURT!' he hammered in the message. 'They think I'm finished but I'LL NEVER SURRENDER.'\nAdmissible or not? As prosecutors played evidence to the court that Trump's lawyers argued should not be admissible, Trump, seated at the defense table, watched along on a monitor. This included an excerpt from Trump's deposition in the E. Jean Carroll case where he defended his lewd comments in an \"Access Hollywood\" tape that surfaced in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, and remarks from a campaign rally late in that election cycle, where he showed concern over what he said were false accusations.\nJurors should know Trump's exact words, prosecutors argued. They also displayed tweets they said were evidence of Trump's pressure campaign on Cohen not to cooperate with prosecutors.\nMerchan reinforced a ruling that the \"Access Hollywood\" could not played to the jury — though it could be discussed — and barred prosecutors from introducing the deposition video about it.\nWhen prosecutors asked to introduce evidence about allegations of Trump's coordination with the National Enquirer to 'catch and kill' stories potentially devastating to his 2016 campaign, Trump's attorney dismissed it as a 'sideshow.' The judge ruled that it would be admissible.\nIn a win for the defense, Merchan denied a request by prosecutors to bring in other allegations against Trump of sexual assault. 'Complete hearsay,' he called them.\nMerchan gave Trump a twenty-four-hour deadline to enter final exhibits into evidence. 'You have 24 hours,' Merchan ordered. \"Whatever you don't identify in the next 24 hours, you will be precluded from using.'\nWhat's next? Merchan said he would wait to hear arguments next week on whether Trump violated his gag order by posting social media comments about witnesses in the case.\nLast week, Trump said he would \"absolutely\" testify in the trial, and tomorrow, the judge will conduct a hearing designed to ensure that this decision is well-informed. Known as a Sandoval hearing, it will delve into what could come up under cross-examination when Trump is on the witness stand.\nMerchan rejected a request that Trump be excused next Thursday in order to attend the Supreme Court's arguments on the immunity claim.\nIn another of his cases, Trump has argued to push back two filing deadlines on the basis that his attorneys will be overloaded with the New York trial over the coming six weeks. The request shows how the trial has become the latest opportunity for Trump's team to stall forward momentum on the legal charges against him.\nKatherine Doyle",

            "excerpt": "Trump is taking aim at Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as several recent polls show he may have more to lose from the independent's presence on the ballot.",
            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he's confident that independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will pull more votes away from President Joe Biden than from him — a net win for the Republican's candidacy.\n'He is Crooked Joe Biden's Political Opponent, not mine,' Trump wrote on Truth Social late last month. 'I love that he is running!'\nBehind closed doors, however, Trump is less sure. A Republican who was in the room with Trump earlier this year as the former president reviewed polling said Trump was unsure of how Kennedy would impact the race, asking the other people on hand whether or not Kennedy was actually good for his candidacy.\nAnd after mostly ignoring Kennedy early in his campaign, Trump has stepped up his efforts to brand the independent candidate as left-wing and make him Biden's problem, suggesting that he and allies are concerned about Kennedy's ability to attract Republican voters. In the same post in which he called Kennedy Biden's political opponent, Trump called Kennedy 'the most Radical Left Candidate in the race, by far,' someone who was 'a big fan of the Green New Scam' and 'other economy killing disasters.'\nIn a video monologue he posted to his social media page this month, Trump described Kennedy as being to Biden's left but said Kennedy has 'got some nice things about him' and 'I happen to like him.'\n'If I were a Democrat, I'd vote for RFK Jr. every single time over Biden because he's frankly more in line with Democrats,' Trump said, adding, 'I do believe that RFK Jr. will do very well. And I do believe he's going to take a lot of votes away from crooked Joe Biden.'\nTrump's increased focus on Kennedy comes as Democrats have increased their attention on third-party contenders, standing up super PACs and other anti-spoiler efforts meant to kneecap independent challengers who could pull from Biden and reduce the vote share Trump needs to get over the top this fall. And in defiance of earlier conventional wisdom about the 2024 race, new polling shows that right now Trump might have the most to lose with Kennedy on the ballot.\nAn NBC News national poll released Sunday found that Kennedy cut deeper into Trump's support than Biden's. The survey found that 15% of voters who picked Trump in a head-to-head matchup with Biden switched to choose Kennedy in a five-way ballot test, while just 7% of those who initially selected Biden in the head-to-head switched to Kennedy when third-party candidates were added.\nThat trend meant Trump went from leading Biden by 2 percentage points in a head-to-head survey to trailing him by 2 points when the race is expanded to five named candidates, including Kennedy. The survey's margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\nRepublican voters view Kennedy much more favorably than Democrats. The poll found that 40% of self-identified Republicans viewed Kennedy favorably, while 15% held negative views of the independent candidate. For Democrats, just 16% had positive views of Kennedy, while 53% expressed a negative view of him.\nThat's in part the result of conservative media and Trump allies heaping praise on Kennedy when he was initially running in the Democratic primary against Biden, as well as prior to this election cycle as Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, railed against the medical establishment and so-called social media 'censorship.'\nA Republican who worked on a door-knocking effort in an early state for a Trump primary opponent told NBC News that Kennedy often came up as the second choice among people who said they were backing Trump.\nA changing posture Trump himself has offered kind words for Kennedy in the past. During a June 2023 interview on the Howie Carr Show, Trump described Kennedy as 'a common sense guy.' Right-wing allies like Steve Bannon, Alex Jones and Roger Stone openly pined for Trump to pick Kennedy as his running mate.\nThe vibe is different now.\nThe pro-Trump PAC MAGA Inc. this month launched a 'Radical F---ing Kennedy' website dedicated to promoting the candidate's left-wing positions. Kennedy, meanwhile, has criticized Trump from the right, hitting him for taking advice from Dr. Anthony Fauci during the pandemic and for running up the deficit. He said another Trump term 'would be bad for the country.'\n'President Trump calls me an ultra-left radical,' Kennedy posted on X in response to the MAGA Inc. website. 'I'm soooo liberal that his emissaries asked me to be his VP. I respectfully declined the offer.' (Trump's campaign has denied that Kennedy was ever approached about being the former president's running mate.)\n'I am against President Trump, and President Biden can't win,' Kennedy's post continued. 'Judging by his new website, it looks like President Trump knows who actually can beat him.'\nOn the whole, there have been public surveys showing both major party candidates suffering more as a result of Kennedy's campaign. The dynamic also may change depending on which state is being surveyed — and which states feature Kennedy on the ballot in November, a battle that is still in progress.\n'Nobody has conducted more polls than I have on Kennedy and his place in the race — and continuously I have seen him draw equally from Biden and Trump,' said Jeremy Zogby, a managing partner at John Zogby Strategies who has polled for Kennedy's campaign. 'Sometimes a point or two towards one side in a poll, and vice versa in another poll. The fact remains Kennedy has crossover appeal among those disaffected within both parties,' like the 'double haters' who dislike both Biden and Trump.\nDemocrats have long worried that Kennedy's association with his famous father and uncles will win over some liberals who are fond of the family. Plus, Kennedy for years gained acclaim as an environmental activist and an anti-corporate crusader, two causes that have him finding common ground with Democratic voters.\nLast week, Biden held an event with Kennedy family members who touted the president and warned of the danger their relative's campaign posed. And on Monday, the Democratic National Committee announced it was launching billboards in Arizona depicting Kennedy as a pro-Trump spoiler candidate.\nA strategist working on the Democrats' anti-third party effort said the data shows Kennedy is clearly taking a slice from both major party candidates, as well as a portion of voters who wouldn't be open to voting for either Trump or Biden.\n'I think the data's moved a little bit over the last month-plus,' this person said. 'But it's all on the margins, it's tough to tell whether this is RFK appealing more to Trump voters, or some Trump voters just looking for an off-ramp, or both. Ditto on the Biden end — is this just reflecting the fact that Biden's ticked up a few points?'\nOne Trump ally said the presumptive GOP nominee should hold off on hitting Kennedy for now, arguing there will be time later this fall to go after him as 'too liberal for America' if these polling trends continue.\n'The second you start attacking him or even addressing him, you start giving credibility to and you start firming up those votes,' this person said, 'At the moment, he's irrelevant. As you get close and votes start hardening in terms of who people are voting for and when and why and how, then you've got to start making moves.'\nIn a statement, Trump's campaign railed against Kennedy's environmental positions and described him as 'no independent , ' while also hitting Democrats for challenging his efforts to get on the ballot.\n,' while also hitting Democrats for challenging his efforts to get on the ballot. 'RFK Jr. is an AOC lover and opposes really any human advancement, preferring that we all live in caves by candlelight, except of course supports charging stations for your $150,000 electric car that can only drive a few miles before dying just like his presidential campaign,' said Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director.\nTony Lyons, a co-founder of the pro-Kennedy super PAC American Values 2024 and the president of Skyhorse Publishing, said there will be a 'pendulum swinging back and forth' throughout the campaign that shows Kennedy at times being better for Trump and at other times boosting Biden's candidacy.\nLyons said Kennedy will soon be promoting a 30-minute infomercial posted online that aims to hit back on the attacks he's facing from his rivals.\n'The fascinating part of it is that Trump says he's ultra left-wing,' Lyons said. 'And Biden says that he's ultra right-wing.'\nAllan Smith Alex Seitz-Wald and Vaughn Hillyard contributed.",

            "summary": "More than a year after securing an indictment, New York prosecutors for the first time on Monday laid out their case against Donald Trump in a courtroom, weaving a story they say will prove the former president along with his \"fixer\" and a tabloid publisher conspired to cover up hush money payments.\n'This case is about a criminal conspiracy. Trump orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election,' said Matthew Colangelo, a lawyer from Alvin Bragg's office. 'Then he covered up that criminal scheme by lying in his New York business records over and over and over again.'\nThe prosecution detailed allegations of a sensational tabloid scheme to 'catch and kill' stories that could prove damaging to Trump, a plan, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said, was elicited with Trump's blessing and implicated him directly.\n'You'll hear defendant's own voice on a tape,' said Colangelo said.\nHere is what else you missed on the fifth day of trial:\nThe 'Access Hollywood' tape emerges in trial Prosecutors have argued that when the so-called \"Access Hollywood\" surfaced during the 2016 campaign, it triggered the worry that led Trump and his allies to try to keep Stormy Daniels quiet, setting off the hush money payments.\nJudge Juan Merchan has said that prosecutors can't play the tape for jurors, but that government lawyers could read from the transcript. And before opening statements were over, prosecutors did just that.\nColangelo quoted the tape to the jury, including Trump's words that, 'I just start kissing them … when you're a star, they let you do anything.'\nAssistant District Attorney Matthew Colangelo, right, speaks as Trump and his attorney Todd Blanche look on Monday. Jane Rosenberg / Reuters Colangelo detailed for the jury how allies of Trump's began to withdraw their endorsements, 'The impact of that video on the campaign was immediate and explosive,' he said.\nAt the defense table, Trump sat slumped.\nTrump faces a full jury After four days of jury selection, for the first time on Monday morning, Trump sat with a full panel of jurors watching him — 12 jurors and 6 alternates.\nMerchan jurors that they must guard carefully against outside bias as they listen to evidence in the case. While jurors may tell their employers that they are among the small group of New Yorkers who will judge Trump, they must not talk about it. Instead, as they listen to the evidence and render a verdict, they must avoid all news related to the case and not research the details or anyone involved.\n'Our laws do not permit jurors to speak to anyone else about the case,' Merchan said. 'Only you have been found to be fair.'\nThe day opened with one juror concerned about media attention from the trial, echoing the challenge last week of seating a jury in a densely populated city where Trump has loomed large for decades, and whose celebrity long predated his insurgent 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe jurors are presiding over a historic case, but none can escape the workaday nature of a trial made up of ordinary Manhattanites, with their own obligations. On Monday the trial adjourned earlier than expected to allow a juror with toothache to attend an emergency dental appointment.\nA decision on possible Trump cross-examination Trump slumped in his chair slightly with his eyes closed as Merchan read his ruling on allowing prosecutors to draw facts from prior cases should the former president testify.\nAfter hearing six different proceedings involving 13 different determinations brought by the prosecution, Merchan said he had 'greatly curtailed' the prosecution's ability to elicit evidence, including ruling out two full prior cases. But he warned Trump: 'This Sandoval ruling is a shield and not a sword.'\nTrump appeared disinterested.\nProsecution opens alleging Trump tried to 'cook the books' Before a rapt jury, the prosecution detailed the explosive allegations against Trump, including saying they will show that the former president discussed the importance of paying cash.\nTrump worked with attorney Michael Cohen, who will testify, to 'cook the books' in order to bury a story potentially devastating to his campaign and the 'porn star payoff' that made it go away, the prosecution alleged.\n'It was election fraud, pure and simple,' Colangelo said, explaining that the Trump Organization could not cut Cohen a check with the memo: 'Reimbursement for porn star payoff.'\nHe promised jurors would see evidence of how concerned Trump's campaign was by the story of an affair between Trump and Daniels.\nHe also revealed how a source for a story the National Enquirer suppressed texted its publisher on Election Night, 'What have we done?'\nThat publisher, David Pecker, began testifying on Monday and is expected to return to the stand to say that Trump met with him after the election to thank him for being the campaign's 'eyes and ears,' scooping up information that could prove harmful to Trump and reporting it back to Cohen.\nWhen Pecker walked into the courtroom, Trump craned his neck, fixing his eyes on the publisher. He took notes with attorney Todd Blanche as Pecker explained the so-called 'checkbook journalism' of his publications, where he doled out thousands of dollars in exchange for stories.\nTrump's defense: Poke holes Blanche didn't waste time trying to tell a story like the prosecutors did. Instead, he went straight to trying to tear apart the story.\n'The story you just heard, you will learn, is not true,\" Blanche said.\nDefending Trump, Blanche attacked the evidence as nearly a decade old, part of an effort to poke holes in the allegations against Trump.\n'There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy,' Blanche argued in the defense's opening statements and called 'perfectly legal' the usage of non-disclosure agreements.\nDaniels, he said, had waged an attempt to 'extort' money from Trump — a point that drew an objection from prosecutors — and Cohen, now a disgruntled former employee, was waging a vendetta against his client.\nto 'extort' money from Trump — a point that drew an objection from prosecutors — and Cohen, now a disgruntled former employee, was waging a vendetta against his client. 'You will learn, ladies and gentlemen, that Michael Cohen has pled guilty to lying under oath,' Blanche said.\nBlanche had painted a picture of the 'larger than life' former president, telling jurors how 'he's also a husband, a man, a father.'\n'A man just like me,' he said, as Trump watched his defense attorney intently.\nAs a full panel of jurors faced Trump for the first time this morning, Merchan pointedly emphasized how the burden of proof in the case 'never shifts' to the defendant. The prosecution must make its case 'beyond reasonable doubt, not beyond all possible doubt,' he said.\nKatherine Doyle Lisa Rubin, Jonathan Allen, Adam Reiss, Katie S.

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump might be able to declare victory in his upcoming Supreme Court case on presidential immunity even if the justices reject his most extreme arguments.\nAt issue in the high-stakes showdown Thursday is whether Trump's criminal charges over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election results should be dismissed based on a broad claim of immunity.\nEven if the court rejects that bold argument, it could still send the case back to Washington-based U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan for more proceedings on whether some of Trump's actions are insulated from prosecution.\nWith the case, initially scheduled for trial in March, already plagued by delays, such a ruling would further imperil the chances of any trial being concluded before November's election.\n\"Trump's first preference would be a ruling that he is immune, but a second preference would be a ruling that there is some kind of complicated factual test for immunity so it has to be remanded,\" said Richard Bernstein, a lawyer who filed a friend-of-the-court brief opposing Trump on behalf of former government officials.\nIn that scenario, \"the case would get bogged down\" on questions about to what extent each of the four counts in the indictment rest on official acts of the then-president, which might be protected, he added.\nThe case in Washington, separate from the ongoing criminal trial in New York, concerns Trump's involvement in a scheme to submit fake election certificates to Congress in the hope that it would nullify Joe Biden's victory, a chain of events that led to the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.\nProsecutors led by special counsel Jack Smith say those acts constituted a series of crimes. Trump says he was merely expressing his concerns, which were not based on any evidence, that the election was plagued with fraud.\nThe four charges he faces are: conspiracy to defraud the United States, obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy to violate the right to vote and have one's vote counted.\nThe question of whether the obstruction charge can be used to prosecute people involved in the Jan. 6 riot is the subject of another Supreme Court case argued last week.\nThe legal issues in the election interference case have sometimes served as a sideshow to the issue of timing, with Trump opponents hoping that a trial could take place before the election in the belief that a guilty verdict could affect the 2024 general election, in which Trump once again faces off against Biden.\nSome legal commentators say Trump has in many ways already won by persuading the Supreme Court not to intervene in the case at an earlier stage, making it less likely that a trial can take place before the election even if the immunity claim is outright rejected. The court also dithered when deciding how to frame the legal question when it ultimately took up Trump's appeal.\nThe Supreme Court's handling of the case so far might suggest it will fall short of a sweeping ruling against Trump as some have predicted, legal experts say.\nThe court might think that there are some official duties that do merit immunity but leave it to a trial court to figure out how that applies to Trump's case, according to Randall Eliason, a former federal prosecutor who teaches at the George Washington University Law School.\n\"The reason they took the case is because they want to write something more nuanced that accepts there may be immunity in some circumstances,\" he added.\nSmith has argued in court papers that Trump has no immunity and that the case should go immediately to trial.\nBut in his latest brief, Smith offered his views on what the court should do if it thinks that there is some form of immunity for official acts.\nIn that scenario, the trial should still go ahead, he argued, because the charges in the indictment also include \"private conduct\" that has nothing to do with Trump's official duties.\nIf there are concerns about actions that should be subject to immunity being used as evidence against Trump, the trial court could weigh whether that evidence should be excluded, Smith argued.\n\"The district court can make evidentiary rulings and craft appropriate jury instructions for trial clarifying that petitioner may be held criminally liable based only on the private conduct alleged in the indictment,\" Smith wrote.\nThe prosecution's theory of the case is that any use of official presidential power \"was merely an additional means of achieving a private aim\" — remaining in office after losing an election.\nSmith cited, among other things, Trump's coordination with private lawyers in forming the scheme to submit false alternative election certifications to Congress in the hope that then-Vice President Mike Pence would refuse to certify Biden's victory.\nSmith also argued that, at a minimum, some evidence arising from official duties could be used at trial in order to show Trump's \"knowledge or notice of the falsity of his election-fraud claims.\"\nTrump's own brief calls for sweeping immunity, seeking an extension of a 1982 Supreme Court ruling called Nixon v. Fitzgerald that said presidents cannot be sued for conduct within the \"outer perimeter\" of their official duties. That was a civil case and has never been applied in the criminal context.\nThe possibility of a remand is also addressed in Trump's brief, with his lawyers appearing to envisage a pretrial proceeding that would include detailed consideration of whether his conduct constituted protected official acts.\nThey cite an appeals court ruling that allowed civil claims to move ahead against Trump over his involvement in Jan. 6. That court rejected Trump's broad immunity argument, but said he could raise the issue again later in the litigation.\nTrump could also seek to appeal any adverse ruling in a pretrial proceeding, although, depending on how the process works, he might have to wait until after trial.\nOpinions vary on how much more time, from days to weeks, additional litigation on immunity could add before a trial commences.\n\"How much delay that causes is a real open question,\" said Matthew Seligman, another lawyer who filed a brief backing prosecutors.\nChutkan, who put the case on hold while Trump appealed the immunity issue, has previously indicated that a trial could start three months after she gets the case back following a Supreme Court ruling.\nIf that ruling comes at the end of June, when the Supreme Court typically issues decisions in its most consequential cases before breaking for the summer, that would lead to a trial starting no earlier than the end of September. The trial could last up to 12 weeks.\nA trial before the election is \"still theoretically possible,\" Eliason said, but \"the window is closing.\"\nLawrence Hurley",

He said, 'No.' He wouldn't do it. Because they were all 'suckers' and 'losers,'' Biden told a crowd of union workers. 'I'm not making that up. The staff who were with him acknowledge it today.

Beau Biden and Ambrose Finnegan both served in the military before Trump took office.\nmy son, my uncle.' Beau Biden and Ambrose Finnegan both served in the military before Trump took office. Biden's comments were in reference to Trump's 2018 trip to Paris for the centennial anniversary of the end of World War I where he declined to visit the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and reportedly called Marines who died at Belleau Wood 'suckers' and fallen soldiers at the U.S. cemetery 'losers.'\nFormer White House chief of staff John Kelly confirmed last year that Trump privately made the remarks first reported by The Atlantic.\nBiden has often cited Trump's 2018 remarks, but Wednesday was the first time he tied them directly to his son and uncle.\nOn Tuesday, Biden called Trump's remarks 'offensive' during a campaign rally in his childhood hometown of Scranton, Pa., displaying a sense of anger at the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\n'He said that those soldiers who gave their lives were...'suckers' and 'losers,'\" Biden said. \"Who the hell does he think he is?\"\n\"These soldiers are heroes, just as every American who served this nation,' Biden said to loud applause.\nThe president, who was in Pittsburgh for the second stop of a three-city tour of Pennsylvania, said he was reminded of Trump's comments about service members while visiting a war memorial in Scranton.\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\nElyse Perlmutter-Gumbiner Ghael Fobes",

            "summary": "New York Attorney General Letitia James on Friday asked that a judge void former President Donald Trump's bond in his civil fraud case, questioning whether the company that issued it has the funds to back it up.\nIn a 26-page filing ahead of a pre-scheduled hearing on Monday, James expressed concern about whether Knight Specialty Insurance Company could secure the $175 million bond. She also argued that the collateral put up by the former president should be under the full control of the company.\nOne of James' concerns about KSIC is that the insurer \"is not authorized to write business in New York and thus not regulated by the state's insurance department.\" She added that the company \"had never before written a surety bond in New York or in the prior two years in any other jurisdiction, and has a total policyholder surplus of just $138 million.\"\nJames also criticized Trump's team's apparent hold on the collateral put up to back the bond.\n\"KSIC does not now have an exclusive right to control the account and will not obtain such control unless and until it exercises a right to do so on two days' notice ,\" she wrote.\non two days' notice ,\" she wrote. Neither Trump's lawyers nor KSIC immediately responded to a request for comment.\nTrump attorney Alina Habba previously said when the former president's bond was posted that he \"looks forward to vindicating his rights on appeal and overturning this unjust verdict.\"\nThe new filing comes after James filed a notice earlier this month seeking more information about the former president's bond. In that filing, she asked that Trump's lawyers or the insurance company \"file a motion to justify the surety bond\" or provide additional information about the collateral put up by Trump within 10 days.\nThe bond for Trump and his co-defendants was reduced by a state appeals court to $175 million in March, down from $464 million. Trump had been liable for $454 million, the vast majority of the original sum. The former president has repeatedly slammed the case against him and denied any wrongdoing.\nJames' filing comes as Trump was in the courtroom for his New York criminal hush money case where he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records and as a state appeals court judge rejected Trump's request for a emergency stay of the trial. A jury has been seated in that case and arguments are set to begin on Monday. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all counts.\nAdam Reiss Megan Lebowitz",

            "excerpt": "The proceedings mark the first time a former president has stood trial on criminal charges. Trump is facing 34 counts of felony falsification of business records.",
            "summary": "Donald Trump will make history Monday as the first former president to stand trial on criminal charges, a watershed moment for American politics, the presidential election and Trump himself.\nTrump — the presumptive Republican nominee for president — is required to be present for the entire trial, which could last as long as eight weeks. He's pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records, a low-level felony punishable by up to four years in prison. The trial kicks off Monday with jury selection.\nThe charges relate to Trump's first run for president, in 2016. Prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office allege he took part in a scheme with his then-lawyer Michael Cohen and the publisher of the National Enquirer to suppress scandalous stories about him in the run-up to Election Day.\nOne of those stories involved porn star Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. Trump has denied the claim, and Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 in October 2016 to keep quiet about the allegation. After he was elected, Trump repaid Cohen in payments recorded as legal fees at his company —documents the DA alleges were falsified to keep the hush money payments secret.\nTrump has maintained he didn't do anything wrong and derided the case as being part of a politically motivated 'witch hunt' against him, a claim he's used to galvanize his supporters and rake in millions of dollars in fundraising for his campaign.\nThe criminal case was the first of four brought against Trump in four different jurisdictions and is the only case definitively set to go to trial before the election.\nBecause Trump is required to be in court four days a week (the trial does not take place on Wednesdays), his ability to campaign in person is limited to times the court is not in session. But as he did during his previous New York trials, Trump is likely to speak publicly during breaks and after court adjourns for the day.\nThe start of the trial comes despite numerous last-ditch efforts by Trump to delay it, including by filing appeals accusing Judge Juan Merchan of having a conflict of interest because his daughter's media firm does work for Democratic candidates, arguing the judge's partial gag order against him is 'unconstitutional,' and claiming that it's impossible for him to get a fair trial in Manhattan given the huge amount of pretrial publicity surrounding the case.\nThe DA's office countered in a court filing that 'given the sheer size of New York County, it is absurd for [Trump] to assert that it will be impossible or even impractical to find a dozen fair and impartial jurors, plus alternates, among more than a million people.'\nThe jury selection process is expected to take one to two weeks. Two sources with direct knowledge of the situation told NBC News that 6,000 jurors have been called to the Manhattan criminal courts this week — 2,000 more than in a typical week.\nMerchan announced a methodical system of whittling down the large jury pool to 12 jurors and six alternates who can be 'fair and impartial' about the deeply polarizing Trump.\nEighteen jurors will be put in the jury box at a time and each one in succession will read out loud their answers to a series of 42 questions. The questions include inquiries about what news sources they follow, whether they've ever attended any Trump rallies or anti-Trump protests, and whether they've ever supported the QAnon movement or antifa.\nThe form does not ask about party affiliation, political contributions or voting history, but the judge said answers to those questions 'may easily be gleaned from the responses to other questions.' After the 42 questions are answered, prosecutors can ask the jurors a series of follow-up questions, and then Trump's attorneys can ask their own follow-ups.\nMerchan warned both sides 'not to seek to expand the degree of intrusion beyond what is relevant and has already been approved,' and rejected a request from Trump's attorneys that jurors be asked whether they 'like' the former president.\n'Such questions are irrelevant because they do not go to the issue of the prospective juror's qualifications,' he wrote in an order made public on April 8. 'The ultimate issue is whether the prospective juror can ensure us that they will set aside any personal feelings or biases and render a decision that is based on the evidence and the law,' the order said.\nThe trial will have an anonymous jury, meaning the jurors' identities and addresses will not be made public. The judge said the move was necessary because of 'a likelihood of bribery, jury tampering, or of physical injury or harassment of juror(s).'\nWhile the trial is the first criminal trial involving a former president, it's the fourth trial in New York involving Trump as a defendant since he left office. He was sued twice by writer E. Jean Carroll for sexual abuse and defamation and he and his company were accused of fraud in a civil case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. The verdicts against him in the three cases — all of which he is appealing — total about $550 million.\nAdam Reiss Dareh Gregorian Zoë Richards contributed.",

            "summary": "Prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office said in a court filing Wednesday that they plan to ask Donald Trump about the costly verdicts and findings of wrongdoing in his numerous civil cases if the former president decides to testify in the criminal case against him — though the permissibility of that line of questioning remains to be seen.\nThe prosecutors said they intend to ask Trump about the judgment in state Attorney General Letitia James' civil fraud suit against him and his company, as well as a pair of verdicts in lawsuits brought against him by writer E. Jean Carroll. The judgments in the three cases total almost $550 million and include findings that Trump committed fraud in the AG's case and that he's liable for sexual abuse and defamation in the Carroll case.\nDistrict Attorney Alvin Bragg's office also plans to mention findings by the judge in the civil fraud case that Trump violated a gag order and \"testified untruthfully under oath\" during the trial.\nThey said they want to be able to bring up those findings — which Trump is appealing — in order \"to impeach the credibility of the defendant\" if he takes the witness stand.\nTrump said last week he \"absolutely\" plans to testify but is under no obligation to do so.\nIf he does take the stand, prosecutors would also like to ask him about the verdict in the DA's successful criminal tax fraud prosecution of the Trump Organization, and a settlement his Trump Foundation struck with the AG's office back in 2019. A federal judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million in damages in that case after the foundation admitted in a settlement that Trump had misused foundation funds to help his 2016 presidential campaign, settle personal legal disputes and buy portraits of himself.\nThey also want Judge Juan Merchan to allow them to ask about a Trump lawsuit against Hillary Clinton and others that resulted in the former president and one of his lawyers being sanctioned and ordered to pay $937,989 in fees for filing a frivolous, bad-faith lawsuit. The judge in that case handed down the penalty after finding that \"Mr. Trump is a prolific and sophisticated litigant who is repeatedly using the courts to seek revenge on political adversaries. He is the mastermind of strategic abuse of the judicial process, and he cannot be seen as a litigant blindly following the advice of a lawyer. He knew full well the impact of his actions.\"\nProsecutors made the disclosure ahead of a type of hearing called a Sandoval hearing, which is tentatively scheduled to take place on Friday. Sandoval hearings are designed to allow defendants to make an informed decision on whether to testify by providing a pre-trial determination on the permissible scope of cross-examination by prosecutors.\nTrump's attorneys told the judge in a letter last month they'll argue the DA's office should be barred \"from asking about these items.\"\nThe trial, the first ever criminal trial against a former president, was off on Wednesday but resumes with jury selection on Thursday. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to a porn star during the closing days of the 2016 presidential election. He faces up to four years in prison if convicted.\nAdam Reiss Dareh Gregorian",

Let us know\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know It underscores an important point: Despite all of the news, developments and drama over the past year, the Biden-Trump contest has been remarkably stable — and competitive — with any movement coming within the margin of error.\nTake the two-way ballot test. Over the course of nearly a year, Trump's percentage has been stuck from 45% to 47% of registered voters. Biden's percentage, meanwhile, has hovered from a high of 49% in the summer of 2023 to a low of 42% this January.\nOr take the names at the top of the ticket out of the equation and note the stable congressional preference. Right now, 47% prefer a GOP-controlled Congress in the poll, compared to 46% who want Democrats. The parties have been locked in that competitive position for years: The GOP number hasn't moved more than 2 points in either direction in NBC News polling since August 2021, while the Democratic number dipped outside that range just once.\nBut the latest NBC News poll also points to at least three potential wild cards that could upend this stability.\nTrump's trial: While Trump's multiple criminal indictments and legal challenges helped him with Republican primary voters in 2023 and early 2024, the NBC poll finds 50% of voters saying he's being held to the same standard as anyone accused of such a crime, versus 43% who believe he's being unfairly targeted.\nTrump's trial: While Trump's multiple criminal indictments and legal challenges helped him with Republican primary voters in 2023 and early 2024, the NBC poll finds 50% of voters saying he's being held to the same standard as anyone accused of such a crime, versus 43% who believe he's being unfairly targeted. Third party-candidates: For months, the conventional wisdom has been that the bigger the size of the third-party vote, the worse it would be for Biden. And that could still be the case, given that Trump's consistent 46% to 47% vote share becomes a winning percentage if the third-party vote is greater than 6%. Yet the poll shows Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hurting Trump more than Biden at the moment.\nThird party-candidates: For months, the conventional wisdom has been that the bigger the size of the third-party vote, the worse it would be for Biden.

Kennedy Jr. hurting Trump more than Biden at the moment. Turnout: The level of high interest in this contest is at a nearly 20-year low, signaling that turnout in November could be significantly lower than it was in 2020. Does that lower turnout help Trump, given that more Republicans have high interest (70%) than Democrats do (65%)? Or does it help Biden, given that many of the voters who say they're supporting Trump ended up not participating in the 2020 or 2022 elections?\nTurnout: The level of high interest in this contest is at a nearly 20-year low, signaling that turnout in November could be significantly lower than it was in 2020.

These are all ways a stable race could quickly become unstable — and unpredictable.\nRead the full story here →\nTrump trial, day 5: The prosecutors lay out their case By Katherine Doyle More than a year after securing an indictment, New York prosecutors on Monday for the first time laid out their case against Donald Trump in a courtroom, weaving a story they say will prove that the former president, along with his 'fixer' and a tabloid publisher, conspired to cover up hush money payments.\n'This case is about a criminal conspiracy. Trump orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election,' said Matthew Colangelo, a lawyer with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office. 'Then he covered up that criminal scheme by lying in his New York business records over and over and over again.'\nThe prosecution detailed allegations of a sensational tabloid scheme to 'catch and kill' stories that could have proved damaging to Trump, a plan, the DA's office said, that was elicited with Trump's blessing and that he was directly implicated in.\nHere's what else happened on the fifth day of trial:\nThe ‘Access Hollywood' tape emerges: Prosecutors have argued that when the 'Access Hollywood' tape surfaced during the 2016 campaign, it triggered the worry that led Trump and his allies to try to keep Stormy Daniels quiet, setting off the hush money payments.\nThe ‘Access Hollywood' tape emerges: Prosecutors have argued that when the 'Access Hollywood' tape surfaced during the 2016 campaign, it triggered the worry that led Trump and his allies to try to keep Stormy Daniels quiet, setting off the hush money payments. Judge Juan Merchan has ruled that prosecutors can't play the tape for jurors, but that government lawyers can read from the transcript. And before opening statements were over, prosecutors did just that. Colangelo quoted the tape to the jury, including Trump saying: 'I just start kissing them … when you're a star, they let you do anything.'\nTrump faces a full jury for the first time: Merchan warned the full panel of 12 jurors and six alternates that they must guard carefully against outside bias as they listen to evidence in the case. While jurors may tell their employers that they are among the small group of New Yorkers who will judge Trump, they must not talk about it. Instead, as they listen to the evidence and render a verdict, they must avoid all news related to the case and not research the details or anyone involved.\nTrump faces a full jury for the first time: Merchan warned the full panel of 12 jurors and six alternates that they must guard carefully against outside bias as they listen to evidence in the case.

After hearing six different proceedings involving 13 different determinations brought by the prosecution, Merchan said he had 'greatly curtailed' the prosecution's ability to elicit evidence, including ruling out two full prior cases.\nRead more here →\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

            "excerpt": "The former president perked up at certain remarks by members of the jury pool, while at other times he appeared ambivalent and staring straight ahead.",
            "summary": "Jury selection in Donald Trump's hush money trial on Thursday revealed there are certain topics that are likely to capture the former president's attention: Miami, real estate and media.\nWhen one New Yorker talked about his decades in law enforcement, Trump raised his eyebrows. The juror, who said he holds Yankees season tickets, added that he reads the New York Post and Daily News. It was as if Trump, who moments earlier let out a yawn, was seized by an electrical current.\nLater, Trump straightened his back and cocked his chin as a young lawyer, born and raised in Miami, began running through her answers to the jury questionnaire. Asked if she had been the victim of a crime, the woman said her phone was stolen from her in Paris, and she noted that her family's car was 'incidentally burned in an arson in Italy.'\nAny reprieve Trump may have hoped for from the woman soon fell away as she talked about reading The Washington Post, a newspaper the former president has railed against. She said that while she harbors 'opinions' about Trump, she is 'very comfortable that I can put those aside.' The woman described watching Fox News occasionally 'just to try to see what's going on all sides.'\nTrump crossed his arms and glared at the space in front of him.\nBoth jurors were later dismissed.\nAt times, Trump craned his neck, particularly when potential jurors who said they didn't think they could be fair or impartial were exiting the courtroom.\nThat ended up being the fate of a former university administrator who recalled seeing Trump during a time when he was a developer and tabloid fixture, before he was elected president. The juror described once seeing Trump and his former wife Marla Maples 'shopping for baby things at ABC Home.' She said she had heard positive things about Trump, but added, 'how I feel about him as a president is different.'\nThe exchange illustrated the complexities of sitting a jury in Democratic-leaning Manhattan, where Trump faces a public largely averse to his behavior and politics.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him related to falsifying business records to allegedly cover up hush money payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the tail end of the 2016 presidential campaign.\nMostly, though, Trump appeared ambivalent, staring ahead during the voir dire on Thursday. He did not follow his legal team in turning around to face the potential jurors seated in the courtroom as they were introduced to the defense.\nHe yawned as the presiding judge, Juan Merchan, reached the end of reading jury instructions.\nThe lengthy process included two jurors being dismissed after having been seated.\nThe first, an oncology nurse, said she'd had second thoughts about her ability to be fair or impartial. The other, an IT consultant, returned for questioning and expressed 'annoyance' at how much information about him was already public.\nOne social media influencer said she was '[p]roud to be amongst' those who asked to be dismissed because of their strong views about Trump.\nThose who weren't immediately struck ticked through jury questionnaires with answers befitting a densely populated metropolis with some of the highest per capita income levels in the country.\nAn attorney who said she had discussed this case and its legal merits 'with many coworkers' was asked whether that would affect her ability to serve as fair and impartial. She responded with a sigh, saying that while she would put her legal training aside, 'it is hard to unring a bell.' She was not seated on the jury.\nStanding feet from Trump, others called him 'selfish and self-serving' and described themselves as 'allergic' to politics that 'gets personal and petty.'\nOne man said he was born and raised in Italy and then compared Trump to Silvio Berlusconi, the late prime minister of Italy and infamous womanizer who was convicted of tax fraud in 2013.\n'It would be a little hard for me to retain my impartiality and fairness,' the man said before being dismissed.\nLater, a self-described 'Bernie gal' apologized after she was asked to read aloud some of her social media posts attacking Trump during the 2016 campaign, a time when she said she was in a 'disturbed frame of mind.'\n'I do not hold those positions today,' she said.\n'Electoral politics can be pretty spicy, and Mr. Trump can be pretty spicy. And I feel that I owe him an apology for some of my language,' she said, before also being dismissed.\nRobert Hirschhorn, a jury consultant at Cathy E. Bennett & Associates, said the process was not unusual, with high-profile cases often drawing heavy scrutiny — including for the jurors themselves.\nIt is 'seven steps forward, two steps back,' Hirschhorn said, citing Murphy's Law.\n'If it can go wrong, it will go wrong,' he said.\nStill, he said he expected a fair and impartial jury to be empaneled by the end of jury selection.\nMerchan swore in the 12-person jury, plus an alternate, on Thursday. He is aiming to sit the other five alternates before the end of Friday.\nThe trial is expected to take as many as eight weeks, with Trump required to attend each day or face penalties.\nKatherine Doyle",

Trump is the majority stakeholder in the company.\nTrump Media, which created the Truth Social app and trades under the stock ticker DJT on the Nasdaq, fell nearly 20% last week.\nThe company's intent to issue more common stock was made public Monday morning in a 'preliminary prospectus' filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The shares cannot be issued until a registration statement with the SEC goes into effect.\nThe filing describes a plan to offer more than 21.4 million shares of common stock, issuable 'upon the exercise of warrants,' the filing shows. Stock warrants give their holder the ability to buy shares at a predetermined price within a certain time frame.\nTrump Media predicted in the filing that it will receive 'up to an aggregate of approximately $247.1 million from the exercise of the Warrants.'\nThe closing price of Trump Media's warrants was $13.69 as of Friday, according to the filing. The warrants are being traded on the Nasdaq under the ticker 'DJTWW.' That ticker was down more than 8% before the market opened Monday.\nThe company also seeks to offer the resale of up to 146.1 million shares of stock from 'selling securityholders,' 114.8 million of which are held by Trump himself. Trump owns 78.8 million shares of the company, and stands to obtain 36 million 'earnout shares' if the stock stays above a certain price for enough trading days.\nTrump's current stake in the company was worth more than $2.2 billion at Monday morning's share price. Trump is not allowed to sell his shares until a monthslong lockup period expires.\nTrump, whose social media following was massively diminished after he switched to Truth Social following his suspension from Twitter and Facebook in 2021, has tried to encourage his followers to flock to the fledgling app. But it is unclear if they have heeded Trump's call. The company has not publicly released key performance indicators, including the number of active Truth Social users.",

            "excerpt": "The South Carolina senator is working to make himself the face of the Black conservative movement as the GOP tries to make inroads with Black voters.",
            "summary": "Last July, a town hall attendee in Salem, New Hampshire, asked Sen. Tim Scott if he 'believed he could swing the historically Democratic-supporting African American community.' Scott's response was guarded.\n'Maybe,' the then-presidential candidate replied. 'I'm a fairly conservative candidate. That does not necessarily bode well for my ability to persuade die-hard Democrats, Black or white or any other color.'\nBut now, with Scott in the middle of speculation about former President Donald Trump's pick for a 2024 running mate, the South Carolina senator is leaning into his ability to engage with the growing number of Black voters that polling data suggest are open to voting for Trump in this election.\nScott has launched a weekly series, 'America's Starting Five,' with other Black Republicans in Congress, in a bid both to make Black conservatives more visible and to reach Black voters. The series, which will discuss ' politics, race, and the 2024 election' and which Scott hopes to continue at least through the summer, is also a vehicle for him to lean into a skill set that could be an asset for Trump: his perceived ability to expand the party's tent.\n' politics, race, and the 2024 election' and which Scott hopes to continue at least through the summer, is also a vehicle for him to lean into a skill set that could be an asset for Trump: his perceived ability to expand the party's tent. 'Sen. Scott recognizes that he can draw people into the party, particularly Black men,' said a source familiar with the planning of the series. 'This is an effort to highlight that.'\nA composite analysis of NBC polling data from 2023 found that among Black voters, men under 50 years old gave by far the lowest ratings to President Joe Biden — and the highest ones to Trump, though a majority still viewed Trump negatively.\nStill, almost 40% of those voters said they'd vote for Trump over Biden in a general election, compared to no more than 15% in any of the other age and gender categories among Black voters, a split well outside the margin of error for those subgroups.\nThat's largely what's behind other recent surveys showing Trump garnering more support from Black voters than ever, cutting into Biden by double digits compared to the 2020 results, even though the president still leads among Black voters.\nA shift in tone Scott's willingness to focus on his race is a departure from the early days of his presidential campaign, when he was at times hesitant to lean too deeply into his identity, even as supporters encouraged him to highlight a factor they believed made him the most electable 2024 presidential candidate on the GOP side.\n'Here are four non-Black, Black people,' Scott said while leading a roundtable discussion alongside four other prominent Black Republicans in the first episode of his new series: Reps. Burgess Owens of Utah, Byron Donalds of Florida, John James of Michigan and Wesley Hunt of Texas.\nThe panelists were taking their turns dissecting a past misstep by Biden, and the focus of the group had turned to a 2020 interview he did with radio host Charlamagne tha God, during which Biden suggested that Black Americans who don't vote for him 'ain't really Black.'\n'The good news is in 2024, it looks like four out of 10 of us ain't Black enough for Joe Biden,' Scott continued.\nAs Scott's presidential campaign went on last year before he dropped out in November, his tune began to shift. He became more vocal not only about his appeal to the small but growing number of Black conservatives nationwide, but also how he was uniquely positioned to help the party make more inroads with voters of color, as arguably the most prominent Black Republican elected official in the country.\n'I believe that I create a red wave where we win back the Senate, we expand our majority in the House, and you do that by having the kind of candidate who — the literal truth of my life — destroys the lies of the radical left and creates a red wave,' Scott said at one of his final campaign stops in October.\nThat 'red wave,' in his view, would be fueled in part by his life story: A Black man from South Carolina, raised by a single mother in a low-income neighborhood, who went from 'cotton to Congress' in a single generation, as he often riffed during his events.\n'I have lived a similar experience to people who find themselves trapped in poverty, who are today growing up in single parent households, who are wondering whether the American dream can work for them,' Scott said.\nA valuable surrogate Trump seems aware of Scott's potential and has certainly worked to keep his former primary opponent close.\nIn addition to appearing alongside Trump at several campaign rallies in the waning days of the Republican primary, Scott was invited by Trump to attend and speak at his Mar-a-Lago fundraiser last week, which the campaign said netted $50 million across groups including Trump's main super PAC and other fundraising committees.\nA day before the South Carolina Republican primary, Scott accompanied Trump to the Black Conservative Federation's annual gala, where Trump was the recipient of the 'Champion of Black America' award. Scott was the only former Trump rival to appear at the event.\nAnd Trump has repeatedly said that Scott is better at campaigning on his behalf than he was campaigning for himself.\nThe Biden-Harris campaign appears skeptical that Scott — or whoever Trump ultimately selects as a running mate — will be successful in recruiting more Black voters to the Republican Party.\n'Regardless of who Donald Trump's running mate is, these are the facts: While he was president, Black unemployment and uninsured rates spiked, his encouragement of white nationalism divided the nation, and his botched Covid-19 response disproportionately left Black people dead,' said Jasmine Harris, the Biden campaign's Black media director. 'Black voters remain some of the most informed and engaged voters every election, and this November they will get behind Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who put Black Americans at the forefront of their administration's work.'\nNnamdi Egwuonwu",

            "excerpt": "Analysis: Trump's lawyers battled over the 'minutia\" while supporters and detractors argued over the purpose of the trial.",
            "summary": "Inside a courthouse nestled between Tribeca and Chinatown on Monday morning, former President Donald Trump's lawyers argued with the district attorney's office over procedures for a hush-money case that could send an ex-commander in chief to prison for the first time in American history.\nJudge Juan Merchan advised lawyers that he was getting a little annoyed by the \"minutia.\" With a pool of 500 prospective jurors waiting, he wanted to get started with the process of picking 12.\nThe judge also delivered Trump his \"Parker warnings,\" including that he could be jailed for contempt if he is absent without leave at any point during the trial. Trump, betraying little emotion, said he understood.\nOutside, in a sun-filled park across the street, peculiarity reigned over pedantry.\nA smattering of pro-Trump demonstrators — some wearing costumes, others carrying signs, one temporarily lowering the top of her dinosaur-themed one-piece before writhing on the ground in performative ecstasy — lent their support to the former president and presumptive Republican nominee.\nThe presence of high-profile gawkers accentuated the carnival-like nature of the gathering: The Daily Show's Jordan Klepper, former Republican gubernatorial candidate Andrew Giuliani and filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, a daughter of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\"I never miss a freak show,\" the younger Pelosi, a longtime resident of nearby Greenwich Village, said.\nThe unlikely tandem of Klepper and Giuliani provided a clear window into a series of truths about this trial: the charges are at once the least consequential of the set pending against Trump and as fundamental to democracy as the question of whether special treatment — either targeting or protection — can be avoided in the case of such a powerful figure.\nSensing an opportunity, Giuliani, the son of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, agreed to talk on camera with Klepper, a master of man-on-the-street interviews that leave the subjects looking foolish. After all, the coin of the realm in Trump's domain is defending the big guy in tough, televised interviews.\nBut the younger Giuliani, a former Trump White House official in his own right, was worried enough about the outcome — and aware enough of the art of video editing — that he asked an associate to make his own recording of the full interview.\nAdditional cameras seldom provide additional protection, and this case was no exception. Pelosi couldn't help but watch the scene unfold.\nKlepper wasn't interested in the high-stakes trial inside. Many Democrats are more exercised about the other charges Trump faces — he's been indicted in federal and Georgia courts for efforts to overturn the 2020 election and in another federal court over allegations that he illegally retained classified documents.\nWhat Klepper wanted to know — with Andrew Giuliani amounting to a stand-in for his father — was whether Trump's rhetoric would lead to violence. The former president recently said in a fundraising email that \"all hell\" would break loose at his trial. Before the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, Trump told supporters \"if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.'\nAndrew Giuliani noted that the crowd outside the courthouse was definitively peaceful. Then, he went further.\n\"I was in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, as well,\" Andrew Giuliani said. \"I was with President Trump. I remember him talking about peacefully protesting.\"\nThat was the gotcha moment Klepper was waiting for.\n\"Some people were talking about peaceful protest,\" Klepper said. \"Some people also on Jan. 6 were talking about ‘trial by combat.' Do you know anybody who was talking about that?\"\nIt was Rudy Giuliani who had called for \"trial by combat\" at the Trump rally preceding the sacking of the Capitol. His son declined to identify him. The interview turned more, well, combative after that.\n\"Oh, funny guy,\" Andrew Giuliani said with disdain, \"let's get a brain in there.\"\nAlmost lost in the exchange was the message Andrew Giuliani wanted to deliver: that Democrats are trying to take Trump \"off the campaign trail,\" which amounts to \"the death of our Constitutional republic.\"\nLike most satire, Klepper's interview was revealing.\nIt served as a reminder that the hush-money trial has much less to do with whether Trump is fit to serve as president than the election-interference and classified-documents cases — even though it carries with it the grave potential consequence of a major-party nominee being convicted of a crime during the stretch run of a presidential campaign.\nconvicted of a crime during the stretch run of a presidential campaign. Trump's critics argue that his push to silence porn actress Stormy Daniels amounts to an illegal benefit to his own 2016 campaign. He should not be above the law, they contend, just as his allies argue he has been unjustly targeted for political purposes.\nThe spur-of-the-moment on-camera exchange between Andrew Giuliani and Klepper, two figures deeply engaged with American politics, also reflected and underscored the degree to which the right and left talk past each other.\nNeither suggested that the trial is important because it will determine whether Trump committed crimes.\nKlepper tried to sidestep that question. Andrew Giuliani used the trial as a foil for the argument that Trump is being persecuted.\nIt could be easy to forget, amid the onlookers, that the jurors will render a decision as simple and prosaic as whether one man broke the law by falsifying documents and as consequential as whether a former president, and current candidate, should be held accountable.\nRepublican strategist Matthew Bartlett, who was not at the trial, said the political landscape may not change based on the outcome.\n\"At the end of the day, I'm not sure this trial about a transaction from 2016 will have a superseding effect on what voters want for policy and a vision for the future of the country,\" he said.\nOutside the first day of the trial smacked of a Ringling Brothers production. Inside the courtroom, just across Centre Street, the solemn nature of the work ahead was evident.\nWhen the first group of 96 prospective jurors passed through metal detectors and into the courtroom around 2:30 p.m., filling every available seat, Trump twisted his neck to take a look. He later stood and turned to acknowledge them when he was named as the defendant.\nAt times during the lengthy proceedings, the former president suggested disinterest or exhaustion by closing his eyes.\nMost of the jurors sat quietly and expressionless. Merchan emphasized his desire to shield their identities from the public, going so far as to warn the rival legal teams not to reproduce lists of their names. More than half of them were dismissed when they raised their hands to say they could not be impartial in this trial.\nOne dismissed prospective juror was overheard in a hallway saying, \"I just couldn't do it.\"\nFinding 12 adults with no particular feelings about Donald J. Trump, and the will to sit through a multi-week trial, is no easy feat. That process will continue inside Merchan's court. For the rest of the world, the \"freak show\" rolls along on the outside.\nJonathan Allen",

            "summary": "No one will ever accuse former President Donald Trump of being woke. But over a few hours Monday, he transformed from a disinterested observer at his own hush-money trial — eyes shut at times — to a highly attentive defendant-in-chief.\nMaybe it was the chance to stare the full jury in the eyes, which he did when they sat in their box — against the wall to his right — and when they entered and exited the courtroom. Perhaps it was onetime ally and alleged co-conspirator David Pecker testifying against him from a dozen or so feet away. Or, it could just have been that all the talk was finally about him — after jury selection and arguments on legal points last week.\nSitting in a wood-paneled courtroom seemingly designed to induce sleep — like a 1950s junior high school or any branch office of a state's Department of Motor Vehicles — Trump leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes at the start of the fifth day of his trial. But after Judge Juan Merchan dispensed with rote procedural matters, including a long set of instructions for jurors, Trump began to focus more intently on the other key players in the room.\nHe stared straight ahead during prosecutor Matthew Colangelo's opening statement, willfully refusing to look at an adversary who previewed the case for the jury. Trump conspired with one-time \"fixer\" Michael Cohen and former tabloid publisher David Pecker to stop pornographic-film actress Stormy Daniels from publicly accusing him of having an affair with her, Colangelo alleged.\n\"Then he covered up … that scheme by lying in his New York business records,' Colangelo said, adding that the full set of actions amounted to \"an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of a presidential election\" and \"conceal that illegal election fraud.'\nNo one could snooze through that.\nMerchan, chin between his thumb and forefinger, twisted his seat toward the jury box and shifted his gaze — ping-pong style — from jurors to prosecutor as he rocked back and forth lightly in his chair.\nTrump finally recast his eyes once Colangelo turned the floor over to defense lawyer Todd Blanche for his opening statement. Trump isn't just a former president or the Republican nominee for president in 2024, Blanche said as he aimed to frame his client as a peer of the jurors.\n'He's also a man,\" Blanche said. \"He's a husband. He's a father. He's a person, just like you and just like me.'\nAs his own lawyer spoke, it was unclear at times from the closed-circuit telecast inside the courtroom when Trump looked at jurors and when he looked at Blanche. The head-on frame of Trump didn't include the jury box. But viewed from behind, the shifting angle of his profile showed that he split time between focusing on the jury and on Blanche.\nFor most of the day, his mouth was drawn in a familiar and serious expression that betrayed no emotion, even as his lawyer began to tear down Cohen's credibility with the jury.\n'I submit to you that he cannot be trusted,' Blanche said of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to lying to Congress when he was still in Trump's good graces.\nBlanche also countered the prosecution with more than a testament to Cohen's checkered history with the truth and Trump's membership in the clubs of man, father, husband and humanity.\n\"The story that you just heard\" from prosecutors, he said, \"you will learn is not true, and at the end of this trial there will be plenty of reasonable doubt.\" For Trump to be convicted, all 12 jurors must decide that he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\nWithout any doubt, Monday, his interest grew as Pecker took the stand as the prosecution's first witness. The former chief of American Media is a central figure because, prosecutors allege, he agreed to help by promoting bad stories about Trump's 2016 opponents, running articles praising Trump and, most importantly, helping Trump silence those who would tell negative tales about him.\nPecker did not get through much of his testimony before Merchan adjourned the trial for the day. The Passover holiday and a juror's need for emergency dental work conspired to force the pause.\nBut as Pecker testified, Trump leaned forward into the defense table, spoke animatedly with lawyer Emil Bove and furiously scribbled notes on a piece of paper that he shared with Bove and Blanche. His entire demeanor had changed over the course of a day, hinting that he plans to be an active participant in his trial going forward.\nIn a courthouse hallway, Trump ripped into prosecutors for pursuing the trial.\n'It's a case as to bookkeeping, which is a very minor thing in terms of the law, in terms of all the violent crime,' he said. \"It's very unfair...I should be allowed to campaign.\"\nProsecutors say a campaign — the 2016 version — compelled him to pay hush money to Daniels and then cover it up with fictitious records.\nNow, the sleeping giant is awake.\nJonathan Allen",

            "excerpt": "Proceedings in the first criminal trial of a former president are set to get back underway Thursday after a scheduled break Wednesday. Seven jurors have been selected so far.",
            "summary": "Jury selection is set to resume in former President Donald Trump's hush money trial in New York City after a break in action Wednesday.\nWith seven jurors already having been selected from a pool of 96, the schedule for Thursday will focus largely on questioning potential jurors in a second group of the same size to see whether they can be fair and impartial when it comes to Trump. The judge has said he hopes to have 12 jurors, as well as alternates, selected by the end of Friday.\nProsecutors and lawyers for Trump will have less opportunity to dismiss potential jurors going forward, because both used six of their 10 peremptory challenges Tuesday.\nWhile both sides can make an unlimited number of challenges for cause, it is up to the judge to decide whether to grant those challenges and strike those jurors. State Judge Juan Merchan dismissed two jurors for cause Tuesday, one of whom had posted a 'lock him up' message about Trump on Facebook, but he denied some other challenges.\nTrump bemoaned the number of challenges he can make Wednesday.\n'I thought STRIKES were supposed to be ‘unlimited' when we were picking our jury? I was then told we only had 10, not nearly enough when we were purposely given the 2nd Worst Venue in the Country,' he wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, before he blasted the case as 'election interference.'\nUnder New York law, defendants charged with lower-level felonies like Trump are entitled to only 10 peremptory strikes.\nThe scheduled day off Wednesday followed some fireworks in the Manhattan courtroom, where Merchan chided Trump for appearing to speak to one of the potential jurors who was being questioned about a Facebook post in which she had apparently celebrated Joe Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump.\n\"I won't tolerate that. I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom. I want to make that crystal clear,\" Merchan said.\nEventually, seven jurors were sworn in Tuesday: two lawyers, a teacher, an oncology nurse, an IT consultant, a teacher and a software engineer.\nThe jury foreperson — who typically leads and steers the jury and acts as its spokesperson — is a married man who lives in West Harlem and works in sales. He told Merchan he reads The New York Times and watches Fox News and MSNBC.\nThe jurors' names were not made public because Merchan, citing security concerns, has decided to use an anonymous jury.\nTrump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records and has pleaded not guilty. He faces up to four years in prison if he is convicted.\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office alleges that Trump falsified business records to hide money he was paying his former lawyer Michael Cohen to reimburse him for $130,000 he paid adult film actor Stormy Daniels near the end of the 2016 presidential campaign. Daniels has claimed she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. Trump has denied that he slept with Daniels, but he has acknowledged repaying Cohen.\nThe DA's office also alleges that American Media Inc. paid $150,000 to model and actor Karen McDougal, who appeared in Playboy magazine and claimed that she had a nine-month affair with Trump before he was elected president, 'in exchange for her agreement not to speak out about the alleged sexual relationship.'\nTrump has also denied having a sexual relationship with McDougal.\nAdam Reiss Dareh Gregorian",

The current minimum target is 2%.\n'They also discussed the war between Russia and Ukraine, the conflict with Israel in the Middle East, and many other topics having to do with getting to world peace,' the campaign said.\nAfter their dinner Duda said it was 'a friendly meeting in a very nice atmosphere.'\nTrump, who is on trial in New York over accusations that he covered up a 'hush money' payment to pornographic actress Stormy Daniels, is likely to face a tight race against President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November presidential election.\nDuda is in New York to attend the United Nations, and will travel on to Canada on Friday.",

Daniels says she slept with Trump in 2006, and McDougal says she had a 10-month sexual relationship with Trump that ended in April 2007. Trump has denied sleeping with either woman.\nCohen paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet, while Enquirer publisher AMI paid McDougal $150,000. After he was elected president, Trump repaid Cohen in a series of payments that prosecutors argue were fraudulently labeled as legal expenses. Trump has acknowledged repaying Cohen, but maintains the payments were legitimate and he didn't do anything wrong.\nTrump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records related to the hush money payment to Daniels, which was made in the closing days of the 2016 presidential campaign. The former president, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges, could face up to four years in prison if convicted.\nCohen, Daniels and McDougal, as well as former AMI head David Pecker, are expected to testify during the trial, which is estimated to take six weeks.\nIt's unclear who will be delivering opening statements for the prosecution on Monday. The DA's office declined comment Friday.\nTodd Blanche will deliver the opening statement for the defense. He's expected to argue that Trump didn't commit any wrongdoing and that the jurors can't trust what Cohen and Daniels tell them because both have axes to grind against the former president.\nThe jury consists of seven men and five women. The final day of jury selection, on Friday, was particularly intense, as some potential jurors broke down in tears and said they were too anxious to be seated on the jury. They were excused. The day also saw a man set himself on fire outside the courthouse.\nTrial proceedings on Monday will be slightly abbreviated. Judge Juan Merchan has said the court will adjourn at 2 p.m. ET on Monday and Tuesday because of the Passover holiday.\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass said in court Friday that the DA's office plans to call one witness Monday, with direct testimony expected to take up the rest of the day after opening statements. Trump attorney Susan Necheles on Friday asked for the witness' identity, but Steinglass refused to disclose it, noting that Trump has attacked witnesses, including Cohen, in social media posts despite a partial gag order forbidding such action.\nThe judge called Steinglass' position 'understandable' and said he would not order prosecutors to reveal the witness before Sunday.\nAdam Reiss Dareh Gregorian",

            "summary": "The share of voters who say they have high interest in the 2024 election has hit a nearly 20-year low at this point in a presidential race, according to the latest national NBC News poll, with majorities holding negative views of both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\nThe poll also shows Biden trimming Trump's previous lead to just 2 points in a head-to-head contest, an improvement within the margin of error compared to the previous survey, as the president bests Trump on the issues of abortion and uniting the country, while the former Republican president is ahead on competency and dealing with inflation.\nAnd it finds inflation and immigration topping the list of most important issues facing the country, as just one-third of voters give Biden credit for an improving economy.\nBut what also stands out in the survey is how the low voter interest and the independent candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. potentially scramble what's been a stable presidential contest with more than six months until Election Day. While Trump holds a 2-point edge over Biden in head to head , Biden leads Trump by 2 points in a five-way ballot test including Kennedy and other third-party candidates.\n'I don't think Biden has done much as a president. And if Trump gets elected, I just feel like it's going to be the same thing as it was before Biden got elected,' said poll respondent Devin Fletcher, 37, of Wayne, Michigan, a Democrat who said he's still voting for Biden.\n'I just don't feel like I have a candidate that I'm excited to vote for,' Fletcher added.\nAnother poll respondent from New Jersey, who declined to provide her name and voted for Biden in 2020, said she wouldn't be voting in November.\n'Our candidates are horrible. I have no interest in voting for Biden. He did nothing. And I absolutely will not vote for Trump,' this voter said.\nDemocratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies, said that 'Americans don't agree on much these days, but nothing unites the country more than voters' desire to tune this election out.'\nThe poll was conducted April 12-16, and it comes during yet another turbulent time in American politics, including the beginning of Trump's criminal trial in New York, as well as new attacks and heightened tensions in the Middle East.\nAccording to the poll, 64% of registered voters say they have a high level of interest in November's election — registering either a '9' or a 10' on a 10-point scale of interest.\nThat's lower than what the NBC News poll showed at this same point time in the 2008 (74%), 2012 (67%), 2016 (69%) and 2020 (77%) presidential contests.\nThe question dates back to the 2008 election cycle. The lowest-ever level of high election interest in the poll during a presidential cycle was in March 2012 — at 59%. But it quickly ticked up in the next survey.\nThis election cycle, high interest has been both low and relatively flat for months, according to the poll.\nMcInturff, the Republican pollster, says the high level of interest in the poll has 'always been a signal for the level of turnout' for a presidential contest.\n'It makes it very hard for us to predict turnout this far in advance of November, but every signal is turnout will be a lower percentage of eligible voters than in 2020,' he said.\nBy party, the current poll shows 70% of self-identified Republicans saying they have high interest in the upcoming election, versus 65% of Democrats who say this.\nIndependents are at 48%, while only 36% of voters ages 18 to 34 rate themselves as highly interested in the election.\n'They just aren't low interest,' McInturff said of young voters. 'They are off-the-charts low.'\nBiden trims Trump's lead The poll also finds Trump narrowly ahead of Biden by 2 points among registered voters in a head-to-head matchup, 46% to 44% — down from Trump's 5-point advantage in January, 47% to 42%.\nThat movement, within the poll's margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, is consistent with what other national polls have showed in the Trump-Biden race.\nTrump's biggest advantages are among men (53% to 37%), white voters (54% to 37%) and white voters without college degrees (65% to 25%).\nBiden's top advantages are among Black voters (71% to 13%), women (50% to 39%) and Latinos (49% to 39%).\nThe poll shows the two candidates are essentially tied among independents (Biden 36%, Trump 34%) and voters ages 18-34 (Biden 44%, Trump 43%). One of the big polling mysteries this cycle is whether young voters have defected from Biden (as the NBC News poll has shown over multiple surveys), or whether Democrats have maintained their advantage among this demographic.\nWhen the ballot is expanded to five named candidates, Biden takes a 2-point lead over Trump: Biden 39%, Trump 37%, independent Robert F. Kennedy 13%, Jill Stein 3% and Cornel West 2%.\nAgain, that result between Biden and Trump is within the poll's margin of error.\nNotably, the poll shows a greater share of Trump voters from the head-to-head matchup supporting Kennedy in the expanded ballot compared with Biden voters, different than the results of some other surveys.\n(Read more here on how Kennedy's candidacy impacts the 2024 race, according to the poll.)\n(Read more here on how Kennedy's candidacy impacts the 2024 race, according to the poll.)

'The question is whether he can build upon this momentum and make inroads with the groups of voters that still are holding back support.'\nBut McInturff, the GOP pollster, points out that the only recent presidents who lost re-election had approval ratings higher than Biden's at this point in the election cycle: George H.W.

Biden leads on abortion and unity; Trump leads on inflation and competency The NBC News poll asked voters to determine which candidate they thought is better on several different issues and attributes.\nBiden holds a 15-point advantage over Trump on dealing with the issue of abortion, and the president is ahead by 9 points on having the ability to bring the country together — though this is down from Biden's 24-point advantage on this issue in the Sept. 2020 NBC News poll.\nTrump, meanwhile, leads on having the ability to handle a crisis (by 4 points), on having a strong record of accomplishments (by 7 points), on being competent and effective (by 11 points), on having the necessary mental and physical health to be president (by 19 points) and on dealing with inflation and the cost of living (by 22 points).\nInflation, immigration are the top 2024 issues As for inflation and the cost of living, it tops the list of issues in the poll, with 23% of voters saying they're the most important issue facing the country.\nThe other top issue concerning voters is immigration and the situation at the border (22%) — followed by threats to democracy (16%), jobs and the economy (11%), abortion (6%) and health care (6%).\nimmigration and the situation at the border (22%) — followed by threats to democracy (16%), jobs and the economy (11%), abortion (6%) and health care (6%). Additionally, 63% of voters say their family's income is falling behind the cost of living — essentially unchanged from what the poll showed in 2022 and 2023.\nAnd 53% of voters say the country's economy has not improved, versus 33% who say it has improved and Biden deserves some credit for it and another 8% who agree the economy has improved but don't give the president credit for it.\n'If I look back to when I had all three of my children in the house — we only have one child left in the house now, and we're spending more now than what we did when we had a family of five,' said poll respondent Art Fales, 45, of Florida, who says he's likely voting for Trump.\nBut on a separate question — is there an issue so important that you'll vote for or against a candidate solely on that basis? — the top issue responses are protecting democracy and constitutional rights (28%), immigration and border security (20%) and abortion (19%).\nIndeed, 30% of Democrats, 29% of young voters and 27% of women say they are single-issue voters on abortion.\n'I have a right to what I do with my body,' said poll respondent Amanda Willis, 28, from Louisiana, who said she's voting for Biden. 'And I don't believe that other people should have the ability to determine that.'\nOther poll findings With Trump's first criminal trial now underway, 50% of voters say the former president is being held to the same standard as anyone else when it comes to his multiple legal challenges. That compares with 43% who believe he's being unfairly targeted in these trials.\n52% of voters have an unfavorable view of Biden, while 53% share the same view of Trump.\nAnd Democrats and Republicans are essentially tied on congressional preference, with 47% of voters preferring Republicans control Congress and 46% wanting Democrats in charge.

            "summary": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday weighs whether those involved in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol can be charged with obstructing an official proceeding, a case that could have bearing on the election interference prosecution of former President Donald Trump.\nThe justices are hearing an appeal brought by defendant Joseph Fischer, a former police officer who is seeking to dismiss a charge accusing him of obstructing an official proceeding, namely the certification by Congress of Joe Biden's election victory, which was disrupted by a mob of Trump supporters.\nThe court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in the past been skeptical of prosecutors when they assert broad applications of criminal provisions.\nTrump himself faces charges of violating the same law, as well as conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. They are among four charges he faces in his election interference case in Washington, separate from the hush money prosecution currently moving ahead in New York.\nTuesday's hearing comes just a week before the Supreme Court hears Trump's bid to toss out his election interference charges based on a claim of presidential immunity.\nFischer and Trump both say that the obstruction law does not apply to their alleged conduct, meaning that the charges should be dropped.\nOn Jan. 6, prosecutors say, Fischer joined the crowd breaching the Capitol from the east side. 'Charge!' he yelled again and again, before pushing forward toward a police line while yelling, 'Motherf-----s!' the government says.\nHe and other rioters then fell to the ground. After other rioters lifted him up, video disclosed as evidence in other Jan. 6 trials shows that he tried to appeal to officers protecting the Capitol, telling them that he was an officer too.\nFischer faces seven criminal charges, only one of which is the focus of the Supreme Court case. He also faces charges of assaulting a police officer and entering a restricted building, among others.\nThe law in question criminalizes efforts to obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding. Conviction can result in a prison sentence of up to 20 years.\nThe provision was enacted in 2002 as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was passed after the Enron accounting scandal.\nFischer's lawyers say the law should be limited to circumstances involving tampering with physical evidence, which is what they argue the law aims to address.\nA ruling in favor of Fischer could benefit Trump, although that is not guaranteed. Prosecutors in Trump's case have said that even if Fischer wins, Trump's conduct would still be covered by a narrower interpretation of the statute.",

            "summary": "A man set himself on fire Friday outside of a New York City courthouse at about the same time that jury selection had just been completed for former President Donald Trump's historical criminal trial inside.\nA spokesperson for the NYPD said the man, identified as Max Azzarello of Florida, was in critical condition. He appears to have had pamphlets describing a conspiracy involving cryptocurrency that he threw around before setting himself ablaze, police said.\nThe incident, which took place shortly after 1:30 p.m. ET inside an area set aside for demonstrators, came amid an intense day inside the courtroom that resulted in two jurors breaking down in tears and three being excused after expressing anxiety about being on the case.\n\"We have our full panel,\" Judge Juan Merchan declared after they added the last of the six alternates who will serve alongside the panel of 12 jurors, paving the way for opening statements in the first-ever criminal trial of a former president to begin Monday. The 12 and one alternate had been chosen by the end of the day Thursday.\nThe five alternates who were ultimately selected Friday include an unemployed married woman who's into art and described herself as not political, an audio professional, a contract specialist, a clothing company executive and a construction company project manager. It took four days of jury selection to find the 18 jurors.\nTrump took to social media after the jury was selected to complain the judge is \"'railroading' me, at breakneck speed, in order to completely satisfy his 'friends'.\"\nThe day began with the judge calling up the 22 remaining potential jurors from the previous pool of 96 to answer questions designed to indicate whether they could be fair and impartial about the divisive real estate mogul and presumptive Republican nominee for president.\nof 96 to answer questions designed to indicate whether they could be fair and impartial about the divisive real estate mogul and presumptive Republican nominee for president.

Brendan McDermid / Pool via Getty Images The first of those potential jurors was dismissed after she said she didn't think she could be fair. 'I have really, really bad anxiety and people have found out where I am,\" she told the judge. A short time later, two other potential jurors were dismissed after each told the judge that upon further reflection, \"I don't think I can be impartial.\"\nOther potential jurors included a married father who said he listens to a podcast called \"Order of Man,\" which is described on Apple's website as discussions about \"reclaiming what it means to be a man.\" Some past guests of the podcast include people who've been outspoken in their support of Trump and were highly critical of the civil fraud case New York Attorney General Letitia James brought against the former president. The man, an audio specialist, was chosen as one of the alternates.\nAnother potential juror was a married fund manager who said he'd done \"get-out-the-vote\" work for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Trump's 2016 presidential opponent. Trump and his attorney Todd Blanche passed notes back and forth while that juror was speaking. He was later dismissed after being asked about a 2020 Facebook post where he apparently called Trump 'the devil and a sociopath.'\nTrump appeared most interested in jurors whose answers offer ambiguity around their personal political views. When one prospective juror said they were a Fox News viewer, Trump cocked his head, then quickly conferred with his lawyer, Todd Blanche.\nAnother potential juror was a woman who became emotional as she disclosed she'd served two years in prison on drug-related charges, but said she could be \"fair and impartial.\"\nDuring a morning break, Merchan — who'd chided reporters on Thursday for disclosing too much information about potential jurors — said the woman had shared \"very personal things about her life\" and was \"very brave.\" 'I just wanted to encourage the press to please be kind. Please be kind to this person,' the judge said. He later dismissed her, saying she needed a certificate of release to be qualified for service going forward. On her way out, she cheerfully called out, \"Good luck!\"\nFollowing that juror's departure, the DA's office began its individual questioning of the jurors. One woman, who'd disclosed that her father is lifelong friends with Trump ally turned critic Chris Christie, broke down in tears when prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked her an innocuous question about the burden of proof in the case. \"I feel so nervous and anxious right now. I'm sorry,\" she responded, bursting out into tears. \"I thought I could do this,\" she said, adding \"I wouldn't want someone who feels this way to judge my case.\" She was dismissed.\nHoffinger's questioning was followed by Trump attorney Susan Necheles, who asked a potential juror who'd started their own business how she would assess a witness's credibility. The woman then asked to speak to the judge, saying she was \"getting anxiety and self-doubt' from Necheles's line of questioning. She was dismissed.\nNecheles later asked another woman — who previously said she was a victim of sexual assault — whether she would hold it against Trump that women outside this case have accused Trump of sexual assault. She said she would not have a problem setting those accusations aside but the judge ultimately excused her, saying, \"It's best to err on the side of caution.\"\nAnother man said he has some differences from Trump on his policies but thinks he's 'usually awesome.' He was not chosen for the jury.\nOn his way into court in the morning, Trump again complained the case against him is \"unfair,\" and that the partial gag order preventing him from lashing out at witnesses, prosecutors, court staffers and jurors is not \"constitutional.\" \"Everyone else can say whatever they want about me. They can say anything they want. They can continue to make up lies and everything else. They lie. They're real scum. But you know what? I'm not allowed to speak,\" he told reporters.\nProsecutors this week asked the judge to fine Trump and hold him in contempt for social media posts that they said violate the gag order. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Tuesday..\nThe main panel of 12 is made up of seven men and five women, including two lawyers, a teacher, a retired wealth manager, a product development manager, a security engineer, a software engineer, a speech therapist and a physical therapist. The foreman — the juror who essentially acts as the leader and spokesperson for the panel — is a married man who works in sales and gets his news from The New York Times, MSNBC and Fox News.\nThe lone alternate selected Thursday is a woman who works as an asset manager.\nLater in the day, Merchan held what's known as a Sandoval hearing. That's a type of hearing designed to let defendants know the scope of questions they could face from prosecutors on cross-examination so they can make informed decisions about whether to take the witness stand in their own defense.\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office disclosed in a court filing that it would like to ask Trump about several items, among them the $464 million civil judgment against him and his company for fraud, the total $88 million verdicts and liability findings for sexual abuse and defamation in lawsuits brought by writer E. Jean Carroll and a number of other adverse court rulings over the past few years.\nTrump has denied wrongdoing in all the cases and is appealing the fraud judgment and the Carroll verdicts.\nProsecutors said they want to be able to bring those findings up 'to impeach the credibility of the defendant' if he takes the witness stand.\nDiscussing the findings in the fraud case, prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told the judge it was \"hard to think of something that is more squarely in the wheelhouse' for the DA to ask Trump about \"than a finding by a judge of persistent and repeated fraud and illegality.\"\nTrump's attorney Emil Bove countered that prosecutors shouldn't be able to breach the topic at all because Trump's appeal is still pending. He made similar arguments over the DA's contention that they should be allowed to ask about a judge's finding that he was untruthful on the witness stand during the fraud trial and had violated a gag order in the case.\n'Is it your position that because a case is being appealed or might be appealed, that therefore it can not be used?\" Merchan asked the lawyer. \"Not necessarily,\" Bove replied.\nThe judge said he'd issue his ruling on the dispute on Monday morning.\nTrump said last week he 'absolutely' plans to testify, but he is under no obligation to do so.\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records and faces up to four years in prison if he is convicted.\nBragg alleges that Trump falsified records to hide money he was paying his former lawyer Michael Cohen to reimburse him for $130,000 he paid adult film actor Stormy Daniels near the end of the 2016 presidential campaign. Daniels has claimed she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. Trump has denied that he slept with Daniels, but he has acknowledged repaying Cohen.\nThe DA's office also alleges that as part of a scheme to boost Trump, National Enquirer publisher American Media Inc. paid $150,000 to model and actor Karen McDougal, who appeared in Playboy magazine and claimed that she had a nine-month affair with Trump before he was elected president 'in exchange for her agreement not to speak out about the alleged sexual relationship,' according to a statement of facts filed by Bragg.\nTrump has also denied having a sexual relationship with McDougal.\nAdam Reiss Lisa Rubin Dareh Gregorian Katherine Doyle contributed.",

One prospective juror professed Trump 'totally guilty' in an interview outside the courthouse on Monday. A day later, that person, an American history teacher, was struck from a rapidly winnowing pool of more than 500 New Yorkers.\nLawyers excavated ancient social media posts; asked jurors to explain inconsistent answers; and tried to strike from the pool candidates they feared could spell danger for their case.\nAt one point, the judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan, warned Trump that he should not try to intimidate potential jurors.\nTrump is defending himself against 34 felony counts of falsifying business records for his alleged role in arranging a hush-money payment to a porn star during the 2016 presidential election. The former president has denied all charges.\nAs Trump's attorneys closely watched each juror, Todd Blanche, his lead attorney, took handwritten notes. Some of the answers prompted a smile. Trump, for his part, mostly looked straight ahead.\nBy the numbers The selection process started with 96 jurors in the first batch. By Tuesday, more than half were excused after saying they could not be fair or impartial. That left 34. From there, 18 were sat in the jury box and winnowed down to six. And then another six brought in, who were reduced to one.\nSeven jurors, including a former waiter, an oncology nurse, an attorney, an IT consultant, a teacher, and a software engineer, were seated by the late afternoon in a process that took two days. Merchan appeared optimistic a jury of 12 New Yorkers and likely six alternates could be sat by the end of the week.

'I don't generally read the emails,' she said before she was stuck.\nAnother juror said he reads the New York Times and New York Daily News and used social media. 'I do Google. I do X,' he said.\nJurors were asked if they read the New York Times, or watched CNN as the lawyers queried the pool to get a better sense of their knowledge of the charges against Trump in New York and his other legal cases, and what they think of them.\nSeveral jurors professed not to consume much news at all, including one lawyer who explained that his wife is not a fan.\nwife is not a fan. Another, a teacher and Harlem native said she does not pay attention to politics or the media. She said she does not have strong opinions but that, as a person of color, she has friends with strong opinions on Trump. But she did share one, praising the former president as a person 'who speaks his mind.'\n'I'd rather that than someone who's in office who you don't know what they're thinking,' she said.\nWhen Blanche asked the group if they were familiar with the other charges facing Trump, she appeared to be the sole juror not to raise her hand. She was seated on the jury.\nAnother juror professed to have been away through February and March, living on a lake without wifi. 'Knowing this was going to happen, I really tried not to hear about this case and I blocked the news,' this person said. She was struck by Trump's lawyers.\nSocial media One juror said she doesn't tweet and quit Twitter after two days. Another said her Facebook page and the political materials posted to it weren't representative of her views and that she had sought to remove it. One man, a resident of Hells Kitchen but originally from Mexico, said he could not be held responsible for the views of his Facebook friends. 'Feelings are not facts,' he insisted.\n'Feelings are not facts,' he insisted. At one point, Merchan apologized for causing potential offense as he read political memes about Trump, including one about a group of Thai boys who were trapped in a cave in 2018. Another meme shared by one juror included side-by-side photos of Trump and former President Barack Obama with a caption reading, 'I don't think this is what they meant when they said orange is the new black.'\nIt wasn't clear whether jurors had written every post themselves or reposted others. But the materials were cause for Trump's lawyer to press the jurors repeatedly—including over Facebook posts from Occupy Democrats that one woman claimed not to be responsible for and said she did not know how to remove.\nImpartiality tests The defense scoured the internet, unearthing comments from prospective jurors that showed hostility to Trump or ran contrary to what they told the court in questionnaires.\nSpeculation over seemingly non-partisan events — such as a post about an Election Day celebration in the city in 2020, a Democratic stronghold — became the basis for queries that sought to probe any stronger biases that could sway a juror one way or another.\nOther commentary was more overt. 'Republicans projected to pick up 70 seats in prison,' one potential juror had posted.\nThat person said she lost sleep last night over whether she could judge the case fairly, Blanche said, explaining how the prosecution and defense had 'a fair bit of colloquy' with her.\nBut he argued that while the post may be dated, it still mattered. 'The evidence at trial is going to be six years old,' he said.\n'The evidence at trial is going to be six years old,' he said.

            "summary": "Trump Media is making a point of telling its shareholders how to prevent their stock from being loaned to short sellers — who bet the price of the shares will drop.\nThe short-selling-prevention tips posted Wednesday on Trump Media's website come as its DJT stock has sharply fallen in price since it began being public trading on March 26 — and as short sellers have taken a keen interest in the owner of the Truth Social app despite relatively high fees to finance such trades.\nTrump Media's share price rose sharply on Wednesday, by more than 15%, its closing price of $26.40 was still a whopping 63% lower than the price it opened at on March 26.\nThe stock slumped by 20% last week alone, and then plummeted by more than 18% on Monday and another more than 14% on Tuesday.\nThe share price Wednesday was nearly 46% lower than its closing price on April 1, the same day Trump Media disclosed it had booked a $58 million loss for 2023, with just $4.1 million in revenue for that year.\nFormer President Donald Trump is by far the biggest shareholder in Trump Media, owning nearly 60% of its shares. And his 78.75 million shares could soon grow by 36 million shares if DJT's price stays above $17 per share in the coming days due to an earnout provision in the merger deal that took the company public.\nBut Trump, who is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and Trump Media since late March seen billions of dollars in share value evaporate from share price declines.\nOn Wednesday, following two straight days of sharp price drops, the company included a supplement to its frequently asked questions list on its website, which it detailed in an 8-K filing on Thursday morning with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe supplement offers detailed instructions to shareholders on: ' How do I prevent my shares from being loaned for a short interest position?'\nShort selling is the practice of borrowing shares of a company's stock, and then quickly selling those shares for a certain amount of money. The short seller then waits, hoping that the share price will drop over some period of time, so that they can then repurchase the same number of shares and give them back to the lender, pocketing the difference between what they first sold the shares for as profit after paying brokers' fees.\n'For long-term shareholders who believe in the Company's future, the Company is highlighting the following actions you can take with your brokerage firm to prevent the lending of your shares for short selling,' Trump Media said in its supplement to its FAQ Wednesday.\nThe tips include holding DJT shares in a cash account at a brokerage firm as opposed to a margin account, 'opting out of any securities lending program,' moving Trump Media shares to the company's designated transfer agent, and transferring shares to a bank and 'holding them in your retirement account.'\nThe instructions include a helpful form letter that shareholder can send to their brokers.\nThe letter says: 'Please accept this written instruction to make sure that the following securities are held in my cash account only and accordingly are not available for any stock loan activities.'\n'I hereby expressly opt-out of any securities lending programs and instruct you to not loan out any of my shares,' the letter says, before a section that the sender can fill out with their number of shares.\nA spokeswoman for Trump Media did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new instructions regarding preventing short selling.\nShort selling is particularly risky because it is markedly different than a 'long position' in a stock — in which a person can only lose the amount of money they paid for shares if their price falls to zero.\nIn contrast, a short position in a stock can in theory see its price rise without stopping, leaving the short seller responsible for paying exponentially more money to buy back the shares to return to the lender.\nTrump Media in its update FAQ nodded to that risk in noting that brokerage firms loan shares 'to sophisticated and institutional investors' to do short sales. Brokers often insist that customers who do short sales with them are experienced investors, and have sufficient cash or collateral on hand that can insure that if the short trade goes bad they can cover their losses.\nTrump Media also pointed out that lending shares to short sellers can earn brokerage firms 'an alternative source of revenue.'\n'If the price of the stock in fact decreases, then the brokerage firm and the sophisticated and institutional investors will have made a profit, while the ultimate retail investor has not,' Trump Media told its shareholders.'\nOnly about 5 million shares of DJT have been available to short out of more than 136 million company shares. And much of the 5 million shares were already locked up in short positions earlier this month.\nBut Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, told CNBC in early April, 'What I'm hearing on the Street is that if [an amount] of stock becomes available, shorts are taking it down.'\nDan Mangan, CNBC",

            "excerpt": "American politics has largely been stuck in a narrow band of close division for most of the Biden era. New polling shows what could break it one way or the other.",
            "summary": "The good news for President Joe Biden in our new national NBC News poll is that it appears he's climbed out of the political hole he was in this winter: His overall approval rating is up 5 points from January, and he now trails former President Donald Trump by just 2 points among registered voters, down from a 5-point deficit three months ago.\nThe bad news for Biden is that his current political standing is back to where it was in the fall of 2023, when his re-election prospects were already on shaky ground.\nIt underscores an important point about 2024's presidential election with six months to go: The Biden-Trump contest has been remarkably stable — and remarkably competitive — with the movement coming within the margin of error.\nTake the two-way ballot between Biden and Trump, for example. Over the course of almost a year, Trump's percentage has been stuck between 45% and 47% of registered voters, matching his share of the popular vote in both the 2016 and the 2020 elections. Biden's percentage, meanwhile, has hovered between a high of 49% in the summer of 2023 and a low of 42% in January.\nOr look at Biden's approval rating, which has consistently been below 45% since the start of January 2023, and which hit a low of 37% in the first month of this year. It's now at 42% in our latest poll.\nOr look at the favorability ratings for both Biden and Trump, which are almost identical:\nBiden: 38% positive, 52% negative (minus 14 net rating)\nTrump: 38% positive, 53% negative (minus 15 net rating) Or take the names at the top of the ticket out of the equation and note the stable congressional preference in the poll. Right now, 47% prefer a GOP-controlled Congress in the new NBC poll, compared to 46% who want Democrats. The parties have been locked in that competitive position for years: The GOP number hasn't moved more than 2 points in either direction in NBC News polling since August 2021, while the Democratic number dipped outside that range just once.\nSo, despite all the news, developments and drama over the past year, this race has barely budged. And it's extremely close.\nBut the new NBC News poll also points to at least three potential wild cards that could upend this stability.\nThe first is Trump's criminal trial in New York. While his multiple criminal indictments and legal challenges helped him with Republican primary voters in 2023 and early this year, the NBC poll finds 50% of voters saying he's being held to the same standard as anyone accused of such a crime, versus 43% who believe he's being unfairly targeted.\nhelped him with Republican primary voters in 2023 and early this year, the NBC poll finds 50% of voters saying he's being held to the same standard as anyone accused of such a crime, versus 43% who believe he's being unfairly targeted. That majority saying Trump is being held to the same standard as anyone else is higher than the vote share Biden gets in the head-to-head matchup against the former president. Bottom line: The legal challenges don't seem to be a political winner for Trump with the general electorate — at least right now.\nAnother potential wild card is the third-party vote. For months, the conventional wisdom has been that the bigger the size of the third-party vote, the worse it would be for Biden. And that could still be the case, given that Trump's consistent 46% to 47% vote share becomes a winning percentage if the third-party vote is greater than 6%.\nYet, our NBC News poll shows independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hurting Trump more than he is hurting Biden at the moment.\nAnd a final wild card is the eventual turnout in the 2024 presidential race. As our poll finds, the level of high interest in this contest is at a nearly 20-year low, signaling that turnout in November could be significantly lower than it was in 2020.\nDoes that lower turnout help Trump, given that more Republicans have high interest (70%) than Democrats do (65%), according to the NBC News poll?\nOr does it help Biden, given that many of the voters who say they're supporting Trump are the ones who didn't participate in 2020 or in the 2022 midterms?\nThese are all reasons how a stable race can quickly become unstable — and unpredictable.\nMark Murray",

            "summary": "Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday ripped the jury selection process for his historic New York criminal trial, the day after the first seven jurors were selected out of a pool of nearly 100 people.\nPosting about the hush money trial on its scheduled off-day, Trump — who has repeatedly accused the judge in the case of being biased against him — suggested incorrectly that he should be entitled to unlimited strikes of potential jurors in his criminal case.\n'I thought STRIKES were supposed to be 'unlimited' when we were picking our jury? I was then told we only had 10, not nearly enough when we were purposely given the 2nd Worst Venue in the Country,\" he wrote in a post on Truth Social, before decrying the criminal cases against him as \"election interference\" and part of a \"witch hunt.\"\nUnder New York law, each side does have an unlimited number of strikes 'for cause,' but the judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan, can decide whether or not that cause is worthy of a strike.\nbut the judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan, can decide whether or not that cause is worthy of a strike.\nThe two sides are also entitled to a limited number of \"peremptory strikes\" — potential jurors they can dismiss. Because Trump is charged with a Class E felony, which is a lower-level felony, he and prosecutors are entitled to 10 peremptory challenges each. (The number goes up to 20 for defendants facing the highest level of felony charge, Class A.)\nWhile the judge has dismissed scores of potential jurors in the case who said they could not be impartial or had scheduling conflicts, he's only dismissed two \"for cause\" in the two days since jury selection began. One was a person who'd written \"lock him up\" of Trump in a 2017 social media post. The judge denied some other Trump \"cause\" dismissal requests, including a woman who'd posted on Facebook about celebrating Joe Biden's 2020 election win.\nTrump's attorney Todd Blanche then used one of his peremptory challenges to have the woman removed.\nBy the end of the day Tuesday, both Trump and prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office had used six of their 10 challenges, meaning they only have four each left for the remaining jurors.\nTwo potential jurors the DA's office used its strikes on were people who said they'd read Trump's book \"The Art of the Deal.\"\nTrump is required to attend the trial, which is expected to last as long as eight weeks and take place every weekday except Wednesday and holidays. The rigorous trial schedule will limit his ability to join in-person campaign events as part of his presidential bid — something the former president has complained about repeatedly. NBC News reported last month that Trump plans to leverage his legal issues for political gain by falsely blaming President Joe Biden.\nJury selection is scheduled to resume Thursday morning with a pool of an additional 96 prospective jurors. Once a full 12-person jury has been selected, the two sides then pick alternate jurors.\nMerchan appeared hopeful Tuesday that jury selection will be done by the end of the day Friday. He told the seven jurors who have been selected to return Monday morning for opening statements, while also cautioning the date could change.\nTrump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to a porn star during the closing days of the 2016 presidential election. He faces up to four years in prison if convicted.",

            "summary": "Jury selection will continue — and could conclude — Friday in former President Donald Trump's historic New York criminal trial.\nWith a full 12-person jury and one alternate juror sworn in Thursday, Judge Juan Merchan has called a pool of 96 potential jurors to his Manhattan courtroom in hope of finding five more alternate jurors for the first trial of a former president, which is expected to last roughly six weeks.\nIn addition to those 96 potential jurors, there are 22 left over from Thursday who will be questioned, as well.\nIf the effort to fill the jury box is successful, opening statements could take place as soon as Monday.\nThe main panel of 12 is made up of seven men and five women, including two lawyers, a teacher, a retired wealth manager, a product development manager, a security engineer, a software engineer, a speech therapist and a physical therapist. The foreman — the juror who essentially acts as the leader and spokesperson for the panel — is a married man who works in sales and gets his news from The New York Times, MSNBC and Fox News.\nThe lone alternate selected Thursday is a woman who works as an asset manager.\nAlso Friday, Merchan is expected to hold what's known as a Sandoval hearing, a type of hearing designed to let defendants know the scope of questions they could face from prosecutors on cross-examination so they can make informed decisions about whether to take the witness stand in their own defense.\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office disclosed in a court filing that it would like to ask Trump about several items, among them the $464 million civil judgment against him and his company for fraud, the total $88 million verdicts and liability findings for sexual abuse and defamation in lawsuits brought by writer E. Jean Carroll and a number of other adverse court rulings over the past few years.\nTrump has denied wrongdoing in all the cases and is appealing the fraud judgment and the Carroll verdicts.\nProsecutors said they want to be able to bring those findings up 'to impeach the credibility of the defendant' if he takes the witness stand.\nTrump said last week he 'absolutely' plans to testify, but he is under no obligation to do so.\nTrump's attorneys told Merchan in a letter last month that they will argue the DA's office should be barred 'from asking about these items.'\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records and faces up to four years in prison if he is convicted.\nBragg alleges that Trump falsified records to hide money he was paying his former lawyer Michael Cohen to reimburse him for $130,000 he paid adult film actor Stormy Daniels near the end of the 2016 presidential campaign. Daniels has claimed she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. Trump has denied that he slept with Daniels, but he has acknowledged repaying Cohen.\nThe DA's office also alleges that as part of a scheme to boost Trump, National Enquirer publisher American Media Inc. paid $150,000 to model and actor Karen McDougal, who appeared in Playboy magazine and claimed that she had a nine-month affair with Trump before he was elected president 'in exchange for her agreement not to speak out about the alleged sexual relationship,' according to a statement of facts filed by Bragg.\nTrump has also denied having a sexual relationship with McDougal.\nAdam Reiss Lisa Rubin Dareh Gregorian",

            "summary": "If the prosecution and defense in former President Donald Trump's hush-money trial can agree on one thing, it's this: he's not quite like any other defendant.\nHe was the most powerful man in the world and wants that job again. His mastery of media — including social platforms — made him known to virtually every American. The the vast majority of them have strong visceral reactions to him — with barely more than a third rating him likable, according to Gallup.\n\"We may be in an alternate universe because President Trump is known to everybody,\" his lawyer Todd Blanche said on Tuesday, the second day of the trial.\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass echoed him: 'Everyone and their mother has an opinion about this case, and what the right outcome should be.'\nThat presents the court, and its officers, with a conundrum: There may not be 12 eligible jurors in New York — or America, for that matter — who don't know what they think of Trump.\nIncredibly, Judge Juan Merchan had to assess Tuesday whether several jurors' social media posts about the defendant rendered them unfit to serve. That simply doesn't happen in many trials.\nBut this first prosecution of a president, sitting or former, is bringing new precedent after new precedent.\nNo lawyer has ever had to ask prospective jurors whether they could set aside their personal feelings about a president, sitting or former, to judge whether he's guilty of a crime. And yet by early afternoon Tuesday, both Blanche and Steinglass had done just that.\n\"We're trying to pick a jury that can be fair to both sides,\" Steinglass said as he opened the selection — or voire dire — process. \"This case has nothing to do with your personal politics … it's not a referendum on the Trump presidency.\"\nBlanche pushed a complementary line. He asked possible jurors their opinions of Trump — separate from the trial at hand — to gauge whether they might be too biased to judge the former president fairly. Before a lunch break, the group assured him they could.\nWhen the trial resumed around 2:15 p.m., Blanche was armed with politically charged social media posts by jurors who had promised they could be impartial. Merchan allowed him to call those jurors back to the stand to be asked about the posts.\nSome possible jurors were struck for cause. One had posted \"lock him up\" after a court overturned Trump's travel ban, the judge said.\nLater, one was removed after volunteering, \"As much as I would like to serve for New York and one of our great presidents, I cannot serve due to my job. I cannot take off six weeks.\"\nBut Merchan drew a line when Blanche tried to eliminate a juror by pointing to her husband's account.\n'These are posts from over eight years ago, not involving the juror, involving the juror's husband,' Merchan said, adding that he was reassured 'if this is the worst thing that you're able to find about this juror.\"\nIt was not impossible to find jurors acceptable to both sides. Seven of them were seated by the end of Tuesday's session. That left six more regular jurors and \"about six\" alternate jurors left to choose, Merchan said.\nThat group of a dozen — plus the six reserves — will be charged with the very ordinary task of applying the facts to the law and the extraordinary challenge of ignoring the Trump in the room.\nJonathan Allen",

            "summary": "The New Yorkers who could decide Donald Trump's fate were vetted in real time on Friday by the former president's defense team.\nAs the potential alternate jurors were being questioned by prosecutors seeking to convict Trump of illegally paying hush money to a porn star, and by defense attorneys trying to keep him out of jail, a jury consultant hired by Trump's legal team was watching the candidates closely for telltale signs of possible bias while simultaneously feeding the defense attorneys her impressions.\nFollow along for live updates\nFollow along for live updates Meanwhile, a team of researchers working with the jury consultant were doing social media and other online searches to fill out the picture of every potential juror and sending that information to Trump's lawyers in the courtroom.\n'All this has to happen relatively quickly,' said veteran jury consultant Jo-Ellan Dimitrius of Dimitrius & Associates, who has been following the case and identified the firm working for Trump as Magna Legal Services.\nThe Philadelphia-based firm did not respond to a call from NBC News but court records show that Magna served as Trump's jury consultant when he was found liable for sexually abusing and then defaming writer E. Jean Carroll.\nIt was not immediately clear if the Manhattan District Attorney's office used its own jury consultant to vet jurors and a spokesperson for the agency did not return numerous phone calls from NBC News.\nBy midday, jury selection had been completed and Trump's first trial was heading for opening arguments.\nUsing jury consultants for vetting has become a fairly common practice.\n'In my experience, there's usually a consultant sitting behind the lawyers with a laptop who is feeding information to the lawyer doing the questioning of jurors,' Dimitrius said. 'They usually have the home office doing the social media checks and other searches because the primary role of the consultant in the courtroom is to listen and watch the jurors and give feedback to the lawyers.'\nSometimes the background checks of potential jurors are being done even before the questioning begins, Dimitrius said.\n'Generally on the morning of jury selection you get a list of potential jurors,' she said. 'So we will take an iPhone photo of the list and send it back to the office where they'll start their searches.'\nTampa-based jury consultant Michael Boucher of TCS, who has worked on a number of high-profile cases in New York City, like former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's failed libel case versus the New York Times, echoed Dimitrius.\n'In a case like this, we would set up a laptop on the podium and use a messaging app to stay in contact with the lawyers questioning the jurors,' Boucher said. 'Not only are you feeding the lawyer information, you are finding on the jurors online, you're trying to help guide the lawyer asking the questions. Lawyers, at times, sometimes get too far into the weeds and they need assistance so they can come up with follow-up questions.'\nAt the same time, Boucher said, 'We're watching the reactions of the other jurors waiting to be questioned and feeding that information to our legal team. That way, when the next potential juror steps up we already have a sense of where they stand.'\nBoucher said in his experience Manhattan jury pools tend to be sophisticated, well-educated and thoughtful. But cases involving polarizing figures like Trump or Palin 'sometime attract what we call 'motivated jurors,' with strong feelings either for or against\" them.\n'It's very hard to find anybody who doesn't have an opinion about Trump,' he said.\nNBC News Legal Analyst Danny Cevallos, an attorney who practices in New York and elsewhere, agreed.\n'In virtually every other case in the world, there's not a strong chance that the jurors have tweeted about the defendant or posted on social media,\" Cevallos said. \"This is the rare one-in-a-million case where there's a good chance all of us have retweeted or tweeted something about Donald Trump.\"\nRenato Stabile, managing director at Dubin Research & Consulting in New York City, said the ability to track social media has revolutionized the way juries get picked — and how jury consultants do their jobs.\n'Before you just had to rely on what jurors said in court, and I think lawyers depended a lot more on their experience and gut, and maybe unfortunately, stereotypes that were either correct or incorrect and their past experience,\" Stabile said. \"Now you just get such a better sense of what jurors are really all about based on the articles they're liking, what they're reposting.\"\nExamining social media is \"probably the most important part of jury selection,' said David Oscar Markus, a criminal defense attorney who, among others, successfully defended former Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum against charges of lying to the FBI.\n'Lots of folks will come into court and say, ‘Yes, of course, I can be fair,' or, you know, ‘I have feelings about this one way or the other, but I can put all those aside and give the prosecution and defense a fair shake',\" Markus said. \"But then, you know, once you see posts, even if they're old posts, they reveal sort of the jurors' true feelings.'\nLisa Rubin and Corky Siemaszko reported from New York City, Megan Lebowitz reported from Washington, D.C.\nLisa Rubin and Corky Siemaszko reported from New York City, Megan Lebowitz reported from Washington, D.C.\nLisa Rubin Megan Lebowitz Corky Siemaszko",

            "summary": "Four days into the first criminal trial of a president, Donald Trump was showing signs of frustrations.\nHe had listened to scores of New Yorkers express less-than-favorable opinions about him, was restricted in what he could say in court and had even been told to sit down by the judge.\n'Sir, can you please have a seat,' said Juan Merchan, the soft-spoken judge who is presiding over Trump's hush money trial, when the former president thought Friday's proceedings were over and got up to leave.\nAs Trump returned to the defense table, Merchan thanked him.\nTrump exited the room minutes later looking weary and promising to testify at the trial, which he slammed as a 'witch hunt.'\nHis comments capped a week that was filled with power reversals and accusations turned upside down.\nTrump, who prosecutors say used hush money payments to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, is attempting to make a parallel case in the court of public opinion.\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday, the presumptive Republican nominee for president groused that 'instead of being in Pennsylvania or Georgia, or North Carolina or lots of other places today, I'm sitting in a courthouse all day long,' adding that process 'will go on for another four or five weeks.'\nThe trial is expected to last as many as six weeks.\nTrump, who is required to be in court for the duration of the trial, also accused the district attorney's office of waging interference in the 2024 presidential election on behalf of President Joe Biden by 'keeping me off the campaign trail.'\nHe went on to argue that he was 'not allowed to speak' after the judge said he must curtail his social media attacks against potential witnesses in the case, and later told supporters in a fundraising email that he was 'FULLY GAGGED.'\nMuch of Friday's drama unfolded outside the courthouse, where a man set himself on fire in a park facing the court. He was taken to a hospital after police extinguished the flames.\nIn the courtroom, Trump sat at the defense table as prospective jurors were asked questions aimed at sussing out their ability to be impartial.\nOne alternate juror was excused for anxiety, which she believed would hamper her ability 'to be completely fair.' Another was questioned about a social media post referencing the former president, saying, 'I do believe he's the devil.'\n'I don't recall posting that,' the man said, before being dismissed.\nTrump had taken a particular interest in the man, who had volunteered for the campaign of his 2016 Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.\nSocial media posts made the case for dismissing several other potential jurors, even after they said they could judge Trump fairly.\nA retired New York high school teacher said he could 'absolutely' be fair and impartial, but was compelled to answer questions about excavated social media posts that revealed in 2017 he had attended 'a massive anti-trump rally,' according to the caption of a picture in which he had tagged himself online.\nHe was excused.\nBy Friday afternoon, Merchan had seated a full 12-person jury and assigned six alternates. All 18 will meet for the first time on Monday morning, when opening statements are set to get underway.\nTrump's defense team looked noticeably downcast during the afternoon's proceedings, with attorney Susan Necheles slumped back into her seat, arms crossed until addressing the judge late in the day. Lead attorney Todd Blanche was seated next to Trump, and the two sat watching and occasionally whispering to one another.\nAfter Merchan said he would not consider a motion on presidential immunity and other motions, Blanche insisted there was still more to discuss.\n'This sounds suspiciously like the 10 minutes we spent arguing this on Monday … with no new facts, no new application of the law,' Merchan responded.\n'There's nothing else to re-argue,' he added as the first week of the trial came to a close. 'We're going to have opening statements Monday morning. This trial is starting.'",

Donald Trump — the first criminal trial of a former president ever.\nThe quest to find a jury of 12 people and six alternates got off to a slow start Monday, as more than half of the 96 potential jurors summoned to the Manhattan courtroom said they couldn't be \"fair and impartial\" when it comes to Trump, the polarizing New York native and former commander-in-chief.\nTrump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, is required to be in attendance for the trial, which is projected to last six to eight weeks. He has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to a porn star during the closing days of the 2016 presidential election. The low-level felony is punishable by up to four years in prison.\nTrump complained after court Monday that Judge Juan Merchan wouldn't let him skip court May 17 to attend his son's high school graduation, though Merchan has yet to actually rule on the request, saying he would do so later.\nTrump's attorney Todd Blanche also asked whether Trump could be excused on April 25, the date the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear his arguments about presidential immunity stemming from the federal election interference case against him. Merchan rejected that request after Blanche told him, \"We shouldn't be here at all right now.\"\n\"You don't believe you should be here right now?\" the outraged judge responded. \"He's required to be here. He's not required to be at the Supreme Court.\"\nThe issues were some of the several raised by lawyers for both sides in court Monday that resulted in the jury selection process' not beginning until the afternoon. Only nine potential jurors answered questions from Merchan's 42-question form — which included several questions about their political affiliations and views about Trump himself — before the end of the court day.\nTrump's eyes were closed during part of Monday's proceedings when Merchan was reading the potential jurors his instructions — creating speculation about whether he was asleep or just deep in thought.\nThe remaining jurors from the first pool will continue answering questions Tuesday morning before prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office and Trump's attorneys ask follow-up questions.\nAfter that, they'll move on to the next pool of 96. Merchan has estimated the process will take one to two weeks.\nAdam Reiss Dareh Gregorian\nPage 2",

How Trump has hobbled his legal team before the first witness is even called at his historic trial By Laura Jarrett For the better part of the last year, former President Donald Trump has sought to turn what would ordinarily amount to significant legal trouble into a political asset.\nFour indictments and one mugshot later, he's successfully managed to dodge any dip among his supporters. Yet now that he stepped into a no-frills Manhattan courtroom this week for the start of his first criminal trial, the legal downside of his political strategy has come into sharp view.\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know The rules of criminal procedure don't change, no matter the defendant, even for a former president. And the courtesies and customs recognized between seasoned prosecutors and defense lawyers begin to break down, if not completely collapse.\nIn a telling moment near the end of a long day in court Thursday, Trump's lead attorney, Todd Blanche, asked if he could get the names of the first three witnesses the prosecution intends to call. That's a routine and reasonable request. But the prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, rebuffed him.\nWhy? Because 'Mr. Trump has been tweeting about the witnesses,' Steinglass said. 'We're not telling them who the witnesses are. I'm sorry.'\nJudge Juan Merchan, who has been the subject of his own wave of attacks from the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, then said: 'I can't fault the People for that.'\nThe issue came up again late Friday afternoon, and the prosecution agreed to turn over the name of the first witness to the defense on Sunday. But the implication remains: Trump's legal team is facing a distinct strategic disadvantage with less time to plan cross-examinations of the state's witnesses. In other words, instead of being able to focus all weekend on prioritizing the expected testimony of just a few witnesses, all are up for grabs.\nAnd it's all because Trump has been railing against multiple witnesses online, and has only ramped up his vitriol in recent days, notwithstanding a court order directing him not to do so.\nThis is the year the legal and political lives of Trump have been on a collision course. The only difference is, now the side that's feeling the burn is his own team.\nTrump trial latest: Jury selection completed during a tense day inside and outside the courtroom By Adam Reiss, Lisa Rubin and Dareh Gregorian Opening statements are set to begin next week in Trump's criminal trial after the final members of the jury were seated Friday, following a dramatic day in which two prospective jurors broke down in tears, an appeals court judge rejected the former president's request for a stay, and a man set himself on fire in front of the New York City courthouse.\n'We're going to have opening statements on Monday morning. This trial is starting,' Merchan said towards the end of the day, after successfully seating the remaining five alternate jurors that were needed.\nThe case — the first-ever criminal trial of a former president — will be heard by a panel of 12 jurors and a total of six alternates. It's expected to last roughly six weeks.\nThe five alternates ultimately selected Friday include an unemployed married woman who's into art and described herself as not political, an audio professional, a contract specialist, a clothing company executive and a construction company project manager. It took four days of jury selection to find the 18 jurors.\nAround the same time the judge declared 'we have our full panel' inside the courtroom in the early afternoon, a man set himself on fire outside the courthouse. A spokesperson for the NYPD said the man was in critical condition. He appears to have had pamphlets describing a conspiracy involving cryptocurrency that he threw around before setting himself ablaze, police said.\nRead more from the fourth day of the Trump trial here →\nVolodymyr Zelensky and Joe Biden in 2023 in Washington, D.C. Drew Angerer / Getty Images file A pivotal moment for Biden, Ukraine and Congress By Kristen Welker A pivotal moment has arrived for President Joe Biden, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and House Speaker Mike Johnson.\nCan the GOP-led House pass the aid Ukraine says it needs in its two-year-old war against Russia?\nIf it does, is it already too late to help?\nHow much longer does Ukraine need assistance?\nAnd how much is riding on the outcome of the 2024 election, given Trump's past opposition to this aid?\nThese are among the questions that I plan to ask Zelenskyy on Sunday when I interview him on 'Meet the Press.'\nThe congressional fight for Ukraine aid has also underscored an important point about the Biden presidency: It's been largely defined — and unsettled — by events overseas.\nIt began with the botched and deadly U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021.\nThen there was Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.\nAnd then came the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack in Israel, which has led to a six-month war.\nJust in the past week, we saw Iran launch missile strikes and drones at Israel, while Israel responded Thursday night by carrying out what appears to be a limited response inside Iran.\n'We don't want to see this escalate. ... We're not looking for a wider war with Iran. ... I think, you know, the coming hours and days will tell us a lot,' National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told me last Sunday.\nHow foreign affairs has defined Biden's presidency has carried over with Russia's invasion of Ukraine — and with the current congressional drama over whether the U.S. will continue to provide Ukraine with the funding it needs.\nAll of it creates a fraught backdrop as the 2024 race heats up.\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

Mike Johnson faces his most perilous moment yet as House speaker By Sahil Kapur House Speaker Mike Johnson faces the biggest threat to his gavel nearly six months into the job, with the walls closing in from both sides of his divided Republican Party on providing aid to U.S. allies.\nAfter wavering for months and exhausting his timeouts, he's finally calling the play: a trigger for separate votes on four bills — assistance for Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and a hodgepodge of other national security priorities important to Republicans.\nEach one will have a unique coalition, and that's the point.\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know In theory, Israel aid can pass with mostly Republicans, over progressive opposition. Ukraine aid — structured as a loan — can pass with mostly Democrats, over conservative opposition. The GOP opponents of assisting Ukraine can vote against it, and the GOP proponents of giving the country weapons to fend off Russian aggression finally get off Johnson's back.\nMeanwhile, Johnson's public Republican opposition just doubled: Rep. Thomas Massie announced Tuesday that he would co-sponsor Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to remove him as speaker. Massie said he's 'pretty certain' Johnson has more GOP opponents today than the eight who ousted Kevin McCarthy as speaker in October, though he didn't name names.\n'Mike Johnson is going for the Triple Crown here against our base. He has voted for an omnibus that spends more than Pelosi. He's put his finger on the scales to pass FISA without warrants. And now he's about to do Ukraine without protecting our own border,' Massie said. 'This will get called and he will lose the vote.'\nTwo votes may not seem like much, but after this Friday, Johnson will have a staggering one-vote majority. Two defections and Johnson loses — unless Democrats step in to rescue him and vote against a motion to vacate. That would be extremely unusual, but some centrist Democrats say they'd do it, especially if Johnson brings up Ukraine aid.\n'He's got to manage his politics. And if they try and kick him out as speaker, I'm going to vote to keep him,' said Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y.\nMassie said a Democratic rescue would ultimately do more harm than good to Johnson.\n'Then he goes further in the hole with Republicans,' Massie said. 'He becomes toxic to the conference. For every Democrat who comes to his aid he'll lose 2-3 more Republicans. … There's no sustainable solution where Democrats save him.'\nAnd that sums up Johnson's dilemma: He can't govern with his far-right rebels, but he can't hold on to his job without them. The same dynamic became too much for McCarthy to navigate. Today, Johnson has an even slimmer majority.\nStill, he recognizes that he can't be cowed by such threats or he becomes fully captured by the agitators. And this could be the last major piece of business until the 2024 election, when voters will redetermine the makeup of Congress.\n'I am not resigning. And it is in my view an absurd notion that someone would bring a vacate motion when we are simply here trying to do our jobs,' Johnson told reporters. 'I am not concerned about this. I am going to do my job.'\nFirst jurors are seated in Trump's hush money trial Donald Trump during jury selection on the second day of his trial at Manhattan Criminal Court on Tuesday. Curtis Means / Getty Images pool By Adam Reiss, Dareh Gregorian, Jonathan Allen and Lisa Rubin The first seven jurors were selected Tuesday in Trump's hush money trial amid a battle over prospective jurors' old Facebook posts and calls to 'lock him up' and a warning from the judge that the former president should not try to intimidate the panelists who will be deciding his fate.\n'I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom. I want to make this crystal clear,' Judge Juan Merchan told Trump and his lawyer Todd Blanche. The judge told Blanche that Trump had 'audibly' said something in the direction of a juror while she was '12 feet away from your client.'\nMerchan said he didn't know what Trump said, but that he'd been 'muttering' and 'gesturing' at the juror, and directed Blanche to talk to his client about his behavior. Blanche then whispered something into Trump's ear.\nThe incident underscores Trump's penchant for acting up in court and the problems his lawyers might have keeping him in check.\nThe drama came on the second day of jury selection. The jury is anonymous so their names weren't used in open court, but the panelists include a salesman, an oncology nurse, an IT consultant, a teacher and a software engineer.\nOverall, the quest to find a jury of 12 people and six alternates who could be 'fair and impartial' when it comes to the polarizing New York native and former commander-in-chief moved at a brisker pace compared to Monday.\nThe trial doesn't sit on Wednesdays, so the process will resume on Thursday.\nRead more on the second day of the Trump trial here →\nTrump needs a different type of swing voter in Manhattan Analysis by Steve Kornacki Trump's legal team argues that the former president faces 'real potential prejudice' in his hush money trial because of its venue: Manhattan, the bluest borough in one of the bluest big cities in America.\nWhether this could actually have any bearing on the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's ability to receive a fair trial is a matter of debate. But simply in terms of its political leanings, Manhattan's partisan bent is stark.\nAs a whole, New York City backed Joe Biden over Trump by a 76-23% margin in 2020. But of the five boroughs that comprise the Big Apple, it was Manhattan that produced Biden's most lopsided margins:\nEach of these boroughs features its own particular demographic and political mix. The lone red redoubt of Staten Island, for instance, has by far the smallest population and is more suburban in character, with considerable local support for secession from the rest of the city.\nThe other four boroughs are densely populated Democratic bastions. But even among these four, Manhattan stands out. Why is it a shade or two bluer than the others? A comparison of its demographics to those of the city as a whole reveals an explanation:\nSimply put, compared to New York City overall, Manhattan is whiter and wealthier and contains a much deeper concentration of white residents with college degrees. That's a demographic mix that, especially in the Trump era, has been political gold for Democrats.\nRegistered voters in Manhattan (one of the sources from which potential jurors are drawn) are more than 10 times more likely to be Democrats (72%) than Republicans (7%). Political engagement runs higher in Manhattan as well: While it accounts for 19.2% of the city's population, it represented 22.9% of all New York City votes cast in 2020.\nThe combination of its size, turnout level and partisan tendencies makes Manhattan one of the biggest single sources of Democratic votes anywhere in the country. To put this in perspective, the 603,040 votes Biden received in Manhattan in 2020 was larger than his total in 20 states.\nWhen it comes to his legal fate in Manhattan, Trump is going to need a very different kind of swing voter.\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

            "summary": "President Joe Biden will on Tuesday deliver a speech in Florida denouncing that state's new six-week abortion ban and other efforts to restrict abortion access across the country, according to Biden campaign aides who shared details of the trip first with NBC News.\nAt the event, which is scheduled to take place in Tampa about one week before the state law is set to go into effect, the president will talk about the 'the stakes of this election for reproductive freedom across the entire country.'\nBiden will also tie Florida's restrictions on the procedure to other consequences of Roe v. Wade being overturned in 2022, including the Arizona state Supreme Court decision last week which upheld a near-total abortion ban dating from 1864, according to the aides.\n'From Arizona to Florida, more and more Americans are seeing up close the devastating impact of Trump overturning Roe v. Wade,' Morgan Mohr, senior advisor for reproductive rights for the Biden-Harris campaign, said in a statement. 'While Donald Trump continues to brag about unleashing these extreme and dangerous bans, President Joe Biden is running to restore reproductive freedom. Since the overturning of Roe, whenever reproductive rights have been on the ballot, they have won, and this November will be no different.'\nThe event is significant for Biden: While voicing full support for abortion access, he has often looked to Vice President Kamala Harris to be the administration's most prominent voice on the issue. Since the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturned the federal right to abortion, Harris has held more than 80 events across 20 states focused on reproductive freedom, including delivering a speech last week in Arizona criticizing the ban in that state and tying in former President Donald Trump's role allowing abortion restrictions to take place.\nOn Tuesday, though, Biden will take center stage on the issue. The president is expected to attack Trump for saying he is proud of appointing the Supreme Court justices who made overturning Roe v. Wade possible, as well as for other comments related to recently enacted state abortion bans. Biden is also expected to say that if re-elected, Trump and his allies will enact a federal abortion ban, though Trump has recently claimed he would not do so, saying instead that he wanted the issue left to the states.\nMeanwhile, the Biden-Harris campaign has been hammering Republicans as more and more states restrict abortion. The campaign has rolled out emotional ads focused on the issue and has used women impacted by the abortion restrictions as campaign surrogates across the country.\nBiden's trip to Tampa is part of the campaign's broader effort to nationalize the fallout and the conversation around state abortion bans. The campaign sees Florida's abortion ban as especially salient because, once in effect, the six-week ban will impact the entire Southeast, given that many women have previously traveled to Florida from states with stricter abortion bans to get abortions.\nYamiche Alcindor",

            "excerpt": "Analysis: Don't discount voters' interest in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s third-party candidacy, even if he seems to be trying not to be taken seriously.",
            "summary": "What happens when an electorate wants change but there's no obvious change candidate on the ballot?\nThis question popped into my head after I watched one of Rich Thau's fascinating monthly focus groups of Biden-Trump voters, with the latest edition convening Pennsylvania voters who voted once for either President Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton and once for former President Donald Trump.\nThau has been doing these qualitative monthly check-ins with voters across the country ever since the rise of Trump. For the 2020 election cycle, he gathered voters who voted Obama-Trump. Now, he has shifted the voter résumé to the mix of folks above, still focusing on people who have switched their votes election to election. (Thau and his company, Engagious, are also partnering with NBC News on another recurring focus group project gathering key voting groups in battleground states.) You can see some of the archived focus groups at his website. This is one of those projects that become exponentially more impactful with each new monthly addition to the archives, so pay attention!\nThe headline-grabber for this month's Pennsylvania check-in was the surprising level of interest in Robert F. Kennedy Jr. among these swing voters. In some ways, this shouldn't be a surprise. These voters are by definition not hard partisans, and they certainly aren't pleased with either major party, as they've been comfortable voting against both of them over the last two elections.\nAs I wrote months ago, there was always going to be a moment in this campaign cycle when both major parties had finished their nominating processes and selected Biden and Trump — and yet the public wasn't satisfied with that outcome. We are at that moment.\nSix months ago, while we knew his trials were always going to be a disruptive moment for Trump, it wasn't clear how much other issues were going to be disruptive to Biden. But clearly, the Middle East is becoming a hugely disruptive political issue for him.\nIronically, it was this moment in the calendar that the folks at No Labels had once identified as the perfect time to pick their ticket and start selling it publicly. The convergence of a front-loaded primary calendar with ballot deadlines made it inevitable that an April lull would be an ideal opportunity to fill an obvious void. This spring period in 1992, after it became clear that Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush would be their parties' nominees, was when Ross Perot got an opening — and he used it brilliantly. The strongest 90-day period for Perot's campaign was essentially April 1 to mid-July (the start of the Democratic convention).\nUltimately, No Labels failed to find a compelling ticket, so it has since called off its effort. But No Labels didn't fail because the vacuum of people looking for an alternative to Biden and Trump ceased to exist.\nWith no mainstream third-party alternative available for now, that vacuum is being filled by Kennedy. For many voters, one can tell, he's simply a famous name filling a void. You can hear the lack of knowledge many of these Pennsylvania voters had about Kennedy other than his name, and those who knew something about him knew only a few things. Moreover, it was clear that his best asset was the fact that his last name was neither Trump nor Biden.\nWatching the initial interest in Kennedy's candidacy among these voters serves as a reminder that there was a powerful opportunity for a true potential unity ticket — not one that professed 'centrism' per se, but one that promised to take a partisan timeout for four years and attempt to focus on hard choices to solve hard problems, like immigration.\nBut given the stakes of this election, it has also been clear to me that while an opening exists with the true middle-of-the-road or less partisan crowd, the lane is very narrow. And unless partisans from one or both parties also wanted an alternative, there really wasn't a path to victory.\nBut there is a path to relevancy.\nI'm convinced that if Kennedy were merely just anti-Covid vaccine, rather than anti-most vaccines, the voters he needs to persuade wouldn't view him as skeptically, and that would make others take him more seriously. Every one of these new measles outbreaks around the country has the fingerprints of the anti-vax crowd on it, and whether those outbreaks are in South Florida or Northern California or Oklahoma or elsewhere, they all serve as a reminder that anti-vaccine messaging has done real damage to real human beings.\nDespite all of that, the initial interest in Kennedy does tell me that he is going to be a very powerful 'none of the above' candidate on the ballot.\nNationally I think it's pretty clear Kennedy pulls from both Trump and Biden about evenly, reinforcing this notion he's most likely a placeholder for 'none of the above.' Where this will get tricky is in the battleground states, because I'm not as convinced Kennedy will pull evenly from the two major candidates when you start to measure this in Michigan versus North Carolina or Arizona versus Wisconsin.\nNot all anti-Biden and anti-Trump voters around the country act the same. Military veterans in North Carolina who choose to vote for Kennedy, say, may also vote GOP down the ballot, but they don't trust Trump as commander in chief. And while those votes won't hurt the GOP in other ways, they will lower Trump's support and give Biden a lower 'winning' number to carry North Carolina. If Biden can make 47% a winning number in North Carolina, he'll carry the state.\nKennedy could also become a place to park votes for folks uncomfortable with Biden's execution of foreign policy, particularly all things having to do with Israel and Gaza.\nThat same math problem could affect the Democrats if, say, a big chunk of progressive voters in Michigan or Wisconsin decides both Trump and Biden have the same basic policy toward Israel and they vote for Kennedy as a protest vote. Perhaps that wouldn't hurt Democrats down the ballot in either state, but it would lower the winning number Trump needs to carry either. As in North Carolina for Biden, if Trump can make 47% a winning number in Wisconsin or Michigan, he'll carry it.\nI don't foresee Kennedy's getting north of 'none of the above' territory come Election Day, but the likelihood that he continues to poll in double digits until at least October seems high. And if that means he ends up qualifying for the national debates, then we could enter some rarely charted territory.\nIf he's in the debates, it's a potential opportunity for Kennedy. But I'm hesitant to believe he can make the most of that opportunity, because, so far, every time he has had a chance to grab a mainstream spotlight, he has instead either eagerly traveled down rabbit holes marked 'vaccines' and 'Jan. 6' and 'Kennedy conspiracies' or he has gotten so defensive when asked about them that it quickly derails him.\nDespite every effort by voters wanting to take Kennedy seriously as a candidate, he has a hard time presenting himself as a serious candidate.\nI am curious whether, in a moment when both Trump and Biden are proactively going after Kennedy, the combination of being attacked by both major-party nominees has a bizarre boomerang effect that boosts the independent, especially if Trump and Biden are attacking him for different things.\nBottom line: Pay attention to Kennedy and to voters' flirtation with his candidacy. It has nothing to do with Kennedy the person and everything to do with Trump and Biden. The stronger Kennedy looks in the polls, the more it appears to be a direct reflection on the collective weakness of the two parties. And the stronger he looks in the fall, the more variance you should expect in how the battleground states shake out.\nWhen the news became a reality TV show To say I have a lot of thoughts about O.J. Simpson is an understatement. For one: The impact he had on the news industry and the TV consumption habits of all Americans is quite remarkable.\nLooking back, I now realize the entire O.J. experience — from the feeding frenzy coverage the week Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were murdered to the multiple televised trials over the following three years — is probably one of the five most impactful events to happen in my lifetime.\nObviously, 9/11 tops that list, as does the election of the country's first Black president. I was a teenager when the Challenger space shuttle exploded on live television, and I distinctly remember heading to a Cub Scout meeting the day Ronald Reagan was shot. After those four events, 'where were you when O.J. was in the White Bronco?' is probably next. (I was co-hosting a house party that Friday evening, if you must know.)\nBut looking back, the profound impact Simpson had was on how media and its consumers interact.\nI'd argue that pre-O.J., the news business was a healthy mix of delivering information you needed to know balanced with information we knew you wanted to know. And I'd argue what that episode taught news executives was that the 'news' could be profitable if you packaged it in a way that made consumers want to watch! What if you simply gave consumers what they wanted to know or hear and didn't drive them away by giving them information they didn't want to know or hear?\nneeded to know balanced with information we knew you wanted to know. And I'd argue what that episode taught news executives was that the 'news' could be profitable if you packaged it in a way that made consumers want to watch! What if you simply gave consumers what they wanted to know or hear and didn't drive them away by giving them information they didn't want to know or hear? Thirty years later, I think the media-industrial complex has learned how to deliver everyone what they want to hear to the point that people can live in different realities. We don't have a shared set of facts anymore, because the news business is stuck with a revenue model that provides financial incentives for catering to whoever it thinks are their readers or consumers.\nSadly, it's hard to explain to anyone who was born after the Simpson trial that a different media landscape did exist before. While news networks always wanted more eyeballs, there was a line between news and entertainment that wouldn't get crossed. In trying to explain this pre-O.J. world to my 17-year-old and to some college students I've been meeting with weekly this semester, I realized how hard it's going to be to try to go back to some of the old ways we did business.\nUltimately, you go to war with the army you have, not the one you want. But I hope, as we all look back at the O.J. saga of the '90s and all the bad decisions that were made in the attempt to make that coverage more compelling to viewers, that we don't repeat many of them as we gear up for coverage of at least one, and perhaps two, trials of the century this spring and summer — involving another celebrity from the '70s and the '80s.\nCameras in the courts: Hot take alert I've been unofficially polling friends and colleagues with the following question: When have cameras in the courtroom been truly a good thing for the public as a whole?\nI started from a position of 'I've yet to find one example.' But there was one televised trial that made me hesitate for a minute: the trial of the cops involved in the killing of George Floyd. I think a strong argument can be made that more good than bad came from the televised testimony in that trial.\nBut outside that example, I'm struggling. I don't think cameras were a net plus for the public with Simpson. Ditto Johnny Depp. Now, just because I'm a no-camera guy doesn't mean I'm anti-transparency. I think audio-only, which the Supreme Court temporarily gave us during the Covid-19 pandemic, should become the norm, with all trials available live via audio.\nBut the more I see cameras in the courtroom, the less I believe they have been a net positive for understanding the courts or the justice system. It's clear all the televised courts have given us is access to cheap and free reality TV programming. Click.",

First jurors in Trump hush money trial are chosen The first seven jurors in Donald Trump's hush money trial have been chosen, a process that got off to a bumpy start yesterday as New Yorkers were pressed about whether they could fairly judge the former president. The selected jurors include a former waiter, an oncology nurse, an attorney, an IT consultant, a teacher and a software engineer. Their names won't be used in open court. They were told to return Monday, signaling that the selection process will be finished by the end of the week. The court still needs to select five more jurors and likely six alternates.\nTrump's lawyers excavated ancient social media posts, asked jurors to explain inconsistent answers on their questionnaires and tried to strike from the pool of candidates they feared could spell danger for their case. At one point, Judge Juan Merchan read unflattering memes about Trump after apologizing in case it caused offense.

Mayorkas impeachment trial could be a swift ordeal Republicans are hoping to drag out the impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, but they might not get that what they wish for. This afternoon, an impeachment trial will kick off with all 100 senators getting sworn in as jurors. Then, Senate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, are expected to quickly move to dismiss or table the two impeachment articles against Mayorkas and move on to other business. A conviction against Mayorkas is likely impossible because none of the Senate's 51 Democrats have said they support his impeachment.\nMayorkas is charged with 'high crimes and misdemeanors' for failing to enforce immigration and border security laws and for knowingly lying under oath in Congress.

Autopsy for ‘Unabomber' Ted Kaczynski details cancer, depression before death John Youngbear / AP file An autopsy report for Ted Kaczynski, the domestic terrorist known as the 'Unabomber,' shows that he was diagnosed with rectal cancer and 'was noted to be depressed' before his death last year at the age of 81. The report, obtained 10 months after his death by suicide, offers new details into Kaczysnki's health and final months and raises questions about whether his death was preventable.\nKaczynski was diagnosed with rectal cancer in March 2021, and he received biweekly chemotherapy until March 2023, medical examiners said. About a month before Kaczynski's death, an oncologist noted that he 'appeared depressed.' On June 10, 2023, Kaczynski attempted suicide, and later died at a hospital.\nWhether Kaczynski's depression resulted in a suicide watch is unclear. But given Kaczynski's status within the federal prison system, one expert says 'it's somewhat surprising' he was able to end his life. Read the exclusive story here.\nRead the exclusive story here. Boeing whistleblower doubles down ahead of Senate hearing A Boeing whistleblower is expected to testify before a U.S. Senate subcommittee today about his concerns with the company's 787 Dreamliner, which he said is unsafe to fly and could 'drop to the ground' midflight unless problems are addressed. Sam Salehpour, a former quality engineer for Boeing, first raised his allegations publicly last week. He said the company has yet to properly address tiny nonconforming gaps found in multiple planes after two sections of their fuselages were joined together during assembly. The \"safety issues,\" he said, could lead to catastrophic outcomes.\nSalehpour doubled down on those claims yesterday in an interview with 'NBC Nightly News.' When asked if he would put his own family on a 787 right now, Salehpour didn't hesitate. 'Right now, I would not,' he said. Watch the full interview here.\nWatch the full interview here.

Tammy Baldwin fights to maintain appeal in Wisconsin's Trump country By Sarah Dean REEDSBURG, Wis. — Dairy farmer Randy Roecker is at a breaking point — and he blames it partly on President Joe Biden, so is planning to vote for Donald Trump for a third time this November.\n'Farmers are hurting like you wouldn't believe, and I myself, I am to the point of throwing up my hands and saying I'm done,' said Roecker, who cited inflation as straining his business for the last two years.\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know But while he's planning to vote on booting the Democratic president, Roecker's also planning to vote to keep his Democratic senator, Tammy Baldwin.\n'I support her all the way. I mean, no question,' Roecker said. 'And everybody I know — the farmers — everybody says that she's great for Wisconsin agriculture.'\nBaldwin is bracing for a tough re-election race against likely Republican nominee Eric Hovde, a multimillionaire and bank owner, in the evenly divided Wisconsin, one of a handful of states that will determine which party controls the Senate. But she has the advantage of incumbency, and has often outperformed other statewide Democrats in rural areas, even as the party as a whole has lost significant ground in those regions in recent decades.\nBaldwin is already pouring more effort into rural campaigning this year as she prepares for the challenge of sharing the ballot with one of the forces driving GOP margins in rural areas sky-high. Unlike her first two races for the Senate, in 2012 and 2018, Donald Trump will be running this November, too.\nLate last month, Baldwin sat around a kitchen table with Roecker and others from the Farmer Angel Network for a 90-minute discussion about farmers' mental health. The event was part of the senator's 'Dairyland' tour through 19 counties, none of them among Wisconsin's five most populated counties.\n'I think that there has been a real opportunity for me to be a champion for issues that I might not hear about if I only was going to the population centers of the state,' Baldwin told reporters at a stop at the New Glarus Brewing Co.\nRead more →\nWhy you shouldn't discount voters' interest in RFK Jr. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Mario Tama / Getty Images Analysis by Chuck Todd What happens when an electorate wants change but there's no obvious change candidate on the ballot?\nThis question popped into my head after I watched one of the fascinating monthly focus groups organized by Rich Thau, the president of the research group Engagious, with the latest edition convening Pennsylvania voters who voted once for either Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton and once for Donald Trump.\nThe headline-grabber for this month's check-in was the surprising level of interest in Robert F. Kennedy Jr. among these swing voters. In some ways, this shouldn't be a surprise. These voters are by definition not hard partisans, and they certainly aren't pleased with either major party, as they've been comfortable voting against both of them over the last two elections.\nAs I wrote months ago, there was always going to be a moment in this campaign cycle when both major parties had finished their nominating processes and selected Biden and Trump — and yet the public wasn't satisfied with that outcome. We are at that moment.\nWith no mainstream third-party alternative available for now, that vacuum is being filled by Kennedy. For many voters, one can tell, he's simply a famous name filling a void. You can hear the lack of knowledge many of these Pennsylvania voters had about Kennedy other than his name, and those who knew something about him knew only a few things. Moreover, it was clear that his best asset was the fact that his last name was neither Trump nor Biden.\nWatching the initial interest in Kennedy's candidacy among these voters serves as a reminder that there was a powerful opportunity for a true potential unity ticket — not one that professed 'centrism' per se, but one that promised to take a partisan timeout for four years and attempt to focus on hard choices to solve hard problems, like immigration.\nBut given the stakes of this election, it has also been clear to me that while an opening exists with the true middle-of-the-road or less partisan crowd, the lane is very narrow. And unless partisans from one or both parties also wanted an alternative, there really wasn't a path to victory.\nBut there is a path to relevancy.\nRead more from Chuck here →\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

            "summary": "PITTSBURGH — President Joe Biden will call for tripling tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum Wednesday when he speaks to union members in battleground Pennsylvania.\nBiden, who is set to speak at the headquarters of the United Steel Workers, is in the middle of a three-day swing through the state focusing on economic issues, while his opponent, former President Donald Trump, faces jury selection in New York in his trial on charges he falsified business records to cover up an alleged affair with an adult film star.\nThe Biden administration says China is overproducing goods to export to the U.S., driving down prices and hurting the American economy because higher-quality U.S. products must compete with artificially low-priced alternatives.\nThe current average tariff on steel and aluminum from China is 7.5%, and Biden is calling on the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative — the federal agency charged with developing U.S. trade policy — to triple the tariff rate.\nBiden is also directing his administration to work with Mexico to prevent China's evasion of tariffs on steel and aluminum that's imported from Mexico into the U.S. The trade representative's office is also launching an investigation into China's trade practices in the shipbuilding, maritime and logistics sectors.\nStill, critics argue increased tariffs would backfire and raise consumer prices and inflation. China has denied the overcapacity accusation as 'groundless,' and it accuses the U.S. of trying to prevent global competition.\n'If taken, these actions will not increase inflation,' a senior administration official said. 'But they will protect American jobs and the steel industry.'\nBiden has been ramping up his economic rhetoric against China. So has Trump, who has said he'd consider a 60% tariff on all Chinese imports.\nDuring his administration, Trump imposed new tariffs on imports of washing machines, solar panels, steel, aluminum and billions of dollars' worth of goods from China. The new levies amounted to a tax increase of $80 billion a year, according to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit tax policy group. Biden has kept most of Trump's China tariffs.\nThe push comes amid the White House's controversial opposition to a buyout of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel. Shareholders just approved the potential deal, but it faces stiff backlash from union members and Biden, who has redoubled his efforts to ally himself with unions after he joined a picket line with the United Auto Workers last year and won the endorsement of the United Steel Workers.\nWith polls showing Biden trailing Trump significantly when it comes to voters' perception of who would better handle the economy, the White House is touting that nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs have been created during the Biden administration and that construction employment is at a record high.\nSome see the crackdown on China as an acknowledgment that the Biden administration needs to do more to show it's taking the reins of an unpopular economy.\n'It has nothing to do with elections,' a senior administration official said. 'I think it has to do with the fact that we're actually acting from a place of self-confidence and strength because our economy is growing and manufacturing is rebounding.'\nBut John Basalyga, a developer in Scranton who adamantly backs Trump, blames the Biden administration for the rising costs of doing business.\nBiden 'says his policies are helping middle America,' he said. 'Just walk around and ask the real people of this country and they'll tell you the exact opposite.'\nThe White House hopes the push for higher tariffs on China will resonate with blue-collar voters in Biden's native Pennsylvania. Joe Padavan, a retired steelworker from Wilkes-Barre, said Biden has stood up for union members and stood up to China — and he doesn't blame him for high inflation or rising prices.\n'The problem today is corporate greed more than anything,' Padavan said. 'So hopefully by putting on some tariffs, it's going to bring some of our people here. Why pay the tariffs when you could build it here?'\nGabe Gutierrez Bianca Seward",

            "summary": "LAKE HAVASU CITY, Ariz. — Arizona GOP Senate hopeful Kari Lake told supporters they can \"strap on a Glock\" to be prepared for the intensity of the 2024 campaign and urged military and law enforcement veterans to be \"ready,\" as her race heats up in a key battleground state.\n'We need to send people to Washington, D.C., that the swamp does not want there,' Lake said toward the end of a Sunday speech to a crowd of Arizonans in Mohave County. 'And I can think of a couple people they don't want there. First on that list is Donald J. Trump; second is Kari Lake.'\nShe described standing up to the 'swamp' in Washington, saying: 'They can't bribe me, they can blackmail me. That's what they don't want me in Washington, D.C. And that's exactly what President Trump wants me they're fighting with him.'\n'He's willing to sacrifice everything I am. That's why they're coming after us with lawfare, they're going to come after us with everything. That's why the next six months is going to be intense. And we need to strap on our — let's see. What do we want to strap on?' Lake asked as some in the crowd chuckled. 'We're going to strap on our, our seat belt. We're going to put on our helmet or your Kari Lake ball cap. We are going to put on the armor of God. And maybe strap on a Glock on the side of us just in case.'\n'We're not going to be the victims of crime,' Lake continued. 'We're not going to have our Second Amendment taken away. We're certainly not going to have our First Amendment taken away by these tyrants.'\nEarlier in the roughly 30-minute remarks, Lake gave another warning about the period between now and Election Day.\n'The next six months are going to be difficult. If you are not ready for action, and I have a feeling with as many veterans and former law enforcement, active law enforcement' — Lake paused to ask for a show of hands — '… you guys are ready for it,' Lake said to her supporters. 'It's going to be a crazy run, the next six months. This is the moment we have to save our country.'\nLake's campaign declined to comment when asked to clarify the point of her remarks and whether she was implying there might be political violence in the next six months.\nWhile Lake didn't explicitly warn of political violence, that's how one of her supporters took her rhetoric.\n'They're gonna do everything they can to disrupt the election, whether it's another pandemic, whether it's going to be inciting the civil war,' said Geenee Roe, 63, when asked about Lake's speech afterward. The event included a raffle of an AR-15-style rifle.\nNBC News asked the Lake Havasu City resident, who plans to vote for Trump and Lake in 2024, if she believed another American civil war is a concrete possibility.\n'The signs are all there,' said Roe, who believes the political left is trying to push the MAGA movement into trouble. 'Saying the MAGA people are bad, that we incite riots — and the whole J6 thing that happened, that was all a setup for sure,' said Roe, referencing the debunked conspiracy theory that the Jan. 6 Capitol riot was a ploy to frame Trump and his supporters.\nLake's comments came in Arizona's northwest Mohave County, which broke for Trump with 75% of the vote in the 2020 presidential election. The Senate hopeful is setting her sights on an even larger margin in 2024.\n'If Mohave County shows up 100% or close to it, they can't cheat their way out of this in Maricopa County, no matter what they do,' Lake said, leaning on a signature talking point.\nLake has continually rejected the 2020 election results, which saw President Joe Biden narrowly defeat Trump in Arizona, and the 2022 election results, which saw her bid for governor fail by a slightly wider margin. Court cases and other reviews of the results have not found evidence of fraud or malfeasance affecting the election results. And in March, Lake decided not to contest her liability in a defamation suit brought by a Republican election official in Maricopa County.\nStephen Richer, the Maricopa County recorder, who plays a key role in election administration, filed a defamation claim against Lake in June alleging that she 'repeatedly and falsely accused' him of causing her electoral defeat in the race for governor won by Democrat Katie Hobbs. Lake's legal team recently filed a default judgment motion that indicated she was not challenging her culpability. She instead will argue against damages in the case.\nShe continued questioning the integrity of Maricopa County's election results on Sunday.\n'You all know what goes on in Maricopa County. I mean, you know that you know, the garbage that they're pushing down there,' Lake said of Arizona's most populous county, where Richer and the Republican-controlled board of supervisors run local elections.\n'We're gonna need all these counties outside of Maricopa County to show up, and I'm counting on Mohave County to lead the way,' Lake said.\nAlex Tabet",

And, history lessons.

Welcome to Sunday, it's Meet the Press.\nANNOUNCER:\nFrom NBC News in Washington, the longest-running show in television history. This is Meet the Press with Kristen Welker.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nGood Sunday morning. We begin with our brand new NBC News poll and the headline President Biden is closing the gap with former President Trump. Trump leads Biden by two points in a head-to-head matchup, 46 to 44%. Biden has narrowed that deficit against Trump from 5 points in January. And when third party candidates, including Robert F. Kennedy, are included, Biden leads by two points, 39 to 37%. The president's job approval has also ticked up to 42%, up five points from January. The last time we've seen a five-point increase for an incumbent president in their re-election year was Bill Clinton in 1996. There are still troubling numbers in the poll for Biden. He trails Trump by 22 points on dealing with inflation and the cost of living. All of it comes amid a major foreign policy development. Six months after the president delivered an Oval Office speech pleading for wartime aid for Ukraine, $61 billion dollars in new funding finally passed on Saturday 311 to 112.\n[START TAPE]\nREP. MARC MOLINARO:\nThe bill is passed.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nA moment of bipartisanship in a Congress primarily defined by its dysfunction. 101 Republicans and 210 Democrats voted in favor. But more Republicans, 112, opposed it. Congress also passed new aid for Israel and Taiwan, along with a measure to force TikTok parent company ByteDance to sell the app. New aid for Ukraine came only after Republican Speaker Mike Johnson, who once opposed it, did an about-face and put his job on the line to get it through, amid threats from three far right Republicans to oust him.\n[START TAPE]\nSPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON:\nIf we turn our backs right now, the consequences could be devastating.\nREPORTER:\nYou're being asked to resign, will you?\nSPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON:\nNo, listen, I – I – as I've said many times I don't walk around this building being worried about a motion to vacate. I have to do my job. We – we did. I've done here what I believe to be the right thing and that is to allow the house to work its will and as I've said you do the right thing and you let the chips fall where they may.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThe Pentagon has said it has a massive infusion of military aid for Ukraine ready to go. It comes as Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said that without this support, we will have no chance of winning. Ukraine's top military commander issued a bleak assessment of the army's positions on the eastern front, saying they have worsened significantly in recent days. And the top American military commander in Europe told members of Congress that Russia will soon be able to fire ten shells for every Ukrainian shell.\n[START TAPE]\nGEN. CHRISTOPHER CAVOLI:\nIf one side can shoot and the other side can't shoot back, the side that can't shoot back loses.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nJoining me now is the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. President Zelenskyy, welcome back to Meet the Press.\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nGood morning, and greetings to you.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, President Zelenskyy, it is an historic morning. I want to get your reaction to this major news, the House approving $61 billion in aid to Ukraine. It's expected to pass through the Senate. But you have been asking for this aid for six months. In that time, you have run out of ammunition. You've suffered setbacks on the battlefield. Will you get this aid in time to make a difference?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nYeah, it's been so important. And we'd like to say thanks to the Congress for the bipartisan support. And we'd like to say thanks to Speaker Johnson and President Biden. Indeed, it is so important, the support from the United States of America. Of course, we need the support of the American people because, of course, the political decisions depend on the public opinion. And this aid will strengthen Ukraine, and send the Kremlin a powerful signal that it will not be the second Afghanistan. The United States will stay with Ukraine, will protect the Ukrainians, and they will protect – they will protect democracy in the world. This is the show of leadership and strength of the United States. And I think, indeed, now we've reached this important moment. For half a year we've been waiting and I would like to say thanks to all the team on my side and on the U.S. side, the team who did everything so that we would get this positive vote. And today, we definitely need this aid. And Kristen, we really need to get this to the final point. We need to get it approved by the Senate. And then we want to get things as fast as possible so that we get some tangible assistance for the soldiers on the front line as soon as possible, not in another six months, so that they will be able to move ahead.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou know, you said this week, President Zelenskyy, that Ukraine would have 'no chance of winning' without more U.S. support. And I guess the question is can Ukraine now win this war? Or is the United States merely giving you enough aid to prolong this war?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nThank you. I think this support will really strengthen the armed forces of Ukraine. And we will have a chance for victory if Ukraine really gets the weapon system which we need so much. We - thousands of soldiers need so much, and this aid should not be just spread into layers all over, but it has to end up in tangible weapon systems. Some really crucial weapon systems which are hard to get. The long-range artillery and I really appreciate that it mentions ATACMs, long-range weapons. And it's important because we need long-range weapons to not lose people on the front line. Because we have – we have casualties because we cannot reach that far. Our weapons are not that long-range. So we need it, and air defense. This is crucial. These are the priorities now.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, as you know, this aid was held up for half a year because there is fierce opposition to sending war aid to Ukraine, particularly amongst some Republicans. How long should Americans be expected to fund the war in Ukraine?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nThe Americans are not funding the war in Ukraine. They foremost protect freedom and democracy all over Europe. And Ukraine is fighting, and Ukraine is sending its best sons and daughters to the front line and this reduces the price for all Europe, for all NATO. It reduces the price for everyone, including the U.S. as the leaders in NATO. U.S. army now does not have to fight protecting NATO countries. Ukrainians are doing that. And it's only the ammo that the civilized world is providing. And I think it's a good decision. That is why we do need to keep supporting. While Ukraine stands, there's no direct war between U.S. or NATO and Russian aggression. So Ukraine is still fighting, and Ukraine is protecting all the others.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nBut President Zelenskyy, can you give Americans a sense of the timeline? Will you still need as much aid this time next year? Or do you think you can turn the corner on Russia? What's the timeline?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nWell, it depends on when we actually get weapons on the ground, as you said it Kristen. If we get it in half a year. Well, we've had the process to hold for half a year. And we had losses in several directions. The losses in men, in equipment. In the east it was very difficult. And we did lose the initiative there. Now we have all the chance to stabilize the situation and to overtake the initiative. And that's why we need to actually have the weapon systems. When we get it, when we have it in our arms, then we do have the chance to take this initiative and to move ahead to protect Ukraine. But giving U.S. specific timeline of the war, well, it depends on how soon we get this aid. There are so many variables, so many factors. And sometimes when we protect the important line, you retreat because you don't have enough forces and equipment. And then retaking the climb would take two or three times more. And I'm not saying that this is how it's going to end up. But things are possible, and I can give you an example with F-16. It's a great example. The decision to supply F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, we've had it a year ago. One year ago, we got the positive response. Ukraine should receive these fighter jets, so that not only air defense could protect the sky, but we also have more than jets. A year has passed. We still don't have the jets in Ukraine. So it's very difficult to do any forecast. I would like us to be open and very, very specific. From the moment we get our hands on these weapon systems, well, from that moment, we can talk about the timeline.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, Ukrainian intelligence suggests that the Kremlin is preparing for a major offensive in the coming months. You have said by your own account that they are prepared to outgun you ten to one in fire power by some estimations. Will you be ready for that offensive?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nWe are preparing. The personnel is preparing. The soldiers are engaged in training. And I don't want to repeat myself, but we are waiting for the weapon systems because we want to have the brigades fully equipped. Some of them are exhausted. We need to replace them. But these new brigades, they have to have the equipment. Russia wants to mobilize 300,000 people by June 1st. We are getting ready for this. By May 9th, Russia expects that in the east of Ukraine they will take Chasiv Yar city. I visited the region recently. I talked to the soldiers. The soldiers say that they lack equipment. They need to fight Russian reconnaissance drones, which essentially guide the artillery and we need artillery shells. I hope we will be able to stay, and the weapons will come on time, and we will repel the enemy and then we'll break the plans of the Russian Federation with regards to this full-scale offensive.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nI want to ask you, President Zelenskyy, about reports of a lack of morale. Some 650,000 men who are eligible to fight, we are told, have fled Ukraine. You have lowered the draft eligible age, but you've resisted a full call-up of all Ukrainian men. What do you say to young men who don't want to fight, who don't want to risk their lives in this war for their country?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nThis war is the war for the sake of all of us. This is our land. We don't have another place to go. And the citizens of Ukraine understand that. Of course, there are people who don't want to, are not ready. But we do have this mobilization campaign. We do have the draft. We do have a strong army. And we can be frank. In Russia, of course they have more people and people are forced there. So, for example, if someone in Russia is deserting the battlefield, they just shoot them on sight. We cannot do that because we have the democratic values, believe in the democratic country. So, to be frank, in Ukraine we have a lot of people who are ready to protect the motherland. But of course the motivation, the morale can go down, especially when they go to the front line and they see that, well, there are no shells. There is no equipment. That's why the aid from the states is so important. And people need to be trained by professional people and they need to have the equipment to be used so that they have this so people, not only on the training field, but also on the actual battlefield. And then, indeed, they can show the performance on the front line. This is very important.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy –\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\n– And then the morale will go high. And then they will indeed defend the motherland.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThe Washington Post is reporting that Donald Trump has said privately he could end Russia's war in Ukraine by pressuring Ukraine to give up some territory like Crimea, like the Donbas region. What is your reaction and realistically speaking do you see this war ending in a negotiation with Russia.\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nLet's just say that, well, I'm a president of a country at war. And rumors and different hearsay, I don't believe that. When Trump comes here and would tell me their formula of peace, then I would be able to provide the response. At the moment, I know that, well, things Putin wants to show, they cannot happen.And I'm sure that people who know him well, they know. But you can never trust Putin. It's impossible. So the strategy of ending the war should be based not on the words which Putin says or some other people from his entourage say, but on something very specific. Something – something very tangible in Ukraine that is independent and democratic. And I'm confident that everyone is interested in that. All the political leaders in the U.S., they are also interested to have Ukraine independent and sovereign and democratic. It's of interest for both the Republicans and the Democrats.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, back in February Donald Trump encouraged Putin to invade NATO countries that he doesn't believe are contributing enough to defense spending. What kind of a message do you think that sends to the world?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nWell, I don't know the details of that speech. I know for sure if Ukraine fails, then Putin – then Putin definitely will invade the Baltic countries. Why? Not because there's some interesting idea, strategy, but because Putin wants to return the influence of the Soviet Union. And he really wants to retake the force to war. He wants to retake all former Soviet republics and now independent states. Whether they are in the NATO or not, he doesn't care. That is why this is his strategy. Of course, after the Baltic states, also Poland and parts of Germany would also –\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, big picture. Germany's top military official has warned that Putin could be ready to attack NATO countries in as soon as five years, following up on what you're saying. How big of a threat do you see Putin to the West?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nI think he does want to go further. As I said, he wants to reinstate Soviet Union and the Soviet – the Soviet bloc. And they do that in terms of information, misinformation. They just drive different political groups and democracies. Not only Europe, in Latin America, in Africa, they have the influence everywhere. And they do this to split the world. So the risk is high. I think this German diplomat said that it's not even about the wish of Putin, but it's that if Putin is not stopped, then Putin is ready to attack NATO. Even look at the sheer size of the army and the weapons that they have. So we have to be ready to stop him now. Because the froze in conflicts, well, we've seen that in Georgia. We've seen that in other countries. So if we give the big pause to Putin, if we freeze the war right where we are, this will enable him because all his industry will start working not for the war in Ukraine, but will start working for the war against NATO.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, you are not just a president. You are also a father. You have survived multiple assassination attempts. Tens of thousands of your fellow citizens have been killed and injured. Millions have left their homes. Have you ever lost hope?\nVOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY [TRANSLATED]:\nYou can never lose hope. You can never lose hope. You can never lose freedom. You can never lose independence. Otherwise, you just lose everything. You lose your state. You lose your security for your children, for – all the children in Ukraine are my children. I will then lose everything. And I have to show the example. If I lose hope, well, my children would lose their future independent country. And then we would lose Ukraine as – as the nation. It's not only about the territory. It's about ourselves, our identity. So we cannot lose hope. We've had different moments, some very cruel. There were moments of challenge. And I'm sure in the history of the United States they also had many moments when the people of the U.S. had to fight for their independence. We remember the period of struggling, when many people lost hope. Or some people emigrated to France. But some people raised the banner, the United States, the banner of independence. And some people were skeptical on both sides of the ocean, in Europe too. But people didn't give up. And I think, well, you got the independent country. And the world got this great democracy. So we cannot lose hope either.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Zelenskyy, thank you for being here on this monumental morning. We really appreciate your perspective and having a chance to talk to you. When we come back, Steve Kornacki is here with the results of our latest NBC News poll.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. For more on the NBC News poll, I'm joined by National Political Correspondent Steve Kornacki to break down the numbers. A lot of headlines here, Steve.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nAbsolutely, Kristen. I think the biggest headline, this. Let's give you the bottom line. Donald Trump does lead Joe Biden 46% to 44% in our poll. But this is a tightening from our last poll. You could see three months ago Donald Trump had a five-point lead against the current president. That five-point lead, now down to two points, so there is progress here for Biden in the last three months.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nComing after the State of the Union, and he's had a campaign blitz.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nYeah, and the Democratic primaries, such as they were, coming to an end. Perhaps there's Democrats rallying around Biden, too. Also, I think not coincidentally, this slight improvement here for Biden tracks with a slight improvement in his job approval rating. It now sits at 42%. Again, go back to our last poll, look at this. He was in all-time-low-for-him territory last time around. Now up back over 40%, the highest Biden's job approval has been in our poll since last spring. So, again, these are encouraging signs for Joe Biden; although, broader picture here, this 42% approval rating, history says probably by itself not enough. He's probably going to need more because put this in some context here: these are other recent presidents. At this point in their reelection campaigns, where were their approval ratings? Again, you see Biden's 42%. One thing that jumps out: they were all higher than Joe Biden. The other thing, the two presidents on this list who did not win reelection of course: Donald Trump four years ago, he was at 46%; and back in 1992 George H.W. Bush, he was at 43%. Biden below both of those. The last time Biden's been at this level, 46%, you've got to back to the start of 2023. The last time he was higher than that, you've got to go back to the summer of 2021, his first year as president. So Biden has some work to do on that front. And also troubling for the Biden campaign, the erosion of public confidence on a number of critical fronts. We asked voters in this poll about a number of leadership characteristics here. \"Which candidate would be better?\" There are two, only two, where Biden has the edge over Trump. Abortion, we've talked about this one, seen this for a long time here.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThat's a big one.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nIt is. Certainly, that's the biggest Biden advantage in this poll. And then bringing the country together, Biden you see performing better than Trump. But I think the headline here is you add those two numbers together, you're not even close to 100. That means a lot of voters think neither candidate is better on that. And then on every other front here, we talk about the erosion for Biden and now, you start to see it. Look at these numbers. Trump advantages on all of these traits.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd I stop here because competent and effective, that was President Biden's, the crux of his campaign pitch back in 2020.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nAnd we actually polled this question in 2020, and it was basically the exact opposite. It was Biden with about a ten-point advantage over Trump and, again, same with handling of crisis. Biden had the edge over Trump. And how about this? It's the former president, the current president. We don't really see matchups like this. Well, now we can measure it. Who has the strongest record as president? And, again, Trump outpacing Biden on that front. And, again, you've got to mention this one, too. \"Necessary mental and physical health.\" We asked this four years ago, it was a wash. It's now a clear liability for Joe Biden. So these are all troubling numbers for Biden, but it's not to say there aren't warning signs for Donald Trump in this poll either.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, Trump and his campaign are hoping a third-party candidate might give them a little bit of a boost, but our poll shows it's a little bit murkier than that.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nThat's the thing, because, again, we show a 46-44 race here for Donald Trump. Again, all those liabilities for Biden, Trump only ahead two. What the Trump folks have been hoping is RFK, third-party candidates, they gobble up some votes and Trump doesn't need to get to 50%. But look what happens when we add RFK's name to the mix. Suddenly, we have a new leader. Joe Biden, 39%; Donald Trump, 37%. There's Kennedy getting 13%. In other words, we're seeing by a better than 2:1 margin, it's Trump voters who are flipping over to Kennedy in this scenario, not Biden voters. You see it right here. 15% of Trump voters, when we add RFK's name to the mix, they go to RFK. Only 7% of Biden voters. There's a big change right there.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nDefies conventional wisdom. There's no doubt about that.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nAbsolutely. I think we haven't seen this in other polls. And one final note, Kristen, as well, is the question of enthusiasm. And I thought this really jumped out here. The most engaged voters, those who voted in 2020, voted in the midterm elections, those folks are voting for Biden by nine points. Where Trump's strength is, why he leads Biden, it's voters who don't typically turn out in many elections. Didn't vote in '20, didn't vote in '22, they are with Trump by more than 20 points. And the warning sign for Trump in relying on this kind of voter is this: we are seeing the lowest level of –\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWow.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\n– interest since we started asking this question back in 2008. \"Are you very interested in the election?\" Sixty-four percent, that's lower than any other time at this point where we have polled this before. So, again, lower interest. Maybe those voters who in the polls are saying they're for Trump, are we sure they're going to actually vote in November? The Trump campaign better hope so.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWe'll have to see if that ticks up if we get closer to Election Day. Steve Kornacki, thank you so much for being here.\nSTEVE KORNACKI:\nYou got it.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWe really appreciate it. When we come back, the jury will hear opening statements in Donald Trump's first criminal trial. What impact will it have on voters? The panel is next.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. The panel is here: NBC News chief Washington correspondent Andrea Mitchell; Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher; and Matt Gorman, former senior communications advisor for Tim Scott for America. Andrea, I have to start with you. There's a lot to unpack. Let's start with President Zelenskyy. What were your key takeaways from our conversation?\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nThat he's really worried about the surge – the Russian surge in what we expect to be May, June, July. This six months was critical. They had a really good chance of winning, before the six months of no aid from the U.S., the weapons that only the U.S. can provide. And after six months, they can lose. They can lose, if the weapons don't get there soon enough. So now it's supply chain. He pointed out that the F-16s are still not there, and they were approved a year ago. And talking to Ukrainian officials, and you heard him today, they need the long-range weapons. They still don't have the ATACMS, those long-range missiles. They're supposedly in the package, the administration is deciding. Ukrainian officials say they've got to get them because the Russian launches, the artillery launches, not only do they have the ammo – they don't have the ammo, they don't have the manpower, Ukraine doesn't have any more – but Russia has that huge advantage, 10:1 in artillery, but they can't take that artillery out, because they don't have the long-range missiles. U.S. has been really worried about not letting them fire into Russian territory. The Ukrainians tell me they really want to, but they do have that restriction. They have restrictions that, frankly, are not placed on Israel. And they're watching Israel getting, you know -- despite all the controversy over Gaza, Israel has the support that Ukraine doesn't have. And I also think that it was really interesting that he ducked the two questions you asked about Donald Trump. He knows this is a close election. And the bottom line is he knows that Donald Trump has said that Ukraine can be forced at the negotiating table to give territory up to Russia. By next November, if Donald Trump is elected, I think it's all possible that Ukraine can still lose this war, despite their great spirit.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, I'm so glad that you bring up two points: One, that he did choose his words very carefully on Donald Trump; and the factor of Israel, the fact that Ukraine is so concerned, Matt Gorman, that the world has forgotten about them as attention has turned to the Middle East, to what's happening in Gaza. And of course, House Speaker Mike Johnson really at the center of the battles for more aid for Ukraine and Israel. Both were approved yesterday, but there's so much opposition within his own party, three conservative Republicans threatening to oust him over this. But it seemed like the temperature was turned down a little bit, yesterday. What is your assessment? How in jeopardy is his job?\nMATT GORMAN:\nIn the short term, not as much as I think people think. The real threat to Mike Johnson isn't now; it's November, it's post-election. Republicans are going to choose their leaders for the next Congress. They'll already have to choose a Senate leader. I think, until then, Democrats and Republicans will cobble together a majority on a motion to vacate, if it comes up. And I think Republicans want to hold on until then. Let's face it: also, too, no one really wants to be speaker right now, other than Mike Johnson. I thought it was notable that Steve Scalise and Tom Emmer voted with Johnson; notable who didn't, Elise Stefanik. If a successful move is going to be made, it's not until November.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYeah. Only member of the Republican leadership who did not vote for it. Cornell, let's talk about this poll: President Biden narrowing the gap with former President Trump, not a big surprise. But what stood out to you in the crosstabs?\nCORNELL BELCHER:\nWhat stands out to me is – well, first of all, great interview, by the way, groundbreaking interview. Spot on. What stood out to me is – surprise, surprise – polls are closing. And polls continue to shrink and get tighter and tighter because that's what happens in this country. And if you go back to our polling, go back to our polling back in October of last year, Donald Trump was at 46%. What is he, throughout all our NBC polling? He's at 46%. What is he at right now? At 46%. Donald Trump, what did he get in the last election? He got 46%. His support stays solid. Where I'm worried about or where I see you can see growth here is, I think Donald Trump is at his ceiling, and Biden is close to his floor. Where he's off most? He's off most among young voters. He is – and the other part about this is the enthusiasm, which I think is really the headline, is that if these young voters aren't enthusiastic and they don't show up and break for Biden big, that's how Trump wins.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAndrea, pick up on that point, because this is all going on against the backdrop of Donald Trump in court for his first criminal trial this week.\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nYet, the fact is we don't know how that is going to play. Up until now, these legal cases have only helped him fundraising, made him, you know, tell people he's a victim, energized his base. And so he's risen in the polls with every indictment. Now, we're going to see him really powerless. The judge has been very effective. And how they handle the gag order is yet to be seen, while Joe Biden is campaigning. The problem for Joe Biden and the Democrats is it's is crowding out – the trial is crowding out the trial, is crowding out everything else. So Joe Biden goes out and does major policy things, the steel tariffs in Pennsylvania, everything else that he's doing. Student loans is breaking through, a lit bit. But everything else is crowded out. And it's the Trump story. And that's what happened in 2016 to Hillary Clinton. And that could be replicated this year. I think it's really – I think the enthusiasm issue and the young voter issue is critical. And as long as this war in Gaza goes on, this is going to be a problem with young voters because they have off ramp. That off ramp is RKF Jr. And I know your poll shows that RKF Jr. would hurt Trump more than Biden, hypothetically, and it's very early in polling, you know, to say who, but I know the White House is more afraid of –\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nIs jittery, yeah.\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nThe family certainly is because it was very hard for those siblings to come out and do that. They only did it because they think he really hurts them, Joe Biden, more than Donald Trump.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nMatt Gorman, what about all of that?\nMATT GORMAN:\nYeah. Look, I was encouraged because when I was going into the trial, I was nervous that all the talk was going to be simply coming from Trump, his message was going to be about himself and the trial. I was surprised, going in the bodega, I thought it was smart, it leaned into issues like immigration, the migrant crisis, and crime that are winning issues, as we saw in the poll, for Republicans and Trump. He needs to continue to do that, get a message that's not just about himself, while he's sitting in the courtroom.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nHow does the courtroom optics play, Cornell?\nCORNELL BELCHER:\nAndrea, you're spot on about him – about him dominating the news, but it's negative news, right? This is different –\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nThat's a very good point.\nCORNELL BELCHER:\nAnd he doesn't look strong. He looks - he looks weak there. And so, to a certain extent, I don't –I don't mind if he's in court every day, dominating the news, because it's negative news.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nOkay. All right. Great conversation. We covered a lot of ground, but thank you.\nANDREA MITCHELL:\nCongratulations on a great interview.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThank you, Andrea. Thank you, all. When we come back, as the athletes prepare for the Summer Olympics in Paris, we look back on the U.S. decision to boycott the games after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Our Meet the Press Minute is next.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. We have officially crossed the 100-day mark to the 2024 Olympics, as Paris prepares to host the competition, this summer. But the Olympics are not just about sports; they've also made history. The United States led an international boycott of the 1980 games in Moscow to protest the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. President Jimmy Carter announced his historic decision right here on Meet the Press.\n[START TAPE]\nPRES. JIMMY CARTER:\nNeither I know the American people would support the sending of an American team to Moscow with Soviet invasion troops in Afghanistan. I'll send a message today to the United States Olympic Committee, spelling out my own position, that unless the Soviets withdraw their troops, within a month, from Afghanistan, that the Olympic games be moved from Moscow to an alternate site or multiple sites, or postponed, or canceled. If the Soviets do not withdraw their troops immediately from Afghanistan within a month, I will not support the sending of an American team to the Olympics.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd you can watch the Paris Olympics this summer on NBC and streaming on Peacock. When we come back, presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin joins me for our Meet the Moment conversation with lessons from the past, as America's democracy is being tested once again.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. As she likes to say, Doris Kearns Goodwin has spent most of her career writing about dead presidents, immersing herself in their papers, diaries and letters in an attempt to being them back to life. In a new book, \"An Unfinished Love Story,\" the presidential historian turns that same attention to her marriage. Before his death, she opened more than 300 boxes of documents and memorabilia with her husband Richard Goodwin, who served as a speechwriter for President John F. Kennedy: a time capsule of their life in the 1960's. In her twenties, Doris was chosen to be a White House fellow for President Lyndon Johnson, one of only three women out of the 16 fellows selected, and developed a loyalty and closeness to President Johnson which has lasted her entire life. I sat down with Doris for a Meet the Moment conversation on her new book and the resilience of America, even in turbulent times.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou have typically written presidential biographies. This is a biography to some extent of your husband, and it is also a love story. What was the process like of writing this book as compared to all of your other incredible works?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nWell, I was so used to writing about presidents who had archives, and I would want to talk to them. I knew them so well, because it took me so long to write those books, longer to write the book about World War II than the war to be fought, longer to write about the Civil War than twice the Civil War. And I would always ask them questions, and they never answered me. So this time, I had this guy, my guy, right across the hall from me in the same study, and I was able to talk to him. And he could answer my questions. And he had an archive – a mini archive of what presidents have – memos, diaries, letters. He just had saved everything in 300 boxes and finally decided when he turned 80 to open them. And what it really opened was a door to the 1960s, a decade that I'd lived in but I was able to learn through him starting at the beginning with John Kennedy, ending with Bobby Kennedy's death and the Democratic Convention.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou talk about the fact that after your husband passed, it was a struggle for you to finish this project that was a labor of love. You write, \"I found myself edging toward a commitment to finish the project influenced by headlines announcing divisions between Black and white, old and young, rich and poor, divisions that made it increasingly evident that the momentous issues emanating from the '60s remain the unresolved stuff of our everyday lives.\"\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nYeah, I think that's what really decided me. I knew if I were going to work on it, it was going to take years. My books take so long, so it was a huge commitment, and I was going to be writing as an historian, not simply as somebody writing about my husband. And so, once I realized that the '60s really had a message to the people today, and I believe that's so. Because we look at the '60s in a sad way because it ended with the riots, it ended with anti-war violence, it ended with Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy being killed. But when you start at the beginning, it was a decade in which young people in particular were powered by the conviction they could make a difference. And they joined the Peace Corps. The people who were in the Freedom Rides and the sit-ins, in the marches against segregation, marches for the vote. The beginning of the women's movement is there, the gay rights movement. It's a time when the air is filled with that belief that if you work together, you can change the government.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, when you look across the political spectrum, do you see leaders right now who are meeting this moment where so many people wonder if our democracy will stay intact?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nI mean, I don't know that we're fighting it the same way we need to be. This is one of the most perilous moments, and there are people obviously in local areas. There are people in states. There are some people in Washington. But the overall sense is, sometimes we've become too much of spectators watching what's happening to ourselves. And – and one of the things Dante said is that \"The lowest place in Hell are for those people in a moral crisis who remain neutral or remain silent.\" We are in a moral crisis right now, and that's what history – I always feel so – so positive about what history can teach us, because we've lived through really hard times before. And these are hard times, however, and it won't get better unless we act, unless we take seriously our citizen responsibilities and use the qualities of character that we need to bring into politics.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nHow afraid, how concerned are you that January 6th could happen again?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nWell, because we're not remembering it correctly. That – that – what history – I was so certain as an historian, and I was on television saying, \"This is going to change public sentiment.\" Just as certain things happened in the '50s that made people understand in the '60s that slavery had to be ended, public sentiment finally got changed. I thought it had, but everything is so breaking news today, and one thing tops on another. I thought the summer after January 6th when the hearings took place, that would change public sentiment. But I still think in the end that the majority of the people understood what happened in that election. I think the majority of people are for the basic values that we're talking about right now for democracy. And it's just a matter of them speaking out and recognizing that it is in danger, and it's up to us. It's not up to somebody else, it's up to us to save it.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd the Republican nominee has yet to accept the results of the last election. Within the context of this conversation and your concerns about the nation's democracy, how much of a threat do you think the democracy is facing right now, and do you think the country can survive this threat?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nWell, I think the real threat is when the Republican – former President says that \"if he doesn't win, he won't accept the results of this next election,\" which means that we may have a recurring battle for who's really – who's really elected each time we do this. And that's a real problem. I mean, all the candidates, when you look at the ones who lost, it's really hard to lose, and every single one was able to say, as – as Carter did, \"I promised I'd never tell you a lie. This hurts, it really hurts.\" Or Al Gore working on that concession speech that my husband was honored enough to help him on, where he talked about the fact, \"The law of the land has said that this election is lost. I don't agree with it, but I must do it.\" And Hillary Clinton say, \"We not only believe in the transition of power, we cherish it.\" I looked at all those, and it just makes you so proud of each one of those candidates who had been through an election. They'd lost it, they'd let down their constituents, and they were able to make that transfer of power. And it's an essential part of our democracy that has to happen this next November.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAs we sit here today, how concerned are you that it may not happen?\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nI am concerned that it may not happen, but I somehow think if the majority of the people come out who have different values from that and they vote, voting is absolutely essential. It's the premium value. As Lyndon Johnson said, \"It's the – it's the one thing that all the rest of our democracy depends on.\" And what is democracy? You throw a candidate out or you call him in. You either want him to come in, or you want to throw him out. We have to be able to do that. And I think, if the majority comes out to vote, and the majority never comes out in enough numbers to vote, not only young people. They've made a big difference in 2020, 2018, 2022, and they're saying now that they may not vote if they're not happy with either candidate. Again, if they only could know what we felt like in the '60s when we felt we were making a difference, you feel larger. You feel a sense of – of exhilaration, the word you used earlier. And I just hope they feel that this election could turn on them, and the uncommitted people and the undecided people have to come out and vote, and we have to just take the results of the election. That doesn't mean we know how it's going to happen, but if the overwhelming majority vote, then somehow maybe it won't be as close as we think it is going to be. And then we'll have a clear-cut choice.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nI hear so much optimism in your voice still.\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nYes, I think I was born that way, and I think it's the only way we can live. I mean, it sometimes may sound naïve. I remember thinking what I was feeling when I was at the Civil Rights march, that we're going to change America. Maybe we didn't change America completely, but we made huge changes at that time. And if you have optimism, at least you have the confidence that if you act, something will happen. And it may take a long time, as – as Martin Luther King talked about, \"the arc of the universe,\" all that stuff takes a long time, but it moves toward justice. And I do believe that.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThank you, Doris Kearns Goodwin for this incredible conversation.\nDORIS KEARNS GOODWIN:\nThank you. I'm so glad to have been with you.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell that's all for today, thanks for watching. We'll be back next week, because if it's Sunday it's Meet the Press.",

The Supreme Court will consider that question today when it weighs the constitutionality of multiple ordinances enacted by an Oregon town. An appeals court ruling said that several of the ordinances in the city of Grants Pass are prohibited under the Constitution's Eighth Amendment, which bars cruel and unusual punishment. The city ordinances in question bar sleeping or camping on publicly owned property, including sidewalks, streets, bridges and city parks. The key issue in the case is punishment, which can include fines of up to several hundred dollars and exclusion orders that bar people from public property.\nBut advocates for the homeless argue that the ordinances punish people for existing when they don't have anywhere else to go and do nothing to address the underlying issue of housing shortages.

Man on terror watchlist was dropped by migrant monitoring program When an Afghan national on the FBI terrorist watchlist was arrested last week after having spent nearly a year in the U.S., immigration officials said he had been enrolled in a program that tracked his location via ankle monitor, mobile app or telephone.

Mohammad Kharwin is believed to have then spent 10 months in the U.S. without any kind of monitoring system.\nNow experts say the case raises questions about how migrants who may pose a security threat are vetted and tracked in the U.S. It also raises questions about the Alternatives to Detention, which has seen funding cuts from Republicans in Congress who oppose it, forcing ICE to drop migrants from being monitored.\nHomeland security correspondent Julia Ainsley, who broke the story last week, explains the latest developments .\nexplains the latest developments. Johnson eyes a weekend vote on foreign aid bills House Speaker Mike Johnson rolled out three bills to provide assistance to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan, with the hopes of holding final votes on Saturday.

Already, several Republicans have said they will not approve any more aid for Kyiv. In order for that funding to pass, a significant share of Democrats will be required to carry that measure over the finish line.\nAlso expected to come up this weekend through an amendment process is the House-passed bill to ban TikTok in the U.S. unless the company divests from its China-based owner.

            "summary": "More than a dozen members of the Kennedy family will endorse President Joe Biden for a second term Thursday, passing over family member Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Biden campaign announced.\nThe Kennedy family has stepped up its involvement in the Biden campaign, working to lift Biden's odds as Democrats worry that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s bid could pose a spoiler risk that could hand the election to former President Donald Trump.\nFormer Rep. Joseph Kennedy III, the independent candidate's nephew, said in an interview that he believes his uncle's 'candidacy poses a threat to the country that I love and the values that I hold.'\n'I believe that his candidacy is likely to divert support away from President Biden and end up increasing support for Donald Trump,' he said.\nThe 15 Kennedy family members making the endorsement include the candidate's siblings Rory Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, Joseph Kennedy II, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Christopher Kennedy and Maxwell Kennedy Sr.\nThis endorsement has been 'months in the making,' according to a source familiar with the Biden campaign's planning, who added that family members came forward to 'do something to show they're united by the president.\"\nJoseph Kennedy III, who serves in the Biden administration as special envoy to Northern Ireland, said the family endorsement is intended to blunt third-party support that could 'siphon votes' from the president.\n'We want to be able to make that case not just for the risk that Bobby's candidacy shows, but because of who Joe Biden is, what Joe Biden has done and what Joe Biden will do with four more years in office,\" he said.\nJoseph Kennedy III acknowledged 'challenging' feelings involved in the endorsement, while noting that 'it's something we believe has to be done.'\n'Bobby knows that we stand by him as a family member, while also being able to clearly communicate that his candidacy poses a risk to the country that we love,' the younger Kennedy said.\nThe family members will formally make their endorsement at an event in Philadelphia with a speech by the candidate's sister Kerry.\n\"We can say today, with no less urgency, that our rights and freedoms are once again in peril,\" she will say, according to prepared remarks sent by the Biden campaign. \"That is why we all need to come together in a campaign that should unite not only Democrats, but all Americans, including Republicans, and independents, who believe in what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.\"\nAccording to excerpts of prepared remarks, Kerry Kennedy will directly attack Trump and invoke her father, Robert F. Kennedy. The prepared remarks do not appear to mention her brother, though only an excerpt of the prepared speech was shared with news outlets.\n\"I can only imagine how Donald Trump's outrageous lies and behavior would have horrified my father, Robert F. Kennedy, who proudly served as Attorney General of the United States, and honored his pledge to uphold the law and protect the country,\" she will say before going on to compare Biden to her father.\nAfter the speech, Biden and members of the Kennedy family will hold a campaign event, where Biden will be introduced by Joseph Kennedy III.\nFamily members will also make calls to voters and knock on doors, according to the campaign.\nMembers of the Kennedy family have praised Biden and boosted images of family members posing with him, such as a St. Patrick's Day photo depicting three generations of the Kennedy family with him.\nLikewise, Biden describes Robert F. Kennedy as a political hero \"who inspired him early in his career to leave corporate law to become a public defender, and then go on to run for public office,\" the Biden campaign said. Biden also has a bust of the elder Kennedy, who was attorney general in his brother John's administration, in the Oval Office.\nSome members of the family have been more direct in their criticism of Robert Kennedy Jr., such as when Stephen Kennedy Smith referred on social media to what he called his cousin's \"misguided stands on issues, his poor judgement, and tenuous relationship with the truth.'\nRory Kennedy said in an MSNBC interview this month: \"I love my brother, and it pains me to come out against him. But I am very concerned with the stakes in this election.\"\n\"I'm concerned that his campaign and running for office as an independent is going to lead to Trump's election,\" she added.\nRobert Kennedy Jr. responded to family members' criticism of his campaign this month, telling CNN's Erin Burnett, \"I don't know anybody in America who's got a family who agrees with them on everything.\" He has reiterated that he loves his family and that he understands \"why they don't like me running.\"\nThe campaign is intentionally keeping the event to immediate family members, such as several of the candidate's siblings, a member of the large political family said.\n'This event is only going to involve the immediate RFK family so that Bobby can't fall back on his claim that he ‘has big family ... and we aren't all going to agree,'' the family member said, referring to how RFK Jr. has previously deflected questions about his family's criticisms of his campaign.\n'The message is crystal clear that Bobby's own brothers and sisters are endorsing the president,' the person added.\nJoseph Kennedy III was sympathetic to the security concerns that his uncle has raised regarding his denied request for Secret Service protection. The younger Kennedy said he was not aware of the specific threat assessments, but 'I would want my uncle, just like anybody else that's running for office, to make sure that they have the safety and security that they need to be able to run a campaign.'\nPolling indicates that Biden and Trump are headed for a neck-and-neck race — and a high-profile third-party candidate, such as Kennedy, could further shake up both candidates' prospects. If the presidential election were held in March and the candidates were Biden, Trump and Kennedy, Kennedy would get about 16% of the vote, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.\nKelly O'Donnell Megan Lebowitz Nnamdi Egwuonwu contributed.",

            "excerpt": "Democrats and election experts say the figure is unrealistic, but expressed concerns the effort could hamper normal election operations and intimidate voters.",
            "summary": "Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the Republican National Committee announced a massive 'election integrity' operation on Friday, promising to deploy 100,000 volunteers and attorneys to battleground states to 'protect the vote and ensure a big win' in November.\nIn a press release, officials said they wanted the volunteers and lawyers to monitor logic and accuracy testing, early voting, ballot tabulation, mail ballot processing and Election Day voting, as well as post-election canvasses, audits, and recounts. The release suggests they may intend to recruit poll workers, too.\n'Having the right people to count the ballots is just as important as turning out voters on Election Day,' Trump said in the release..\n\"The RNC is hiring hundreds of election integrity staff across the map — more than ever before because our Party will be recruiting thousands of more observers to protect the vote in 2024. These campaign officials in states are tasked with recruiting, training, and when possible, shifting poll watchers and poll workers day in and day out,\" added RNC co-chair Lara Trump.\nPoll watching is a normal part of elections — both parties do it — but experts warn that unruly operations can be a problem. And as Trump and his allies continue to make false claims about the 2020 election, some experts worry that empowering these sort of observers at polling sites could hamper normal election operations or intimidate voters.\nThe GOP release notes they plan to work with \"passionate grassroots coalitions who are deeply invested in fighting voter fraud.\"\nThe planned operation would double the RNC's promised 50,000-person operation from 2020, though some experts said both numbers figures were aspirational and unrealistic. The RNC did not respond to a request for data on how many people had volunteered or been staffed in recent elections.\n'I've actually run a program like this with real people,' said Justin Levitt, a former advisor in the Biden White House on democracy issues who has previously worked in the Department of Justice on voting issues. 'We did really well and got multiple tens of thousands.'\nRecruiting individuals in particular to monitor for voter fraud, he said, is even harder than staffing poll workers.\n'They're recruiting people to stand there and watch for something that's not going to happen. Can you please show up and watch, wait for the UFO for 15 hours?' he said.\nMarc Elias, a leading Democratic election lawyer, agreed the 100,000 number was unrealistic, but said he was still concerned about the plans.\n\"I think they are going to have a massive voter suppression operation and it is going to involve very, very large numbers of people and very, very large numbers of lawyers,\" he said. \"I think we need to take the RNC literally and seriously — except on their numbers.\"\nLauren Groh-Wargo, executive director of Fair Fight PAC, the political advocacy arm of the Georgia voting rights group of the same name, said the effort would harm election administration.\n'The Republican National Committee's new voter suppression unit is just the latest version of their cynical playbook to divide and intimidate voters and steal American's voices by building an operation based on the lie of voter fraud,' she said in a statement.\nUntil 2018, the RNC's poll watching plans were limited by a consent decree, which required it seek court approval to prove that any poll watching work wasn't discriminatory.\nThat decree was put into place after Democrats sued and accused the RNC of sending armed, off-duty police officers to patrol the polls in minority neighborhoods in 1981. The decree required them to seek prior court approval for poll watching operations, but expired at the end of 2017 after 35 years.\nPoll observers are a normal and beneficial part of the election process when they are well trained and do not interfere with administrators work, said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, a group that helps support election officials. An army of 100,000 would present a different dynamic, he said, but noted that election workers are prepared to handle unruly observers if they appear.\n\"They will protect the right of their voters to vote free of intimidation. If observers are acting any way contrary to voters interests or interfering with poll workers, they will be dealt with under the laws of the state,\" he said.\nJane C. Timm",

Lawyers for the parties did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nSmartmatic, a voting machine company used only by Los Angeles county in the 2020 election, filed a spate of lawsuits in 2021 alleging it was defamed by conservative media networks, personalities and allies of former President Donald Trump.\nHerring Networks also faces a lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems, a popular voting machine company that made headlines for securing a massive $787.5 million settlement last year from Fox News in a defamation claim. Dominion's case against Fox News dragged reams of evidence and testimony into the public sphere, revealing that Trump's media allies did not believe the remarkably dubious evidence behind the the president's stolen election claims.\nAt least eight other defamation cases from the voting machine companies are working their way through the judicial system this year, too.\nSmartmatic's lawsuit against Newsmax is scheduled to go to trial in September, while its trial on the voting machine company's case against MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, which could have begun as early as this month, was recently rescheduled to early next year.

            "excerpt": "'If our votes and the votes of people who support the Palestinian human rights are so important, then Biden should be listening,\" one activist said.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — \"Outraged,\" \"point of no return\" and \"absolute disaster\" are how some Muslim American organizers have described their reactions to an aid package for Israel that is making its way through Congress for President Joe Biden to sign into law.\nMany Muslim Americans were already furious with the Biden administration over its handling of the Israel-Hamas war, with activists organizing Democrats to vote 'uncommitted\" rather than support the president in some state primaries this year.\nFor several activists and leaders of prominent Muslim American organizations, Biden's support for $26 billion in aid for Israel reaffirms their view about November's election: They cannot back Biden for a second term.\nAhead of the House's vote to pass the aid package to Israel on Saturday, Muslim American organizations urged voters to contact members of Congress to demand they vote against the aid. It ultimately passed 366-58, with 37 Democrats and 21 Republicans voting against the aid and seven members absent.\nIf Biden signs an Israel aid package, as he intends to, \"that heartless decision could mark the point of no return for what remains of the White House's relationship with the American Muslim community and other Americans opposed to the genocide in Gaza,\" said Council on American-Islamic Relations' government affairs director Robert McCaw in a statement.\n'The administration is already at its lowest point in its relationship with the American Muslim community,' McCaw said.\nFor others, it's too late.\nThe rift between the president and Muslim American voters is unlikely to be repaired \"unless the president can undo what has been done for the past six months\" in Gaza, said Osama Abu Irshaid, the executive director for Americans for Justice in Palestine Action.\nAbu Irshaid, who lives in Virginia, cast a ballot for Biden in 2020 but is not planning to vote for Biden nor former President Donald Trump in November, he said.\nMore than 33,000 people in Gaza have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Gazan health ministry. About 1,200 people in Israel were killed during the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, according to the Israeli government, and more than 240 people were taken hostage. More than 100 hostages remain in Gaza, though it is unclear how many are alive.\nThe aid package, which now heads to the Senate for likely passage next week, would mark a significant boost of U.S. support for Israel, though the U.S. has already sent weapons to the country since the start of its war with Hamas. Democratic lawmakers have been increasingly critical of arms support to Israel as well. Earlier this month, more than three dozen members of Congress — including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. — signed a letter asking the White House to \"reconsider your recent decision to authorize the transfer of a new arms package to Israel.\"\nProgressive Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., is among the lawmakers who voted against the Israel aid Friday. She said that she and her colleagues were working to \"make sure that we don't send more weapons\" to Israel as part of the aid package.\n\"Just because we authorize it doesn't mean it has to be sent immediately,\" she said.\nBiden praised the House's passage in a statement after the vote, urging the Senate to \"quickly send this package to my desk so that I can sign it into law.\"\n\"This package will deliver critical support to Israel and Ukraine; provide desperately needed humanitarian aid to Gaza, Sudan, Haiti, and other locations impacted by conflicts and natural disasters around the world; and bolster security and stability in the Indo-Pacific,\" the president said in the statement.\nIn a close election, anger at Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war could be key in swing states that the president won in 2020 by a slim margin.\nBiden flipped Michigan, which has a sizable Arab American population, winning the state by about 154,000 votes in 2020. In 2016, Trump won the state by about 11,000 votes. But during the 2024 presidential primary, more than 100,000 Michiganders cast ballots for uncommitted, many as an act of protest.\nBut the relatively tiny proportion of uncommitted delegates — just 0.008% of the Democratic delegates awarded so far — points to uncertainty about the movement's impact on the November general election. While Biden has more than 3,000 delegates, only 26 have been designated \"uncommitted.\"\nBiden also flipped Arizona in 2020 by a tight margin, beating Trump by just over 10,000 votes.\nAhmed Ewaisha, the chairman of the Arizona Muslim Alliance, said he was \"very excited\" about Biden in 2020. Now, he serves as the co-chair of the Abandon Biden campaign in the crucial swing state. Ewaisha said he's \"definitely concerned\" about Trump, adding that he \"would never, ever support Trump at all.\"\nStill, he said he wanted to vote against Biden as punishment for the president's policies toward Israel and Gaza.\nIn a statement, a Biden campaign official said that 'the President believes making your voice heard and participating in our democracy is fundamental to who we are as Americans.'\n'He shares the goal for an end to the violence and a just, lasting peace in the Middle East,' the official continued. 'He's working tirelessly to that end.'\nSeparately, a White House official pointed to the administration's numerous meetings with state, local and interfaith leaders, as well as outreach to Muslim, Arab and Palestinian communities.\nBiden administration officials have also traveled to Michigan and Illinois to meet with Arab American and Muslim community leaders.\n'White House officials have had more than 100 conversations with leaders at the local and state level concerning the conflict and humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza,' the official said.\nAyah Ziyadeh, the advocacy director for Americans for Justice in Palestine Action, said she voted for Biden in 2020 and tried \"to convince everybody to vote for him.\"\nNow, her organization is working alongside other groups on an American Muslim election task force, which she said will guide how she votes in November. The task force recommendations are expected in a month or two, she said.\nWhen criticizing Biden's response to the war, she said that she doesn't know \"that anything can change my views because I've had to watch six months of genocide against my people.\"\nAs the war progressed, Biden has increasingly sharpened his rhetoric against Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli military's tactics.\nAfter an Israeli air strike killed aid workers in Gaza, Biden said he was \"outraged and heartbroken\" and argued that \"Israel has also not done enough to protect civilians\" and aid workers.\nSimilarly, Biden expressed support for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's public rebuke of Netanyahu.\nThe New York Democrat roundly criticized Israel's prime minister and called for new elections in the country. Later, Biden said that Schumer \"made a good speech, and I think he expressed a serious concern shared not only by him but by many Americans.\"\nWhile several Muslim American organizations are critical of Biden's policies toward Israel, organizers are contemplating how their November votes could impact Trump's prospects for regaining the Oval Office.\nIn the early days of his 2016 campaign, Trump released a policy plan calling for \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" In October of last year, he called for expanding travel bans from several Muslim-majority countries and barring potential refugees from Gaza from entering the U.S.\nHowever, several Muslim American organizers say that the onus is on Biden to regain their votes to avoid handing the election to the former president.\n\"We don't think it's on us. It's on Biden,\" Abu Irshaid said. \"If our votes and the votes of people who support the Palestinian human rights are so important, then Biden should be listening.\"\nActivist Linda Sarsour echoed his sentiments, arguing that \"trying to explain that Joe Biden is better right now during a genocide is not a talking point that lands within our communities.\"\nSarsour is the executive director of the Muslim grassroots organization MPower Change and an organizer for the campaign to vote uncommitted to protest Biden. She said she voted for the president in 2020.\n\"There is no community in this country that knows that Donald Trump is worse than we know him,\" she said, referring to the travel ban on Muslim-majority countries.\nSalam Al-Marayati, president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, voted for Biden in 2020 \"because I really care about our democracy. I saw what Trump was doing.\"\nHe said he has not yet decided how he will vote in November. His organization has not decided whether to make an endorsement for the presidential election, adding that some feel that \"it's not worth endorsing anyone.\"\n\"My concern is that you have a candidate for president who cannot do any more public events for fear of protest, who will not be able to galvanize his own party because it is fractured and is not listening to his own base in his own party,\" Al-Marayati said.\nBiden continues to do public events, although he has faced anti-war protesters interrupting his speeches. At an event in March, he conceded that pro-Palestinian protesters who interrupted his remarks \"have a point.\"\n\"We need to get a lot more care into Gaza,\" he said after the protesters, who called for care in Gaza, were escorted out.\nMegan Lebowitz",

WWE is moving on. Following his resignation as executive chairman of WWE parent company TKO Group amid a lawsuit accusing him of sex abuse, Vince McMahon has been spending time traveling, eating out and keeping in touch with friends. NBC News / Getty Images April 17, 2024, 5:49 PM UTC By Chloe Melas and Alex Sherman, CNBC As he faces a mountain of legal woes, former WWE leader Vince McMahon is traveling, eating out and keeping in touch with friends and associates — including former President Donald Trump. McMahon resigned as executive chairman of World Wrestling Entertainment's parent company almost three months ago after a former employee, Janel Grant, accused him in a bombshell lawsuit of sexual abuse and trafficking. He denied the allegations. McMahon, 78, is also facing a federal criminal investigation, although he hasn't been charged. NBC News and CNBC talked to 11 people familiar with McMahon and WWE about how he's been spending his time — and how the global brand he built over more than four decades is moving on without him. These people, including close personal associates and company insiders, declined to be named, citing ongoing legal cases and the confidential nature of internal corporate communications. Multiple WWE insiders said he hasn't had any contact with company leaders and figureheads since he resigned. Mark Shapiro, the operating chief of WWE parent company TKO Group Holdings, said in March that McMahon 'doesn't work for the company, doesn't come into the office, and he's not coming back to the company.' That also means McMahon hasn't talked to his son-in-law, WWE creative chief and former superstar Paul 'Triple H' Levesque, or daughter, Stephanie McMahon-Levesque, regarding company matters, sources said. While she introduced WWE's WrestleMania event earlier this month, McMahon-Levesque, who worked beside her father for more than 20 years and played roles in storylines, currently has no involvement with the company, according to people familiar with the matter. Levesque and McMahon-Levesque declined to comment through a spokesperson, as did a WWE representative. Vince McMahon, Stephanie McMahon and Triple H attend the UFC 276 event at T-Mobile Arena on July 2, 2022 in Las Vegas. Jeff Bottari / Zuffa LLC file McMahon is nonetheless indelibly linked with the wrestling outfit, which he bought from his father 42 years ago. Still, he seems to have moved on, according to multiple sources. McMahon has kept up his other routines, and it's as if he's unfazed by his legal fights, two sources said. For instance, on an afternoon in late March, McMahon returned on a private plane to the United States from the sunny Turks and Caicos Islands -- but he wasn't alone, according to a person close to him. He had with him seven kittens and a puppy, all of which he brought back to be adopted by his friends, this person added. 'If anything, he's enjoying life,' said the person, who added that McMahon had also taken a trip to Italy. Jessica Rosenberg, an attorney for McMahon, declined to comment regarding the aspects of the former WWE chief's life reported in this article. In an emailed statement Tuesday, however, she criticized Grant's suit: 'The lawsuit's claims are false, defamatory and entirely without merit. We intend to vigorously defend Mr. McMahon and are confident that he will be vindicated.' Life amid litigation The details of McMahon's life after his WWE reign present a stark contrast to Grant's accusations, which paint a graphic portrait of a violent and controlling man. In the federal lawsuit, filed Jan. 25, Grant's attorneys said that she was 'the victim of physical and emotional abuse, sexual assault and trafficking at WWE,' naming McMahon and former WWE executive John Laurinaitis. Both men have denied the accusations in the suit. The lawsuit also named WWE as a defendant. WWE and its parent company, TKO, have said that they take Grant's allegations 'very seriously.' 'Vince McMahon raped, trafficked and physically assaulted Janel Grant as part of his decades-long normalization of treating women within the WWE as objects. He might have thought that Janel would just walk away, but that wishful thinking couldn't be further from the case,' Ann Callis, an attorney for Grant, said in a statement Wednesday. 'Every day we are focused on adding to our mountain of evidence, speaking with other victims, hiring renowned experts on sex trafficking/coercive control and preparing to vociferously litigate this case.' Federal investigators seized a phone from McMahon and have been trying to determine whether federal law was broken in the conduct surrounding Grant's allegations, NBC News reported in February. WWE had disclosed last summer that investigators served McMahon with a federal grand jury subpoena and executed a search warrant in July. McMahon is cooperating with authorities, according to one of the people close to him. McMahon believes officials won't bring any charges against him and that Grant's civil case will be settled out of court, said a person close to the former wrestling executive. Nicholas Biase, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment. A spokesperson for Grant's attorneys said that there have been absolutely no settlement talks with McMahon. Vince McMahon speaks to an audience during a WWE fan appreciation event in Hartford, Conn. on Oct. 30, 2010. Jessica Hill / AP Photo file While his legal battles persist, McMahon is often ferried by a private driver from his posh Connecticut home to Manhattan, according to one of the sources close to him. There, he eats with friends at restaurants such as the old-school Italian spot Il Tinello East on 46th Street, sees his longtime barber for biweekly haircuts and works with his personal trainer multiple times a week, the source said. Two other sources, however, say McMahon has otherwise been 'quite guarded' and often on the phone with his lawyers to map out plans since Grant's lawsuit was made public. Staying in touch McMahon has also talked to Trump, according to two of the people close to the wrestling impresario. The two billionaires have been in touch regularly, according to a person close to McMahon, although it isn't clear what they've discussed. Trump and the McMahon family go way back: The former president hosted two WrestleMania events in Atlantic City in the late 1980s, engaged in a wrestling 'feud' with McMahon in 2007 and is a member of the WWE Hall of Fame. Linda McMahon, McMahon's wife, served as the Small Business Administration's head in Trump's Cabinet, led a pro-Trump super PAC and is now on the board of the publicly traded Trump Media and Technology Group. In 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that McMahon paid $5 million in previously unrecorded expenses to the since-dissolved Donald J. Trump Foundation during two of the years Trump appeared on WWE programming. Vince McMahon gets more than he bargained for when Donald Trump got physical after signing the contract for Wrestlemania XXIII's \"Hair vs Hair\" match in Washington on March 12, 2007. Sam Greenwood / WireImage for WWE via Getty Images file Trump, who's running for a second term as president, has also been accused of sexual assault and is facing his own costly pile of civil and criminal legal troubles, including four separate indictments. Trump has denied wrongdoing in his various cases, pleading not guilty in each criminal proceeding, including a New York trial that started Monday. Another person close to McMahon said that the two men don't discuss their legal problems and that Trump doesn't provide legal advice. A representative for Trump declined to comment. Since he resigned, McMahon has been in touch with Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and John Cena, sources said. Johnson and Cena, both Hollywood superstars, are two of WWE's biggest success stories. Publicly, Johnson has thanked TKO and WWE executives regarding his addition to the TKO board earlier this year. In February, Cena told the radio host Howard Stern that 'the whole thing is super unfortunate and it sucks,' while noting that he loves McMahon and has a 'great relationship' with him. 'But in the same breath,' he added at the time, 'I'm also a big advocate of accountability.'

Eugene Gologursky / WireImage file Cena and Johnson are both represented by the William Morris Endeavor agency, which is part of Endeavor Group — the majority owner of TKO. A spokesperson for Johnson declined to comment. A representative for Cena didn't respond to requests for comment. WWE in transition This isn't the first time WWE has had to contend with controversy stemming from its former longtime leader. McMahon was acquitted of federal criminal charges in the early 1990s related to the steroid scandal that engulfed the wrestling world at the time. In 2022, he briefly stepped down as WWE's leader after the Journal reported that he paid millions of dollars to multiple women to cover up his alleged extramarital affairs. The Journal also reported that other women had come forward with sexual misconduct allegations. WWE amended its financial reports to reflect the payments. McMahon denied all wrongdoing. His daughter helped take over leadership of the company in the interim, but McMahon-Levesque resigned when her father, who owned a controlling stake in WWE, returned in early 2023. McMahon then engineered a deal to merge the company with Endeavor Group's UFC to form TKO. Longtime Hollywood super agent Ari Emanuel is the CEO of both Endeavor and TKO. That deal, announced in April 2023, made McMahon the executive chairman of the new company, and he gave up majority control of WWE. At the time, he told CNBC he wouldn't be 'in the weeds' with creative decisions but he would weigh in on big decisions. That marked a big shift for McMahon. His family has been in the business dating back to the early 20th century. After buying the company from his father, who was known as 'Vince Sr.,', the younger McMahon then employed flamboyant superstars such as Hulk Hogan and the Rock, staging glitzy pay-per-view events like WrestleMania. to build it into an international sensation. And while WWE is still defined in part by the family, McMahon's daughter and son-in-law are publicly attempting to push the brand into the future. Stephanie McMahon in the ring during Night Two of WrestleMania 40 at Lincoln Financial Field on April 7, 2024 in Philadelphia. WWE / Getty Images At WrestleMania 40, held earlier this month in Philadelphia, McMahon-Levesque surprised the crowd with an appearance and hailed her husband's leadership. 'Every Wrestlemania is special for its own reason, but I think WrestleMania 40 might be the one I'm most proud of, because this is the first WrestleMania of the Paul Levesque era,' she said. (Linda McMahon joined her daughter backstage, according to an Instagram photo posted by wrestling star Charlotte Flair.) Levesque himself proclaimed a 'new era' for WWE. It was a significant moment for the brand, coming during the first WrestleMania since the Grant lawsuit -- and it's the first one under TKO's management. Still, some rank-and-file WWE employees have griped that the company hasn't done more to address the situation, according to an insider. After McMahon quit, Shapiro told a global town hall for both TKO and Endeavor employees 'in no uncertain terms' that the former wrestling boss wouldn't return, according to another insider. Shapiro also assured employees that Levesque and WWE President Nick Khan have his support, this person said. Otherwise, WWE is more relaxed since McMahon resigned in January, sources said. When McMahon was still running things, he would come in late in the afternoon and often stay until around midnight or beyond, two current employees said. (His office at WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, is unoccupied but otherwise intact, according to an executive, who called it 'spooky.') He had a reputation for being capricious and quick to fire employees, which generated fear and created a chilling effect, according to sources. Now there's more levity and freedom to make a mistake or suggest an idea, some employees said. The current leadership operates more conventionally, giving underperforming employees a standard progress report and opportunities to improve before taking action, they added. The World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) headquarters in Stamford, Conn., on Jan. 31, 2022. Johnny Milano / Bloomberg via Getty Images file Some McMahon loyalists remain, but one employee said: 'WWE is actually a really great place to work, and Vince distracted from that. It's been much better since he left.' Another said: 'People feel like they're on steadier ground.' The company, meanwhile, is charting its post-McMahon course with the help of lucrative media rights deals. In September, WWE signed a $1.4 billion deal with NBC News' parent company, NBCUniversal, for domestic rights to 'Friday Night SmackDown.' In January, it inked a 10-year, $5 billion pact with Netflix to move its flagship 'Raw' show and other programs to the streaming giant next year. WWE announced both agreements after it became part of TKO and McMahon ceded much of his official control over the brand. There's yet another sign suggesting that McMahon's distance from WWE is more than temporary: He has sold hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of shares in TKO since November, a sizable chunk of those sales coming after he resigned in January. That's different from when he briefly stepped down in 2022. 'This time, it's like, OK, now, it's over -over,' one of the insiders said. A version of this story was published on CNBC.com .

U.S. District Court Tyler Campanella, the stepson of former RHONJ cast member Sigalit \"Siggy\" Flicker, was arrested in New York City on Wednesday, according to court records. He faces five misdemeanor charges.\nFlicker had posted photos from inside of the Capitol on Jan. 6 along with the caption \"I love patriots so much. Stay safe Tyler. We love you,\" the FBI said. She added some emojis and a \"Stop the Steal\" hashtag, according to an image of the post included in the FBI affidavit.\nA screenshot from the Instagram account \"homegrownterrorists\" that appears to contain a screenshot of an online post by Siggy Flicker. U.S. District Court Phone records subpoenaed by the government indicate that Campanella's phone, which was associated with Flicker's account, was inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, according to the FBI. The account was associated with Bayside Chrysler, according to the FBI, where Campanella was listed as a sales manager. A message left for Campanella at the Chrysler dealership was not immediately returned. Court records do not indicate whether Campanella has a lawyer.\nFlicker is a Trump supporter who has posted images of herself with the former president, and apparently encountered Trump at an event at Mar-a-Lago last month. Flicker did not immediately respond to a request for comment. There's no evidence that Flicker herself was at the Capitol, and she said in a social media video after the attack that she was in Florida.\nFlicker is friends with Alina Habba, a lawyer who has represented Trump and frequently appears on cable news in support of the former president. Habba did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News.\nMore than 1,387 people have been charged in connection with the Capitol attack, with more than 984 defendants have been convicted. Of the more than 859 defendants sentenced, more than 520 have been sentenced to periods of incarceration that have ranged from a few days behind bars to 22 years in federal prison.\nThe overwhelming majority of Jan. 6 defendants currently in custody either admitted to their criminal conduct or were found guilty at trial; only 15 Jan. 6 defendants are currently in pre-trial custody.\nRyan J.

Today, the search continues for five more alternate jurors. And then the first week of the former president's criminal trial will come to a close. Looking back, the ways Trump tried to control the narrative are clear. On Monday, Trump stood in front of reporters ready to unleash a grievance-laced tirade that, at times, did not totally reflect reality. He fixated on Judge Juan Merchan's decision to not yet rule on whether Trump can attend his son Barron's high school graduation next month. The key words to keep in mind are 'not yet.'\nBut Trump painted a picture for his supporters of a biased judge blocking a loving father from seeing his son's graduation. The disdain toward Merchan from Trump's supporters was swift.\nThen there were arguments about whether Trump fell asleep at one point and about jury selection rules. Those sorts of distortions and fights about nearly every aspect of the trial dominated the first week — and earned him $1.6 million in small-dollar donations.

Ilhan Omar's daughter, pictured above — were arrested yesterday at a pro-Palestinian protest at New York's Columbia University after school officials voiced concerns about demonstrators violating campus policies. The protests grew throughout the afternoon and eventually, more than 500 students entered the quad area, according to NYPD Commissioner Edward Cuban.

Inside a convention for a far-right sheriffs movement Conspiracy theorists, felons and election deniers flocked to a Las Vegas hotel. They were there to attend a far-right sheriffs convention, where discussions centered around their belief in encroaching federal power and rampant voter fraud, despite a lack of evidence. The event by the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, or CSPOA, included a lackluster Pledge of Allegiance, a smooth jazz rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" disgruntled former politicians and a pizza party.

Staff Pick: A regional reproductive care void on both sides of the border A growing number of American women are seeking abortion care in Mexico, and they're navigating a medley of laws that, like the U.S., vary according to Mexico's different states.

What we found is that most Mexican border states ban elective abortions, despite a Supreme Court ruling last year that decriminalized the procedure nationwide. Add Arizona's recent ruling on an 1864 law that will ban most abortions in the state, and women on both sides of the border could soon find themselves in a remote and politicized region with little reproductive care. — Isabela Espadas Barros Leal, associate editor\ndug into some of these laws.

After the first 96 prospective jurors were brought into a New York courtroom, Judge Juan Merchan asked if any of those assembled could not be 'fair and impartial.'

Other analysts have warned that if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decides to hit back hard, it could plunge the wider Middle East into war.\nWhile Israel and Iran have been enemies since the late 1970s, the bitter conflict has long been confined to secret assassinations, audacious cyberattacks, nuclear sabotage and war-by-proxy.

NBC News found that at least 150 paid 'Premium' subscriber X accounts and thousands of unpaid accounts have posted or amplified pro-Nazi content on X in recent months, often in apparent violation of X's rules. The paid accounts posting the content all consistently posted antisemitic or pro-Nazi material.

Staff Pick: Florida teens give back — and forge a path forward Most people, if they've heard of Immokalee, Florida, at all, know it as an agricultural center. It is, of course, but this story focuses on the Guadalupe Center Tutor Corps program , which matches Immokalee high school students, who are children of immigrant workers, with younger students. Not only do the tutors get paid, they also get the tools they need — including help securing scholarships — to go to college.\nthis story focuses on the Guadalupe Center Tutor Corps program, which matches Immokalee high school students, who are children of immigrant workers, with younger students.

            "excerpt": "Conservative influencers were briefed about House Speaker Mike Johnson's latest election integrity bill well before it was publicly announced.",
            "summary": "High-profile rightwing influencers were briefed on House Speaker Mike Johnson's voter registration bill well in advance of its announcement in what appears to be a coordinated social media campaign meant to drum up support for the legislation, which is dead on arrival on the Senate.\nConservative influencers posted dozens of times before Johnson, R-La., publicly announced the bill alongside former President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, calling on Congress to pass the bill, which has not yet been filed, and offering policy details that are still not available to the public.\nThe legislation targets voting by non-citizens, which is already illegal and very rare. Johnson's appearance at Mar-a-Lago came at a time when his speakership is in a precarious position, with attacks from far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who has a significant social media following. Getting some public support and praise from Trump could give Johnson a bit of protection with the Republican base, as could drumming up support from conservative social media influencers.\nAt 3:50 p.m. ET on Friday, Ryan Fournier, the chair of Students for Trump who boasts a million followers on X, appears to have been the first to post the name of the bill and details of the legislation.\nJohnson's press conference was scheduled to begin at 4:30 p.m. ET on Friday but began just after 5 p.m. Neither the speaker nor his office would provide specifics on the legislation in advance of Friday's event when asked by NBC News, but his office confirmed Monday that background information about the bill had been sent in advance to conservative-leaning influencers.\nIn the hours leading up to Johnson and Trump's press conference, social media posters including Libs of TikTok, DC_Draino and EndWokeness promoted the legislation online. They all called the bill 'the SAVE Act,' though Johnson did not name it as such.\n\"PASS THE BILL,' wrote DC_Draino at 4:22 p.m., claiming the bill 'would require blue states to obtain proof of citizenship for voter registration.'\nOn X, EndWokeness wrote that the bill would add penalties for election officials registering noncitizens to vote.\nRep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, reposted EndWokeness's post at 4:40 p.m., saying he'd authored the bill. A spokesman for the Republican lawmaker said the bill has not yet been filed yet, but Roy posted a screencap of the first few lines of legislation ahead of Johnson's speech.\nhas not yet been filed yet, but Roy posted a screencap of the first few lines of legislation ahead of Johnson's speech. The bill is dead on arrival, with Democrats controlling the U.S. Senate. Johnson said Friday, though, that simply putting the bill to a vote would be \"interesting.\"\n\"When we put this bill on the floor, you're going to see a record vote by Republicans and Democrats,\" he said. \"They're going to have to go on record, do you believe that Americans and Americans alone should be the ones who vote in American elections? We're about to find out their answer.\"\nIt is illegal for non-citizens to vote in state and federal elections, though some municipalities allow non-citizen voting in local elections only.\nChrissy Clark, a conservative influencer who contributes to Turning Point USA, appears to have been one of the individuals who received early information about the legislation.\n'Speaker Mike Johnson just dropped information about the SAVE Act, which basically its only goal is that only U.S. citizens can vote in federal elections — what a concept,' Clark said in a video posted more than 20 minutes before Johnson would begin speaking.\nClark's post included numerous details about the bill that were not yet public.\n'The whole message that he's trying to portray is you should be required to provide proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration. That doesn't necessarily mean a state-issued ID,' she said in the produced short video, which was posted on TikTok and X.\nClark's post is tagged with the hashtag #partnership, a tag some influencers use to disclose they have been paid for a post. Clark did not respond to an emailed request for comment, and Johnson's office did not respond to a request for comment on paying influencers.\nAnother conservative-leaning Twitter and TikTok account, Ding News, posted a produced video about the \"common sense SAVE Act\" at 4:11 p.m., nearly an hour before the press conference took place. An email sent to Ding News was not returned.\nAnother conservative influencer, Isabella DeLuca, posted about the legislation at 5:07 p.m., at the same minute when the press conference began.\n\"Speaker Johnson just introduced the SAVE Act, a pivotal measure to fortify our democracy and save our elections,\" DeLuca wrote on Twitter.\nLast month, DeLuca was arrested on Jan. 6 charges, with the FBI saying she climbed into the Capitol through a broken window and helped hand a table out a window that was used to assault police officers. Her Twitter account had been set to private earlier in the day, before her post about Johnson's bill.\n\"America's democracy hinges on the integrity of our elections,\" the Jan. 6 defendant wrote.\nRyan J. Reilly Jane C. Timm Ali Vitali, Kyle Stewart and Matt Dixon contributed.",

            "excerpt": "Jewish voters could play a major role in the big battleground state this fall. Before that, there's a key primary approaching Tuesday in Pittsburgh.",
            "summary": "PITTSBURGH — In the heart of one of America's most prominent historically Jewish neighborhoods, Dan and Baila Cohen keep the front entrance of their 70-year-old Judaica store locked during business hours.\nIt's not how they'd prefer it. But in light of Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack in Israel, Israel's ongoing military campaign in Gaza and tensions at home, they said, the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh told them they needed to be vigilant about who enters their business.\n'That's the reality of the world,' Dan Cohen said.\nIt's not the first time they've had to take additional safety precautions. The couple completed their purchase of Pinsker's Books and Judaica in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood in 2018 just days after a white supremacist gunned down 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue a few blocks away in the deadliest antisemitic attack in American history. But this time feels different.\n'Oct. 27 really unified' Squirrel Hill and Pittsburgh, Baila Cohen said of the Tree of Life massacre. 'Oct. 7 … really started polarizing the community itself, because that's when we started seeing much more of the infighting and conflicts.'\nConversations with more than 30 political strategists, activists and voters outlined how that tension has put Jewish voters in an unfamiliar spot ahead of the 2024 elections: on the front lines of the fight for control of the White House and Congress. Nowhere is that more apparent than in Pennsylvania, the swing state with the largest Jewish population — about 300,000 voting-age Jews in a state President Joe Biden won by roughly 80,000 votes in 2020.\nWhat's more, the congressional district that includes Squirrel Hill features a primary Tuesday that is among the first electoral tests of sentiment on both sides of the conflict in Gaza and concerns over rising antisemitism in the U.S. Democratic Rep. Summer Lee, a 'squad'-aligned progressive critical of Israel's handling of the war and one of the first lawmakers to call for a cease-fire last year, will face Bhavini Patel, an Edgewood Borough Council member who has painted Lee's advocacy as harmful to Biden's re-election chances and out of step with her district.\n'We have communities that are hurting. The Jewish community is one of them. And there are people who are … not going to agree 100% on everything that you say,' Lee said in an interview, adding she has been 'very clear and very upfront' about her cease-fire position. 'I have condemned Hamas. We've worked with the families of hostages; we've done everything that I think is necessary to do that. And at the end of the day, we disagree.'\nA dozen Jewish voters in the district who spoke to NBC News, whether supporting Lee or Patel, almost universally said their votes in November would be driven by issues beyond Israel, saying that the Jewish electorate isn't a 'monolith' and that democracy, abortion rights and the economy weighed heavily on them.\nMost Jewish voters in Squirrel Hill — and nationally — align with the Democratic Party. A Pew Research Center survey released this month found 69% of Jews leaning Democratic, while 29% aligned Republican.\nBut Republicans aren't looking for a massive defection. GOP strategists and Republicans involved in Jewish outreach expressed confidence that Democratic divisions over Israel will help move a small but potentially significant number of Jewish voters into their camp in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona. They pointed to surveys showing President Donald Trump's improved performance among Jews in 2020, compared with his 2016 race, as evidence of a slow shift that could continue.\n'Before Oct. 7, most candidates would say this issue is so messy. … It's not necessarily something that I want to focus on in my campaign,' said Tali deGroot, political director for the liberal Jewish group J Street. 'And I would have said, ‘Absolutely, this isn't a voting issue for people we poll year after year.' And it's too soon to tell if it's going to be a voting issue. But not talking about it is not an option.'‘Playing with fire' In Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, the war and its impact at home took center stage last week at a campaign event where Lee launched her 'Jews for Summer' coalition.\nLee talked about 'how our liberation is tied together,' whether 'in western Pennsylvania or the West Bank.' She spoke about how the district still needs 'deep healing' following both the Oct. 7 attack and the killing of Jews at Tree of Life. And she framed her primary as a covert Republican effort to divide a multiethnic, cross-religious support base by using splits over Israel.\n'There are people who have to convince you that the only reason why I could believe in peace is because I actually hate some of our neighbors, not because we love each other,' said Lee, who overcame significant spending by groups aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group, when she narrowly won her first congressional primary in 2022.\nIsrael didn't have the salience it does now. Lee has accused the Israeli government of committing 'war crimes,\" called for an end to unconditional military aid to the country and joined a handful of other progressives in mid-2022, before the Israel-Hamas war, who voted against a GOP-led resolution that said Israel wasn't 'a racist or apartheid state.' She has also condemned Hamas' attack and repeatedly spoken out against antisemitism.\nOn Saturday, she joined 36 Democrats and 21 Republicans in voting against an aid package to the country, which passed overwhelmingly. She and Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., were the only Pennsylvania members to vote against it.\nHer early call for a cease-fire is now largely in step with Democratic voters, but Jewish leaders have expressed unease with how Lee and some of her allies have discussed the issue. Last month, more than 40 Pittsburgh-area rabbis wrote in a letter, after an earlier meeting with Lee, that she has 'continued to use divisive rhetoric' that the group has at times 'perceived as openly antisemitic.'\nTheir letter didn't describe that rhetoric, but it said Lee opposed House measures to condemn antisemitism and criticized her calls for an 'unconditional cease-fire from one side,' which they said 'devalues the lives and beliefs of one group.' They also called on her to return campaign contributions 'from people who have voiced virulently antisemitic sentiments.' In February, Lee canceled an appearance before the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations amid backlash over other speakers' antisemitic and homophobic remarks, which she condemned.\nKaren Hochenberg, president of a local Democratic club that has endorsed Patel, said Lee has lost considerable support in the Jewish community, including hers. While Hochenberg aligns with Lee on many issues, she and others have been 'hurt' by some of her votes and actions, and she said she wished Lee had been more vocal about the Hamas attack.\n'Many Jews now are starting to question where are we on the road map of intersectionality,' Hochenberg said. 'Jews are starting to really take a look at how comfortable we are and if we're going to send candidates to Congress who's going to be there and have the voice of the Jewish community in mind, as well.'\nJeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgher leading a new Jewish voter group, said the pushback Lee faces isn't so much about Israel but about what he called an unwillingness to meet with constituents who don't share her views.\n'She finds the individuals who agree with her already who are anti-Zionist, who are extremist or fringe of the left of politics, and she will hold them up on a pedestal while spreading things' that, Kazzaz said, make local Jews 'less safe.'\nBut overall, Lee is looking stronger in her district now than in her first run, even to some opponents. AIPAC-linked groups aren't getting involved in her primary this time. Lee has framed her campaign around efforts to counter MAGA Republicans and bring federal dollars to the district.\nJonathan Mayo, a Squirrel Hill resident co-leading the Jews for Summer coalition, told NBC News he aligns with Lee's position on Israel but emphasized that he's not a single-issue voter.\n'It is so important to speak out and show that there are members of the Squirrel Hill Jewish community who still very much support Summer Lee,' he said.\nPatel, meanwhile, is framing her challenge to Lee around who offers Biden the most support, hitting Lee for not criticizing activists and groups calling for 'uncommitted' votes against the president in Tuesday's primary.\n'It's essentially playing with fire,' Patel said in an interview, arguing it could boost Trump.\nLee allies have countered that anti-Biden GOP megadonors support Patel's campaign. An outside group boosting Patel recently disclosed that it received an $800,000 donation from right-wing billionaire Jeffrey Yass. (Patel said she 'denounces' Yass, calling any focus on him a distraction.)\nLee has said she is supporting Biden in the fall. She's endorsed by congressional Democratic leadership and by Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has become arguably the most staunchly pro-Israel Democrat in Congress. And in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, Biden shouted out Lee as someone 'who had my back.'\n'We're going to make sure that the person who's sitting in the White House is not going to be replaced,' Lee said at her event on a recent Sunday.\nSeveral attendees said they were casting anti-Biden protest votes Tuesday. But most said they would support him this fall.\nOne of them, Harry Hochheiser, said Biden 'is the only legitimate choice' against Trump. He said the divisions opened up in the Jewish community over the war have been devastating.\n'I don't think any of us enjoy these divisions,' Hochheiser, a University of Pittsburgh professor and pro-Palestinian activist voting uncommitted in the primary but backing Biden against Trump, said of tensions in the Jewish community over Israel.\n‘More salient than it has been' The fight for Jewish votes in Pittsburgh is only part of a bigger landscape. Across Pennsylvania, Republican Dave McCormick has put Israel at the forefront of his campaign against Democratic Sen. Bob Casey. Nationally, groups in both parties are preparing for what they say could be the largest investment ever made to court the Jewish vote at the presidential level.\nBiden's handling of the war is the main flashpoint. Initially, he was more deferential to Israel. But as the death toll mounted in Gaza and left-wing blowback intensified at home, he has sharpened his criticism of Israeli leadership, pushed for increased humanitarian aid and ramped-up efforts to reach a cease-fire agreement. Still, he hasn't gone as far as his critics to his left would like.\nAs for whether Republicans can pick up voters disaffected by the Democratic divide over Israel, Mark Mellman, president of Democratic Majority for Israel, said it's 'mostly noise' but cautioned 'there is a serious chance' depending how the coming months play out.\nJewish voters have 'been extraordinarily appreciative of the support that President Biden and Democratic leaders have given Israel over the course of this conflict,' he said. 'I hear from some people that is beginning to change as people perceive some change in the positions of those Democratic leaders. But look … Biden has been extraordinary.'\nA 2021 Pew Research Center survey found a wide split in partisanship among Jewish voters depending on which movement they aligned with. Orthodox Jews favored Republicans over Democrats by 75% to 20%, while 70% of Conservative Jews and 80% of Reform Jews backed Democrats.\nSam Markstein, national political director at the Republican Jewish Coalition, said much of the Jewish vote is based in states where Republicans have no shot at all, contributing to the gulf in support between Republicans and Democrats. Pointing to an Associated Press VoteCast survey after the 2020 election that found Trump improved on his 2016 performance among Jewish voters, Markstein predicts the Republican Jewish Coalition will make its 'largest investment at the top of the ticket ever' this cycle to target Jewish voters in battlegrounds.\n'That's where you're going to see the most success this year,' he said.\nSome other surveys had more positive trends for Democrats. This month's Pew survey found the share of Jewish voters who align with Democrats has increased 8 points since 2020.\nDan Siegel, who led Jewish outreach for Biden's 2020 campaign, said Jewish voters' foremost concerns are similar to those of any other voting group: the economy, health care and education.\n'I do think [Israel] may be a little bit more top of mind. But I also think at the end of the day, elections are a binary choice,' Siegel said, predicting Jewish voters 'are going to want that strong, steady hand, not an authoritarian demagogue who is unwieldy at best in a crisis.'\nTrump, who strongly favored Israel as president, has offered limited commentary on the war. Speaking last month with Israel Hayom, an Israeli newspaper, Trump said, 'You have to finish up your war. You have to get it done. We have to get to peace. We can't have this going on.'\nBiden's campaign has zoomed in on recent comments Trump has made about Jewish voters; he said on Real America's Voice that 'any Jewish person who votes for Biden does not love Israel and, frankly, should be spoken to.'\nIn a statement, Karoline Leavitt, Trump's national press secretary, slammed Democrats for caving in 'to the demands of far-left Palestinian extremists.\"\nAsked about Trump's comments on the war, Markstein said he believed Trump 'was just giving voice to the frustration of … people [who] want this to be concluded, with Israel defeating Hamas and rescuing the hostages.' On Trump's remarks about Jewish voters, Markstein said Trump 'was just trying to say in a Trumpian way … why haven't they been more vocal in their opposition to what their own leaders of their party are doing?'\nBack in Pittsburgh, Kipp Dawson, a Jewish civil rights activist backing Lee, said she would be horrified by Trump's re-election and expressed hope that Lee would be able to bring skeptical Democrats back on board with Biden this fall.\n'My sense is that things are extraordinarily in flux in this country right now,' she said. 'The big issue for November is who's going to come out to vote.'\nAt Pinsker's, the Cohens declined to say whom they'd support in next week's primary or the general election, though they said a number of Jews in Squirrel Hill were eager to back Patel.\n'The Jewish community really feels that if they don't take the stand now, [U.S. support for Israel] is not going to be assured,' Baila Cohen said. 'Everyone's very interested in getting actively involved and being part of the political scene in a way that doesn't always play out.'\nAllan Smith Emma Barnett",

            "excerpt": "How moderate Democrats joined with old enemies on the left to stop their own friends in the center from challenging Joe Biden.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — Once upon a time, before the multimillion-dollar negative campaigns and allegations of running 'a conspiracy to commit extortion, voter intimidation, and other criminal behavior,' they were friends. Good friends.\nThe people who run No Labels and Third Way, two of the most prominent centrist organizations in Washington, had all come up together in the small world of Clinton-era center-left politics.\nNancy Jacobson, an early Bill Clinton hire and the founder of No Labels, helped raise the initial money and secure the necessary political blessings to start Third Way. The think tank was co-founded by Jon Cowan, whom Jacobson viewed as something of a mentee. Cowan, now Third Way's president, even signed the ketubah (the Jewish wedding contract) at Jacobson's wedding to Mark Penn, whose firm conducts No Labels' polls.\nThen came the 2024 election — and No Labels' decision to try to field a bipartisan 'unity ticket' against both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, backed by a reported budget of $70 million. Third Way, which may be centrist but is firmly Democratic, viewed this as a misguided, no-hope effort that could only spoil the election for Biden and help to re-elect Trump, with potentially disastrous consequences.\n\"There were deep personal stakes and relationships,\" Cowan said.\nA centrist civil war broke out in the C-suites and steakhouses of Washington and Manhattan. Like so many insider conflicts, it was deeply personal. There were betrayal, a double agent, a secret team of political operatives, some very unlikely allies — and a decisive victory for one side that left the other seething and bitter.\nEven some people close to No Labels acknowledge the campaign against it largely succeeded in its mission: dissuading any potential candidates from joining its ticket. But the cost, they say, will be a gaping wound at the center of what's left of American centrism.\n\"What does Third Way go back to?\" asked former Rep. Max Rose, a moderate New York Democrat who spoke to NBC News at Jacobson's request. \"Because it doesn't seem logical that an organization that considers itself a centrist policy organization randomly makes war on another organization like this.\"\nOr as Holly Page, a longtime moderate Democratic strategist who has worked for both groups but ended up in No Labels' camp put it of Third Way: 'They sold out the center so they could get a seat at the table with [former Biden chief of staff] Ron Klain.\"\nNo Labels was so incensed by what Page referred to as the anti-No Labels campaign's \"little fraternity games\" that the group lodged a complaint with the Justice Department. In a letter and an indignant news conference, they accused their old friends and their new allies of violating anti-racketeering laws, typically used to prosecute the mafia, by engaging in an \"unlawful conspiracy to subvert Americans' voting rights.\" There is no sign the Justice Department took any action on the compliant.\nThird Way and its allies, meanwhile, believe they're the real moderates here. They forged an actual bipartisan coalition of groups spanning Republicans to progressives to support a moderate Democratic president and to stop Trump, few people's idea of a moderate, whom they note No Labels praised as a \"problem solver\" during his 2016 campaign.\nthey're the real moderates here. They forged an actual bipartisan coalition of groups spanning Republicans to progressives to support a moderate Democratic president and to stop Trump, few people's idea of a moderate, whom they note No Labels praised as a \"problem solver\" during his 2016 campaign. 'You're not building a pro-Biden coalition; it's an anti-Trump coalition,' said Sarah Longwell, a Republican strategist and publisher of the conservative website The Bulwark, who supported the anti-No Labels effort. 'They absolutely would subtract people who, when push comes to shove, will vote for Joe Biden.'\nSimilar beginnings go separate ways In many ways, Third Way was an unlikely marshal for a No Labels counterstrike.\nBoth have long been dismissed by the left as stodgy corporatists and crypto-Republicans, and Third Way and No Labels exist in overlapping social circles, draw from similar funders and promote a common ideology. Third Way's previous campaigns took on the left, like when it fought progressive challengers in House primaries and tried to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., from winning the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.\n'Everybody in the centrist donor universe knew No Labels was doing this ticket, and everybody knew we were leading the opposition. You were on one side or the other,' Cowan said. 'And on the other side were some of the wealthiest people in the country and they were very angry at us.'\nThird Way lost a board member who sided with No Labels, and its leaders received word from several other unhappy donors that they should not expect another cent.\nBut while Third Way is fundamentally a Democratic organ, Jacobson has fallen (or been pushed, depending on whom you ask) out of the party's ranks, and now, No Labels views itself as the only group righteous and innovative enough to think outside the red-blue divide.\nStill, that familiarity meant Third Way spoke enough of No Labels' language to understand it and the people funding it — and how to reach the potential candidates it tried to recruit.\nAnd Third Way's moderate credentials helped it pick off potential No Labels allies, from its affiliated members of Congress to New York Times columnist David Brooks — the first major voice to hoist the unity ticket flag, only to later lower it — to the Clintons, the first family of Democratic centrism.\nThe former president and secretary of state hardly needed convincing of the threat a third-party campaign posed to Biden — Hillary Clinton had partly blamed the Green Party for her 2016 loss. So over lunch last July at their home in Chappaqua, New York, the Clintons, each joined by a top aide, talked through strategy with Cowan and Third Way Vice President Matt Bennett and vowed to help privately through their networks, according to three sources familiar with the meeting.\nBill Clinton joined the anti-recruiting team working against No Labels, making personal appeals to two prominent No Labels targets — Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican — that a third-party candidate could not win.\n'Pearl Harbored' Jacobson expressed anger, dismay and a sense of betrayal about Third Way's actions. 'We were Pearl Harbored,' she told supporters on a call, first reported by Puck.\nBill Clinton's lobbying effort was part of a broader campaign, which included dozens groups and prominent figures from the left, the center and the anti-Trump right, built around Third Way's 'war room.'\nAs Bennett put it in the first large gathering of the group, they had to 'build the idea in the minds of the political elites and the people that they talk to ... that if you get involved with this ... you're really risking your entire reputation and your legacy.'\nThird Way identified a long list of potential No Labels targets and set about finding common friends and allies between the potential candidates and the anti-No Labels coalition — people who would be seen as credible messengers. No Labels said 30 candidates passed. And by the end, the opposing coalition says, it reached every name that surfaced.\nThird Way leaders worked the Democratic side of the aisle after securing the blessing of party leaders in the White House, on Capitol Hill and in the Democratic National Committee. Meanwhile, its anti-Trump GOP allies and a clandestine team of 10 to 20 Republican operatives worked to 'surround' potential candidates with appeals, including survey research commissioned from former Rep. Liz Cheney's pollster, which concluded that they could not win running with No Labels.\nEvery potential candidate got a message tailored to their pressure points — their financial needs, their legacies, their future political prospects — from credible figures like local business leaders, clergy and former aides.\nThe chief goal was to make it impossible for No Labels to deliver the kind of big-name ticket it had promised.\n\"This was elite-driven,\" Bennett said. \"We knew they had enough donors that we couldn't deny them money. But we also knew enough about their donors to know they would expect a high-level candidate with a certain stature and would not accept someone who was not obviously credible.\"\nTheir targets included highly publicized suspects like Manchin, Hogan and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, though they were particularly worried about Bill Haslam, the former governor of Tennessee, because he is a billionaire who could self-fund.\nUnlikely allies It wasn't just anti-Trump Republicans like the Lincoln Project and former Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol who joined Third Way's efforts to brush back No Labels. Mainstream Democrats like Klain and former Democratic Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama were joined by leaders on the left who were used to warring, not collaborating, with Third Way.\nLunching with Bennett and working with his group helped 'humanize' people she had viewed as 'an enemy,' said Melissa Byrne, a left-wing activist who has often sparred with moderate Democrats over issues like student debt.\nByrne stressed — 'print this in all caps, bold,' she said — that she will go to war again with Third Way over policy if and when the time comes.\nBennett and the executive director of the liberal group MoveOn, Rahna Epting, ended up working together closely, playing up an odd-couple routine in a series of meetings on Capitol Hill, in the media and even in a public debate against No Labels strategists.\n'Our partnership with Third Way to come together and stop No Labels may be surprising to some, but it is a testament to how high the stakes are to keep Trump out of the White House,' Epting said.\nMeanwhile, some Republicans joined a campaign run by Democrats thanks to a similar calculation: Despite their policy differences, they were united by opposition to Trump and a shared belief that a third-party candidate could be a decisive boon to him.\n\"If you want to go experiment with third-party stuff, go crazy — just not this year,\" said Rick Wilson, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project, another cornerstone of the anti-No Labels campaign.\nThe broad coalition even included a secret member from the most unlikely of sources: No Labels itself.\nNo Labels did its best to keep the names of its delegates, donors and potential candidates under wraps. But the anti-No Labels campaign felt it had a good idea what was going on behind the curtain, thanks to a No Labels delegate who had grown disillusioned and started leaking to the other side.\nThe turncoat, whom Cowan and Bennett would only say was an 'average citizen' who initially joined No Labels out of a sincere belief in its mission, 'was incredibly helpful to us and did so at some personal sacrifice and risk,' Bennett said.\nPeople familiar with No Labels' thinking did not dispute that they had a leaker and said they were unaware of who it might be.\nBut No Labels allies say these kinds of cloak-and-dagger tactics highlight the hypocrisy, as they see it, of supposed champions of democracy and voting rights opposing another party's ballot access.\n'It's just discouraging to see partisans and politicians protecting their turf,' said former Rep. Joe Cunningham, a Democrat from South Carolina who worked with No Labels.\nRose, the former New York congressman, said No Labels' presidential ticket was always a long shot, so its opponents' victory lap is just \"someone seeing where things were going anyway and trying to claim credit.\"\n\"No Labels considered something that didn't really have legs and made a pretty noble decision to not pursue it,' he said.\nWhile No Labels' 2024 push is over, third-party candidates are still in the campaign, especially another ex-Democrat who could affect Biden's chances in November: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Countering Kennedy, though, will be a very different kind of conflict, even as Third Way remains committed to battling Biden's third-party foes.\nThird Way turned out to be the right group for the job of taking down No Labels. Can they take down an outsider too?\nAlex Seitz-Wald",

            "summary": "WASHINGTON, April 15 (Reuters) — U.S. President Joe Biden and his wife Jill on Monday released tax returns showing that their income rose 7% to $619,976 in 2023 and that the couple paid 23.7% of their income in federal taxes.\nBiden released the data on the day U.S. taxes for the prior year are due, and as the Democrat seeks re-election in 2024.\nDonald Trump, his Republican opponent, broke with the tradition of presidents making their federal tax returns public, saying he was not able to do so while being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, even as the agency claimed he was free to release them.\nA U.S. House of Representatives committee controlled in 2022 by Democrats released Trump's redacted returns for 2015 through 2020 over the former president's objections.\nTrump was in a New York courtroom on Monday for a historic criminal trial, one of several legal matters that has implicated the ex-president's personal finances.\n'President Biden believes that all occupants of the Oval Office should be open and honest with the American people, and that the longstanding tradition of annually releasing presidential tax returns should continue unbroken,' the White House said in a statement.\nTrump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn a post on social media on Monday, Trump said American families benefited from tax cuts passed while he was in office. He said if Biden 'gets his way' people would be facing 'colossal' tax increases. He included no information about his 2023 tax filing.\nBiden and his wife earned four-fifths of their income from their jobs as U.S. president and teacher at Northern Virginia Community College, respectively. Joe Biden drew a $400,000 wage, while Jill Biden earned $85,985 from her job teaching English at Northern Virginia Community College.\nThe additional income was drawn from interest on investments, pensions and a corporate entity that collects the couple's book royalties. Most of the increase of income relative to 2022 was from interest paid on one of the couple's bank accounts, according to the tax return.\nThe proportion of Joe Biden's income that went to federal taxes was roughly equal to the prior year.\nBiden plans to deliver a speech on tax policy from his Scranton, Pennsylvania, birthplace on Tuesday that is expected to include a call for the wealthy to pay higher rates. Pennsylvania is expected to be one of the most closely contested 2024 election states in November.\nThe president's return also showed that Biden donated $20,477 to charity, roughly 3.3% of their income, with the beneficiaries including several churches and public health groups like the Epilepsy Foundation and the Fraternal Order of Police.\nBiden's running mate Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, also released a tax return showing $450,380 income for 2023, federal taxes of $88,570 and charitable donations of $23,026.",

            "excerpt": "Abortion is at the center of President Joe Biden's re-election campaign — an improbability for a politician who long expressed his personal discomfort with the practice.",
            "summary": "The issue has been particularly fraught for Biden, an 81-year-old steeped in Catholic teachings and reliant on religious faith to cope with unthinkable tragedy: the deaths of two children and his first wife, Neilia.\n'One of the things that carried him through his numerous difficulties is his Catholic approach of giving yourself to the Lord,' said Ted Kaufman, a longtime Biden confidant and his former Senate chief of staff.\nOn a human level, Biden has never fully overcome his misgivings about abortion. That's evident even in the language he occasionally uses. Two years ago, talking to reporters before he boarded Air Force One, Biden referred to the procedure as aborting 'a child' rather than a fetus, a clue about the point at which he believed life began.\nStill, his stance is that he won't impose his personal views on Americans who believe differently. In 1974, the year he said in an interview that Roe. v. Wade went 'too far,' he also voiced opposition to a constitutional amendment to ban abortion, albeit with some ambivalence, a hometown news report at the time shows.\nA column in the Morning News of Wilmington in January 1974 said Biden told a group of anti-abortion activists: \"I am not sure my stand against such a constitutional amendment is right, nor am I sure the anti-abortionist stand is right, but right now I think I am more right than you are.\"\nLauren Hitt, a campaign spokesperson, said in a prepared statement: 'Joe Biden has opposed abortion bans since the 1970s. As a senator, he voted repeatedly to protect Roe, and as President, he has used his full executive authority to fight back on extreme MAGA attacks on reproductive freedom.'\nBiden described the tensions between faith and policy last year at a Maryland fundraising event.\n'I happen to be a practicing Catholic,' he said. 'I'm not big on abortion. But guess what? Roe v. Wade got it right.'\nA look at his record shows that his path has had its share of starts and stops. As a senator in 1982, he voted in a committee meeting in favor of a constitutional amendment that would have given states the power to restrict abortion if they chose, effectively overturning Roe v. Wade.\nAt the time, Biden said his aim was to push the vote to the Senate floor, where it would finally be resolved. The measure never got that far, and when it came up again the next year, he voted against it.\nIn 2019, as the Democratic front-runner for the presidential nomination, he reversed his long-held position in favor of the so-called Hyde Amendment banning federal funding for abortions.\nThat about-face came at head-spinning speed. One day, his campaign said he supported the Hyde Amendment; the next day, amid blowback from fellow Democrats, he dropped that position. He justified the switch by saying he could no longer support the policy because Republicans were restricting access to abortion in poor neighborhoods.\n'Joe Biden is an Irish Catholic kid from Scranton,' said John Carr, founder of the Initiative on Catholic Life and Social Thought at Georgetown University. 'He seems to stay with Catholic orthodoxy until he thinks the political or other costs are too high.'\nBiden recognized early on that his nuanced position — wary of abortion at his core, accepting of abortion rights in the public square — was bound to cause him grief. He told fellow Sen. Abe Ribicoff of Connecticut in 1973 that his stance would most likely please no one, according to his 2007 memoir, 'Promises to Keep.'\nThat proved prescient.\nIn Biden's first year as president, conservative Catholic bishops argued that he shouldn't receive communion given his backing of abortion rights. He met privately with Pope Francis at the Vatican in October of that year, and afterward he said the pope had assured him that communion shouldn't be withheld.\nKathleen Sebelius, who was health and human services secretary in President Barack Obama's administration, said in an interview that she sympathized with Biden's predicament.\n'I'm born and raised Catholic and went to Catholic schools for 17 years of my life,' said Sebelius, a former governor of Kansas. 'I understand this issue. I've been called out by the archbishop. I was ordered not to take communion.\n'I've been on the personal side of this and the political side of this, and I understand the struggle that those of us who are raised in a faith community and then live in a political world deal with,' she added. 'It's not easy. I think Nancy Pelosi [the former House speaker, who is also Catholic] understands that. I think Joe Biden understands it. It's not a simple choice.'\nWhatever Biden's journey, most advocates say they now have full confidence that he is a reliable champion of abortion rights. When Biden left the Senate in 2009, he had a 100% rating from what was then called NARAL Pro-Choice America, a group promoting abortion access.\n'Biden is not the same man as he used to be when it comes to abortion rights,' said Ilyse Hogue, former president of the organization. 'I don't think he's been hiding his agenda just to win a second term and then secretly plans to turn around and become this anti-choice guy. I'm not worried about it at all.'\nSome still don't believe Biden goes far enough to promote reproductive rights.\nRenee Bracey Sherman, founder and a co-executive director of We Testify, an abortion rights advocacy group, said Biden should use his megaphone to remove the stigma tied to abortion instead of airing his personal doubts. She pointed to recent surveys indicating that 6 in 10 Catholics support abortion rights.\n'He's the president of the United States; he's not the pope of the United States,' Bracey Sherman said. 'I'm sorry, he's allowed to have his personal feelings. But at the end of the day, he is the president, and he is supposed to defend the Constitution and people in this country who need abortions.'\nBracey Sherman said her organization reached out to the Biden administration multiple times offering to bring Catholics who have had abortions into the White House to share their stories — but has yet to hear back.\n'He makes it seem as though he's the one who's following the Catholic teachings,' she said. 'But what about the rest of the Catholics in America who do support access to abortion and have abortions?'\nElections are a choice. Even Biden detractors say they're fully aware that the only realistic alternative at this point is Trump, whom they view as an extremist on the issue.\nAbortion looks to be one of Trump's glaring vulnerabilities. He has boasted about his role in overturning Roe v. Wade through his appointment of three conservative Supreme Court justices during his single term.\n'There is a fundamental question and a fundamental difference between the president and Donald Trump and their belief on whether the Constitution affords women a right to choose. Donald Trump does not; Joe Biden does,' said Kate Berner, a former Biden White House official.\nTrump recently said abortion decisions should be left to the states after he was criticized that he has been murky about what he believes. Even so, he sought to dissociate himself from a recent state court ruling in Arizona upholding a 19th century law imposing a near-total abortion ban.\nDisavowing Arizona's strict anti-abortion measure isn't so easy for Trump. The reason it can take effect springs directly from the votes of conservative Supreme Court justices whom Trump worked to install.\n'The fact is that he announced he was going to stack the court with justices who could be counted on to overrule Roe v. Wade,' said Laurence Tribe, a Harvard Law School professor emeritus. 'He succeeded in that. They did it. That led to the revival of laws like Arizona's, even if Trump says: ‘Oops, I'm sorry that's the consequence. It doesn't make me look good politically.''\nBiden was at the White House last Sunday, dealing with the fallout from Iran's attack on Israel. When he's in Washington on the weekends, he'll often attend services at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Georgetown, the church frequented by the nation's first Catholic president, John F. Kennedy. A Black Lives Matter banner hangs from a fence outside.\nBiden wasn't in the pews that day; he was attending a virtual meeting with U.S. allies about the Iranian attack.\nThe Rev. Patrick Earl led the Mass and greeted congregants at the doorway afterward. He said in an interview that Biden is a 'good presence' during services, recalling how he once left his seat to congratulate a boy's family celebrating his First Communion.\nEarl said he understood Biden's position, even if it conflicts with church teaching.\n'As the political leader of a very varied country, you can't just say, ‘You've got to believe as I believe,'\" he said. \"You just can't.\"\nPeter Nicholas Natasha Korecki",

            "excerpt": "The Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association is urging lawmen to form posses, seize voting machines and investigate baseless claims of voter fraud.",
            "summary": "LAS VEGAS — A conference for a far-right sheriffs group this week drew a parade of felons, disgraced politicians, election deniers, conspiracy theorists and, in the end, a few sheriffs.\nThe Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, or CSPOA, met in Las Vegas' Ahern Luxury Boutique Hotel conference center to publicly counter reports of extremism within the group and set a course for the coming election — one that involves sheriffs' investigating what they claim, despite a lack of evidence, is rampant voter fraud.\nThe group sees sheriffs as the highest authority in the U.S., more powerful than the federal government, and it wants these county officers to form posses to patrol polling places, seize voting machines and investigate the Democrats and foreign nations behind what they claim is a criminal effort to rig the vote by flooding the country with immigrants who vote illegally.\nCritics of the group — including voting rights advocates and extremism researchers — fear the CSPOA's new focus will amount to interference and legitimize disinformation about U.S. elections.\nBut the event Wednesday, which starred MAGA celebrities speaking to a half-empty audience made up of few actual sheriffs, pointed to just how fringe the group's ideas are — and how what once seemed like a movement on its way into the mainstream has lost political pull.\nThe conference opened a little behind schedule; the Pledge of Allegiance was delayed when organizers couldn't find a flag. After he searched the conference center's rooms, Tom Hamner, a Colorado man who served over two years in prison for the felony 'interfering with law enforcement' on Jan. 6, 2021, came forward with the scarf from his wife's neck. It wasn't exactly a flag, but it was emblazoned with stars and stripes.\n'That'll work!' emcee Alex Newman, an Epoch Times contributor, said before he led the crowd of dozens in the pledge. A smooth jazz rendition of 'The Star-Spangled Banner' followed, sung by a Las Vegas man awaiting trial on multiple felony charges who is accused of fraudulently posing as a certified firearms instructor.\nI sat with a small group of reporters at a table marked 'reserved,' a section Newman and other presenters pointed to throughout the day when they invoked, in Donald Trump's style, the 'fake media.'\nWe, along with candidates and elected officials, were admitted gratis. Others paid $49 for the day, which included breakfast, a box lunch and a 'pizza party.' Sponsors staffed booths advertising unofficial Trump merchandise, supplements, prepper gear and various patriot-themed swag.\nCSPOA's finances aren't public. It charges for events like this conference, offers a $99 yearly subscription for access to weekly webinars and solicits donations. It has also provided training sessions in nearly a dozen states, where police and sheriffs earn continuing education credits toward professional requirements. Last year, the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement ended the practice in the state.\nTo the extent that the 13-hour day was structured, it was broken roughly in two: the first half dedicated to the issue of encroaching federal power and the second to election denial and conspiracy theories.\nThe morning's sessions were the group's bread and butter. Former Arizona sheriff Richard Mack founded the CSPOA in 2011 to advocate for the belief that sheriffs — who generally operate independently with little to no oversight and are accountable only to voters — are the ultimate arbiters and enforcers of the Constitution and must act as a check on tyrannical federal power.\nIts early focus was on gun laws and other tea party pet causes, including immigration, the Affordable Care Act and attention-grabbing standoffs between ranchers and the Bureau of Land Management. 'The greatest threat we face today is not terrorists,' Mack's website read in 2012. 'It is our own federal government.'\nAfter two terms as sheriff in an Arizona border county, Mack lost re-election. He sought elected office multiple times but failed in bids for sheriff of a different county, governor and seats in the U.S. House and Senate.\nThere are no public rolls today, but Mack claims 10% of the country's 3,000 sheriffs are members, along with 10,000 ordinary citizens.\nWednesday's event drew a little over 100 people by midmorning. Attendees took notes, nodded along and offered somber 'Amens' and boisterous 'Nos!' when called for.\nJared Bosley, a farmer in South Dakota, told of his fight with the state over a pipeline company surveying his land without his permission. Two convicted Jan. 6 rioters said they were 'political prisoners.' Former Rep. Steve King of Iowa, his legacy a history of racist remarks, railed against the World Health Organization, the World Economic Forum and 'ringleader' George Soros. Another disgraced former congressman, Steve Stockman of Texas, sobbed as he shared his story of serving time in a federal prison for fraud and sobbed again when he got to the part where Trump commuted his 10-year sentence.\nThe supportive crowd felt like 'a warm bath,' Stockman said, his arms stretched toward heaven.\nRichard Fleming, a cardiologist who in 2009 pleaded guilty to felony charges of health care and mail fraud, gave a lengthy presentation alleging the Covid vaccines were bioweapons. Radio show host Wayne Allyn Root thundered into the microphone promoting the 'great replacement,' a racist conspiracy theory. 'They want to replace American citizens who love this country,' Root bellowed.\nIt was nearly lunchtime when the first active sheriff spoke. Bob Songer, a CSPOA board member and the sheriff of Klickitat County, Washington, said he enforces only laws he determines to be constitutional and talked about his 'posse,' a group of 150 armed community volunteers he relies on for tasks like hunting cougars and courtroom security and keeps at the ready, as a potential militia. He offered a copy of his posse plan to sheriffs in the audience.\nDuring the break, as CSPOA volunteer Kenneth Hall sang an original song, 'I Back the Sheriff,' to the music of the Bob Marley tune, I asked Mack why there weren't more sheriffs at his conference. Mack said that didn't matter.\n'There's several candidates,' Mack said, noting the political signs littering the room. He said he hoped to draw a 'new generation' of sheriffs, but, pointing to 78-year-old Songer, he added, 'there's one, and he's one of the best sheriffs in America!'\nIndeed, there are politicians — or would-bes — who see the constitutional sheriffs group as an important bloc of support. Twenty or so candidates for local office in the crowd from Nevada, Utah, Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Georgia and Idaho spent the morning shaking hands and passing out cards.\nIt's a model that has proven effective. Trump depended on support from sheriffs in the White House and continues to rely on them at campaign events, as he did in 2016 and 2020. At a presentation in Grand Rapids, Michigan, this month, a half-dozen uniformed sheriffs stood in the background decked out in gold stripes and braided ropes as Trump railed against immigration and stood before a sign that read 'Stop Biden's Border Bloodbath.'\nAfter lunch, former sheriff Glenn Hamilton, who lost his 2022 re-election bid in Sierra County, New Mexico, regaled the audience with the time he deputized an entire church congregation to permit a gathering in violation of the governor's Covid rules. Hamilton referred to 'this old tool that's in our box called Posse Comitatus. Who's ever heard of this?' he asked.\nThe Posse Comitatus movement in the 1970s and '80s held up the county sheriff as the only true law enforcement officer and urged vigilantism through local posse groups. Latin for 'power of the county,' Posse Comitatus was preached and popularized by white supremacist William Potter Gale, but it dissolved in the wake of a spate of violence and highly publicized prosecutions.\nThe CSPOA has recently sought to distance itself from that history, the kind of messaging that may have resonated with not only tea partiers but also anti-government groups and militias and caused national hate tracking groups and Mack's Republican political opponents to label him a far-right extremist.\nMack and CSPOA leaders have consistently decried the label, but their ties with extremist organizations are well-documented. Mack was a keynote speaker at the first national conference for the far-right Oath Keepers in 2009 and sat on the militia group's board until at least 2015. The CSPOA's current CEO since 2022, Sam Bushman, operates Liberty News Radio, which has syndicated programs hosted by white supremacists. Bushman has hosted Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes on his show, 'Liberty RoundTable,' over a dozen times, including after the attack on the Capitol, for which Rhodes is serving an 18-year sentence for seditious conspiracy.\nA frustrated and defiant Bushman said it was that kind of negative publicity that had most likely caused the conference's biggest speaker, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, to bail. Without notice, Bannon hadn't shown up, he said. Bannon didn't respond to a request for comment.\nWith Bannon out, the biggest star was Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser and retired three-star general who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI but was pardoned by Trump. After he promoted a new film about himself that would be released the next day, Flynn took photos with attendees near the stage. Seeing an NBC News photographer, Flynn demanded to know whom he worked for, and when he identified himself, Flynn became incensed and yelled, 'You're a liar!' The organizers then moved Flynn to a room walled off by curtains and two guards.\nThe CSPOA has always been considered a fringe movement, but the pandemic offered a boost. Constitutional sheriffs were suddenly a viable solution to what a growing slice of the GOP saw as tyrannical lockdown orders, mask requirements and vaccination mandates. Similar constitutional sheriffs organizations began to pop up, including Pinal County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Lamb's Protect America Now and a pro-Trump think tank, the Claremont Institute's Sheriffs Fellowship.\nThe 2020 election offered another opportunity. Pushing unfounded claims of a stolen election, the CSPOA collaborated with True the Vote, the Texas-based election conspiracy theorist group behind '2000 Mules,' a widely panned and debunked film that claimed to reveal widespread ballot drop-box fraud.\nMack called the film a 'smoking gun,' and at its 2022 conference, the CSPOA called upon its members to launch investigations. But results have been lackluster.\nThe most notable investigation came from Barry County, Michigan, Sheriff Dar Leaf, who partnered with a pro-Trump lawyer bent on overturning Michigan's election results. Leaf's investigation, which has involved seizing election equipment and grilling local clerks, has seemingly only impeded a criminal case against three Trump supporters indicted last year on state charges related to their alleged tampering with voting machines. Leaf hasn't been charged with a crime.\nOnstage, Leaf, bespectacled and boyish, was giddy. The investigation had faced setbacks, he acknowledged, but he believed there would soon be justice.\n'I'm getting goose-bumpy here,' Leaf said. Later, he told me he didn't pay any attention to the criticism from state election and law enforcement officials or from the media: 'I just keep my head down.'\nAs the day wore on at the conference, the rails began to wear.\nTina Peters, a former Mesa County, Colorado, clerk facing multiple criminal charges related to a suspected security breach of her county's election system in 2021, and fresh off a home confinement for obstructing government administration in a separate case, took the stage wearing a large white lei. She is fighting the latest charges, with a trial scheduled for this summer. She had recently been to Hawaii, she said, and she offered a slideshow of photographic evidence that she suggested proved the recent deadly wildfires were the result of an intentional laser attack.\nAs Mike Lindell, MyPillow's founder and a sponsor of the CSPOA event, spoke — election denial and his prowess with the media and in business were his main topics — a blond woman in a robin's egg suit jacket walked up behind me and handed me a note: 'I would like to give you some first hand info that will be helpful to you reaching a conclusion on election fraud in NV.' The note passer, Susan Proffitt, later told me that the room was full of operatives, 'and they are doing their best to destroy us.'\nPizza was put out on long tables under heat lamps. The audience, halved from the morning, milled about. A couple of women took off their high heels. Several small groups were forming around the bar. There was still an awards ceremony, and Mack and Bushman had planned a news conference, though by the time it started the members of the media had gone.\nAs I left, I checked in with a man who had been sitting in the back, watching attentively. Jeffrey Kadlowec, a local architect, hadn't heard of CSPOA before and wasn't sure what to expect. 'I thought it would be more about law enforcement,' he said excitedly. 'I didn't expect it to be so, so radical.'\nBrandy Zadrozny",

            "excerpt": "House Republican impeachment managers will walk the articles over to the Senate chamber Tuesday with what is expected to be a short-lived trial beginning on Wednesday.",
            "summary": "WASHINGTON — After a weeklong delay, the House of Representatives on Tuesday afternoon will send its articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to the Senate, a spokesperson for Speaker Mike Johnson confirmed.\nIt will kick off what's expected to be a very short trial in the upper chamber — one that could wrap up by week's end. However, Republicans, who are demanding a full Senate trial, are fighting to drag out the process in a bid to shine the spotlight on what they see as Mayorkas' failure to curtail migrant crossings and secure the southern border.\nAs was done for the two Donald Trump impeachments, the impeachment managers will escort a pair of articles from the House chamber, across the Rotunda and onto the Senate floor sometime after 2 p.m. ET.\nThe Senate will receive the articles, and all 100 senators will be sworn in as jurors in the trial on Wednesday afternoon. It is unclear exactly how long the trial will last, though Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has said the Senate will deal with the matter 'expeditiously.'\nIt's expected that Senate Democrats, who control the chamber, will band together and vote to dismiss or table the issue, then move on to other business, including the chamber's need to renew a critical spy tool before it expires Friday. None of the Senate's 51 Democrats have said they support the Mayorkas impeachment, and even a handful of GOP senators have said the impeachment is meritless.\n\"Impeachment should never be used to settle a policy disagreement; that would set a horrible precedent for the Congress,\" Schumer said in a floor speech Monday. \"Nevertheless, the Senate's plan has not changed since last week. We are ready to go whenever the House sends us the articles. We want to address this issue as expeditiously as possible.\"\nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican, had originally planned to send the Mayorkas articles to the Senate on April 10, but Senate conservatives, led by Mike Lee of Utah, successfully lobbied the speaker to postpone the action to prevent a speedy dismissal by Democrats at the end of the week as lawmakers were preparing to leave Washington.\nMayorkas, Biden's top border official and the first Latino to lead the Homeland Security Department, became only the second Cabinet secretary in history — and the first since 1876 — to be impeached by the House. Republicans' first attempt to impeach him collapsed spectacularly on the House floor, but they were successful on the second try, on Feb. 13, with just a single vote to spare; the tally was 214-213, with three Republicans joining all Democrats in voting no.\nIn their two articles, House Republicans charged Mayorkas with 'high crimes and misdemeanors' for failing to enforce immigration and border security laws, resulting, they said, in 'millions' of undocumented immigrants illegally crossing into the U.S. each year; and for knowingly lying under oath to Congress.\nMayorkas' Democratic allies have lambasted the GOP's impeachment as a politically motivated 'sham' launched months before the presidential election and argued that Republicans' criticism of the DHS secretary amounts to policy differences rather than impeachable offenses. Several conservatives have argued against impeaching Mayorkas as well, blasting the move as inappropriate. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., a Trump ally, called it 'the worst, dumbest exercise and use of time.'\nThe 11 House impeachment managers, the prosecutors appointed by Johnson, are a mix of senior Republicans and conservative hard-liners.\nThey are: Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green of Tennessee; the Homeland panel's vice chair, Michael Guest of Mississippi; Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul of Texas, who previously was Homeland chairman; Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York; Rep. August Pfluger of Texas; Rep. Laurel Lee of Florida; four conservative Freedom Caucus members: Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Clay Higgins of Louisiana, Ben Cline of Virginia and Harriet Hageman of Wyoming; and far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., one of Trump's top allies on the Hill who led the push to impeach Mayorkas.",
