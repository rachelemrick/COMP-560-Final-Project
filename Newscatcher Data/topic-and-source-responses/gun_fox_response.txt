Janet Mills and the Democratic-led Legislature pressed for a number of gun and mental health proposals after the shooting that claimed 18 lives and injured another 13 people, despite the state's strong hunting tradition and support for gun owners.\n\"Maine has taken significant steps forward in preventing gun violence and protecting Maine lives,\" said Nacole Palmer, executive director of the Maine Gun Safety Coalition, who praised lawmakers for listening to their constituents.\nThe governor's bill, approved early Thursday, would strengthen the state's yellow flag law, boost background checks for private sales of guns and make it a crime to recklessly sell a gun to someone who is prohibited from having guns. The bill also funds violence prevention initiatives and opens a mental health crisis receiving center in Lewiston.\nThe Maine Senate also narrowly gave final approval Wednesday to a 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases and a ban on bump stocks that can transform a weapon into a machine gun.\nHowever, there was no action on a proposal to institute a \"red flag\" law. The bill sponsored by House Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross would have allowed family members to petition a judge to remove guns from someone who is in a psychiatric crisis. The state's current \"yellow flag\" law differs by putting police in the lead of the process, which critics say is too complicated.\nLawmakers pushed through the night and into the morning as they ran up against their adjournment date, which was Wednesday. But it didn't come without some 11th-hour drama. Lawmakers had to approve a contentious supplemental budget before casting their final votes and didn't wrap up the session until after daybreak.\nThe Oct. 25 shooting by an Army reservist in Lewiston, Maine's second-largest city, served as tragic backdrop for the legislative session.\nPolice were warned by family members that the shooter was becoming delusional and had access to weapons. He was hospitalized for two weeks while training with his unit last summer. And his best friend, a fellow reservist, warned that the man was going \"to snap and do a mass shooting.\" The shooter killed himself after the attack.\nRepublicans accused Democrats of using the tragedy to play on people's emotions to pass contentious bills.\n\"My big concern here is that we're moving forward with gun legislation that has always been on the agenda. Now we're using the tragedy in Lewiston to force it through when there's nothing new here,\" said Republican Sen. Lisa Keim. \"It's the same old ideas that were rejected year after year. Using the tragedy to advance legislation is wrong.\"\nBut Democrats said constituents implored them to do something to prevent future attacks. They said it would've been an abdication of their responsibility to ignore their pleas.\n\"For the sake of the communities, individuals and families now suffering immeasurable pain, for the sake of our state, doing nothing is not an option,\" the governor said in late January when she outlined her proposals in her State of the State address. Those in attendance responded with a standing ovation.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Maine-State-House.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":9.030745,"_id":"50d60b0ff3da65dc5ddf618b004a12be"},{"title":"Sweeping gun control bills awaiting final passage as Maine legislative session nears its end","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-17 22:33:09","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sweeping-gun-control-bills-awaiting-final-passage-maine-legislative-session-nears-end","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The Maine Legislature is moving toward adjournment as several key proposals await final votes, including sweeping gun control measures introduced in response to the Lewiston shooting.","summary":"The Maine Legislature moved in fits and starts toward adjournment on Wednesday, with unfinished business including final votes on a series of gun safety bills that were introduced after the deadliest shooting in state history last fall.\nThe Senate was awaiting an enactment vote on the governor's gun safety proposals that would strengthen the state's yellow flag law, boost background checks for private sales of guns and make it a crime to recklessly sell a gun to a prohibited person.\nThe Senate narrowly gave final approval to a 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases and a ban on bump stocks that can transform a weapon into a machine gun.\nLooming in the background: Lawmakers had yet to vote on a red flag proposal sponsored by House Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross to allow family members to petition a judge to remove guns from someone who is in a psychiatric crisis.

Janet Mills, a Democrat.\nThe bicameral Legislature is made up of the Senate, with 22 Democrats and 13 Republicans, and the House, which has 80 Democratic members and 68 Republicans.\nDespite Democrats holding majorities, their effort is not immune to resistance as the state has a strong hunting tradition and vocal advocates for gun owner rights.\nOne bill that failed was a proposal to let gun violence victims sue weapon manufacturers.\nSo far, neither chamber has voted on a proposal for a red flag law.\nAnd, a separate measure sponsored by House Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross to fund a range of mental health and violence prevention initiatives does not yet have money in the final budget.\nThe Oct. 25, 2023 shooting that killed 18 people and injured 13 others in Lewiston prompted lawmakers to act. They specifically argued that constituents were demanding they do something that could prevent future attacks.\nOne initiative, the red flag proposal, would allow family members to petition a judge to remove guns from someone's home. The proposal differs from the state's current yellow flag law that puts law enforcement officers \u2014 not the individual's parents, siblings or children \u2014 in the lead of the process.\nThe initiative was proposed as police were warned by family members of the shooter, an Army reservist who took his own life after the deadly rampage.\nFamily members warned the eventual shooter was becoming paranoid and losing his grip on reality before the attack. He was hospitalized last summer while training with his Army Reserve unit.\nOn Sept. 15, his best friend, a fellow reservist, warned that the man was going \"to snap and do a mass shooting.\"\nSix weeks later, he carried out the deadliest shooting in Maine history.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Lawrence Richard","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1746139269.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":8.784298,"_id":"646224ab432840c08c0fafc3b9490a65"},{"title":"SCOTUS to take up challenge to Biden admin's ghost gun rule that group deems \u2018abusive'","author":"Brianna Herlihy","published_date":"2024-04-22 15:00:22","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/scotus-take-up-challenge-biden-admins-ghost-gun-rule-group-deems-abusive","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The Supreme Court announced Monday that it will hear a challenge to the Biden administration's regulation on so-called \"ghost guns\" this fall.","summary":"The Supreme Court announced Monday that it will hear a challenge to the Biden administration's regulation on so-called \"ghost guns\" next term.\nThe rule in question was issued in 2022 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to regulate \"buy build shoot\" kits that are available online or in stores that allow any individual to assemble a working firearm without a background check or the usual serial numbers required by the federal government.\nThe Fifth Circuit late last year struck down the rule, but the Justice Department appealed to the Supreme Court. The DOJ argued that the Gun Control Act of 1968 permits the rule because it defines a \"firearm\" to include \"any weapon\u2026which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive,\" as well as \"the frame or receiver of any such weapon.\"\nHowever, gun rights groups say that the rule is \"unconstitutional and abusive.\"\nFirearms Policy Coalition President Brandon Combs, who is challenging the rule in court, said the group is \"delighted that the Supreme Court will hear our case and decide this important issue once and for all.\"\n\"The Fifth Circuit's decision in our case was correct and now that victory can be applied to the entire country,\" he said.\nThe ATF's rule requires unfinished parts of a firearm, like the frame of a handgun or the receiver of a long gun, to be treated like a completed firearm. These parts need to be licensed and must have serial numbers.\nThe rule also requires manufacturers to run background checks before selling these parts, as they are required to do for whole commercial firearms. The Biden administration argued the rule is necessary to respond to rising numbers of untraceable guns.\nThe Justice Department had argued in court that local law enforcement agencies seized more than 19,000 ghost guns at crime scenes in 2021, a more than tenfold increase in just five years.\nThe Supreme Court had previously allowed the regulation to remain in effect while the lawsuit continued through the courts, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett voting with the three liberal members of the court to form the majority.\nJustices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas said they would have kept the regulation on hold while the case made its way through the appeals process.\nArguments in the case Garland v.

So will Nathan Hochhalter, whose sister Anne Marie was paralyzed after she was shot at Columbine. Several months after the shooting, their mother, Carla Hochhalter, took her own life.\nThe organizers of the vigil, which will also honor all those impacted by the shooting, include Colorado Ceasefire, Brady United Against Gun Violence and Colorado Faith Communities United Against Gun Violence, but they say it will not be a political event.\nTom Mauser, whose son Daniel, a sophomore who excelled in math and science, was killed at Columbine, decided to set up the vigil after learning school officials did not plan to organize a large community event as they did on the 20th anniversary. Mauser, who became a gun safety advocate after the shooting, said he realizes that it takes a lot of volunteers and money to put together that kind of event but he wanted to give people a chance to gather and mark the passage of 25 years since the shooting, a significant number people can relate to.\n\"For those who do want to reflect on it, it is something for them,\" said Mauser, who is on Colorado Ceasefire's board and asked the group to help organize the event at a church near the state Capitol in Denver. It had been scheduled to be held on the steps of the Capitol but was moved indoors because of expected rain.\nMauser successfully led the campaign to pass a ballot measure requiring background checks for all firearm buyers at gun shows in 2000 after Colorado's legislature failed to change the law. It was designed to close a loophole that helped a friend of the Columbine gunmen obtain three of the four firearms used in the attack.\nA proposal requiring such checks nationally, inspired by Columbine, failed in Congress in 1999 after passing the Senate but dying in the House, said Robert Spitzer, professor emeritus at the State University of New York-Cortland and author of several books on gun politics.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Al Gore ran on a gun safety agenda against Republican George W. Bush the following year, but after his stance was mistakenly seen as a major reason for his defeat, Democrats largely abandoned the issue for the following decade, Spitzer said. But gun safety became a more prominent political issue again after the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, he said.\nWithout much action nationally on guns, Democrat-led and Republican-controlled states have taken divergent approaches to responding to mass shootings.\nThose killed at Columbine included Dave Sanders, a teacher who was shot as he shepherded students to safety during the attack. He lay bleeding in a classroom for almost four hours before authorities reached him. The students killed included one who wanted to be a music executive like his father, a senior and captain of the girls' varsity volleyball team, and a teen who enjoyed driving off-road in his beat-up Chevy pickup.\nSam Cole, another Colorado Ceasefire board member, said he hopes people will come out to remember the victims and not let the memory of them fade. The students killed would now be adults in the prime of their lives with families of their own, he said.\n\"It's just sad to think that they are always going to be etched in our mind as teenagers,\" he said.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Columbine-Memorial.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":8.59259,"_id":"9bb60dc4e3711744dc7b2cb9300cf82e"},{"title":"Colorado House passes semiautomatic firearm ban that faces uphill battle in State Senate","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-15 11:31:52","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/colorado-house-passes-semiautomatic-firearm-ban-faces-uphill-battle-state-senate","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The Colorado Democratic-controlled House has passed a bill aiming to ban the sale and transfer of semiautomatic firearms after a similar bill was rejected last year.","summary":"Colorado's Democratic-controlled House on Sunday passed a bill that would ban the sale and transfer of semiautomatic firearms, a major step for the legislation after roughly the same bill was swiftly killed by Democrats last year.\nThe bill, which passed on a 35-27 vote, is now on its way to the Democratic-led state Senate. If it passes there, it could bring Colorado in line with 10 other states \u2014 including California, New York and Illinois \u2014 that have prohibitions on semiautomatic guns.\nBut even in a state plagued by some of the nation's worst mass shootings, such legislation faces headwinds.\nColorado's political history is purple, shifting blue only recently. The bill's chances of success in the state Senate are lower than they were in the House, where Democrats have a 46-19 majority and a bigger far-left flank. Gov. Jared Polis, also a Democrat, has indicated his wariness over such a ban.\nLast year, a similar bill died in committee, with some Democratic lawmakers citing concerns over the sweep of a ban and promises they made to their constituents to avoid government overreach affecting most gun owners' rights.\nDemocrats last year passed and Polis signed into law four less-expansive gun control bills. Those included raising the age for buying any gun from 18 to 21; establishing a three-day waiting period between the purchase and receipt of a gun; strengthening the state's red flag law; and rolling back some legal protections for the firearms industry, exposing it to lawsuits from the victims of gun violence.\nThose laws were signed months after five people were killed at an LGBTQ+ nightclub in Colorado Springs last year. Soon, the state will mark the 25th anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting that killed 13 people. Other mass shootings in Colorado include 12 people killed in 2012 at an Aurora movie theater and 10 people killed in 2021 at a Boulder supermarket.\n\"This is the state where the modern era of the mass shooting began with Columbine,\" Democratic Rep. Javier Mabrey said in urging fellow lawmakers to join other states that ban semiautomatic weapons.\nRepublicans decried the legislation as an onerous encroachment on the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment. They argued that mental illness and people who do not value life \u2014 not guns \u2014 are the issues that should be addressed. People with ill intent can use other weapons, such as knives, to harm others, they argued.\nDemocrats responded that semiautomatic weapons can cause much more damage in a short period of time.\n\"In Aurora, when the shooter walked in that theater and opened fire,\" Mabrey said, \"and in less than 90 seconds shot up a room full of people. That cannot be done with a knife, that can't be done with a knife.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Colorado-Capitol.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":8.502979,"_id":"fc314bada2c0e7ac53433b81fb604e7a"},{"title":"Justice Department intensifies efforts to combat violent crime with gun intel center, carjacking forces","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-18 13:48:02","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/justice-department-intensifies-efforts-combat-violent-crime-gun-intel-center-carjacking-forces","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The U.S. Justice Department is intensifying efforts to reduce violent crime across the country, with a focus on gun violence and carjackings, officials said.","summary":"The Justice Department is ramping up its efforts to reduce violent crime in the U.S., launching a specialized gun intelligence center in Chicago and expanding task forces to curb carjackings.\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said there is \"absolutely much more to do\" to make communities safer, even as many places have experienced a downward trend in crime after a coronavirus pandemic-era spike.\n\"No level of violence is acceptable,\" Monaco said during a trip to Chicago this week. \"We are seeing progress, but we're far from done. We have to double down on the strategies that work, by bringing federal resources to act as force multipliers.\"\nThe initiatives are part of a broad effort by President Joe Biden's administration to address violent crime \u2014 an issue the Democratic president has featured in his reelection campaign to reach young voters concerned about gun violence. Republicans have seized on violence in some American cities, including the nation's capital, to try to paint Democrats as weak on crime.\nLast week, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives announced it had finalized a new rule requiring thousands more firearms dealers to run background checks on buyers at gun shows or other places outside brick-and-mortar stores. Gun rights groups are expected to mount legal challenges.\nIn Chicago, the gun crime intelligence center at the city's ATF office brings together federal agents and state and local police as well as federal and local prosecutors to share and analyze firearm intelligence to better identify traffickers and the most prolific shooters, officials said.\nIt's modeled after dozens of similar centers run by the ATF across the country. The Chicago center will house 65 agents, officers, analysts and prosecutors.\n\"The goal is to catch more violent people, truly violent. And, second, to do a better job at seeing if we can prevent them from getting armed in the first place,\" ATF Director Steve Dettelbach said in an interview. \"The first days and hours after an incident are crucial to the investigation, and being able to have everybody together, looking at that data every single day and making decisions, is a real game changer.\"\nChicago is one of the nation's gun violence hotspots, even as police data shows shootings and killings declined there last year. The announcement comes days after a young girl was killed and 10 other people were wounded in a shooting police believe was gang-related on the city's South Side.\n\"Every innocent life lost to gun violence is one too many,\" Monaco said. \"And every shooter evading justice is one too many.\"\nRecently released FBI data based on numbers sent from about 80% of U.S. law enforcement agencies shows murders overall dropped 13% and violent crime overall was down 6% in the last three months of 2023 compared with the same period the year before. Final detailed data for 2023 is expected to be released in the fall.\nAmid a scourge of carjackings nationwide, the Justice Department has also created new task forces to combat the issue in seven more U.S. attorney's offices, including the Eastern District of Texas, the Northern District of Alabama and the Northern District of California. The task forces, which are now in 11 offices, include federal prosecutors, ATF and FBI agents and state and local law enforcement.\nThe goal is to get federal officials involved at the beginning of carjacking investigations \u2014 even if the cases ended up being prosecuted locally \u2014 to help with duties like tracing firearms, performing forensics analyses or getting search warrants and subpoenas.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/FBI-Building.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":8.44271,"_id":"3102052edaee9fd3d16792eb1bd03d3b"},{"title":"Slain Chicago police officer had gun, car stolen during attack: reports","author":"Bradford Betz","published_date":"2024-04-22 22:44:00","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/slain-chicago-police-officer-had-gun-car-stolen-during-attack-reports","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The Chicago police officer who was shot and killed early while driving home from work had his gun and car stolen during the attack, according to local reports.","summary":"The Chicago police officer who was shot and killed early Sunday morning while driving home from work had his gun and car stolen during the attack, according to local reports.\nOfficer Luis Huesca, 30, was killed outside his home in Gage Park.

He spent time on Discord chats with others who glorified school shootings, authorities said.\n\"He clearly had mental health issues, and I think it would be worth our while to figure out when could we have known, or when should we have possibly intervened,\" Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich said. \"We may have intervened at the right time, but at a very late time in the process. Hopefully this will lead us to look deeper into what we do for mental health support.\"\nYe, a former student at Wootton High School, allegedly also targeted an elementary school for a potential shooting. Ye was hospitalized in December 2022 after threatening to \"shoot up a school,\" and the following month clinicians reported that the teen was talking about \"suicide by cop.\"\nAuthorities first learned of Ye when the manifesto was shared by someone who knew Ye at a psychiatric facility with Baltimore County police in March. The tipster is referred to as \"Witness-One\" in charging documents. Ye claimed the manifesto was a fictional account of a school shooting.\nThe tipster told investigators that they noticed similarities between the story's transgender main character and Ye, the documents state. His internet search history revealed search terms like \"gun ranges near me\" and searches about school shootings, including the massacres at Sandy Hook, Connecticut and Parkland, Florida.\nDuring a search of the family home, a gun belonging to Ye's father was found but Ye didn't appear to have access to the weapon, Jones said.\n\"This could well be a case where the difficulty to get guns prevented him from getting a gun when he wanted it, and possibly prevented him from acting as soon as he would have preferred to act,\" Elrich said, referring to Maryland's strict gun laws.\nYe was formally enrolled at Wootton High School but had not physically attended a Montgomery County Public Schools institution since the fall of 2022, Fox DC reported. He has been taking lessons through the virtual program Online Pathways to Graduation.\nYe has been charged with making threats of mass violence and is currently being held at the Montgomery County Central Processing Unit and was awaiting a bond hearing.\nAuthorities said security has been increased at schools across Montgomery County, particularly Wootton High School.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Louis Casiano","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Andrea-Ye.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.986756,"_id":"4f847ba6bb2a0f870b375be3b44022bc"},{"title":"Maine gun store hires 'udderly' adorable employee, a baby cow","author":"Christine Rousselle","published_date":"2024-04-19 10:35:52","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/maine-gun-store-hires-adorable-employee-baby-cow","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"A&G Shooting in Fairfield, Maine has a new employee who has caused quite a stir: His name is Kade, and he is a baby miniature zebu calf.

The bizarre shooting was the culmination of an \"incredibly tense\" custody battle with \"\u200b\u200ba lot of venom going back and forth,\" Rasmussen said.\n\"All of a sudden there's this horrible noise and I couldn't even identify it. It was like a bomb,\" Rasmussen said, recalling the moment the shooter, who was seated right next to her, began his violent rampage.\n\"It was sort of echoing in my head\u2026 I had no idea what it was. I turned to my right to kind of look at Joe, maybe, and say, \u2018What\u2026 what the hell was that?' And I just see, right next to me, a barrel and a sleeve,\" Rasmussen said. \"I don't even remember seeing the hand. It's so weird. I just saw the barrel of a gun.\"\n\"I just see, right next to me, a barrel and a sleeve,\" Rasmussen said. \"I don't even remember seeing the hand. It's so weird. I just saw the barrel of a gun.\"\nRasmussen said it took her brain a minute to comprehend what was happening.\n\"I recall Joe standing up and pointing across the table with the barrel \u2013 the gun. And by that time, and at that moment, I was really clear on what was happening. I'm like, \u2018okay, that was a gunshot. That's a gun. He's pointing it,'\" Rasmussen said. \"I wasn't going to stand around. I peeled back to my left \u2013 jumped up.\"\nRasmussen fled the conference room for her life along with her client, an 8-months-pregnant associate and a court reporter. She searched desperately for safety as shots continued to ring out in the conference room.\nWhen the violence stopped, the gravity of the tragedy became apparent. Joe Houston, 77, had murdered Dennis Prince, 57, and his wife Ashley Prince, 30, Rasmussen said. The Princes were locked in a contentious custody battle with Dylan Houston, Ashley's ex-husband and Joe Houston's son.\nRasmussen was representing Joe Houston's wife, Kelly, at the time. The group had gathered at Prince Law Group that fateful morning so Kelly could be deposed in the case.\n\"People ask me if I think Joe came with a plan to do this, and I say no,\" Rasmussen said. \"I just really think it just unfolded in a moment of rage, whatever. And we're never going to know, right? Because Joe took his own life. We're never going to know what happened.\"\nRasmussen said Joe Houston displayed no warning signs that morning. She described him as \"jovial.\"\n\"I was aware that he had a cancer diagnosis, but he did not seem just so, you know, terminally ill,\" she said. \"He was able-bodied, and he had a full head of hair, and he was jovial. He didn't seem sick or even like he didn't feel well. He didn't look pale. He didn't. So he may have had a diagnosis that was problematic. I, of course, have no idea what was going through his mind.\"\nShe walked with Joe Houston and his wife up to the conference room where they met several other associates to begin the deposition.\nDennis Prince entered the conference room with his wife, not knowing it would be the last few moments of their lives. Rasmussen said Dennis skipped the usual pleasantries.\n\"It was immediately odd because there was no prelude. There was no \u2018good morning. Does anyone want water? The bathrooms are in the hall,'\" she said. \"He just looked at the court reporter and said, \u2018please swear in the witness,' which isn't, you know, the best way to put the witness at ease.\"\nBefore the questioning began, Rasmussen said, Joe asked Dennis if there was any way they were ever going to be able to resolve any of the issues for the sake of children.\n\"And Dennis didn't respond. There was no response to that. He just turned to Kelly and started asking her the deposition questions. And not even, like, normally in a depo, there's some prelude, you know, please wait until I finish my question until you start your answer. There was none of that,\" Rasmussen said. \"He just started asking her the substantive questions, which was, you know, probably not the way most people would do it.\"\nRasmussen said they only got through three questions before Joe Houston pulled out the gun.\n\"I didn't see anyone get shot,\" she said. \"It's weird because in the process of, like, looking to my left, watching her answer the question, hearing the noise, kind of going to my right, seeing the barrel, seeing him stand up, going back to my left. My whole memory of across the table is nothing. And I don't know if my mind's blocking it out or if they ducked. I just remember seeing nothing across the table.\"\n\"My whole memory of across the table is nothing. And I don't know if my mind's blocking it out or if they ducked. I just remember seeing nothing across the table,\" Rasmussen said.\nRasmussen told Fox News Digital she is in therapy and thankful for all of the support she has received following the tragedy. She has already returned to work.\n\"Whether I'm ready to do another deposition is another question, but so far, I'm doing fine,\" she said. \"And I have really been blessed with the support I've received from my community, from other lawyers, from judges. Everyone has been very kind.\"\nLooking ahead, Rasmussen hopes some good can come from the unthinkable tragedy. She hopes to one day share her story with other lawyers to help bring more \"respect and civility\" back to the profession.\n\"I hope one day, when I feel a little bit healed from this, to be able to perhaps talk to other lawyers \u2013 to participate in some continuing legal education \u2013 to reiterate the importance of civility,\" Rasmussen explained. \"I hope to be a part of the conversation going forward in the future about how much civility matters. It just matters\u2026 lawyering should not be a gladiator sport.\"\nDennis Prince leaves behind four children.

The worker must also not be prohibited from purchasing, possessing, and carrying a handgun under the laws of Tennessee or federal law as determined by a background check.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Bradford Betz","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Teacher-Gun.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":7.414342,"_id":"287b5defcf7bd9ddca6a1621e94ba2df"},{"title":"'The Worst Day Of My Life': 25 Years Since Columbine, A Survivor Remembers","author":"If\ufffd Dancy","published_date":"2024-04-17 11:00:32","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://radio.foxnews.com/2024/04/17/the-worst-day-of-my-life-25-years-since-columbine-a-survivor-remembers","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"On April 20, 1999, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold gunned down twelve students and one teacher--at that time, this was the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history.

Prosecutors alleged he was \"planning a mass casualty event.\"\nBut Rice County Judge Christine Long this week dismissed two of the felony counts against Kurts, citing a lack of evidence that he was conspiring with anyone to commit assault or threats of violence, KARE-TV reported.\nKurts, who has pleaded not guilty and is free on bail, has maintained that he is a recreational firearms enthusiast and was just exchanging text messages on that topic with a like-minded friend.\n\"Both individuals spent a significant amount of time discussing firearms, firearm builds, and performance of certain builds, as well as purchasing parts for firearms,\" Long wrote in her order Wednesday. \"However, there is no evidence that either party communicated with the other regarding threats or plans to engage in either threats of violence or second-degree assault.\"\nKurts was arrested after a custodian found two empty packages for gun magazines outside Kurts' dorm room.

But no guns or ammunition were ever found.\nLong ruled that there is sufficient evidence to proceed to trial on the terroristic threats charge, and on a misdemeanor conspiracy to commit theft charge stemming from notebook writings about stealing ammunition from Walmart, but further proceedings have not been scheduled.\nThe basis for the surviving terroristic threats charge is the prosecution argument that by leaving the two empty high-capacity magazine boxes in the trash where they could be seen by college staff and students, and that by stockpiling tactical gear and firearm parts at the school, Kurts made an indirect threat in reckless disregard of causing terror.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/ALL_CUSTOM_FS_LOCAL_NEWS_MN_CRIME.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.9888754,"_id":"707515931a5b6a805320bae556da2b97"},{"title":"Border Patrol busts illegal Mexican immigrant child sex offender they say carried guns in schools","author":"Adam Shaw","published_date":"2024-04-16 10:00:48","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/border-patrol-bust-mexican-illegal-immigrant-child-sex-offender-said-to-wield-guns-in-schools","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"California Border Patrol agents this week stopped an illegal immigrant child sex offender, who was said to have carried weapons in schools.","summary":"Border Patrol agents in California this week busted an illegal immigrant child sex offender in California who officials said had previously carried guns in schools \u2013 the latest example of dangerous criminals entering the U.S. illegally.\nThe unnamed Mexican man's arrest was announced by El Centro Sector Chief Patrol Agent Gregory Bovino.\nBovino said in a statement that the man was arrested in the U.S. illegally and had a \"troubling history.\"\n\"He's a convicted sex offender against children & has been known to carry firearms in public schools,\" he said.\nHe added that the community of Fresno in California \"no longer has to worry about this threat.\"\nSo far, there have been over 8,700 arrests of criminal noncitizens this fiscal year, compared to more than 15,000 in fiscal 2023 and more than 12,000 in fiscal 2022.

Hannah Gutierrez Reed was sentenced Monday.","summary":"Hannah Gutierrez Reed's maximum sentence is \"bad news\" for Alec Baldwin, who heads to court in July for the same charge of involuntary manslaughter in connection to the \"Rust\" movie set fatal shooting.\nThe \"Rust\" armorer was sentenced to 18 months behind bars after a judge slammed her for not taking responsibility for her actions that a jury found led to the death of the movie's cinematographer. Halyna Hutchins died Oct. 21, 2021, after a gun that Baldwin was holding discharged.\nThe actor will appear in a New Mexico courtroom on July 9 for his own trial. Baldwin was a producer for the film as well as the lead actor. Gutierrez Reed's sentencing is an ominous sign of what's to come for the \"30 Rock\" star, legal experts told Fox News Digital.\n\"This is bad news for Alec Baldwin and shows the court is taking this fatal shooting seriously and that it's not just for show, as his defenders claim,\" Los Angeles personal injury attorney Miguel Custodio, co-founder of Custodio and Dubey LLP, told Fox News Digital. \"A plea deal would be the best strategy for him right now, considering [Monday's] sentencing and the information the prosecution has about the chaos on the set and Baldwin's failure to do anything about it. But I don't see that happening.\"\n\"Baldwin may think that he will have an easier time if he believes that his team can convince a jury to see that the only culpable party has already been convicted. That's a risky proposition, given Baldwin's role as a producer actually involves him in all aspects of the production. Potential jurors will clearly know what went on with Gutierrez Reed and will really scrutinize Baldwin's lack of responsibility for the chaos on the set.\"\nA jury will likely hear the prosecution claim that Baldwin did oversee \"chaos\" on the \"Rust\" set and knew Gutierrez Reed was \"overwhelmed with her duties but chose not to do anything about it,\" according to Custodio.\n\"And remember, Alec Baldwin will be in the same court, with the same judge, in the same community, with prosecutors presenting many of the same facts. And he's facing the same sentence: 18 months imprisonment.\"\nJudge Mary Marlowe Sommer \"laid out\" her thinking \"exactly\" while sentencing Gutierrez Reed, criminal defense attorney Mark Geragos said during an appearance on the Fox News Channel.\n\"It's tough. I don't think that there was, by definition, any intent, but the law will still hold you responsible,\" he said. \"The judge kind of laid out exactly her thinking. I will tell you, if you're defending Alec Baldwin, this is going to give you grave, grave concern going into that trial.\"\n\"I expect he's got a tough road here because [Gutierrez Reed's] trial was filled with trying to shift blame to him.\"\nGeragos said the upcoming trial will be a \"heavy lift\" for Baldwin: \"You've got somebody who's already been sentenced to 18 months \u2026 and now he's got to go in there. He's the person giving the orders. He's the one who was handling the gun.\"\nHowever, Gutierrez Reed's behavior after her conviction seemingly played into the judge's decision. During the April 15 hearing, the prosecution and Sommer both mentioned statements the armorer made in jailhouse phone calls, including bad-mouthing the jurors and complaining about the trial ruining her \"modeling career.\"\n\"I find that what you did constitutes a serious, violent offense,\" Sommer told Gutierrez Reed. \"It was committed in a physically violent manner; a fatal gunshot done with your recklessness in the face of knowledge that your acts were reasonably likely to result in serious harm.\"\n\"You were the armorer, the one that's to be between a safe weapon and a weapon that could kill someone. You alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon. But for you, Mrs. Hutchins would be alive, a husband would have his partner and a little boy would have his mother.\"\nGutierrez Reed \"should have expected\" to receive the maximum sentence after this behavior, former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Fox News Digital.\n\"I don't think Gutierrez Reed's sentence will affect Baldwin,\" he explained. \"She was stupid enough to call the jurors \u2018idiots' and \u2018a--holes' and to say the judge was \u2018paid off' in recorded jail calls. She should have expected to receive the maximum sentence after that.\"\n\"Baldwin is too polished and sophisticated to make those same mistakes,\" said Rahmani, the founder of West Coast Trial Lawyers. \"And his lawyers are too good to allow that to happen. Even if Baldwin is convicted, I expect him to get less time.\"\nWATCH: ALEC BALDWIN'S FIRST WORDS TO DETECTIVES REVEALED AS POLICE RELEASE TROVE OF 'RUST' FILES\nGutierrez Reed's maximum sentence showed she's \"bearing the brunt\" of the negligence that led to the death of Hutchins at Bonanza Creek Ranch, but that doesn't mean that Baldwin as a producer is off the hook, Heidi Reavis, managing partner at Reavis Page Jump LLP, told Fox News Digital.\n\"Many people will believe she is the scapegoat and Alec Baldwin will get off easy. However, the severity of the sentence indicates no sympathy for those responsible,\" Reavis said. \"What I find very interesting is the evidence that came out during Reed's trial shows her many efforts to slow down the production, enhance security and have more training for those handling firearms. She was denied.\"\n\"So, the producers aren't out of the desert just yet,\" she added. \"Then again, New Mexico profits from extending production benefits and won't want to discourage producers from filming there. So, as usual, it's political.\"\nWATCH: ALEC BALDWIN DODGES QUESTIONS ABOUT INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER TRIAL\nBaldwin was indicted on two counts \u2013 involuntary manslaughter, negligent use of a firearm, or, in the alternative, involuntary manslaughter without due caution or circumspection \u2013 on Jan. 19.\nBaldwin has maintained that he did not pull the trigger of the gun that led to Hutchins' death. At the time, he had been rehearsing a scene featuring a cross-draw that Hutchins wanted to possibly add to the script.\n\"The trigger wasn't pulled. I didn't pull the trigger,\" Baldwin told George Stephanopoulos in an interview shortly after the fatal shooting.\n\"No, no, no, no, I would never point a gun at anyone and pull the trigger.

She also did not make any threats towards Brock, nor any demands other than to ask for the package the Uber app sent her to pick up.\nAfter Hall arrived at Brock's home, he pulled out a gun and pointed it at her, demanding the identities of the people she spoke to over the phone.\nVideo of the incident captured from a dash camera showed Hall walking toward the home, followed by Brock pointing a gun at her. The two walk out of frame before Hall is heard saying, \"Stop. Stop, or I'll call 911.\"\nA gunshot immediately gets fired and Brock says, \"Nope. You're not leaving,\" and demanding her to give him the phone.\nHall can be heard horrifically screaming for help when five more shots are fired off, followed by Brock, again, telling her to give him her phone.\nHall continued to scream, and the dash footage captured Brock saying he would shoot her in the head.\n\"Don't do that. Please don't,\" Hall said.\nHall was shot as she attempted to get in her car and leave, while Brock was injured during a scuffle between the two at the car door. He allegedly shot Hall two more times.\nThe sheriff's office did not respond to inquiries from Fox News Digital about the incident.\nUber told Fox News Digital they have spoken with Hall's family and are keeping them in their thoughts.\nThe company also said the account for the person who ordered the Uber service has been banned.\n\"This is a horrific tragedy, and our hearts continue to be with Loletha's loved ones as they grieve,\" an Uber spokesperson said. \"We have been in contact with law enforcement and remain committed to supporting their investigation.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Greg Wehner","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Brock-Split.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":6.4783926,"_id":"7ca8605cb477e28013dd42a704645ba3"},{"title":"Former UNM football player convicted of robbing postal carrier","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-15 21:34:40","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/former-unm-football-player-convicted-robbing-postal-carrier","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Rayshawn Boyce, a 28-year-old former college football player from Albuquerque, faces up to 10 years in prison for robbing a U.S. postal carrier.","summary":"A former University of New Mexico football player has been convicted of robbing a U.S. postal carrier and is facing up to 10 years in prison, authorities said Monday.\nProsecutors said 28-year-old Rayshawn Boyce, of Albuquerque, also was found guilty by a federal jury of stealing a key belonging to the U.S. Postal Service and being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm.\nA sentencing date for Boyce hasn't been scheduled yet.\nBoyce and a co-defendant pulled a mail carrier out of his truck in January 2022 in the International District and demanded his keys at gunpoint before a neighbor who witnessed the altercation intervened, prosecutors said.\nBoyce fled the scene and authorities said they later executed a search warrant at his apartment and seized two semi-automatic guns and a revolver, leading to his arrest.\nBoyce pleaded not guilty.

A jewelry store owner is also charged.\n\"This story is a sensational one and which probably, we jokingly say, belongs in a Netflix series,\" Peel Regional Chief Nishan Duraiappah said.\nPeel Reginal Detective Sgt. Mike Mavity said the gold bars, weighing 419 kilograms (923 pounds), and foreign currency, ordered from a refinery in Zurich, Switzerland, were transported in the haul of a Air Canada flight on April 17 last year.\nHe said that late afternoon a truck driver arrived at the airline's cargo warehouse with a fraudulent bill that was provided to a airline warehouse attendant.\nMavity said a bill for seafood that was picked up the day before was used to pick up the gold.

Tony Anthony Mason Jr., was shot to death while sitting in a parked car with a woman he had been dating, according to police. She was also shot but survived.\nThe case sat unsolved for five years until detectives received a tip in early 2023 that reinvigorated their investigation and led to charges against Dion Thompson, 24, prosecutors said in a news release Wednesday. Thompson, who was 18 at the time of the shooting, is currently serving time in a federal prison on unrelated drug and gun charges.\nAn attorney representing Thompson in that case didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday afternoon.\nHis charging documents in the 2017 shooting don't include a clear statement of motive and they're based almost entirely on the account of someone who knew Thompson but didn't directly witness the crime. The person said Thompson admitted to shooting up a parked car because as he was leaving his friend's grandmother's house, he spotted a vehicle whose occupants he didn't recognize and became paranoid, assuming they \"were there to either rob him or retaliate against him for all the robberies he was committing,\" according to the charging documents.\nThompson learned later from watching the news that the victim was an off-duty police officer, the witness told detectives. Thompson then drove to Philadelphia to get rid of the vehicle he was driving the night of the shooting, prosecutors allege.\nThe charging documents reference two other people who were allegedly involved in the shooting. One later died in a car crash. Officials said no one else has yet been charged in the case.\nMason, 40, was a 17-year veteran of Washington's Metropolitan Police Department.\nDetectives noted that he was unarmed during the attack and wasn't wearing any clothing to identify himself as a law enforcement officer. They said extensive background checks for both Mason and his companion turned up no signs of criminal or gang activity.\n\"For far too long, the details surrounding Sergeant Mason's tragic death have remained a painful mystery,\" said Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith. \"While we cannot erase the pain of loss or the memories of that day, we can take solace in the fact that the person responsible is being brought to justice.\"\nBaltimore State's Attorney Ivan Bates said this will be the first prosecution brought by his office's new cold case unit.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-96263851.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":5.4873424,"_id":"df70da07d2d5d84356b3a50316634b6f"},{"title":"Alec Baldwin 'Rust' shooting: Prosecution beefs up ahead of involuntary manslaughter trial","author":"Lauryn Overhultz","published_date":"2024-04-18 20:29:51","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/alec-baldwin-rust-shooting-prosecution-beefs-up-ahead-involuntary-manslaughter-trial","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"New Mexico attorney Erlinda Johnson joined special prosecutor Kari Morrissey in Alec Baldwin's involuntary manslaughter case.

In 2022, he sued three former colleagues \u2014 Randy Hays, Dustin Boone and Christopher Myers \u2014 for their roles in the attack.\nHays never responded to the lawsuit despite being served while he was in prison on a civil rights violation, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. A judge issued a default judgment in favor of Hall in February and heard testimony Monday about why Hall should receive damages.\nHall's claims against Boone and Myers are still pending.\nHall, in court on Monday, talked about the severe physical and emotional damages that followed the beating. He suffered several herniated discs and a jaw injury that left him unable to eat. He developed gallstones with complications, requiring surgeries.\n\"Mr. Hall had to endure this severe beating and while that was happening, he knew it was being administered by his colleagues who were sworn to serve and protect,\" Circuit Judge Joseph Whyte said.\nHays was not at the hearing. He was sentenced to more than four years in prison in 2021 and is in the custody of the St. Louis Residential Reentry Management Office, which supervises people who have been released from prison and are serving time on home confinement or in halfway houses. He has one year to contest the judgment.\nThe attack happened on Sept. 17, 2017, days after Stockley was acquitted in the fatal shooting of 24-year-old Anthony Lamar Smith on Dec. 20, 2011. Hall was walking back toward police headquarters when his uniformed colleagues ordered him to put up his hands and get on the ground, then beat him.\nHays, Boone, Myers and another officer, Bailey Colletta, were indicted in 2018 in connection with Hall's injuries. A fifth officer, Steven Korte, was indicted on a civil rights charge and another count of lying to the FBI.\nBoone was convicted of a civil rights charge and sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison. Meyers received probation after pleading guilty to a single felony charge. Colletta received probation for lying to the FBI and a grand jury about the attack. Korte was acquitted.\nIn addition to the settlement with Hall, the city of St. Louis last year paid nearly $5.2 million over allegations that police violated the rights of dozens of people by capturing them in a police \"kettle\" and arresting them.

We are so appreciative of the sacrifices he and his family made as the result of his work,\" said Julie Pace, senior vice president and executive editor of the AP.\n\"He never liked to be called a hero, but that's what everyone persisted in calling him,\" said Sulome Anderson. \"I saw him a week ago and my partner asked him if he had anything on his bucket list, anything that he wanted to do. He said, \u2018I've lived so much and I've done so much. I'm content.'\"\nAfter returning to the United States in 1991, Anderson led a peripatetic life, giving public speeches, teaching journalism at several prominent universities and, at various times, operating a blues bar, Cajun restaurant, horse ranch and gourmet restaurant.\nHe also struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder, won millions of dollars in frozen Iranian assets after a federal court concluded that country played a role in his capture, then lost most of it to bad investments. He filed for bankruptcy in 2009.\nUpon retiring from the University of Florida in 2015, Anderson settled on a small horse farm in a quiet, rural section of northern Virginia he had discovered while camping with friends.\n\"I live in the country and it's reasonably good weather and quiet out here and a nice place, so I'm doing all right,\" he said with a chuckle during a 2018 interview with The Associated Press.\nIn 1985, Anderson became one of several Westerners abducted by members of the Shiite Muslim group Hezbollah during a time of war that had plunged Lebanon into chaos.\nAfter his release, he returned to a hero's welcome at AP's New York headquarters.\nLou Boccardi, the company's president at the time, said in a memo to staff on Dec. 4, 1991: \"At long, long last the empty chair at AP's table is once again occupied. Terry Anderson has been set free.\"\nBoccardi said Anderson's plight was never far from his colleagues' minds during his ordeal. \"Rejoice with me that Terry's nightmare is over,\" he wrote.\nAs the AP's chief Middle East correspondent, Anderson had been reporting for several years on the rising violence gripping Lebanon as the country fought a war with Israel, while Iran funded militant groups trying to topple its government.\nOn March 16, 1985, a day off, he had taken a break to play tennis with former AP photographer Don Mell and was dropping Mell off at his home when gun-toting kidnappers dragged him from his car.\nHe was likely targeted, he said, because he was one of the few Westerners still in Lebanon and because his role as a journalist aroused suspicion among members of Hezbollah.\n\"Because in their terms, people who go around asking questions in awkward and dangerous places have to be spies,\" he told the Virginia newspaper The Review of Orange County in 2018.\nWhat followed was nearly seven years of brutality during which he was beaten, chained to a wall, threatened with death, often had guns held to his head and was kept in solitary confinement for long periods of time.\nAnderson was the longest held of several Western hostages Hezbollah abducted over the years, including Terry Waite, the former envoy to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who had arrived to try to negotiate Anderson's release.\nBy Anderson's and other hostages' accounts, he was also their most hostile prisoner, constantly demanding better food and treatment, arguing religion and politics with his captors, and teaching other hostages sign language and where to hide messages so they could communicate privately.\nHe managed to retain a quick wit and biting sense of humor during his long ordeal. On his last day in Beirut he called the leader of his kidnappers into his room to tell him he'd just heard an erroneous radio report saying he'd been freed and was in Syria.\n\"I said, \u2018Mahmound, listen to this, I'm not here. I'm gone, babes. I'm on my way to Damascus.' And we both laughed,\" he told Giovanna Dell'Orto, author of \"AP Foreign Correspondents in Action: World War II to the Present.\"\nHe learned later his release was delayed when a third party who his kidnappers planned to turn him over to left for a tryst with the party's mistress and they had to find someone else.\nMell, who was in the car during the abduction, said Sunday that he and Anderson shared an uncommon bond.\n\"Our relationship was much broader and deeper, and more important and meaningful, than just that one incident,\" Mell said.\nMell credited Anderson with launching his career in journalism, pushing for the young photographer to be hired by the AP full-time. After Anderson was released, their friendship deepened. They were each the best man at each other's wedding and were in frequent contact.\nAnderson's humor often hid the PTSD he acknowledged suffering for years afterward.\n\"The AP got a couple of British experts in hostage decompression, clinical psychiatrists, to counsel my wife and myself and they were very useful,\" he said in 2018. \"But one of the problems I had was I did not recognize sufficiently the damage that had been done.\n\"So, when people ask me, you know, \u2018Are you over it?' Well, I don't know. No, not really. It's there. I don't think about it much these days, it's not central to my life. But it's there,\" he said.\nAnderson said his faith as a Christian helped him let go of the anger. And something his wife later told him also helped him to move on: \"If you keep the hatred you can't have the joy.\"\nAt the time of his abduction, Anderson was engaged to be married and his future wife was six months pregnant with their daughter, Sulome.\nThe couple married soon after his release but divorced a few years later, and although they remained on friendly terms Anderson and his daughter were estranged for years.\n\"I love my dad very much. My dad has always loved me. I just didn't know that because he wasn't able to show it to me,\" Sulome Anderson told the AP in 2017.\nFather and daughter reconciled after the publication of her critically acclaimed 2017 book, \"The Hostage's Daughter,\" in which she told of traveling to Lebanon to confront and eventually forgive one of her father's kidnappers.\n\"I think she did some extraordinary things, went on a very difficult personal journey, but also accomplished a pretty important piece of journalism doing it,\" Anderson said. \"She's now a better journalist than I ever was.\"\nTerry Alan Anderson was born Oct. 27, 1947. He spent his early childhood years in the small Lake Erie town of Vermilion, Ohio, where his father was a police officer.\nAfter graduating from high school, he turned down a scholarship to the University of Michigan in favor of enlisting in the Marines, where he rose to the rank of staff sergeant while seeing combat during the Vietnam War.\nAfter returning home, he enrolled at Iowa State University where he graduated with a double major in journalism and political science and soon after went to work for the AP. He reported from Kentucky, Japan and South Africa before arriving in Lebanon in 1982, just as the country was descending into chaos.\n\"Actually, it was the most fascinating job I've ever had in my life,\" he told The Review. \"It was intense. War's going on \u2014 it was very dangerous in Beirut. Vicious civil war, and I lasted about three years before I got kidnapped.\"\nAnderson was married and divorced three times. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by another daughter, Gabrielle Anderson, from his first marriage; a sister, Judy Anderson; and a brother, Jack Anderson.\n\"Though my father's life was marked by extreme suffering during his time as a hostage in captivity, he found a quiet, comfortable peace in recent years. I know he would choose to be remembered not by his very worst experience, but through his humanitarian work with the Vietnam Children's Fund, the Committee to Protect Journalists, homeless veterans and many other incredible causes,\" Sulome Anderson said in a statement Sunday.\nMemorial arrangements were pending, she said.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Fox News Staff","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/AP24112808147828.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.882533,"_id":"095355030ba2e4d1b00018bd8cd7d236"},{"title":"Fetterman endorses Romney taking over Harvard to reform antisemitism: 'Recalibrate from far-left orthodoxy'","author":"Brian Flood","published_date":"2024-04-22 20:08:03","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/fetterman-endorses-romney-taking-over-harvard-reform-antisemitism-recalibrate-far-left-orthodoxy","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Harvard University is a \"mess\" and Sen.

But to my dismay, recent years have seen an unconscionable spike in \u2014 and even worse, an administrative tolerance of \u2014 hate speech directed at Jews, including targeting Jewish students. The university's response has thus far been ramshackle and unproductive, to put it mildly,\" Rosen wrote.\nRosen reminded readers of \"the disastrous congressional testimony of then-President Claudine Gay,\" in which she famously failed to say that calls for intifada or the genocide of Jews on campus violated Harvard's code of conduct or policy against bullying and harassment.\nAfter her congressional testimony, Gay issued an apology and the university's board initially decided to stick by her despite widespread calls from donors and members of Congress for her ouster. However, she stepped down shortly afterward after being hit with significant plagiarism allegations.\n\"The university president must be the flag-bearer of our values. There is no doubt that there are other Americans of similar standing and stature, but Romney's unique bridge-building character is precisely what Harvard needs in an age of toxic polarization,\" Rosen wrote, praising him for working with Democrats on issues like \"gun safety reform\" and voting to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.\nRomney, who has stood out among Senate Republicans with his opposition to former President Trump, has said he will not seek re-election in the Senate in 2024. He voted to convict Trump in both his impeachment trials, the only Republican to do so, and has not supported him in any of his White House bids.\nBuoyed in part by his successful overseeing of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Romney served one term as Massachusetts governor from 2003 to 2007. He later made a failed bid for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination. He won the Republican nomination in 2012 \u2013 the last candidate other than Trump to do so \u2013 and lost the general election to President Obama.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brian Flood","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/FETTERMAN-ROMNEY-SPLIT.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.878034,"_id":"62e2720981ae67e33714bc38cb9caca9"},{"title":"Suspects charged with killing Kansas women belonged to anti-government \u2018God's Misfit's' group, affidavit says","author":"Greg Norman","published_date":"2024-04-16 14:41:19","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/suspects-charged-killing-kansas-women-belonged-anti-government-gods-misfits-group-affidavit","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"The four suspects charged in the killings of two missing Kansas women belonged to an anti-government group called the \"God's Misfits,\" investigators say.","summary":"The four suspects charged with killing Veronica Butler and Jilian Kelley after they vanished in Oklahoma in late March belonged to an anti-government group called the \"God's Misfits,\" an affidavit alleges, as more details are emerging surrounding the two women's deaths.\nAn Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation special agent, citing a 16-year-old witness, wrote in court documents that the group, which had a \"religious affiliation,\" held regular weekly meetings at the home of two of the suspects, Cole and Cora Twombly.\nOSBI public information manager Hunter McKee declined to comment further about the group Tuesday when asked by Fox News Digital. FBI Oklahoma City also did not immediately respond to an inquiry on the matter.\nButler, 27, and Kelley, 39, were last seen on March 30 heading to pick up children before their car was found abandoned near the Oklahoma-Kansas border, with \"foul play\" suspected, police previously said.\nThe affidavit released this week following the arrests of the Twombleys, Tad Cullum and Tifany Adams \u2013 who are each facing two counts of first-degree murder, among other charges \u2013 said \"Butler was in a problematic custody battle with Tifany Adams for the custody of Butler's two children,\" who were fathered by Adams' son.\n\"An examination of the vehicle and area surrounding the vehicle found evidence of a severe injury,\" it added. \"Blood was found on the roadway and edge of the roadway. Butler's glasses were also found in the roadway south of the vehicle, near a broken hammer. A pistol magazine was found inside Kelley's purse at the scene, but no pistol was found.\"\nThe document said the custody battle involving Butler began in February 2019 \"with many hearings and court appearances\" and in the weeks leading up to her death, \"motions were filed requesting extended visitation for Butler.\" Kelley, the wife of a church pastor, was contacted by Butler to supervise the March 30 visitation, it said.\nButler's attorney then told investigators that she was likely to be granted unsupervised visitation with her children at an upcoming hearing this Wednesday.\nBut instead of picking up the children that Saturday at an intersection in Texas County, Oklahoma, Butler and Kelley vanished.\nThe affidavit said the grandmother of the children's father reported that he said in February she \"didn't have to worry about the custody battle much longer because Adams had it under control, that Adams knew the path the judge walked to work, and \u2018we will take out Veronica at drop off.'\" The father, investigators say, was at a rehab facility in Oklahoma City at the time of Butler and Kelley's disappearance.\nThe affidavit also says Adams purchased five stun guns and three burner phones that allegedly were used in the plot to kill the women.\nAn interview with the 16-year-old daughter of the Twombleys, identified as CW, revealed that on March 30, Cora told her she and Cole \"blocked the road to stop Butler and Kelley and divert them\" to where Adams and Cullum were.\n\"CW asked about Kelley and why she had to die and was told by Cora that she wasn't innocent either, as she had supported Butler. CW asked Cora if their bodies were put in a well, and Cora replied, \u2018something like that,\" the affidavit said.\nTwo of the burner phones were eventually found at a pasture Cullum rented for cattle grazing, about 8.5 miles away from where the abandoned vehicle was found, according to investigators. There, a \"hole had been dug and filled back in and then covered with hay,\" they said.\nThe OSBI says two bodies that were recently found in rural Texas County were pending investigation by a medical examiner.

Times, voter focus groups in Arizona did not have favorable views of Vice President Harris, even among Democratic voters.","summary":"Multiple voter focus groups in Arizona have weighed in on Vice President Harris ahead of the November election, and their responses reinforced the notion that she's an unpopular candidate, according to a report in The Los Angeles Times.\nDays after Harris spoke in Arizona on April 12, the political group \"Republican Voters Against Trump\" invited the outlet to view videos of interviews with three different voter focus groups: one of former Trump 2016 voters who voted for Biden in 2020, one of Black voters who are disappointed with Biden, and another of \"California Democrats.\"\nThe Times reported the crossover voters' views, stating, \"Their assessments were brutal. If she is helping Biden, you don't see it. She rubs me the wrong way. She was picked because she is a demographic. The big things she had, she failed.\"\nGunner Ramer, the political director of Republican Voters Against Trump, summed up the views to the Times, saying, \"Swing voters don't like her.\"\nThe other two groups, while less antagonistic towards Harris, were not complimentary of her. \"In a focus group of Black voters who were disappointed with Biden, none raised their hand in support of Harris, with one participant calling her \u2018the bad news bear,'\" the report noted.\nIt added, \"A focus group of California Democrats, while they liked Harris, had to be prompted to discuss her and said she needed more influence and exposure.\"\nThese views of Harris are not surprising considering she is even less popular than even President Biden and former President Trump, two historically unpopular presidents.\nUSA Today and Suffolk University polling from last month recorded that around 52% of registered voters disapprove of her performance as vice president. Additionally, only 36% of those surveyed say she is handling the job well, with 10% undecided.\nSuffolk University Political Research Center Director David Paleologos claimed in USA Today's report that Harris' unpopularity will be a big talking point during this election.\n\"Usually, it's a secondary and muted discussion about vice presidents. This time, it's going to be almost a parallel and loud discussion in comparison,\" he said.\nThe L.A. Times described how \"Harris has heard the criticism since she entered the White House\" and \"stepped up her appearances with core Democratic groups\" in response.\nThis campaign cycle, the vice president has leaned into championing abortion rights. Late last year, she kicked off her Fight for Our Reproductive Freedoms Tour, touring the nation to galvanize Biden voters over the issue of reproductive freedom.\nThe L.A. Times noted that Harris' allies \"believe her role as the administration's leading voice on abortion rights will boost her and the Democratic ticket on an issue that helped carry the party to unexpected success in the 2022 midterm elections.\"\nHowever, the outlet noted that even though she spoke out in Tucson earlier this month in response to the state Supreme Court upholding an 1864 abortion ban, focus group voters didn't notice.\n\"Several voters said in interviews in Phoenix on Monday that they were not aware Harris was in their state just a few days ago, underscoring the challenge of getting attention as a vice president in an era of information overload.\"\nDuring one of the focus group interviews, Black Democratic voter Tracey Sayles said, \"If she is coming for us, she doesn't show it.\"\nOther voters ripped Harris as well. Retired military member Jeff Garland, who voted Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020, declared, \"But from what I have seen of her, she doesn't look like someone I want running my country.\"\nThe Biden/Harris campaign views it differently. Campaign communications director Brian Fallon told the outlet that the vice president \"has proven to be a highly effective messenger on issues from reproductive freedom to gun violence prevention,\" and that she is \"uniquely positioned to mobilize critical groups across the Biden-Harris coalition, including both progressives and independents.\"\nThe Biden campaign did not immediately reply to Fox News Digital's request for comment.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Gabriel Hays","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1765580230.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.7088294,"_id":"443baf82a59de6decf7bd1de9129065e"},{"title":"Millions of dollars pour into crucial Senate race as Dems try to derail GOP campaign: 'Relentless assault'","author":"Aubrie Spady","published_date":"2024-04-15 20:04:56","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/millions-dollars-pour-into-crucial-senate-race-dems-derail-gop-campaign","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Sen.

Jon Tester, D-Mont., in November, touted his campaign's \"incredible momentum\" after bringing in over $3 million for his Senate campaign in the first fundraising quarter of 2024.\nThe funds, shared first with Fox News Digital, include $2.6 million that came from fundraising, with an additional $500k loaned to the campaign from Sheehy himself.\n\"We are humbled by the incredible momentum and support we're seeing across the state. We have been under a relentless assault with millions being spent on attack ads against us. Chuck Schumer, Jon Tester, and their liberal allies are now smearing a combat veteran because they know the hard truth: They are losing this race,\" Sheehy told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\"Montanans are rallying around a political outsider who will deliver common sense solutions like rebuilding a strong economy with low-inflation, creating more high-paying jobs, securing our border and ending reckless spending,\" the former Navy SEAL said. \"Come November, with the help of my fellow Montanans, we will finally retire Jon Tester and Joe Biden.\"\nTester reported raising $8 million in the first quarter of 2024, setting a new record for first quarter fundraising in a Montana Senate race. The Senator, who is seeking a third term, received donations from individuals in all 56 counties in Montana.\n\"This record-breaking grassroots support shows that Montanans are fired up to send the seven-fingered dirt farmer back to the U.S. Senate,\" Shelbi Dantic, Montanans for Tester campaign manager, said in a press release shared with Fox News Digital. \"Every day, Montanans learn more about Tim Sheehy: that he's a multimillionaire transplant from out-of-state, that he wants to transfer our public lands and shutter our rural hospitals, and that he has repeatedly lied to them about his story and who he is. Montanans know they can't trust Sheehy, and we're so grateful for the enormous enthusiasm we're seeing from our neighbors who are excited to vote for Jon Tester in November.\"\nDemocrats have put an emphasis on the Montana Senate race as they attempt to hold onto their Senate majority in 2024, with a group launched by Sen. Chuck Schumer's Senate Majority PAC recently spending millions in ads across the Big Sky State targeting Sheehy.\nAdditionally, an article was recently published by the Washington Post that heavily quoted Democrat-tied experts and casted doubt on whether the Navy SEAL actually received a bullet wound in Afghanistan.\nSheehy recently revealed that a bullet in his arm, which in 2015 he said was a result of an accidental self-inflicted gun shot, was actually received while serving in Afghanistan in 2012. The Senate candidate told the Washington Post that he never reported it to his superiors due to fear of an investigation, prompting the outlet to interview several individuals and question the validity of his story.\nThe Washington Post used Air Force attorney Rachel VanLandingham, who called Sheehy a \"deeply flawed hero whose fitness for office is highly questionable\" in an April 6 post on X, as a reference to question the Republican candidate's story.\nThe outlet also reported that trauma surgeon Joseph V. Sakran, a vocal anti-Trump activist and former Democrat staffer who donated over $21,000 to Democrats, said \"it is not possible to tell what type of weapon it came from nor the age of the wound.\"\nSheehy described the report as a \"smear piece,\" but his team said they \"aren't shocked\" as he ramps up his Senate campaign.\n\"We aren't shocked the Washington Post chose to cite known Democrats for their smear piece against decorated combat veteran Tim Sheehy,\" a Sheehy for Montana spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Andrew Murray,Aubrie Spady Andrew Murray,Aubrie Spady","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/08/Sheehy-Tester.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.6772814,"_id":"4d66d58186e3a5736769f75228e8a4aa"},{"title":"GOP AGs put a major US bank on notice for alleged 'de-banking' of conservatives","author":"Brianna Herlihy","published_date":"2024-04-15 23:55:15","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-ags-put-major-u-s-bank-noticed-alleged-de-banking-conservatives","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Over a dozen Republican attorneys general are warning a major U.S. bank against alleged practices of 'de-banking\" certain customers because of their religious or political views.","summary":"Over a dozen Republican attorneys general are warning a major U.S. bank against alleged practices of \"de-banking\" certain customers because of their religious or political views.\nIn a letter obtained exclusively by Fox News Digital, Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, along with 14 of his Republican colleagues told Bank of America CEO Brian T. Moynihan that the company \"appears to be conditioning access to its services on customers having the bank's preferred religious or political views.\"\n\"Your discriminatory behavior is a serious threat to free speech and religious freedom, is potentially illegal, and is causing political and regulatory backlash,\" the letter sent Monday states. \"Your bank needs to be transparent with and assure us, its shareholders, and others that it will not continue to de-bank customers for their speech or religious exercise,\" the AGs wrote.\nMedia relations representative, Bill Halldin, denied the claims in a statement saying, \"Religious beliefs are not a factor in any account-closing decision.\"\n\"We are proud to provide banking services to non-profit organizations affiliated with diverse faith communities throughout the United States,\" he said.\nThe AGs claim that Bank of America has previously denied services to gun manufacturers, distributors, and sellers, fossil-fuel producers, contractors for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and private prisons and related services.\nThe letter cites recent news reports that the bank cooperated with the FBI and U.S. Treasury to profile conservative and religious Americans as potential domestic terrorists.\n\"Bank of America's practice of canceling the bank accounts of conservatives and even turning over information about customer's purchases to federal law enforcement undermines free speech, religious freedom, and the right to privacy,\" Kobach told Fox News Digital.\n\"It's discriminatory and likely illegal. As state attorneys general, we will vigorously defend the constitutional rights of all Americans when they are threatened by big business.\"\n\"Those agencies outrageously used innocuous information\u2014such as whether someone shopped at outdoor stores, supported Trump, purchased religious texts, had conservative views on COVID-19 or immigration, or associated with groups like Alliance Defending Freedom, Family Research Council, and the Ruth Institute, which champion mainstream views on free speech, religious freedom, and life\u2014to tar ordinary Americans as potential domestic terrorists,\" the letter states.\nThe letter also cites a report from the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Weaponization of the Federal Government which found that Bank of America \"willingly participated in financial surveillance\" and voluntarily shared confidential customer information without a warrant and without notifying its customers.\n\"We are deeply concerned that Bank of America is willing to cooperate in the infringement of its customers' constitutional and privacy rights to help federal law enforcement surveil and target millions of conservative Americans, many of whom live in our states,\" the letter states.\nBut Bank of America said that it \"followed all applicable laws in our interactions with the Trump Administration's Treasury Department and law enforcement. \"\n\"These interactions began when the Trump Administration's Treasury Department urgently gathered major banks and law enforcement on Jan. 15, 2021 and shared information regarding potential criminal activity that could disrupt the upcoming inauguration. We have cooperated with the committee as they evaluate whether the laws we complied with should be changed,\" the company said.\nThe AGs wrote that \"as attorneys general of our respective states, we take great interest in protecting a culture of free speech within our borders,\" noting that Bank of America is the second-largest bank in the country and have nearly 15% of all domestic deposits.\n\"You appear to be using this power to punish conservative and religious customers by handing their data over to federal law enforcement and even canceling their accounts. This not only undermines free speech and religious freedom, but also is potentially illegal and could lead to investigations, litigation, regulation, and political backlash,\" they wrote.\nThe group of AGs, which include Mississippi, Idaho, Iowa, Alabama, Utah, Texas, Montana, Virginia, Arkansas, South Carolina, South Dakota, Indiana, Missouri and Nebraska, asked that within 30 days of receipt, the bank provides them with a written report about their account-cancellation policies and practices, particularly regarding \"risk tolerance,\" \"reputational risk,\" \"hate,\" \"intolerance,\" and similar terms, and whether Bank of America considers a customer's speech or religious exercise \u2014 or public perception or other groups' perception of them \u2014 as a component of those policies.\nThey also asked that the bank update its terms of service to state that it does not discriminate against customers for their religious or political views or speech, and support shareholder proposals protecting religious and political diversity.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Brianna Herlihy","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/Bank-of-America-Mortgage.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.47085,"_id":"34805aca02ec0763fdb36b80c9c35fe6"},{"title":"World donors pledge $2.1 billion in aid for war-stricken Sudan to ward off famine","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-15 18:49:33","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/world-donors-pledge-2-1-billion-aid-war-stricken-sudan-ward-famine","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"French President Emmanuel Macron announced Monday that world donors have pledged more than $2.1 billion in humanitarian aid for Sudan's 51 million people as its population is on the brink of famine.","summary":"PARIS (AP) \u2014 World donors pledged more than $2.1 billion in humanitarian aid for Sudan after a yearlong war that has pushed its population to the brink of famine, French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday.\nMacron spoke at the end of an international conference in Paris aimed at drumming up support for Sudan's 51 million people. The aid will go to food, water, medicines and other urgent needs, he said, without providing a specific timeline.\nTop diplomatic envoys, U.N. officials and aid agencies urged Sudan's warring parties to stop attacks on civilians and allow access for humanitarian aid, and called for immediate international mediation efforts toward peace. Members of Sudan's civil society took part in the Paris meeting, but neither the Sudanese army nor its rival paramilitary were represented.\nSudan descended into conflict in April last year when simmering tensions between the military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and elsewhere across the country.\n\"Much of the world has been focused on the crisis that was generated in the Middle East. As concerning as those developments are, other dramatic life-and-death emergencies are being pushed into the shadows,\" United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres told reporters after the Security Council met on Sudan on Monday.\n\"The world is forgetting about the people of Sudan,\" he said.\nThe United Nations' humanitarian campaign needs some $2.7 billion this year to get food, health care and other supplies to 24 million people in Sudan \u2014 nearly half its population. So far, funders have given only $145 million, about 5%, according to the U.N's humanitarian office, known as OCHA.\nAfter Monday's conference, Macron said, \u2018'We are today at 2 billion euros ($2.1 billion) for Sudan.'' Of that, some 900 million euros comes from EU countries, he said.\nMonday's conference among 58 countries also called on regional powers to stop funding Sudan's war. Without naming them, Macron said, ''The amount we raised today remains probably less than all the money raised by several powers'' to wage a proxy conflict in Sudan.\nMore than 14,000 people have been killed and at least 33,000 have been wounded in the yearlong war. Nearly 9 million people have been forced to flee their homes either to safer areas inside Sudan or to neighboring countries, according to the U.N. Hunger, sexual violence against women and girls and continued displacement are rampant and much of the country's infrastructure \u2014 homes, hospitals and schools \u2014 has been reduced to rubble.\n\"We cannot let this nightmare slide from view,\" Guterres said in a video message to the Paris conference.\n\"It's time to support the Sudanese people. It's time to silence the guns,\" he added.\nFrench Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne said the aim of the conference was to mobilize humanitarian funding to help Sudanese people, who have been victims of both a \"terrible war\" and \"international indifference.\"\nThe European Union's crisis management commissioner, Janez Lenarcic, said the 27-member bloc wants to ensure that Sudan is not forgotten as wars in Gaza and Ukraine dominate the international news.\n\"People of Sudan, caught up in this emergency, are almost completely invisible,\" Lenarcic said. Sudan has turned into one of the worst humanitarian disasters ever on the African continent, he said, and added: \"It is our duty not to look away.\"\nPresident of the International Committee of the Red Cross Mirjana Spoljaric warned that humanitarian action is increasingly politicized in Sudan and humanitarian workers are risking their lives to get vital aid to people.\n\"Securing a military advantage cannot be pursued regardless of the human cost,\" Spoljaric said.\nThe United States and Saudi Arabia initially led efforts to find a negotiated way out of the conflict. But since October the fighting has been overshadowed by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, which is threatening to expand into a broader regional conflict.\nRelief workers, meanwhile, warn that Sudan is hurtling towards potential mass death in the coming months. Food production and distribution networks have broken down and aid agencies are unable to reach the worst-stricken regions.\nThe conflict has also been marked by widespread reports of atrocities including killings, displacement and rape, particularly in the area of the capital and the western region of Darfur.\nAt least 37% of the population at crisis level or above suffer from hunger, according to OCHA. Save the Children warned that about 230,000 children, pregnant women and newborn mothers could die of malnutrition in the coming months.\n\"Famine is a reality in Sudan,\" said Abdallah al-Dardari, a regional director of the U.N. Development Program.\nThe military, headed by Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, and the RSF, commanded by Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, have carved up Khartoum and trade indiscriminate fire at each other. In 2021, Burhan and Dagalo were uneasy allies who led a military coup.

Lower. But so has President Biden, who wants to wallop Americans with a $5 trillion tax increase.","summary":"Donald Trump has outlined his plans for federal taxation should he be elected.\n\"I will make the Trump tax cuts permanent. You know they expire in a year. And we will cut your taxes even more than that,\" he said in a speech in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Feb. 14, 2024.\nTrump made the direction clear. Lower.\nBut President Biden has also made his plan clear: He wants to wallop Americans with a $5 trillion tax increase.\nBiden's written plan calls for a small business tax hike, a corporate tax hike, a capital gains and dividends tax hike, income tax hikes, energy tax hikes and even a second Death Tax on top of the first one.\nBiden would increase the corporate income tax from today's 21% to 28%. That's a higher tax rate than communist China and France and the U.K., each at 25%.\nNow add the average state corporate income tax at 4% and the average combined Biden rate would be 32%. That would be the second-highest corporate income tax in the developed world. Just below Colombia.\nHouseholds bear the burden of the corporate income tax in the form of higher prices and slower wage growth. Companies do not simply absorb the tax, it is passed on to all of us.\nBiden also promises to increase the tax on Subchapter S corporations, partnerships and all \"pass through\" businesses, most of them small businesses, to 39.6%. These employers pay their taxes through the personal income tax rate, not the corporate rate.\nBiden's budget promises to increase the federal capital gains tax to 44.6%, the highest rate in 100 years.\nCalifornia businesses would pay the 44.6% federal capital gains tax plus a 14.4% state capital gains tax for a combined rate of 59%. New York state businesses would pay a combined 53.4% on capital gains.\nMeanwhile, the developed world average is 18.78%. China's is 20%.\nUnder Biden you could work for 40 years, sell your business and the government could take half or more.\nBiden vows to add a second death tax by eliminating stepped-up basis when parents die and pass on homes, land and stock to children.\nBiden promises to impose a tax on \"unrealized gains.\" If your land or stock account has increased in value in the last year you would pay taxes on the unrealized gain. You have not sold the property; you do not have the income. It isn't \"real.\" Yet you will be taxed as if you had made the sale and received the income.\nBig government politicians have a habit of imposing \"trickle down taxation,\" where a tax is advertised as only hitting \"the rich.\" They lie in order to get the tax into law. Once in place, the tax gradually expands to hit the middle class.\nTake the federal income tax. When it began in 1913, the top rate was 7%, and it only hit households making more than $15.8 million in today's dollars. Now the income tax hits nearly half the country and the bottom rate is 10%.\nAnother example is the \"Alternative Minimum Tax\" imposed in 1969. It was only supposed to hit 155 high-income households nationwide. But that's not what happened. The tax gradually expanded to threaten 30 million households by the early 2000s.\nBiden is already using \"trickle down taxation\" to hit more and more Americans with his stock tax. Biden signed into law a 1% tax on companies that buy their own stock. This tax burden hits all Americans with a 401(k), IRA or union pension. Not even China has such a tax.\nBut now Biden wants to increase it to 4%: a 400% tax hike in three years. How long until it rises to 5% or 7% or 10%?\nBiden is also giving away America's tax sovereignty. He has accepted the demand of our European competitors that we set a floor under our corporate income tax rate. Europe knows that Trump has long pushed for a 15% corporate income tax.\nBut Trump has made it clear he wants to compete with other nations by offering lower taxes on American workers, not by paying American workers lower wages. Biden has endorsed the idea of a government tax cartel, an OPEC for tax rates no lower than 15% and Biden now demands we move that minimum tax to 21%.\nBiden's budget calls for a tax on energy used for things Biden does not like. Starting with bitcoin mining. Once in place, the list of future targets writes itself: gun manufacturing, gas stove manufacturing, and more.\nSpeaking of energy taxes, beware a carbon tax in a second Biden term.\nBiden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have all endorsed an energy tax/carbon tax. All but 10 Democrats in the House voted against a resolution opposing a carbon tax this spring.\nAnd all these new Biden taxes will be collected by a supersized and unreformed IRS.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Grover Norquist","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/05/Biden-Tax-Hikes-3.jpg","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.2921767,"_id":"91c7bde59a44c872f0a7926c55b59523"},{"title":"Vulnerable Dems signed pledge from Gen Z group that pushes no-cash bail, decriminalizing prostitution","author":"Emma Colton","published_date":"2024-04-20 08:00:39","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vulnerable-dems-signed-pledge-gen-z-group-pushes-no-cash-bail-decriminalizing-prostitution","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"A handful of vulnerable House Democrats are under fire after their ties to a left-wing Gen Z advocacy group advocating things like abolishing cash bail came to light.","summary":"A handful of vulnerable House Democrats, including those in pivotal battleground states, celebrated partnering with a left-wing Gen Z advocacy group ahead of 2024 that supports policies such as decriminalizing prostitution and abolishing cash bail.\n\"I am thrilled to be a Voters of Tomorrow Youth Vote Champion.

Susan Wild of Pennsylvania.\nThe four members of Congress were identified last year by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as vulnerable in the 2024 elections, assigning them as members of the Frontline Program for vulnerable incumbents. Each member celebrated joining forces with the Voters of Tomorrow in comments shared by the advocacy group on social media.\n\"I wholeheartedly agree with Voters of Tomorrow's view that empowering Gen Z in our political process is a requirement for building a better future,\" Landsman said in a message of his support of Voters of Tomorrow.\n\"I ran for Congress to be an advocate for all Alaskans \u2014 from every region, background, and generation. Encouraging young people to get involved in our political process benefits everyone \u2014 and is a responsibility I take very seriously,\" Peltola said in another message posted by Voters of Tomorrow last year.\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) told Fox News Digital that the four Democrats aligning with Voters of Tomorrow ahead of 2024 shows they are not \"moderate\" Democrats, but instead \"complete frauds that should never be re-elected.\"\n\"Self-proclaimed moderate House Democrats are once again showing the American people where their true priorities lie: abolishing cash bail, defunding the police, ending ICE & CBP, and decriminalizing sex work and drugs. It's dangerous, and exposes how Cartwright, Landsman, Peltola, or Wild are complete frauds that should never be reelected,\" the NRCC's rapid response director Macy Gardner told Fox News Digital.\nFox News Digital reached out to the campaigns for comment, but did not receive replies.\nImmigration and the economy are two of the biggest issues weighing on voters this election cycle, while crime still ranks high for voters following 2020's historically bloody year, which was followed by other ongoing crime trends, such smash-and-grab robberies and carjackings.\nProstitution has spiraled in certain areas of the country in recent months, which has been compounded by the immigration crisis and local state laws. Residents in California have particularly voiced their outrage over rampant and brazen prostitution on city streets, which many pin blame on a law that repealed a previous law that banned loitering with the intent of engaging in prostitution. New York City has also seen \"third world\" conditions, including prostitutes and pimps walking the streets of Queens in broad daylight.\nVoters of Tomorrow argues prostitution should be decriminalized, saying that \"Sex work is work.\"\n\"Criminalizing consensual sex, including the exchange of these services, is taking away from the human right to autonomy and privacy. The government should not be telling consenting adults who they can have sexual relationships with and on what terms,\" the group says on its website.\nThe group also advocates for the end of cash bail, which would abolish the requirement that suspects charged with crimes post bail in order to leave jail while they await court proceedings.\n\"If the \u2018justice' system has policies or laws in place that have a monetary value tied to them, then those policies only apply to low-income people. No one should have to remain in prison for the duration of their case just because they do not have the financial means to pay their bail. Cash bail only applies to low-income people and we need equal justice,\" the group states.\nVoters of Tomorrow was founded in 2019 by a \u200b\u200b17-year-old immigrant from Mexico, Santiago Mayer, after he \"noticed a lack of political engagement at his high school,\" according to the group's website. The group has since gone on to advocate that Gen Z vote, including in both the 2020 election and the 2022 midterms.\nThe Republican Party had a lackluster 2022 in the midterms, which some have attributed to lack of outreach to America's youngest voting generation.\n\"Another reason that the polling was so inaccurate and that so many critical races swung to Democrats is the growing importance of Gen Z voters, which appears to have been completely ignored by the GOP,\" Fox News contributor Liz Peek wrote in an op-ed in 2022, arguing Gen Z \"stopped the Republicans' expected red wave.\"\n\"Not only did Gen Z show up in force, they overwhelmingly picked Democrats, by a 28-point margin. That preference was close to their vote in 2020, which went 62% Democrat and only 32% GOP.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Emma Colton","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/votersoftomorrow.png","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.1260552,"_id":"1d4683ff32c71e04a9480972cca34d61"},{"title":"I thought our marriage was great except for one intimate thing.

And we had never talked about one crucial thing. Yet, we both thought our marriage was finally solid.","summary":"For 31 years of being married, my wife and I never talked about sex.\nFor the first time, we both thought our marriage was finally solid. After years of secrets and affairs and bringing our own traumas into our marriage, we went to a marriage conference, for once, not because our relationship was barely hanging on by a thread, but to get encouraging information that we could share with other couples as we started our own marriage ministry.\nThen there was Saturday night.\nThe homework for that night concerned sex.\nNot necessarily doing it.\nTalking about it. To each other.\nI remember going to the room feeling good because I didn't think we had much to talk about in this area, and it would be a breeze. We'd go to a nice dinner and do the project quickly.\nKathy was very quiet, like \"you could cut the air\" silent, until we got to the room. Her plan was to skip going to dinner, to order room service, and to give the project our all:\n\"For me, Kathy, I remember thinking that there were some things I wanted to talk about regarding sex, like how there were some things I didn't like about what Tim was doing and how I felt that he was doing more what he wanted, when he had never really asked me what I wanted. We both got defensive. We were both filled with pride, but as we broke down those walls of pride, we were better able to talk and to understand what each other was saying. It was a good start.\"\nToday, I am really glad Kathy stuck to her guns and didn't settle for brushing over the topic of sex that night. It really was a good start, but that's what it was\u2026a start. We had a lot of work to do, and we sure didn't always do it right.\nFor Kathy, after marriage, sex was an afterthought; for me, sex was the thought.\nPrior to our 1982 wedding, my sexual expectations were very clear, at least to me. One of my biggest regrets is that I didn't take pre-marital counseling seriously, and I don't remember sex even being a topic. I just figured that marriage to Kathy would give me the right to have sex with her whenever I wanted, which looked like nine times a week.\nNobody told me differently, and I assumed she knew. It never occurred to me to talk to her about it. After all, we had lots of sex prior to marriage, so why would I think it would change? I had grown up promiscuous, but, as a husband, I didn't want to be, and I had high hopes that since Kathy would take care of all my sexual needs, I would change.\nThere was one huge problem. She didn't get the memo.\nGoing into our marriage, Kathy had entirely different thoughts. She would have our baby and take care of our house. I would help with the little one, and we would just fit sex in where we could. Unfortunately, that's the memo I missed.\nFor Kathy, after marriage, sex was an afterthought; for me, sex was the thought.\nNeither one of us bothered to tell the other. We went on this way for many years, which left Kathy feeling isolated, unheard, and sadly, not loved:\n\"For me, Kathy, sex felt like an obligation. I really didn't even have the desire after we got married. So many things were wrong with the marriage, and emotionally sex wasn't enjoyable because of that.\"\nThe pain she felt still breaks my heart today. Our opposing sexual expectations led both of us on a search for feeling loved and for that romantic feeling of love...and away from each other.\nIt took almost three decades for me to realize the sex was not about me, that it involved love, and, most importantly, that God created it for marriage.\nWe didn't talk to each other about sex.\nWe did not find out what each other likes and doesn't like.\nWe didn't know that we really should enjoy each other before, during, and after sex.\nBut we knew we needed to do something. Our sex life just wasn't \"all that.\"\nSex to the Fullest\nSince serving in marriage ministry together, we have found that it is very common for husbands and wives not to talk about sex. We are now happily unified in this area and enjoy each other selflessly in ways that we didn't expect. In fact, on most days\u2026\nWe talk about sex.\nWe pray about sex.\nWe thank God for the gift of sex.\nWe always ask Him to increase our desire for each other.\nWe are thankful that God created sex to celebrate marriage and that He has made it so easy for us to talk about it and to enjoy it as a gift from Him. Because He created sex for our marriages, it should not be anything other than a blessing to them.\nAs you may already know, our marriage started with sex on the first date, and we know that's not what God wanted. In fact, we even named our book, \"Sex on the First Date: A Story of a Broken Beginning to a Radically Transformed Marriage.\" Now, after over four decades of marriage, we are enjoying sex to the fullest, just as He designed.","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Tim Bush","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/couple-hugging-istock.jpg","is_opinion":true,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":4.116154,"_id":"cb2c659110b6988b699ede2a1b636023"},{"title":"Alec Baldwin's 'Rust' armorer's plea for no jail time is 'too little, too late': expert","author":"Lauryn Overhultz","published_date":"2024-04-15 08:30:46","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/alec-baldwins-rust-armorers-plea-no-jail-time-too-little-too-late-expert","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Hannah Gutierrez Reed's bid for no prison time following her involuntary manslaughter conviction is not likely to be granted, a legal expert told Fox News Digital.","summary":"The \"Rust\" armorer's plea for no jail time is \"too little, too late,\" as Hannah Gutierrez Reed's legal team argued for a conditional discharge ahead of her April 15 sentencing hearing.\nLawyers for Gutierrez Reed argued she qualifies for no jail time due to her \"lack of a criminal history,\" \"personal character traits\" and the armorer's young age. The conviction of involuntary manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 18 months.\nA jury found Gutierrez Reed guilty of involuntary manslaughter in connection to the death of Halyna Hutchins. The cinematographer died on the set of \"Rust\" on October 21, 2021 when a gun actor Alec Baldwin was holding discharged.\n\"It's possible the judge grants [Gutierrez Reed] a conditional discharge, but I don't think it's likely,\" former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Fox News Digital. \"Gutierrez Reed still hasn't accepted any responsibility for her actions which caused someone's death. She pushed her case to trial, and her lawyers have said they're going to appeal because of the jury instructions.\"\n\"At the time of the shooting, Gutierrez Reed was more concerned with her career being over than Hutchins' death,\" he continued. \"Add the drug use and obstruction of justice \u2013 I don't think she's a very sympathetic defendant. These letters are probably too little, too late to sway the judge.\"\nThe felony that Gutierrez Reed was convicted of is the lowest type of felony offense, but \"it will be difficult for the court to ignore that the crime led to a loss of life,\" Oleg Nekritin, a defense attorney at the Law Offices of Robert J. DeGroot, told Fox News Digital.\n\"As part of its sentence, the court must consider Ms. Guiterrez Reed's good character and her caretaking functions for her sick father,\" he further explained. \"However, the court will most likely be swayed by the position of the victim's family and the State. If the victim's family and the State request that Ms. Guiterrez Reed be sentenced to a term of incarceration, it will be likely that the court will follow suit.\"\n\"If the victim's family asks for leniency, that may give the court cover and reason to be lenient and justify a lower sentence. Ms. Guitterez-Reed's future may depend on the grace of the victim's family.\"\nGutierrez Reed's sentencing memorandum, filed April 10, listed all the reasons that she shouldn't spend time in jail \u2013 including her father's cancer diagnosis. Up until her incarceration, Gutierrez Reed had been caring for Thell Reed, according to her legal team.\nThe armorer's father had also set up a GoFundMe, with a fundraising goal of $100,000, to help cover Gutierrez Reed's legal costs. However, the fundraiser was shut down because it violated the platform's rule against raising money for \"the legal defense of alleged financial and violent crimes,\" according to The Hollywood Reporter.\nGutierrez Reed's boyfriend and childhood friend, Sean Kridelbaugh Jr., wrote a letter of support for Gutierrez Reed further confirming that the armorer was taking care of Thell.\n\"She's always helping people and going out of her way to make sure people are okay. She's a part of her community and always working and taking care of her dad,\" the letter read.\n\"She's an amazing person that the media is painting a bad picture about. To say she isn't remorseful would be an understatement,\" he continued. \"These past few years have been the hardest for her mentally with not only Ms. Hutchins death but with all the harassment and threats she gets from the case being highly public and the release of her personal information.\"\nOthers have also sent letters of support to the court, which create a \"holistic\" picture of Gutierrez Reed's character, the court filing stated.\n\"Following the jury verdict, counsel have received numerous unsolicited emails and calls from around the country and world, from people expressing their support for Ms. Gutierrrez Reed,\" Bowles wrote. \"We have been informed that people have mailed letters on their own to the Court, and we ask that the Court consider all the sentiments expressed in these letters as well in computing a reasonable sentence that balances punishment, with rehabilitation, and the need for deterrence with the notion of fairness \u2013 including that Sarah Zachry received complete immunity and David Halls received 6 months of unsupervised probation on a misdemeanor.\"\nGutierrez Reed's legal team focused on the \"facts,\" which Bowles insists back a conditional discharge.\n\"She has a complete lack of prior criminal history,\" Bowles wrote. \"It is proper to consider her employment record, record of prior good works and positive things she has done when considering this sentencing option.\"\nHe continued: \"The facts support a conditional discharge, based on her lack of a criminal history, her personal character traits as expressed in the outpouring of letters from the community, and her relative youth and the devastating effect a felony will have on her life going forward. A conditional discharge will require Ms. Gutierrez Reed to abide by all set conditions during any term of a probationary period and to undergo all counseling and rehabilitative efforts this Court requires.\"\nGutierrez Reed was convicted of involuntary manslaughter on March 6 following a two-week trial. She was also found not guilty of evidence tampering, a charge she received in 2023 after investigators accused her of passing off a bag of cocaine on the day of the fatal set shooting.\nThe jury deliberated for less than three hours at the New Mexico courthouse. After the verdict was read, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer ordered that Gutierrez Reed be taken into custody, where she has remained awaiting her sentencing.\nThe armorer faces up to 18 months in prison, in addition to a $5,000 fine.\nGutierrez Reed's trial, which began February 21, saw testimony from weapons experts, FBI and Santa Fe County authorities and crew members who witnessed the fatal shooting.\nThe prosecution largely focused on Gutierrez Reed's behavior as an armorer, claiming she didn't do her job correctly.\n\"Hannah Gutierrez knew that Baldwin was loose. She knew it,\" special prosecutor Kari Morrissey said during closing arguments. \"She didn't do anything about it, even though it was her job. It was her job. It is her job to say to an A-list actor, if in fact, that's what you want to call him, 'Hey, you can't behave that way with those firearms.' That is her job. That is what they pay her for.

Hutchins had been preparing a close-up shot when a gun Alec Baldwin was holding discharged. The 18-month sentence was the maximum time Gutierrez Reed could serve. She has currently spent about a month behind bars.\n\"For all the fanfare and pundits and fingerpointing that has been going on for over two years, we were able to seat a jury of her peers who confirmed that they could listen to the evidence received in court and determine the facts and apply the law,\" Sommer said before giving her ruling. \"They found Ms. Gutierrez guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\"\nSommer slammed Gutierrez Reed's jailhouse calls, pointing out that the armorer spoke to someone about how \"this is messing up her modeling career.\"\nA jury convicted Gutierrez Reed of involuntary manslaughter on March 6 following a nearly two-week trial. The jurors heard from weapons experts, crew members and investigators during the trial.\n\"First and foremost, my heart aches for the Hutchins family and friends and colleagues as well, and it has since the day this tragedy occurred,\" Gutierrez Reed said in her first statements made throughout the trial. \"Haylna has been and always will be an inspiration to me. I understand she was taken too soon. And I pray that you all find peace. I am beyond grateful that Joel survived that terrible day. My heart goes out to the film industry for the devastating pain that this tragedy caused and the old wounds that have been reopened.\"\nShe added: \"I am saddened by the way the media sensationalized our traumatic tragedy and portrayed me as a complete monster, which has actually been the total opposite of what's been in my heart.\"\n\"Your Honor, when I took on 'Rust', I was young, and I was naive, but I took my job as seriously as I knew how to,\" Gutierrez Reed stated. \"Despite not having proper time, resources and staffing when things got tough, I just did my best to handle it. Today, I humbly ask you to consider probation. A probation where I can continue to contribute to society through community service, and I can continue my counseling, and I welcome any classes that you may deem necessary for me to attend. I give you my word now that I would strictly follow the rules and respect the parameters of that probation. I beg you, please don't give me more time. The jury has found me in part at fault for this God awful tragedy, but that doesn't make me a monster, that makes me human.\"\nAttorney Gloria Allred appeared on behalf of Hutchins' family during the sentencing hearing and shared statements from the cinematographer's mother, father and sister.\n\"My life has been split into two before and after,\" Allred read on behalf of Hutchins' mother. \"Time does not heal. It simply prolongs my pain and suffering. I have hope that the guilty, those that are responsible for the death of my daughter, will be punished fairly and sentenced justly. Justice must prevail.\"\n\"It's extremely, extremely difficult without her. I cannot. She graduated university and then she gave birth to a wonderful boy, my grandson,\" Hutchins' mother said in a video translated from Ukranian into English. \"Unfortunately, I have no ability to see him now. She was an amazing mom. She really loved her work. The day of her death ruined my entire life. It's heart-wrenching to see her child grow without his mother.\"\nHutchins' father's statement read: \"The demise of my daughter Halyna on the 21st of October 2021 became the tragedy and biggest bitter loss of my life as well as the lives of my close loved ones. There is no way I can put into words to express the soul-crushing pain and suffering that I lived through every day.

Ted Cruz, who has represented the Lone Star State in the upper chamber since 2013.\nWhile it is unclear whether the views of campaign staff could endanger what The Austin Chronicle described as Allred's \"moderate-Dem case\" against Cruz, the Texas congressman has made clear his support for \"stand[ing] with our ally Israel.\"\nMichelle Cede\u00f1o, the digital mobilization manager for the Texas Democrat's campaign, has shown her support for Palestine and disdain for Israel in social media comments.\nShe shared another X user's post on October 11, less than a week after Hamas carried out its assault on Israel, that stated, \"You can't celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day and say Palestinians don't have a right to their homeland.\" She also retweeted a post that urged individuals not to \"talk to cops\" and a post from Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., that claimed Israel was led by \"apartheid-in-chief [Benjamin] Netanyahu.\"\nIn February 2024, Cede\u00f1o amplified remarks made by one X user who accused Israel of committing \"genocide.\"\nCede\u00f1o, who has been tasked with reaching millions of Texas voters and has sent multiple emails to the Allred campaign's email list, shared numerous posts on social media in recent years that are seemingly anti-police and anti-ICE. Additionally, Cede\u00f1o previously made disparaging remarks about President Biden and an individual who now serves in his cabinet.\nIn a January 2021 post to her Facebook page, Cede\u00f1o celebrated a news report that stated members of the Austin City Council could use some funds diverted from its police budget to purchase two hotels to use as \"permanent supportive housing for people experiencing chronic homelessness.\"\n\"YES,\" she wrote, sharing the article with her friends.\nCede\u00f1o also shared a July 2019 then-Twitter post from United We Dream Texas that claimed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents \"are cruel\" and called for the agency to be abolished. She also shared a Sept. 2020 then-Twitter post that claimed ICE was performing \"genocide\" through acts that \"inspired the Nazi regime.\"\nAside from her remarks about political issues, Cede\u00f1o has directly targeted Biden and Pete Buttigieg, who previously ran for president and now serves as the secretary of transportation, during the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries.\nIn an Oct. 2019 post, Cede\u00f1o claimed that Biden has \"abusive habits\" and an \"over-botoxed five-head.\"\nRegarding Buttigieg, Cede\u00f1o wrote, \"F--- this dude\" in a Nov. 2019 post to social media and later expressed frustration when Biden appointed him to a cabinet position.\n\"Bro can't even take control of his police department as mayor when they murder a black man now you're going to trust him with a WHOLE CABINET POSITION,\" she wrote in a Dec. 2020 post to Facebook.\nJames Burnett \u2014 another staffer who serves as the political coordinator for Allred's Senate campaign, according to his LinkedIn profile \u2014 has made questionable remarks about Trump supporters and has expressed support for an \"assault weapons ban.\"\nIn a Sept. 2019 post to then-Twitter, Burnett suggested that Trump supporters are \"Angry White People With Guns.\" In a separate post in Aug. 2020, Burnett claimed that the same Trump supporters are \"racist.\"\n\"We said they were racist, we didn't say they weren't intelligent,\" he wrote at the time.\nBurnett has also suggested the U.S. should \"abolish the Electoral College\" and took aim at officials, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, over immigration-related topics.\n\"Not gonna sugarcoat it, F--- you and your Wall,\" Burnett wrote in Oct. 2020 in response to a post from then-acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan. Last November, Burnett also accused Abbott of being a \"Human Trafficker\" due to his efforts to bus migrants to other parts of the U.S.\nBurnett also disagrees with Allred over the issue of whether Texas should be considered a \"non-voting state,\" writing in a November 2020 post to social media that Americans \"can no longer make the argument that Texas is a non-voting state anymore because Texas voted and we got our asses trounced.\"\nThat comment, however, stands in contrast to a comment made by Allred in a May 2023 post to social media claiming \"the truth is Texas is a non-voting state.\"\nHannah Fishman, who serves as the digital director for Allred's campaign, is another staffer who has shared hot takes online that are contrary to what millions of voters in Texas agree with.\nAmid the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue in Richmond, Virginia, Fishman wrote in a July 2020 post to then-Twitter that taxpayer dollars \"still fund groups like the sons/daughters of confederate veterans and fund salaries of abusive and racist police officers,\" adding that the \"fight is only beginning.\"\nAdditionally, Fishman has offered support for a group that contributed to bailing out alleged violent criminals by sharing a link to the Baltimore Action Legal Team (BALT) in a June 2020 post amid nationwide Black Lives Matter protests.

They come out here, and they want to say, \u2018I'm out here in the Wild West,' and they want to have a big tough story to tell. \u2018I'm gonna go out there, and hunt me some Mexicans,' you know? And that appeals to some people, but that's not a common thing.\"\n\"He's an extremist,\" Wilburn, who has 120,000 YouTube subscribers, chimes in from off-camera.\n\"Yeah, you would not see people like that,\" Hathaway added in the 52-minute video viewed by Fox News Digital. \"It's not like there's a bunch of groups wandering around with that attitude.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Hathaway for comment, but he did not immediately respond.\nDr. Ron Martinelli, a forensic criminologist who is working pro-bono for the Kelly defense as their lead consultant with the forensic death investigation, told Fox News Digital that \"these are completely inappropriate, prejudicial and extremely biased statements about a criminal defendant.\"\nThe consultant said the video was referencing Kelly because, although Hathaway didn't mention Kelly by name, the sheriff had been \"literally driving through Mr. Kelly's neighborhood.\"\n\"But what is Mr. Kelly's motive? So we have a rancher on a very nice ranch with an impeccable background of cooperation with law enforcement. He's never been in trouble in his life. And according to Sheriff Hathaway and the state's theory of criminality, Mr. Kelly woke up one morning and just decided he was going to kill him, a Mexican?\" Martinelli said. \"That's absurd.\"\nKelly's wife testified earlier in the trial that she saw a group of armed men dressed in camouflage and carrying packs near their residence on their 170-acre cattle ranch near Keno Springs outside Nogales, Arizona, before calling Border Patrol. Her husband went outside, and according to the defense, fired warning shots into the air.\nLaw enforcement responded, and hours passed before Kelly called for help again to report finding Gabriel Cuen-Buitimea's body on his property on Jan. 30, 2023.\nKelly was charged with first-degree premeditated murder and held on $1 million bond for weeks as the case gained national scrutiny. The highest charge was later downgraded to second-degree murder.\nLast week, Santa Cruz County Det. Mario Barba testified that he accompanied Hathaway to Mexico to interview Daniel Ramirez, the prosecution's key witness who claims to have seen first-hand when Buitimea was shot on Kelly's ranch before fleeing across the border. Weeks after the shooting, Hathaway arranged a meeting with Ramirez at a hotel in Nogales, Mexico, and though the sheriff interviewed him for about 40 minutes, he only recorded about six minutes, Barba said. The detective said Ramirez \"couldn't cross into the United States legally\" to be interviewed.\n\"You could have spoken to Mexican officials to arrange something? Correct?\" Kelly's defense attorney, Brenna Larkin, asked.\n\"Correct,\" the detective responded.\n\"And you didn't do that. Did you?\" Larkin said.\nBarba replied, \"No.\"\nTaking the stand earlier in the trial, Ramirez admitted that he previously carried drugs across the border before and had been deported several times.\nThe defense believes that the people contacted by the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office to conduct their investigation into Kelly's case are related or connected to the Sinaloa Cartel, Martinelli said.\n\"The Sinaloa Cartel and Manos Malas, an organized crime ring which is in league with Sinaloa, do not allow independent drug smugglers. So you have to be associated with the cartel,\" Martinelli said. \"When they meet with him, that was actually facilitated by another convicted, twice convicted felon \u2014 one of his last convictions that he did prison time for was bringing guns across the border.\"\n\"The false narrative is out there that Buitimea and all these so-called witnesses are people seeking the American dream. Migrants seeking the American Dream do not smuggle drugs across the border or smuggle weapons across the border. And again, that is an indication of cartel influence, cartel membership,\" the consultant said. \"That has nothing to do with the narrative that the prosecutor and the sheriff were putting out there, that Mr. Buitimea was an innocent migrant seeking the American Dream.\"\nWhile with Barba in Mexico, Hathway introduced himself as the supervising investigator in the case, Martinelli told Fox News Digital, meaning \"he is the supervising investigator in an international investigation that he initiated in a foreign country.\" The defense believes that was a violation of U.S. State Department protocols, as well as Mexican law created by Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador and the country's legislature providing guidelines for U.S. authorities while conducting criminal investigations in Mexico.\n\"There is no evidence he ever advised the Mexican government or requested permission to enter the country to conduct an international homicide investigation involving Mexican nationals. And that includes the federal police. The Mexican federal police,\" Martinelli said. \"What we want to find out today is how that meeting came about. How did they cross into Mexico? You know, did they drive there in a marked car? Were they in uniform with, you know with their, even plainclothes, with their badges and firearms? How did that take place? Because procedurally, that's a huge thing.\"\nAlso on camera in the same YouTube video, Hathaway said that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that Border Patrol can search, detain and interrogate anybody within 100 miles of the U.S. international border.\n\"And the Supreme Court had called that extended border search authority,\" Hathway said. \"To me, it's a real problem to have a policy like that within the U.S. government because this is supposed to be America. This is supposed to be a free country, right? I mean, you shouldn't have people who can pull you over for no reason like they're the Gestapo or something like that. For me, that's a problem.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPHathaway also went on to criticize the sheriffs of other neighboring counties for decrying the border crisis.\n\"He minimizes the victimization of migrants coming across the border. The rape of migrants. The murder and the robberies of migrants,\" Martinelli said. \"But at the same time, he is enjoying a financial grant from DHS to patrol the border with his deputies\u2026 He doesn't have any problem taking money from the United States government for his deputies' patrol.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"Danielle Wallace","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/AP24081790280843.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":3.7141156,"_id":"992b0a9fe412dd541c5a5f13ec2a6aeb"},{"title":"Russian deserters of Ukraine war hide abroad, but as asylum claims surge, foreign countries are suspicious","author":"","published_date":"2024-04-16 12:18:55","published_date_precision":"full","link":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/russian-deserters-ukraine-war-hide-abroad-asylum-claims-surge-foreign-countries-suspicious","clean_url":"foxnews.com","excerpt":"Russian soldiers who defected and fled Russia since the start of the war with Ukraine speak about their reasons for leaving and their struggles finding a safe place to land.","summary":"If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert \u2013 more than 500 in the first two months of this year \u2013 are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\nThe question now is, where can they go?\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny \u2013 and the others \u2013 have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\nHe is crying.\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States \u2013 obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like to serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive of a path from here to there.\nHe wakes at 10 o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\nFarhad confessed.\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book \u2013 Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" \u2014 into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\nFarhad was free.\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\"They said, \u2018You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo \u2013 what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people \u2013 never!\"\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\nHe refused to touch the pen.\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work in Astana.\n\"I am for people to not get stuck,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile.\nWhen he runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease \u2014 if only for a moment \u2014 with his place in the world.\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"","rights":"foxnews.com","rank":249,"topic":"energy","country":"US","language":"en","authors":"","media":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/Russia-Ukraine-War-Deserters.jpg","is_opinion":false,"twitter_account":"@foxnews","_score":2.78507,"_id":"65a0b0c9663d9f8dc07b314a5df4ccf9"}],"user_input":{"q":"gun","search_in":["title_summary_en"],"lang":["en"],"not_lang":null,"countries":null,"not_countries":null,"from":"2024-04-15 00:00:00","to":null,"ranked_only":"True","from_rank":null,"to_rank":null,"sort_by":"relevancy","page":1,"size":100,"sources":["foxnews.com"],"not_sources":[],"topic":null,"published_date_precision":null}}
